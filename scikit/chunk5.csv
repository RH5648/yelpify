The photo on the website shows tortilla chips, but those are a 69 cent up charge. Do you care for some sour cream sir?  69 cent up charge.  In fact, everything except the bowl, soup and spoons seemed to be a 69 cent up charge though they did toss in, on the side, a chocolate covered strawberry and a couple of crackers.  The soup was good, but it would take Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to find any chicken in my soup.",2016-05-21 11:05:26

For those of you who don't know, if you sign up on their email list, you get a certificate for $30 you can use during your birthday month.  It's a GREAT deal!

Pretty funny, but it seemed like half the people there were celebrating a birthday.

The staff is very kind here, and works very fast.  The food is delicious, and their Happy Hour goes until 7:30 PM, with great food/drink specials.  Our Chef Toshi was nice enough.  I'm sure they all have different personalities, but he did a good job.

If you haven't been here yet, sign up for the birthday coupon and come check it out.  
ENJOY!",2014-08-13 15:30:34

Last spring, I then scarfed down at Burgatory.  (""But you gotta try Winghart's!"" I was told again.)
Last month, I chomped some chow at Tessaro's. (""Hey, dumb-dumb, what about Winghart's?"")

Hmm...where should I go now to try the best burger in Pittsburgh?  Uhm... I think I've heard this place called Winghart's might be worth a shot.  And no, there are no wings!

Our group had the Shipwrecked (Brie cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, white truffle aioli), the Mattola (applewood smoked bacon and American cheese), and the Market Sq (Bacon, mushrooms, and gruyere cheese) burgers.  It was a food frenzy. There was a lot of smacking, snorting, snuffing, and slurping.  Don't judge me, unless you've had these burgers.  Or the crunchy fries.

For those that have toddlers, it's definitely not kid-friendly.  There are some high chairs, but most of the tables are bar tables and stools, that are even taller than the high chairs!  But my kid is a trooper, and she enjoyed picking the leftovers off my leg. #goodparenting
 
So...BRGR, Tessaro's, Burgatory, Winghart's... who has the best burger?  That Shipwrecked burger was just this smooth, greasy, cheesy, burger explosion in the mouth.  That's tough to beat.",2012-08-20 23:48:33

I usually go to aloha specialties in California Hotel but after trying this place it is now my spot. The Kalua pig and roast pork are my favorites it's juicy and very tasty.

I came to Arcadia Health and Wellness on a recommendation from a good friend of mine. She has been singing Dr. Dom's accolades for years, and she was confident that he could ""fix my migraine problem"".  I'll be honest, I was completely skeptical as I've had migraines for years that no other chiropractor had been able to fix.  However, because she was so emphatic about his abilities I decided that it was worth a shot and booked an appointment with him.  

Lesson learned? Never doubt my friend. :)  Since beginning care with Dr. Dom and his massage staff, I am now migraine free for 4+ months and have never felt better!  Not only have my migraines dissipated, but my posture has improved, and overall I'm feeling much more balanced and strong.  

Dr. Dom is AMAZING and I 100% recommend seeing him and his staff for your chiropractic care!!  Trust me; your body will thank you for it ;)",2014-12-02 22:59:31

I went with the veggie omelet with dry honey wheat toast and my best friend had the french toast with fresh fruit.  We absolutely loved our meals!  My omelet was a standard veggie omelet with a great mix of fresh veggies.  What really set the meal apart was the unbelievable toast and the fact that they had mini sugar free jams.  I don't usually have heart palpitations over bread but something about this wheat bread nearly brought me to my knees...

Why 4 stars?
I don't really like the idea of ordering at the counter but that's the norm here at Soma.  We sat in cozy chairs and really enjoyed our breakfast and people watching.  From what we could see everyone seemed to know each other here and it appeared that the owners/workers were all interacting with a large group of 'regulars.'  It was nice and made me want to be in the 'regular club.'

n1GUx2nBTtbDfAfXcXbNhA,15Yrx7yqhGp-uUc5ghCcUg,cs0wRfzCxLNktXnh7TLVVg,5,8,0,0,"Went halves on this service with my ex-roommate. Really didn't want to have to, but we had a couple pieces of furniture between us that would have just been so difficult to move ourselves.

By the time we factored in the cost of renting a moving truck, then the time (and aggravation) it would take to move everything ourselves, it made sense to hire a service like Skinny Wimp.

Not sure how we landed on Skinny Wimp, to be honest - I left that decision to my roommate. And I am very happy to report that I couldn't have been more pleased with her decision.

We had a small-apartment, two-hour job estimate. The minute Luis and Victor arrived, and saw what they had to deal with, they confirmed that it would take about two hours and committed to doing everything they could to keeping it within than range.

And then they went to work.

These guys were super polite and they moved really fast. It was obvious that they picked up on our desire to keep the job under two hours and THEY. HUSTLED. They were also very careful with all the furniture and super respectful in all communications.

At the end of the day, they pushed past the two hour mark by a mere 15 minutes. (The poor guys were practically RUNNING to beat the clock, too!). Rather than charging us for the full hour they bit into, we were only charged for the additional 15 minutes.

Honestly, I wouldn't hesitate to hire Skinny Wimp again. Their service was WELL worth its cost, appears to be very competitive compared to other movers in the area, and frankly, the QUALITY of service sold me many times over.

If you're ever on the hunt for a great team of movers you can trust at a fair price, remember this review: Skinny Wimp Moving Co. will not leave you wanting.

Thank you, Skinny Wimp, Luis, and Victor, for working so hard to deliver such a high level of service. And thank you, Luis and Victor, for hustling yesterday! Really meant a lot.",2015-09-27 16:11:14

No I'm not a Star Trek fan, but am a fan of grown adults dressing up, and nerding out.. lol 

We ended up going here Saturday after we ate dinner to check out all the people dressed up roaming around the hotel after the convention was closed for the night.. 
Not a lot of action, nerds must have been tired.. 

The hotel was treky looking, but looked pretty dated in the inside, went to the bath room and the tv's in the mirrors said no signal, I guess in a galaxy far far away from the strip they get no signal.... huh.. 

OK, the cool thing about the hotel was they opened their pool and outside bar to the public to hang and chill from 4pm-8pm. We didn't bring our swimsuits, but did chill on there nice big lounge chases they have.. pretty nice, they fit I'd stay 10 people.  We had walked by a few other hotels and they had exclusive policies on only hotel guest to be allowed anywhere near there pools, I'm talking security guards and all...  anyways, the Hilton  also had a guy with a guitar covering old rock artist from the 80's. We didn't stay to long but got a feeling of what a real swimming pool should be like. --- (see we stayed at the Fremont) , and I didn't even want to see what there pool looked like..

While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.

It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.

Combine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.",2012-04-04 21:44:01

I decided to try an entree salad and picked the one that was suppose to be mango glazed chicken. It soon came out and the first thing I noticed was the greens were all WILTED and dry and warm. The greens were topped with a small (maybe two oz.) plain (not mango glazed) grilled chicken breast that was sliced and very dry. The plate was garnished with two sliced grape tomatoes and two half sliced orange sliced. The dressing was suppose to be citrus vinaigrette but it was thick and might have been the mango glaze that should have been on the chicken and certainly didn't  seem like any kind of vinaigrette.

My husband had the shredded beef brisket. I tasted the brisket and it was lean for brisket but pretty much unseasoned.

1) Please state your level of inebriation while writing this review.
2) Please state your level of inebriation while ingesting the food reviewed.

This would give a more balanced overall assessment. I visited Smoke's twice in the span of one week: once at 1pm (drunk) and once at 1am (sober)**.

At 1pm, the food was acceptable but not mind blowing. I was able to eat about half of a small order of the Traditional (meat) gravy ($5.45). I am not a fan of the gravy - it tastes overwhelmingly of an herb that doesn't belong in gravy. As Susan C has mentioned, it might be rosemary or thyme? I don't care to scrutinize this any further but it needs to be extracted from the gravy recipe. 

Later in the week I split a large Traditional Veggie ($6.95) with a friend and we handily polished it off. The veggie gravy tasted better than the ""meat"" but still wasn't hot enough to melt the curds. I want more strings dangling from my lips and I want to be wheeled into the ER with a giant melted cheese curd blob in my stomach that requires immediate extraction, OK?

I stopped by this Tim Hortons after the Sensation concert, in addition to stumbling across two people who needed a place to grab a bite. Since I arrived at 4am, there wasn't much food remaining. However, they did have ice capps remain, in which I took.

While we were sitting down having our drinks, there was a man sitting behind us moaning about Trudeau, which somewhat irritated us. We reported it to the supervisor, but he said he's a regular there and they can't do much as he comes back regardless. Okay...?

Washrooms were okay, but reek of piss smell when I was there. However I looked around and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I also like the somewhat old architecture setup of this Tim Hortons as well.",2013-06-02 15:51:15

Here's the deal.  We ordered a gyro and a wrap, along with some hummus.  Dude behind the counter was nice, but for some reason he only talked to me (even though my husband was also talking to him), and he called the gyro a ""j-eye-row.""

The hummus came out first, and we started to chow down.  After a couple bites, I looked at my husband and asked how he liked it.  I asked because it tasted like...air.  Like nothing.  It looked like hummus, it felt like hummus, but it didn't taste like anything.  He thought about it and said ""it couldn't be blander.""  So, the hummus was a bust.

When our food came out, we were pleasantly surprised.  The meat in both was good--though extremely salty--and flavorful.  It was a nice contrast to the lifeless hummus, but I definitely think that it was a tad overpriced.

Overall, we agreed that we wouldn't be coming back.  It wasn't the worst thing ever, but it definitely didn't meet our expectations.  We eat out a lot, and it is always a bummer to spend money on a meal that is just meh.",2013-03-27 00:35:37

With an average of 5 stars and a new placement atop my ""Best Match"" list here on Yelp, I was finally tempted to call in a take-out order.   In going through what I could see of the menu in the pics here combined with my fear of vegan ""meat"", I decided upon the highly lauded Crispy, Spicy eggplant lunch special with brown rice and a regular iced tea to drink.  They told me 10 minutes it'd be ready (fast!) and I probably got there 15 minutes after.  It's upstairs?  Minus one star.  Just kidding, but I am lazy so I took the elevator.

It took them a short while to realize I was at the front waiting, but not crazily long and they apologized so no harm done (I also didn't try to flag them down or anything), and I paid for the meal (reasonable at $9 for food and drink combined) and left.  First thing I noticed which was odd was that it was all bagged up, even the iced tea.  I can understand the thinking that it could be more convenient to carry it this way, but when I got to the car I immediately went to remove it because I don't like my hot and cold items so close to each other when I get takeout.  I then noticed that the tea was in a gigantic soup container, and not a normal takeout cup, meaning it was very wide and the lid did not have an opening for a straw.  Given it's width it wouldn't fit in my cupholders so right back into the bag it went.  You win this round Veggie house.  On the plus side it contained a LOT of tea, and I've never been more AMPED to work on Excel spreadsheets on a Friday afternoon in my life.

In getting to work I was a little disappointed when unpacking the bag to find that there was simply the rice and eggplant (and the tea) inside.  The menu states it is served with a daily soup and also lists a ""Bun Roll"" and some sort of sweet potato rice but now I can see how that might be part of an option I could have chosen instead of the brown rice?  Alright look, I still could have used some soup, and they CLEARLY have to go soup containers.  I know several places make those sort of lunch special components dine-in only, but I didn't see any mention of that being the case here so I was still sad about it.   

As for the eggplant and brown rice, they tasted really great as others have mentioned, but I have a big issue with the eggplant being called spicy because there was ZERO HINT OF SPICINESS whatsoever.  On a scale of 1-10 it was literally a 1 if not a zero.  It was much more sweet than spicy which was a disappointment for me as I love spice.  I'm not sure if I should have specified that I wanted it really spicy, or if my understanding of vegan spice is too limited to understand the deal, but I didn't feel like I ultimately got what I wanted.  The flavors were still nice, and I would definitely give Veggie House another try in the future.   Maybe by then they'll have to-go cups?",2012-10-12 20:34:38

Our group almost thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Mesa Grill. We had several appetizers, the Queso Fundido and the smoked chicken black bean quesadilla being the favorites, and lots of entrees, with the rib-eye and the duck breast getting the most acclaim. Even the bread was delectable. 

But what prevented Mesa Grill from getting five stars? The desserts! We were so surprised when the desserts came out and none of us liked them. We had chocolate corn bread pudding, two warm apple pies, churros and a fourth dessert that I can't name at the moment (I'm staring at it in a picture and I still can't name it). 

Out of the four, the warm apple pie was the best of the worst.. The churros tasted more burned than anything else, and the chocolate corn bread pudding was more corn than chocolate or bread pudding.

I hope not, because I honestly cannot decide who would win. I mean, this was a photo finish. 

I ordered takeout for the family this evening and went wild considering the peanut prices. This Pym-particled joint cannot be beat for a cheap meal. 

I love how the streets in Dormont are named after U.S. states, and whoever owns the place must also. 

I got two dogs; an Illinois Avenue and a Texas Avenue. 
One is of course a Chicago style dog (tomato, pickle, sport peppers, onions, brown mustard, celery salt, poppy seeds) and the other is a Tex-Mex delight with chili, cheddar, sour cream, and... Fritos?!?

Yes it was a taco salad on a bun; a freshly baked, chewy, rich, Kribel's Bakery (treacherous Brookliners!)  bun. 

I never paid much attention to hot dog buns before, but these had to the very best hot dog buns I have ever had. They were just the thing needed to make each hot dog absolutely PERFECT. 

The kid that made the hot dogs looked like a graffiti artist, and an artist he indeed was. You should have seen him making each one. It was as if he was plating a gourmet dish! I'm glad I got there early enough to watch him in action. He's ""Iron Chef"" bound. Each dog was perfectly constructed considering how many toppings each dog had. None of them fell apart on the way home. They were still very warm, each dog being gently placed in its own little styrofoam coffin.  You should see how the mustard and sour cream are drizzled on each dog.

My God I could sit there for an hour and eat ten dogs. What a case for competitive eating! 

Potato salad addict me had to try their own tater salad which was as German as Helloween or Blind Guardian or Doro! Man it had a THICK  mashed potato consistency that included unpeeled New Potatoes and vinegar ( I could taste it). Despite its simplicity, it met my high standards. Well done.

Their cole slaw ain't bad either. It's creamy, a little tangy, and not too soggy.

They still have the great outdoor area which will be awesome in the warmer months.
One of the first things that stood out was that this restaurant/bar is partitioned into three rooms.  Upon entering the two rooms separate from the bar, you could tell a substantial decrease in the noise level from the bar and TVs.  It was a classy and dimly lit, allowing for a much more intimate setting.  On today's visit, I stayed at the bar.  

Their menu is not your typical bar fare.  I got some wings and a burger, which sounds typical enough, but my wings were habanero orange - a nice blend of heat (but not too much) and citrus sweetness. They also were not your typical breaded wings.  They were fried without a coating, which led to a very crispy skin.  My burger (which I ordered medium) was cooked properly, and was a nice thick, juicy chuck patty.  It was topped with friend onions, a tomato compote, mixed greens and cheddar cheese. Very tasty.  The fries that came with it were also great.  Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned with salt and pepper.

The drinks are what stood out the most.  There aren't a ton of beers on tap - I think that there were 7 or eight - but the ones that they did have were solid options.  But where their drinks are different is in the large selection of cocktails, mules, and wines.  I had a Homestead Mule consisting of whisky, ginger beer and an orange slice.  Very refreshing, tasty, and served in an ice cold copper mule mug.

On top of that, service was great - extremely friendly staff and owner, who came by to chat and introduce himself.

This is definitely a solid addition to the growing Homestead bar/restaurant scene, and one that has its own distinct identity among them.  If you are looking for a place with a huge number of draft beers on tap, then this is probably not your best bet in Homestead.  I would try either Dukes, Blue Dust or Dorothy 6.  But if you are more of a foodie looking for an upscale bar, that can also provide an intimate dining experience with a lot of drink options - Honest John's is a great choice.  Definitely work checking out, especially if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront.",2016-12-23 01:28:39

We started with the Guacamole appetizer- you get a order sheet and check-off the mix-ins that you want. Loved the guacamole, and it came with a lot of chips. The Thrice Cooked Wings were also great- the meat just fell off the bone. The fish sauce taste was distinct, so if you don't like it, don't get it. The wings are given by weight when we asked about how many pieces, and this appetizer was enough for 4 people. 

I got the Baja Taco- tempura white fish with cabbage, onion, radish and jalapeno relish. First thought- the fish is huge!!

We are both social workers so we don't get to do it up like this all the time, so we did the damn thing and got dressed to the nines.  Needless to say, when we plan to fork over $100+ for a meal we hope to leave satisfied.  

Service:  We both have an affinity for good, friendly service so we were really pleased when our server was friendly and down-to-earth.  She was very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations.  Chinato's menu is complex, large and confusing.  The dishes are mostly in Italian and lack any description of the preparation or ingredients... so you really don't know what you are ordering unless you ask.  It's a good thing our server was so chill because we had a lot of questions.  At one point I asked for a glass of Merlot and she responded with, ""Do you like Malbec? Because we have a really great Malbec and it's cheaper than the Merlot..."" She really made us feel comfortable and relaxed.

Food:  For my starter I wanted a salad  and I ordered the Arugula with julienne of pumpkin, roasted turnips, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette, at our servers suggestion.  It was really amazing.  A great start to the meal.  The server also recommended that we order a pasta and a entree so I assumed that they'd be small portions.  I ordered the Risotto with speck and yellow pepper as my second course.  This was actually pretty bland and uninteresting.  I didn't even finish it.  Which is probably a good thing because our entrees were not small... they were normal sized and by the time I got mine I was already kind of full.  Nonetheless, I took the servers recommendation and got the ""Deconstructed"" Ribollita.  I had no idea what it was but she talked about vegetables, marinara and pulled pork in a way that I just couldn't say no.  It really was great.  It had some hidden lemon zest and cheese hidden among ribbons of  zucchini and summer squash on top of potatoes, pulled pork and a really great marinara.  I wish I could have eaten more of it but at that point I could only take a few bites.  I really didn't want anything else but we decided to split a desert after we saw some delivered to a nearby table.  My boyfriend has a nut allergy so we ordered the only allergy-friendly thing on the menu, Lemon Polenta Cake.  When it arrived it looked great but upon first bite I was disappointed.  I expected a moist, warm lemon-y cake... but it was a room temperature, ""stale"" textured and somewhat crunchy cake that we didn't care to finish.  The lemon ice cream on the top was pretty tasty though.

The only other thing that can be said is that the ambiance of the restaurant is more commercial than I'd expected.  I also noticed that while we were there it was LOUD and the table behind us was getting so rowdy that they broke a wine glass.

The Fabulous Karen L. and I came here to eat the Snail and Rabbit Paella. We had plans for weeks to go, and Lo and Behold, despite the fact that their on line menu still listed this dish... the menu had changed and it was no longer available. 

Needless to say we were a bit disappointed, but opted for the Duck and Date Paella. The Server was kind enough to offer to go in the kitchen and see if they could still make the Snail and rabbit, and chef Luis came out and apologized in person and offered to make us one with rabbit, mushrooms and artichokes. This did sound great, but we opted for the Duck. For starters, we had the fried green tomatoes which were served in a delicate tower layered with tomato and feta. These were both delicious and well presented. The Fried artichokes were a favourite of mine from the last visit and did not disappoint this time. We also had the peppers with tomato sauce and they were simple, but the tomato sauce was bright and had a nice acid balance with the bright green peppers.

The Chef returned to ask us if we wanted bread to sop up the tomato sauce. Yes, please.

Paella was very good. The duck was served as a confit leg on top of the wine soaked rice and a lovely seasonal offering of fava beans, sweet peas in the pod, chewy dates and dried apricot with fresh basil.

I initially thought that the basil overpowered the dish, but it proved to be a winning combination. I also loved the burned rice on the bottom. We scraped at that stuff for ages and it was worth the effort :)

Again, Chef Luis appeared to ask us if we liked the paella and we nodded that we enjoyed it very much.

Now, the lack of stars is for a couple of things. When I made the reservation, I asked for the booth. When I arrived, the person seating me did not acknowledge this and did not give me the booth. The booth sat empty for an hour and a half and they ended up seating two ladies there, so they weren't saving it for 4. If the host/server had at least lied to me and told me that the table was already reserved, I would have been okay with that. But there was no attempt to acknowledge or honour the request.

They charged me for 3 glasses of wine instead of 2. A mistake which they quickly fixed and I get that if two servers are helping your table, the likelihood of this happening is pretty high.

Overall, there is just something about the service and the vibe here that is lacking. Our server wasn't inattentive or rude, but not really very warm. I felt that the chef cared a lot more than the servers. I think that the food may be a bit more elevated here, but Torito takes the bull by the horns when it comes to great service and a more convivial environment.

The food takes the cake here. Thank you Chef Luis. You're a talented man who showed a lot of class tonight and took care of us very well.

I came here for dinner last week and boy was I disappointed.  Came here on a Friday night, there were about three tables and then us.  The set up when dining in is a bit confusing.  You get a menu but then have to walk up to the counter to place your order.  Then, they bring the food to you.

I was a bit turned off that the server kept walking by spraying and cleaning the nearby tables repeatedly because I was worried the spray would get into our food.

We got the fumicato pizza and chose the trecce pasta....What a mistake!

First off, the pizza though small seemed alot smaller than the one I got last time despite the same size.  It wasn't cut evenly either, like two big pieces and two tiny pieces.

The Trecce was oily and not enjoyable at all.  It was really disappointing considering we had high hopes for this dish.  When I went to pay, I was asked how was everything.  I said the trecce was too greasy and she apologized but didn't offer anything else in compensation.  She just said that it is an oily dish because of the olive oil used in comparison to the other dishes.

I noticed one table got the comp panacotta's but two other tables later weren't offered any.  I was finished while my partner was still eating.  When I went to pay, I wasn't offered the dessert and had to ask about it after I had paid.  The guy asked if we were ready for it yet cause we were still eating.  Umm...I figure I've paid.  Even if someone is working on their dish at the end, I thought you'd bring it out.",2016-10-02 04:53:21

It could have deserved four stars.....sorry your server made our payment process stressful. 

The server who took our order , she was fine and able to answer our inquiries and suggested the appropriate size for two of us.  


Food & price value: 5/5
Service was good at the beginning and eating process. The server kept pouring water for us and got us napkins, everything seemed fine.   We shared food so we were given two bowls but one has food remains or dirty stains on it so we asked to exchange one... one score lost due to the improper cleaning ..... having said that .. not a big deal . We were still enjoying the taste of the food at a good value.  We spent almost two hours chatting while we were the only table in the restaurant.  Okay,  all of a sudden,  the server (~ different one not the one who took the order) gave us a bill and asking us to pay debit or cash ...during our conversation... that means basically our dinner was interrupted inappropriately without asking, and getting us to pay the bill first..... I then asked ok, are you closing up your cash ? She said no but still standing there and waiting to take our payment. .. then we didn't wanna stay anymore and we paid cash and left unpleasantly.... the server could have handled this better.    And we haven't ask for the bill yet....... it is understandable to empty the table at the restaurant if we were occupying your table while your restaurant is full or other customers were waiting badly.  

I would definitely look forward the improvement on the payment process.  It was not a good impression at the end of our dining experience at this location of Hakka legend in Markham store. 

Tip: take out 10% off if order is over $20. It could be a better and enjoyable meal for me if I didn't need to get to pushed to pay. ........ unpleasantly leaving and we both were full with good hakka noodle and Thai veggie soup.

The site-specific installations set this series of spaces on the city's north side apart from so many other art venues across the country.  The permanent installations by Yayoi Kusama and James Turrell (who had a spectacular 2013 with his installations in the US and Europe) are always worth experiencing again.

One delicate installation that has taken over the entire 516 Sampsonia building is, unfortunately, a temporary one.  Chiharu Shiota has attempted to illuminate memories within and of this old multistory house by using thousands of yards of black yarn to weave cobwebs throughout the interior.  The tangle of yarn, in some areas so thick it's difficult to see through it, separates the viewer from the objects she has placed in each of the rooms, including a desk, suitcases, a bed, chairs, a sewing machine, and a beautiful white dress.  On a cold December afternoon, going from room to room and floor to floor of this incredibly elegant tapestry -- that's what it really is -- was like wading through dreams.

My husband's classic benedict also had one of the English muffins burnt! As for my pastrami hash, it came with a charred piece of toast, but that I could care less about. I was overall not impressed with my dish. The pastrami lacked any real flavor, so much so that I couldn't even tell the difference from when I was eating meat or potatoes... It all tasted the same!

From this experience, I would not return back here for brunch. However, they got 3 stars because of the few times I have come for dinner in the past and enjoyed my meal (if you're into sharing, I would definitely recommend either the short rib or the pig's head. Be aware that the pig's head is not for the weak palette, you have to be comfortable with and enjoy fatty meats).",2017-09-12 03:22:02

After a wonderful visit at the Phipps Conservatory, husband and I decided to extend our Schenley experience by heading up to Flagstaff Hill.  We joined dozens upon dozens of other folks doing the same: couples on blankets playing Connect Four, sunbathing coeds, teams of Frisbee golfers making use of Schenley's course, families picnicing at tables, children running around the playground, cyclists taking on the steep drive, even a cheery ice cream truck that brought people flocking.  There was such a peaceful and communal feeling atop this hill, so husband and I found a bench to sun our legs, soak up the view of the city, and -- my personal fave -- people-watch.

For the most part, this is your average Chipotle. I can't say that they do anything exceptional. The primary reason I come here...is because its the closest Chipotle in the area to me. 

My portions unfortunately are not consistent. About 40% of the time...my burrito is slammed with rice...which takes up most of the burrito. I've been to a couple handfuls of Chipotles, so I feel that I know what the average portion is (my opinion). 

Recently, I had an order picked up...came back home...and yes the order was wrong. Lets be honest here, its quite possibly the worst thing that can happen. Customer drives home, finds out that he has a wrong order, or they messed up, and now has to drive back to complete an order. I get it, one small thing missed...and its a domino effect. Maybe it was just a bad night.

I understand that everything is fast paced at Chipotle. Its for business, I get it. Its also obviously that alot of the staff members are young and go in auto-pilot mode and make mistakes. We are all human. 

The thing is, they offered me an extra cup/side of chicken for the mistake. That was the best that they could do in their words. I didn't want a gift card or anything else of that matter. A meaningful apology would have actually been perfect. The way that they handled it just felt meaningless, and they were just gonna brush it right off after I left. It probably happens all the time. This is just how I felt.

On a brighter side - the lines do go fast. They do work hard or try to. They attempt to be as nice as they know how to.

The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.

I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. 

Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.

ff9on-Yoaws0NLjk9lOYjg,RaNkWBMywhBqCZOQWSN_SQ,kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ,1,5,4,1,"Went here for lunch yesterday with the boss. I did a very cursory glance over the menu on their home page and was delighted to see that they had pho-style dishes here. Then only spent a second to check the Yelp star rating before heading out from the office. I read the reviews, as well as the owner retorts, after I got back home from the office - and laughed over the ""butt-hurt one"".. *8-) Reminiscent of the infamous Amy's Baking Company review and reply.. http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2010/08/ouch_todays_hard_lesson_on_yel.php for those of you who missed it the first time round..

Anyway, I've never had Cambodian food before, but I'm a big fan of pho and quite partial to Thai food as well. I'm going to agree with the hard-to-findness of the location. The boss let me know where it is, Google Maps AND Waze tried to tell me where it is, and I still had to circle back and triplecheck the map out front of a 99c store before I inched back out onto Indian School and finally dodged into a tiny catty-corner parking lot with a giant Mexican circular water fountain oddly set directly into the tarmac. No other vehicles except the boss' motorbike. Inside, greeted by the waiter (I assume Yutheana) and sat with the boss. Place was completely empty (apart from us) but I liked the decor - including the concave xylophone up front which reminded me a bit of a dinosaur's ribcage. At the table, I ordered a diet cola. It tasted a little odd - not horrible or anything, but sort of.. either the syrup was off or someone had put a tiny bit of honey in it? No matter. I found the description of their Phnomh Penh soup too amusing not to order it - ""Got guts? Wahey - so does this soup!"" Who could resist heart, liver, intestines, ground pork and shrimp in a pho broth? The boss ordered the Amok Fish.

The waiter came over for a bit of a chat and overheard us talking about how the place was hard to find. Apparently they used to have a sign out front.. which went away for some reason. This place needs blinking neon lights and perhaps a sandwich-board holder wearing a pig intestine costume or something, because it's absolutely nondescript when you're driving past and I'm actually very surprised to see so many reviews - must be word of mouth visits because it sure as hell wouldn't be people going ""Hey, check this Cambodian restaurant out that we're driving past..""

Out came our dishes. High marks for presentation - it all looked quite appetizing, especially the fish dish. Unfortunately, flavour wise, mine was.. just a'ight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't as confrontational a flavour as I guess I thought it might be. In fact it was rather bland. I love spicy food - especially Indian - but usually with pho I drown it in lemon or lime. I put a squirt of lime down on the top and had a few bites. Shrugged at my boss. Surprisingly the lime did nothing for this dish - but a couple of big squeeze bottles of hot sauce had been supplied and I used that instead. THEN the dish came somewhat alive! Interesting.

Would I get the dish I got again? Probably not if I was hungry and/or after something with a little taste to it, but definitely if I wanted to shock friends. The boss didn't mind his but said there were probably four other dishes he'd like to try first before re-ordering the Amok. I didn't hate this place, I certainly didn't think the prices were too high like others observed, but it wasn't stunning enough to warrant more than a ""passable"" rating IMO.

Now if only someone would open up a MALAYSIAN restaurant - the last time I had a decent laksa was over a decade and seven thousand miles ago. Sigh.

Edit 20120414: I came to your restaurant looking for lunch. My review THEN went on to wish for a Malaysian restaurant, riding a completely different train of culinary thought. Imagine star number 3 on my review start to flicker as its batteries begin to run out.

The TAKOWASABI ($4.20) was a delight for the eyes and for the stomach. The presentation was on point and I almost didn't want to eat it! We went half and half (you get the choice of raw/cooked/half and half). The presentation was so extravagant for just takowasabi!

We didn't hear too many good things about Kingyo's fresh fish but decided to give it a shot anyways. We ordered the MAGURO CARPACCIO ($11.20) and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the dish. Thinly sliced ahi-tuna carpaccio were placed on a bed of spring mix, avocado, radish sprouts, daikon radish, onions &amp; topped with crispy garlic chips and their house dressing. While it was great that there were so many ingredients, this can also be a pitfall as you lose the delicate tuna flavour amongst all the other ingredients. Still a refreshing started and we really can't complain about the size of it!

KARAAGE has always been a must-order for us as we love our fried chicken. Kingyo's famous deep fried chicken karaage from ""O-Sho restaurant"" in Japan was served with a magic powder (a sansho pepper blend) and a small lemon wedge. The portion was quite generous with large, moist pieces of crispy fried chicken. The chicken was delicious on its own and the magic powder was not necessarily needed.

We were hoping to order uni shooters when we went but they didn't have any on their special menu :(

The STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE ($10.20) was an incredibly fun dish. Thin slices of raw beef were placed in front of us along with a sizzling stone. You cooked the meat yourself on the stone for about 1 minute or so before dipping it into one of the sauces provided. Just a note, the stone loses its heat after while and they will replace it for you.

J didn't particularly like the KIMCHI UDON ($8.80) as it was too creamy but I really enjoyed it. We both agreed it could have used a LOT more kimchi though especially when that's the name of the udon!

The GOMA RAMEN SALAD WITH SPICY COD ROE ($7.80) had a combination of BBQ pork, cucumbers, marinated sea kelp and spicy cod roe. It was tossed in a tangy house sesame dressing. Cold ramen done right! The sesame dressing was addicting and this was a really refreshing dish

We ended off the meal with their 2 COLOUR ALMOND TOFU ($5.80). A small Jasmine jello layer at the top and a layer of berry sauce in the middle of an almond tofu. We made the regrettable mistake of only getting one almond tofu - get two, you won't want to share.

The dishes were carefully crafted, the flavours were simple and yet stunning, and the service was beyond anything I've ever experienced. 

I could go through and list everything I ate (we ordered the seven course menu), but you won't have the same menu when you go. Some of the plates are smaller than others, but there are some larger protein dishes mixed in. Each dish was exceptional. The bread and butter are the things dreams are made of. I kept trying to remind myself not to fill up on bread, but our server refilled our bread after we finished the first basket and it was so warm and crunchy and the butter had these beautiful hints of, like, i dunno, caramel? maybe ... I can't even. 

By far my favourite course was our starting course - something I can only describe as a ceviche salad with limequat. Apparently my spellcheck doesn't think limequat is a word, but wikipedia says otherwise. Anyways, it was magical.

This isn't the case here. They might limit you to one or two order for a few delicacies but you can have Nigiri all you want... and it is mostly what I had.

Now you know that. 

Did you know that on Thursdays, Triptych runs one of their beers through a Randall? (do you know what a randall is?) (a randall is a device, sold by Dogfish Head, that infuses things into beer. Kind of like a reverse water filter, instead of taking impurities out, it puts other things in). 

Now you know that too. 

I believe this week, triptych will be doing the Red-5 with ginger/lemon tea. This would go great with a pizza. Next week, they are looking to do Sprung with Pineapple (which would go great with a Hawaiian pizza, don't you think?)

Now after eating at the Metro Brasserie, I'm wondering if the location is cursed. Perhaps it was built on top of an old graveyard. It would be interesting to go back in time 600 years or so to see if every trading post put up there failed as well.

So what's a failure here? Well, it's the food. The burgers were shit. Burned and dry. The bun was the same. The fries weren't so terrible, but everything else was. My friend asked for a replacement burger and I was discouraged enough to simply ask to try their mac and cheese. My friend's burger this time was burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Raw. I mean, it was still cold. The mac and cheese was bland, dry, and awful. Did not finish anything except the fries. 

The service was good in the way that they were very nice and polite and they really wanted us to be happy. I can't say they got everything right, but they definitely tried. +1 for that... A for effort. 

I thought the whole thing was overpriced, but they could've charged 10 bucks for that food we had and it would've been too much. In fact, I don't think they did charge us for the burgers... we just overtipped. I just mean the prices on the menu are a bit high. The location is beautiful though, so hopefully they'll get their shit together.",2009-03-21 07:03:19

This is a cute little cafe in the same plaza as Cathay House and Rincon de Buenos Aires. When you walk in, you're greeted with the by-now-familiar ""irasshaimase."" We found our way to one of the tables along the outside wall, beneath the row of hand prints in plaster.

Among the three of us, we shared some Karaage ($5), a plate of Vegetable Curry Rice ($6.99), and the Tororin Omelet ($9.99). I guess we're not fans of Japanese curry because we weren't very impressed with the curry rice; it was mostly heat and not very much flavor. I'm hoping this was an anomaly.

On the bright side, the Karaage was extremely flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly tender (and piping hot on the inside). The Tororin Omelet was also extremely good. It kind of looked like a gigantic piece of tamago sushi. The omelet itself was still runny on the inside, so be forewarned if that turns you off.

As for drinks, I was the only one who ordered something. Reading reviews from Christopher S and Philip T, I was intrigued by the siphon coffee and had to give it a try (after initially ordering a can of Calpico and not opening it). The brewing process looks like a chemistry set (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw?select=bpdXofQNObyw5hqrmFgV1A). I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any stretch, but it was definitely worth ordering. After some cream and sugar, the flavor of the coffee was very smooth.

I have to admit, I've driven by this place probably hundreds if not thousands of times and always thought about checking it out. Having finally stepped inside, I kind of wish I'd done it sooner. 

Decor and ambiance are about what you'd expected for a themed restaurant like this. Lots of wood beams and the whole log-cabin look, coupled with double pane windows and cozy booths. It was definitely nice to get out of the chilly December night air and step inside this place. Lots of black bear themed items of course, right down to the hot sauces, the glasses and the napkins, but it's not overdone to any kind of extreme. I must concede the place probably appeals more to an older crowd or someone looking for the nostalgia of a theme restaurant from a bygone era, but sometimes a trip down memory lane can be fun and I can't knock them for that.

As I mentioned before, we ended up going here to satisfy an evening craving for breakfast food, and they did not disappoint. I ended up trying the Meat Lovers omelette, which was large, perfectly cooked and super delicious. Almost to the point of being too much meat, which was just what I wanted, so no complaints there at all. I will say they gave me so many potatoes with it that the side itself was dwarfing the omelette. Normally that would be a tad odd or off putting, but I was so hungry I just didn't care. My wife tried the chicken pot pie and thoroughly enjoyed her. Her's came with french fries which I did not try, but was told they were fantastic.  

Service was on point the entire time, with quick seating, quick to get a drink order and bring them out and short turnaround time on getting our entrees (and later, the bill) to us. I'll definitely return the next time I get an evening craving for some breakfast food.",2015-12-23 18:30:06

Each of the tables along the wall were blocked off from one another by black-painted wooden walls, making the individual spaces slightly tight for a table of four. The space was made much darker with inadequate lighting in addition to the black walls on either side. But I suppose it's a plus if you prefer more privacy.
With half an hour of happy hour (5pm - 7pm) left, I ordered a $4 beer, $4 steamed shrimp dumplings (3), and $5 tuna poke. Their happy hour menu is pretty extensive, and the prices very reasonable. The dumplings were great, but the tuna poke wasn't as much. There wasn't enough flavor to the poke and the tuna wasn't cold enough..as if it's been sitting out elsewhere for a while. I ordered a tempura udon as entrée and that was pretty good as well. Overall the experience was nothing too out of the ordinary.

It was a cold Friday in February so my colleague suggested we go there for lunch.  I was expecting real old school décor (at the bar area) but I was pleasantly surprised that it was updated.  As soon as I walked in, I got a great vibe as it seemed like such a comfy, cozy place to be on a winter's day.  The owner greeted us with a warm smile and the waitress came over right away with the menus. There were a lot of older people that had already started drinking (LOL) but, all in all, it was a mixed crowd.

I ordered a cheeseburger, my colleague ordered the Reuben and we shared fries with gravy.  The burger was okay but (I'm going to date myself) the fries and gravy took me way back in time; they tasted just like that restaurant at The Bay in Fairview Mall used to serve.  I wish I could remember the name of it but it was like a cafeteria/buffet set-up. Anyway ...  a couple of patrons ordered the fried calamari and it looked so good - just like what you'd get on the Danforth.  Next time I'm getting that for sure!  Service was second-to-none and the waitress was super friendly - we made sure to leave her a nice tip.

Heck, it's the same thing for the most part and it should be one and the same. This is a strong 4.5 stars for a sports bar. 

I come here with my coworker even though we both aren't from Wisconsin (Michigan and Minnesota) but it's a great bar. The appeal of this place is very similar to Badger Cafe, lots of Packer Fans and Wisconsites come here to watch Packers game and other home town related games as well. It gets completely nut! I don't live to far from here but it's my go-to bar.  

They have the occasional drink special (Last week 2 dollar shots) but you can't beat the $3 tall PBR. It's the stable of this place. The bartenders are quick, friendly and fast.

Everyone who shows up there is pretty much from the Midwest, so for me it's like a home away from home.  Beards as far as the eye can see. I hear once or twice a week there is normally some sort of fight or scene that happens, I keep missing out.

They upgraded most of their bar a few months ago. Massive widescreen TV's around the bar as well as darts, shuffleboard and pool tables with arcade games to keep you entertained.

There have been times where I sit down and people just hover over me nearly sitting on my lap because of how packed it can get, as well as there have been times where I almost trip over sleeping hobo's outside. But for me that's part of the charm.

On top of that, with Badger Cafe bringing food to you, it's a damn good bar. I probably wouldn't want to wear my Lions Jersey there anytime soon.",2013-04-14 00:41:41

I started with one of their drinks, the gentleman's something, and my friend had an apple soda. My drink was awesome and also deadly--I could taste the whiskey but the other ingredients had made it so sweet I forgot it was was whiskey! Oops... 

When we ordered, I immediately gravitated towards the jalapeño poppers and the shrimp and grits. I ordered both, but when the waitress asked if I wanted the poppers with my biscuits (HOT BISCUITS???!!), I had to cut out the poppers. 

The biscuits, by the way, were awesome. So fluffy and towering that I was able to split it into thirds! The garlic butter was good but the jam was EXCELLENT. I wish there had been more of it :( 

My shrimp and grits were delicious. The shrimp was nicely grilled with a delicious sear, the asparagus still had some crunch, and the cheese was blended in a delicate way. I devoured it all! My friend had decided you can never have too many biscuits, so he ordered their biscuits with gravy. When it came out, there was so much gravy you almost couldn't see the biscuits! Suffice to say, he couldn't finish it and took the leftovers home :) 

Overall, a lovely experience. Our plans suddenly changed and we had to cut our brunch 20 minutes short. Luckily, the wait staff had been so attentive that we didn't even have to flag someone down and they soon had a doggie bag and check at the table. Much appreciated.

I wish I had the time to really customize my sushi order but being pressed for time I ordered the spicy salmon and shrimp tempura. 

The presentation is very fast food i.e. take out containers and cutlery. The Spicy Salmon was average to good which I expect from every sushi restaurant but nothing to write home about. The shrimp tempura left me wanting a bit more. The batter was really soft and mushy. I like mine crunchy and crispy but if you like yours limp and soft - this is the place to go. They the Japanese cream soda available here (please don't try at your own risk because you will be hooked and will regret that you ever lived without this beverage for so many years!!!)

The decor and layout is cool and funky with no stereotypical Japanese/Asian elements which I do appreciate. 

The service and staff were SUPER SUPER friendly which is why I gave it 4 stars despite the food being average. 

Would I go back? Yes if the prices were lowered just a wee bit as I can't justify eating there for the cost when there is no shortage of sushi restaurants in Toronto.

We stopped in shortly after they opened over the Fourth of July weekend.  They have good food, but it's not amazing and the prices are a little bit steep.  We have other places in Oakmont we prefer to eat, but I would definitely give this place another shot in the future.  

We started with soups - Bobby got mushroom and I got their lobster bisque.  His was just OK.  Mine was delicious.  Very, very good bisque.  I ordered one of their salads and asked to add chicken to it. Bobby got their lobster roll.  My salad was very good, however, the chicken seemed processed to me. I probably would not order a chicken dish again for that reason.  Also, I thought it was weird that out of 6-7 salads they offer on their menu, not one of them had protein on it nor does it state the option to add a protein.   Bobby got their lobster roll and while it was tasty, it was an extremely small portion for $14.

This past Sunday, we stopped in for a drink during the fourth quarter of the Steeler game.  There were only a few other clusters of people throughout the restaurant - two parties of 4-6 eating dinner and three parties sitting around the bar watching the game.  There was a polite hostess and the bartender took good care of us.  They had a nice selection of seasonal beers.

I love the atmosphere in this place. It's dark and industrial while still being chic and cozy.  I love the floors and the tables and the décor.

WOOT WOOT! It makes everything so much easier!

I can't lie before I even got the Windsor I had checked out the brunch menu and was 95% sure I was going to go with the Windsor Eggs Benedict, and even though they have a Bloody Mary Bar for 5 bucks, I wasn't going to tempt myself with that because honestly Bloody Marys are not my sort of thing.

After sitting down and looking at the drink menu, I saw something that looked interesting and needed a try and it was a bloody mary drink too! I was mind blown that I was going down that path, but It's The Verde Bloody Mary, made with cucumbers, roasted poblano, cilantro & watercress, damn this drink was DELISH!  They do have a bloody Mary bar with all your fixings, pickles, spices, salts & garnishes but for me, this drink was perfect, it didn't need anything. It was spicy, it was heaven!  If you do not like spicy don't order it, for me damn it was great!

After sipping on my Verde I no longer was interested in the benedict and wanted a spicy dish to go with my drink, so I went with the Matador, two eggs over easy ontop of griddled cheddar potatoes, crispy tortilla, salsa verde & avocado relish, while waiting for everyone's plates to come out I spotted some of the benedict dishes and was starting to get plate envy, they looked soo good!  Then the Matador made it to me, this dish was amazing, the salsa verde was great the egg & potatoes combo with the avocado relish was just explosions of flavors hitting your tongue, and it went very well with the Verde Bloody Mary, the only thing  I didn't really care for was the crispy tortilla, but it was a great dish for sure!

The employees are young and not very friendly like at a lot of the other trampoline facilities we have been to.

If you go onto the target website there are additional coupons. The only things I would change. The plus size clothing is only a very small section compared to the smaller clothing.

I immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10. Thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday. Yes I can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that's not my gripe.

My gripe is that a lot of the games were not working. I would say about 40 percent were out of order. Even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at. Another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases, they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time. There should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion.

I also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons. This did not bother me at all. Again, since some of the games were out of order, the kids tried to make the most of it. Even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3. Looking around I saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade. 

After about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home. Memo to the Gameworks staff. Dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke? At least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade?

I am so disappointed from our visit that I dont see any reason to come back here. You guys should change your name to ""Gameswork"". Because after coming here I am left scratching my head thinking do any of the ""Games Work?""

So why a one star rating? The food. Ultimately, that's all that counts. 

Uninspired menu, just copying what is already out there but with less quality. Pizza dough is not good... Chewy and tasteless. Even the wood fire oven can't save it. We tried 4 different kinds of pizza and we all remained unimpressed with the toppings. Simply not flavourful.

If this is the type of pizza you like, stick to Brigade or Bottega, which are better choices. If you feel like exceptional pizza, stick to Napoletana on Dante.

Last night, 9:30pm, I'm running too close to 10pm for my own good since I don't want a burger.  GrubHub sucks so I called Olive Garden.  This Olive Garden on 75th Avenue and Thomas Road.  Fiesta Mall.

I ordered dinner, jumped in the car, reached the restaurant and by my clock and I'm meticulous about setting the correct time, it was 9:54pm.  When I got the to the front door, it was locked.

Now, let's examine this: I do understand security and I do understand that restaurants are being robbed more than in the past.  But there are no mass murderers in the news, and you are operating a frigging restaurant that is supposedly open to the public, but you gotta lock up before closing time.  A little overbearing?  Yes.  I think so.

But that's not the bad part.  The bad part is, while I pounded on the glass, I counted 11 employees working inside the restaurant that WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ME.  ELEVEN!  

That's training.  Or lack of training.  Seemingly no one has reminded/told them to be courteous.   Not one person motioned, like with a #1 finger, meaning,  ""just a second"", or ""let me get the manager"" nothing.  THEY JUST IGNORED ME.  That is personally offensive.  And it pissed me off.  On my worst day, I've never treated a customer like that.

Today I called Darden Corporate Customer Service, owner of Olive Garden and they were closed.  Monday, 2:15pm Phoenix-time, Customer Service for all of Darden Restaurants, which include Olive Garden, Capitol Grille, Bahama Breeze, Yard House, Eddie V's, Season's 52 and Longhorn Steakhouse is closed.  It's only open from10am-4pm EDT.  How truly underwhelming is that?  ""We don't care because we don't have to"" or something.  Like the locked door, the bunker mentality reception I got was truly underwhelming.

Chicken Fried Rice:  I tend to measure Chinese restaurants by the quality of this dish and each time I try a new place, it's one of the things I always order.  King Wong had what was probably the worst I have ever eaten.  The chicken was dry and tough and had no flavor....and I don't know how else to say it but it was like it was old.

Kung Pao Chicken:  I think they used the same chicken as in the fried rice, dry, tough, and old.   Aside from that, it was fine.  That's the best thing I can say about it.  

WonTon Chips:  I was actually quite tickled to see these on the menu because they're like Chinese crack to me and I rarely see them offered.  And even though I chowed on them like the had crack inside them, I was not oblivious to the fact that about half of them were considerably darker than the rest, suggesting that they had been fried, left out for a long time, and then fried again.

Hot and Sour Soup:  The broth had that ""kick"" that I enjoy when eating this dish.  Not much else to say about it.

I don't want to discourage people from going here; the lady on the phone who took my order was very nice and conscientious and made absolutely certain that she had my order right, and they did deliver the food faster than the 45 minutes they had suggested would be required.  For me, however, the bottom line with a restaurant is the food, and while i really wanted to be happy with it, every bite was a mouthful of disappointment.",2015-05-29 01:49:05

The flavors themselves were indistinguishable and they all looked and tasted like vanilla to me, sprinkles notwithstanding.  These doughnuts keep well overnight and were as tasty this morning as they were yesterday when fresh.  The cost of $2.25 per doughnut seems reasonable given the organic ingredient list and the fact they are fried in coconut oil, a big plus.  This yeast doughnut is very different from the light glazed raised that Greenbush offers--and twice the cost--but it delivers a very satisfying experience.

On the plus side, the place was quite clean.

On the minus side, there were many problems.

1.  The sandwich maker didn't know what he was doing.  Perhaps he was new.  This is not a crime.   However, when he was in trouble,  he should have asked for help.   He did not.  He put the veggies on top of the bun ...not in it.  As a result,  the sandwich was a real mess.  It was easier to wear than to eat!

2.  The place was almost as cold as a meat locker.  When I courteously asked someone to warm the place up, she smiled at me, but looked at me as though I was from outer space.  Of course, no temperature change was made. 

3.  The ""music"" was abysmal.   It was bubble gummer music at a high volume.   Good for the employees; bad for the customer.  Had the music choice been better,  and/or the volume much lower, our experience would have been better  

I won't be going back to this location, nor any other Jersey Mike's.   Subway has a far superior product at a much more reasonable price point.

The hostess quoted our wait to be 1 hr to 1 hr 10 min. It was very cold outside, but I was dressed warmly and they had the heaters on so it wasn't too bad. A guy brought out pizza samples a couple of times for the people waiting. Always appreciated. My friend went inside to get me a glass of water from the bar. Our wait only ended up being 45-50 min. It's amazing the crowds that Oregano's brings in and how many people are willing to wait. I really wish they operated in bigger buildings. I'm sure they do it for the ambiance (and maybe cost of the space), but they would be successful in a larger space too. I know I would eat here more often if the wait times were shorter.
When we got to our table, I had to switch chairs because the one looked like it had grease on it... then my chair wobbled--I think the tiles were uneven. Small annoyances. Also the lighting was very dim and I used my phone to light up the menu. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara... that is a must for a visit at Oregano's. When it came out, it was really garlicky! It always is, but I think this one was at another level. Very tasty though. For my entree, I ordered the Bollo Pasta (angel hair) with meatballs. This dish is actually unlimited but I can never get through one bowl after the garlic bread and still save a little room for Pizookie! I love the peanut butter chocolate chip they have now, but we got the original chocolate chip. Didn't even finish it... I was so full! Looking forward to the opening of the Goodyear location.
One other comment I have is about the Zany Ziti... now I'm not a pasta expert, but I know the pasta they use for this dish is diagonal cut, not square cut as I know ziti to be. Not sure why they call it ziti if it's actually penne?",2015-01-04 20:08:12

We just requested a side of chili peppers to spice up the dressing, so he didn't have so ""suffer a loss"".  The oversight was so minor. 

The Panang Curry Beef was very good.  Again, meat was cooked just right.  The curry sauce was rich and flavorful.  This dish had the right amount of spiciness we requested.  

The 2nd entree was a crispy trout with a mango salad.  The batter of the trout was light.  The mango salad with its dressing complemented the fresh fish very well.  

Unlike other Oriental restaurant though, an order of rice cost $1.00.  

The service was very pleasant, polite and attentive.

We will definitely return to this restaurant.",2015-11-07 02:28:06

It was a small, clean comfortable restaurant situated next to a carwash. Now that I know where it is - I won't forget ;0)

The employees are very fast, friendly and helpful. We were promptly seated, given water within a couple of minutes and our water was back to get our order quickly.

Two of us got the Pho (one meatball, one steak) and the other in our party got the lemongrass chicken. 

I'm relatively new to the Pho craze, but I have to say this is by far the best I've had. And it was all in the broth. So full of flavor you could literally taste the hours and hours of work put into it. The steak was perfect!! My colleague wasn't crazy about her meatballs and vowed to try the steak next time. 

The three of us split an order of the spring rolls which were amazing.

I headed in after 18 April 2015's Yelp! Event at the Container Bar/Vine Styles just before 1700. I had seen many snippets of reviews, overheard conversations, etc. but I wish I could say what my newest friend, Kate B., said in her review in that she got ""what the hype is about when it comes to Flipp'n burgers!""

Sadly, I do not get it. I was born blonde but I do not think that's it.

Most of you who know me know I eat a lot, I eat around, and am reasonably fair when it comes to reviews and descriptions and even if you do not know me, you are probably smart enough to figure out.

Let's start with the order:

1 Flipp'n burger $14
1 order onion rings $5
1 creamsicle shake $6.25
1 Yelp! discount and adding an egg to the burger -$2

So, that's $27+ with tax before the tip.

So, with this order in process and waiting at a small table, I proceeded to read other reviews and tips noticing that my friend Wanda B. said this about her side order that she discovered ""they are McCain's Sweet Potato French Fries. What happened to the home made version? Seriously I can buy my own McCain's frozen french fries in the stores.""
After reading that, my happiness began to fade and when I got my onion rings, they seemed overcooked and rather small (a large quantity for sure) but I can tell you that the onion ring type dishes at Smashburger or even A&W are way better. Do not get these; you will be sorry. I don't know if these are McCain's or whatever but I do know, these were not acceptable for the kind of press this joint has.

By the way, during the order process, I did see an order of french fries which did look good so, when I do go back, I'll probably just stick with those.

The shake was delicious! The problem here was the lack of quantity (too little shake for too much moolah).

Now, for the apparently 2014 award winning burger on a multigrain bun, I noticed the following:

the toppings were amply applied and fresh (you get to pick those and I hope the picture I uploaded of that bar did post because that was awesome).
the burgers (meat) were huge (two of them)
I should have removed the mushrooms since I normally don't like those on burgers and I think that made it taste salty (on the whole, the burger was too salty, probably because of this).
the sandwich was huge!

To be honest, I've had better burger meat at Smashburger and Clive Burger (though recently, Clive Burger appears to have dropped the ball).

For this amount of money, I expected higher quality (except as already noted) and quantity (again, as already noted).

I will go at least one more time because I realize people have off days; hell, maybe my day was off but my trip to Nellie's in Kensington around noon was really good (that review is coming by the way).

The decor here is totally awesome with pictures of golden era of New York and San Francisco and the many Elvis pictures. Feels like an old diner but be warned, it can get claustrophoic.

The customer service is about you'd expect for Canada/Canadians, Californians, nothing to write home about (it should be better but it could have been worse). But again, I will give it one more chance at a to be determined data (after my stomach recovers).",2015-04-20 23:30:15

Was a bit hesitant about the assembly line pies after having terrible pizza at MOD, but was I pleasantly surprised! Nothing like fired pie or other chain pizzas. The crust was perfect (wood fired) and they use San Marzano tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, among other premium ingredients. You can have a pie off the menu or create your own. We had four different ones and all were delicious! Pies start at $7.99 and they are a decent size for personal pizzas. 

Char has a bar, in addition to offering a few beers on tap where you pay. There is also cannoli, made fresh daily, and it is amazing. Franco, the owner, came around to check on patrons and he talked to us for a while, which was really cool. Always nice to feel your business is appreciated.

We had such an enjoyable time sitting on the patio having a couple glasses of wine (beer for the guys) and eating from very tasty food. I thought at first it would be weird on the patio with the parking lot right there, but it really didn't bother any of us and we kind of forgot where we were for awhile... so, don't let the location deter you from going here!  

As far as the food is concerned...we all shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and bruchetta. Both were good and somewhat unique. The mushroom was stuffed with italian sausage, which I love, and the brushetta was make your own on pizza bread. I was pleased with both appetizers and their prompt service. In addition to little noshes, we all shared 3 pizzas, the buffalo chicken, a pesto with sausage, and plain cheese. I've got to say the pesto was my favorite followed closely by the buffalo chicken. I didn't care too much for the red pizza sauce, just didn't taste that great to me. We also had the cookie dessert, which was mighty fine.

Local ice cream parlor that has been here for a long time must be really good. I did like the old school look of the place. Even the small arcade they had on the other side of the restaurant even though three of the games were out of order still cool. Now I will say I didn't try any of their food but it is an ice cream parlor so you would think the ice cream would be heavenly.
A friend of mine and I went to a movie down the street and were driving home after wards when we spotted it down the street. We had both wanted to try it some day. So I decided today was some day and we pulled in. We had to hunt for a parking space, no big deal, until one popped up right in front of us. We walked inside and waited a minute to be seated. The waitress was very nice and sat us in a booth in the corner right in front of a very nice mural on the wall. She handed us the menu and I realized I had no idea what they had or what I wanted. So I started to scour the menu that is when I realized they had more than ice cream. That was a nice surprise since silly me assumed they only had ice cream but ice cream was what I came for and what they are know for. I finally picked out the Buster Brownie. Brownie with ice cream and marshmallow topping sounded delicious. My friend picked the same thing. We called the waitress over because we were finally ready to order. We placed our order and then were informed we could pick out ice cream flavor if we wanted. Oooo added bonus. I got chocolate and my friend cookies n cream.
It didn't take too long to come out and looked mouthwateringly good. Then the let down. It was good but not spectacular. Not special. The brownie was a fudge brownie which is good but is a little on the hard side. I was expecting a cake brownie all warm and gooey with the ice cream. The marshmallow topping didn't add too much either. I was let down.
I guess I like the corporate place better. I was really hoping the local place would blow them away but sadly no. Also as much as people gripe about the prices at the corporate ice cream store these where about the same.

My older brother tried it first time before I knew what this place was and said oh one must try the admiral's feast and I made sure I tried it on my next visit to North America. I recall liking it as my palate hadn't developed much at that time and food was mainly fuel and my idea of seafood mainly consisted of everything deep fried. When I moved to North America I did go back to this chain mainly to try their stuffed lobster (note the stuffing in lobster for Canada is different from the one in US) as it was decent. Another charm for me is their Signature Margaritas which are good and once one adds a shot can be quite potent so I do come here for those once in a while as apparently hard to get a good margarita in town.  
This spot is what one expects from a chain offering i.e consistent. I think they are reasonably priced if one doesn't order the whole lobster (go figure) service was decent.

We went Saturday for the soft opening. As the first review says, the food out for sampling was definitely decent. I'm a big fan of ABC food and have to say that I think XYZ will live up to those standards. The chicken and waffles were delicious, mussels fresh, but not served with a sauce and the cheese was spectacular. I know that a cheese plate is basic and pretty difficult to mess up, but this was a stellar cheese plate. I do consider myself blessed with an expert cheese pallet. They kept the buffet stocked and fresh the whole time we were there. It was almost as if no one was eating. I did not get a chance to look at a food menu, so I'm looking forward to actually eating a meal there. One of the nice things about ABC is you can eat inexpensively with everything being under 8 bucks. I'm curious to see how reasonable XYZ will be. 

The place was small, and intimate. I enjoyed the diverse crowd. The back by the bar and walls outside the bathroom are a chalkboard so naturally chalk was available to graffiti. I had a good time leaving my marks on the bathroom door.

I finally made it here after wanting to for a while. Rania's is in a strip mall next to a newly-built hospital. There doesn't seem to have been much around it previously. It's a bit of a rough gem out in the middle of not-so-much. The interior of the restaurant is big, open, and spacious. There are a number of tables and booths, as well as several TVs on the wall. I came here with my mom on a Sunday evening. There weren't many people sitting in the restaurant, although a few came in as we dined, but there were a number of people coming in to make and pick up to go orders. The place seems to be somewhat popular, and we found out why with the food.

The service was fantastic. This may have had to do with the fact that the owner himself was doing the service as it turned out, and he was very courteous and friendly. He gave us plenty of attention and was more than happy to describe some of the items on the menu to us. The food we ordered came up pretty quickly and was nice and hot when it got to us.

I had the chicken thighs kabob plate, and my mom had a combo plate with chicken and steak. The chicken was spiced nicely and was decently tender and juicy. The steak was a bit overcooked, but it was still good. The plates come with a little cucumber salad, some yogurt sauce, your choice of rice, and naan or salad. The rice options are pretty good: you can get white, brown, or Kabuli-style rice. The Kabuli-style rice includes carrots and raisins, so of course I got that one (it's an extra charge of $1.50, I believe). I was a little disappointed in how dry the rice was, but I still enjoyed it. The naan was piping hot when it came out. I had not previously had naan like this--it was very light and flaky on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. It made for a good delivery system for the chicken on my plate. Everything on our plates was good, and there was plenty of it!

In addition to the plates, there are a number of ""naanwiches"" that are very reasonably priced. They likely make really good lunch options. I also saw signs for breakfast. I'm intrigued by what might be on the menu for that.

I heard the owner talking about how good the lamb shanks are. Next time, that will likely be what I order. And there will indeed be a next time!",2016-01-06 13:50:54

But anywhoo, let's move on to hubby's meal, he ordered a chicken breast, waffle and side of Mac & cheese. Again $4.75 for a toddler portion and the waffle was terrible looking as well as tasting. It was flat and rubbery and nothing about it screamed hey I'm a meal worth $17! Maybe peeps are paying for the ambiance when they dine in, but why have a dope atmosphere with high prices and mediocre food? I'm so disappointed",2017-12-04 20:42:39

Waitress was nice and I got to sub out for some Cheeseburger sliders, which were very uninspiring with just a little piece of cheese on top of the burger.

I don't know what that is - maybe the explosion of new restaurants was just too much for these old bones. Whatever the case, I had not ventured outside of my comfort zone (my known knowns) for way too long. Thank god it was Bestellen that broke me out of my funk.

Bestellen is an unimposing front on College Street right beside Black Skirt, which I accidentally walked into at 8:00 believing I was late for my reservation. The owner did not seem surprised to have to send me next door so perhaps my stupidity isn't atypical. 

Inside, however, Bestellen is lively and exciting. A large fridge along one wall displays their various meats, all of which have been finely aged so that beef tastes like BEEF. A large bar looks so fully stocked it's surprising that it can hold all the bottles - an OCD bartender's wet dream. There is no wine menu per se (the waiter arched an eyebrow when we asked for one). As the wines change weekly/monthly they're scrawled upon the long blackboard walls to insert new labels more easily. Our reservation was for 8:00 on a Friday. It was the chilly day of winter and snow was falling, so that could be the reasoning for the low turnout. Regardless there were plenty of seats open, which was a bit of a letdown because we'd hoped to eat a bit earlier but were told that couldn't be accommodated. 

But forget about minor annoyances - you're here for the steak. And what a steak. The ""Best Steak in Toronto"" is a title bandied about with some regularity. Admittedly I don't eat out enough to properly judge. But I can say that they do an excellent job here. Steaks are cooked Sous vide, which is a 70s french style of cooking that brings the meat to a perfect medium rare temperature before it's quickly seared and served. The result is a massive perfectly cooked steak. And yes, we went for the most massive of all. All of the food is great, and the smaller (relative term) plates all looked fantastic. But if you can get three or four people together, go and get their $96 steak. It easily feeds four, has a delicious side of marrow (I recall three bones but it could have been four) and comes with two sides, making it cheaper than three mains with sides on their own (or at least comparable).

We splurged on wine, going for a $60 bottle of red - the selection is split into three prices, $45, 60 and something higher we didn't really look at - $90 probably. This makes the selection much easier and helps you dodge having to choose the second cheapest wine. The wine was fine and the waiter was knowledgable about it. Our second bottle was in the cheaper range and you could taste where the $14 had gone. We may have just chosen a bad bottle, but for those looking up and down the cheapest list, it's worth busting out your LCBO app for helpful hints.

Dessert is prepared by the day, so the two or three options are typically scrawled on the wall above the open kitchen. A chocolate volcano-type dish and gingerbread pudding were both good but nothing to write home about.

All in all an amazing meal. This is not a cheap night out, but if you can get a good double date going you'll find it pretty manageable. The ambience is nice (we had an unfortunate table of hoodied dudes arrive as we were leaving, but aside from that it was nice groups and couples) the service great and the meat is to die for. All in all, and easy Four Stars.",2013-01-06 15:22:54

Came here on a Thursday night at about 8 and it was really busy for the location I wouldn't really expect it to be that busy. We waited a few minutes for a table and once we were seated we began looking over the menu we decided to get the chicken tacos and and the nacho style chip and dip. We also ordered 50 Hot wings. And 2 orders of fries and 2 orders of potato wedges. 

The only reason Buffalo Wild Wings even deserves one star is the chicken Tacos because everything else was just plain old SHITYYYYY! The chicken tacos were good though but not good enough for me to return for. The nachos was disgusting like warmed up cheese wiz and warm soggy tortilla chips that were left in a car in the sun in the middle of August. Just all around gross.

Now onto the wings this place is called Buffalo Wild Wings and the wings were definitely not chicken wings more like quail wings. They were tiny so tiny like microscopic there was barely any meat on the bone. This place may be good if you like those nasty flavoured wings that really have no place in society. The fries and onion wings were the size of a McDonald's small fry for $3.75 how is that even logical overall Buffalo Wild Wings is a bad establishment who clearly has never gone to Buffalo and had wings. Come on people it's not that far cross the boarder and find out what real Buffalo chicken wings are like.

The food is really hit and miss. Generally It's pretty average but they have some dishes that are excellent too.

The pricing of the games in the arcade are done via a point system which makes it very difficult to know how much you're spending. On the flip side you have a play card that tracks all your tickets and points you can use over and over again refilling easy and tracking what you spent and earned.

The selection of the games in the arcade is pretty diverse, nothing ground breaking but they seem very well maintained with a lack luster prize selection.

Really glad they opened this new location. It's neat! Lots of space and comfy seating, free popcorn, a 5$ menu with Mac and cheese, everything a Justine needs to feel at home in a pub ( I don't drink so there's gotta be something else they offer). 

Our second Cards Against Tournament UYE was hosted here and it was great! We had two booths reserved and it was in a circular arrangement so it was perfect to play and eat. 

Ordered the Mac and cheese before people started arriving and it was standard. It came with a piece of toast which I found puzzling. 

Wish the popcorn came with small bowls instead of paper bags to carry back to your table.

LRHEOA7oqztlIVYerCdD3A,CYermXzVz9xmpwDM26vS2A,-hn7E7b3VwRjwhNEDgmGIQ,2,6,2,1,"On a recent breakfast outing, we ventured up 7th Avenue to try the recently opened Two Hippies Breakfast Joint. The concept is the newest of the Two Hippies ventures, which seem to be popping up all over midtown. Breakfast offerings include standards like French toast and waffles, a coconut-crusted hot jam sandwich, and breakfast bowls. Lunch selections include burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, and salads. Also available are vegan smoothies, an array of flavored lemonades, and the ever present soda fountain. 

 The breakfast bowl sounds pretty impressive- 3 eggs scrambled with a choice of 6 toppings selected from an extensive list of cheeses, veggies, sauces, and meats- but fell short of expectations. Three of us ordered the bowls, which come with Texas Toast and hash browns, and none of us were impressed. Sure, the scrambled egg mess was tasty, but the potatoes were bland, cubed, and definitely not hash browns. In short, the bowl is nothing special and it could have been done better at home. 

 Two Hippies do a few things right- the prices, the flavored lemonades, the waffle, and the mere existence of fried pickles on the menu. Unfortunately, there are so many more things that they need to improve here. The menu clearly states that lunch is served all day, but a request for lunch items was refused. All orders are packaged in to-go boxes, which is extremely wasteful. The dining area is so cluttered that it borders on claustrophobic. No credit/debit cards are accepted. Maybe they are still working out the kinks, which would explain things like messing up my order and taking ten minutes to find a knife for a customer.

We WERE heading to Pizza Pizza, then saw Subway... then realized this area actually has a bunch of better options now - it used to be a culinary wasteland! So this is good. Yay for you, West Queen West!!!

We had to choose between burritos, poutine, pub food, chain fast food, tapas... lovely to have so many choices! A very nice surprise. It was about 8 p.m. and everything was open - also nice to see this area bustling!

The menu at Fat Bastard Burrito is small but extremely customizable, consisting of burritos (Lil, Big or Huge sizes available), quesadillas, as well as sides like fries, onion rings, poutine (!?), corn on the cob, chips/salsa, chips/guac, etc. There are about 15 burrito options, ranging from sweet chili thai chicken, steak to battered fish and garlic shrimp. 

On the veghead side of things, I have been sadly disappointed at the available options at other burrito places - sooooo not the case here - quite the opposite - lots to choose from!
- roasted yam
- roasted veggies
- bean & cheese
- ""naked""

You choose your burrito, then start stuffing it! You choose from beans, rice, NOODLES (crazy! I've never seen this before, and it seems like an interesting fusion idea. I will definitely be trying the noodles next time! Apparently Chino Locos also has this offering, but I've never been!), guac, sour cream, salsa, pico de gillo, cheese, various veggies, sauces, you get the idea.

They offer deep-fried Mars or Snickers bars (!), freshly made tortilla chips, smoked ghost peppers you can take home, etc. Also worth mentioning is the MEXICAN COKE. Holy smokes... who knew there was such a difference? I'm telling you: TRY IT. The pico de gallo is also definitely worth mentioning - fresh and lovely! The tortillas seemed fresh and house-made, though we didn't ask.

The special of the day was Baja Chipotle Chicken - we were warned it's pretty hot, so stayed away for now. We hear a lot about the Tequila Lime Chicken - may be up next on the ""to try"" list.

Mr. Rosie S. ordered the Pulled Pork Burrito (""Big"" size) and you should have heard the noises he was making. Loved it. He said it was much, much, much more flavourful than the other burrito places we've tried (Burrito Boyz, Burrito Banditos, Hernando's Hideaway, etc.) in the city. I would agree, and add that the array of choices, the great texture and freshness, and the friendly staff put it above the rest by miles.

Anyway, once you've stuffed it, the meat goes in and they take it to the grill. 10 minutes later, it's chow time.

They cut the burrito in half (they asked first) - as he thought he'd only eat one half, claiming he wasn't very hungry... but it was so good he ate the whole thing!! Yumyumyum! I 

Other things to note: 
- take lots of napkins if you're leaving the place
- make sure to take advantage of the staff's wisdom on range of spiciness. You could get burned... so to speak...

In the mail this month we received an entire page full of the same Subway coupon: buy one 6 "" sub plus any drink, get one 6"" sub free. Basically this equates to a whole month's worth of buy one get one free eating, so how could we resist?

We were headed to an outdoor concert in the park and stopped in to pick up some healthy sandwiches. Our visit starts off by being cut off in the parking lot for a front-row-joe parking spot.. oh well I can always use the exercise... turns out the guy wasn't even going to Subway so I am not sure why he needed that exact spot. When we walked in there was guy #1 behind the counter helping a foreign couple with their order.  There was guy #2 sweeping the empty restaurant. We weren't greeted for a while because guy #1 behind the counter was overwhelmed trying to understand the order of the couple in front of us. They didn't speak English very well and had strange requests like adding an egg to their turkey sandwiches - but just one egg, split between two sandwiches.. he kept thinking they were trying to order an omelet. 

We didn't even realize there was a 3rd employee because he was hiding in the back, apparently too busy to come and help up. We weren't too upset about the wait, more humored by the strange order from the folks in front of us. Finally guy #1 behind the counter yells, ""Hey, what's your name?"" Guy #2 sweeping responds back with his name. Guy #1 then yells, ""You wanna come helps these two?"" To which guy #2 sweeping says, ""Yeah, just a sec."" We wait while he finishes sweeping and then washes his hands. He comes around the counter apologizes for the wait and takes our order. But it's apparent he's new because he doesn't know the names of the sandwiches (didn't understand when I ordered a black forest ham and turkey) and gets confused about how much meat comes on it, etc. He has to ask the guy #3 in the back for assistance. It was quite the process! We finally get our sandwiches made and I hand over the coupon. Guy #1 tells me the sandwich and drink are both free, but gets confused entering the coupon and also has to ask guy #3 for help. Turns out the drink was not free, so we buy the drink, take our sandwiches and walk out shaking our heads at what a hassle it was.

I'm sure we'll be back to use another coupon this month, but I'll make sure it's not on a day that I'm in a hurry.",2013-05-13 21:45:26

I was really impressed. 


I was happily surprised to find that Mabel's isn't' just a bakery. 
While they have a nice cross section of sweet baked goods, it also has a savory side.

I don't want to forget everything I just saw, so I'm going to break down my review in the sections of the store.


FRONT ENTRANCE// 
Front window - collection of fresh made bagels, buns and bread. 
I know little (nothing) about coffee/espresso, but I can say, they had a nice looking machine, that i'm sure produces some mighty-fine drinks. 
Drink menu included a simpler selection of espresso based drinks, and about the same number offerings of tea based ones.  

The Magical DISPLAY CASE// 
The items that caught my eye in the sweet section where: mini cheese cake, lemon bars, mini fruit pies (the crust looked incredible!), brownies, mini chocolate flourless cakes, butter tarts & cookies. 

Savory stuff: which includes fresh cheeses, beef empanadas, to meat pies, quiches (veg & meat based ones) and jarred preserves (beats, cauliflower, corn relishes, pears in red wine, strawberry, 

In the FRIDGE/FREEZER section//
Fresh squeezed orange juice, steak & mushroom pie, frozen fresh chicken stock (looked perfect), 

JACKPOT! They have about 5 different flavors of 1/2 litre Greg's ice cream (!!!).

I saw individual parfaits in the fridge, (like, the kind with chocolate pudding and whipped cream on top!!!) I gotta say, it looked amazing. I kinda wish I had picked one up when I was there. It looked so simple, but so yummy. Hell, who doesn't like a chocolate pudding parfait!? 

WHAT I BOUGHT:
chocolate chip cookies: perfect sized cookie. i'm not a fan of those super huge ones, so this is what initially attracted me to this little treat. It was soft and everything  a classic chocolate chip cookie should be. 
lemon bar; not too sweet and tangy. yum! 
beef empanadas; oh yum. Great crust, and the beef is flavorful and has a smidgen of heat to it.
mini cheese cake: the crust! it's crispy! it's amazing! nomnomnom ...
mac&cheese. meh. no go, and dumped it in the garbage after a couple of bites. It wasn't good at all.",2013-03-21 21:00:51

The name sounds like they are serving grandmas cooking then when you see the signage design looks like western with a Latina looking lady. Then when you enter the restaurant they have somewhat of a sushi bar. The paintings on the wall are seafood and when you look at the menu they have Japanese, Spanish, French, Korean, Italian cuisine. It's a fusion of everything. 

We ordered quite a few dish. Spicy Tuna Tartare with waffle fries do not complement with each other. It doesn't give you the distinct flavor of the tuna tartare with a fries. The ceviche is much better paired with sweet potato fries. You can taste the sweetness of the fries and the spicy flavor of the ceviche. The shishito pepper did not have much of a flavor. It is missing something. Hush puppies crab needs more crab and the deviled eggs are quite fine. The kimchi fried rice is very small for an entree. Also they don't give you bottomless lemonade which is quite odd. 

I would say this fusion restaurant is ok. I have not tried the other dish so it maybe better. I would suggest if you are going to order wine and you're in a group, a bottle is better price wise. We got the Jollie Folle Rose and surprisingly good.",2017-07-30 01:09:05

They've changed their menu a couple of times (to offer even LESS than their already bare food menu) and they are way overpriced. The only upside is that their martini menu offers a lot of choices.....
The staff...that's a whole other can of worms. The female bartenders/waitresses wear the typical Vegas uniforms of corsets and tight pants, big hair, and lots of makeup and what comes with that is the typical poor attitude. Friendliness is hit or miss because some are nice, some are not so I guess it depends on the luck of the draw whether you get your orders taken in a timely fashion or if it takes all night. *shrug*....The music depends on the night (the have various specialty nights: Ladies night, Latin night, etc.) and they often host private parties. The do have a decent happy hour which is the best time to actually go there so you don't feel completely jipped by the prices.....about a year or two ago, they started having Hookahs available, but they are overpriced as well...Guess that's all a part of being in a setting away from the swarms of tourists.

Everyone was eating wearing their jackets. There was a really loud group who sat and sat talking loudly and rude most of the time we were there. 
The food was OK but since it was barely warm it was hard to decide. I mentioned it to our waiter who said he would heat them up in the microwave. No thanks.

White rice was to come with both our entrees but we only got one order which was barely warm and then when we were packing our to go cartons, because who wants to eat cold food, they brought the other order which was hot, but we were leaving.

- a chef friend loved the puff pastry escargot

The carpeting seemed drab, though the lighting was a warm yellow glow.  I got sleepy just looking at the pics of dinner.

Will i return to dinner ? I think it is not worth to spend this much on seafood. Can give a try.
The lobster is deep fried, all I tasted was garlic , salty sauce and fried meat . I cannot recognize the taste of lobster . You can order steam.  The oil was excessively used on vegetables , we had veggie in soup but it is covered oil on the top. That could be improved.

We also ordered Maki combo A ($11.50) which featured a tasty california roll, a HUGE dynamite roll and a spicy roll that made my mouth happy! I enjoy a sushi place that doesn't skimp on the spicy in their rolls. Also? No mayonnaise to be seen so far. (Mayonnaise is the sushi kiss of death in my opinion.)

The stars are missing because this is still a new place, the menu is far and away from fleshed out, the seating is strange and the rolls are simple. Give them a few months and I'll re-review, but as it's the only game in town, I'm sure I'll be mosying my way through the menu soon enough.",2011-03-25 14:57:01
W9HoFQ2Jq2Rwz77Z2i-yzw,S6XOGg1gJ-5iNWj0Au-zgw,UByM7N0mF-ylIGUuIWHCtA,3,0,0,0,"My husband and I like to try higher end steakhouses, especially for special occasions.  I had not tried this restaurant before. So he made a reservation for my birthday. I think they have a good menu and the food was very good, I got the bone in ribeye and he got the salmon. Both were well prepared. As an appetizer we did the calamari which was quite good.

That is why I am giving them 3 stars.

My issue is that the service was LACKING for what one would expect at a higher end restaurant. We knew we were going to have an issue the minute we were sat across from a party of 16 celebrating a 50 th birthday. It was a week night, the restaurant was not crowded but for some reason they sat a large party near the front along with several other parties bunched up around  that table, including ours. IMHO they should have seated a party that large away from others. The party was fairly tame but there were times when we could not hear each other because as with any group there is going to be a lot of conversation, and some will be louder than others. I fault management for seating several parties so close together around a large group while other tables near the back sat empty. Doesn't make sense and doesn't enhance the dining experience.

Our waitress was one of the people attending that table. Every time, regardless of whether the restaurant is high end or low end, when we have had a server attending a large party, we have felt shortchanged on service and that was the case here. Our service was delayed the entire meal- from removal of dishes, filling of water glasses,  serving of food. When we asked the server about the table, she flippantly stated oh it was just a group celebrating a 50 the birthday not 20 somethings, so it should not get out of hand. I thought that was an odd comment to make, and somewhat offensive. I am not sure why she had to go there. IMHO her answer should have been, don't worry I'll take good care of you or offered to move us. 

My husband had advised that we were celebrating my birthday so she offered a free dessert from the menu- we did the warm chocolate cake which was good. He had planned to order coffee, but she left before he could even do so. Usually coffee is offered. She did not offer it. It felt like she was trying to wrap up us and get us out of there.  We paid the bill and when she returned his credit card, she thanked him by his first name!!  We felt that was unprofessional. Throughout the meal she had a very cavalier, casual attitude with us that I just didn't appreciate.

We chose not to make a scene in the dining area, but when we got to the hostess stand on the way out, we asked to speak to manager. A young manager came out to talk to us, apologized and offered his card with a promise of free drinks and appetizers at a future visit. I would try another steakhouse before coming back here.

dbWKRIc2PodDjjJanGnk3A,ZS_qdLMh1XyXKGTrpKM-4Q,kLTpxsoIhTaj1v6pYVyyiQ,4,2,3,2,"This was a belated birthday dinner for me and enjoyed it immensely.  We sat on the main floor which was a not too busy when we arrived but was quickly filling up.  The hostess let us know that a large group would be taking over the entire area (3 hours to go) and if we were still there when they arrived they would find us space over by the bar.  I've been known to linger but 3 hours seemed unlikley.  This did explain why we could only get a 515 reservation though.  Our server was fantastic.  Explained the specials, made some recommendations and mixed up a mean table side guacamole.  What stood out for me with the guac was the cilantro.  I've never had cilantro in guac and it lent a nice fresh bite to a dish I thought I knew.   D . had the bison tacos and I had the crispy snapper tacos.  We did a little mix and match and both were awesome.  The snapper was well cooked but moist and the tempura batter nice and light.  The slaw and dressing had a great tang that really complimented the fish.  The bison taco was kind of like a shredded beef taco but different....well of course its bison.  It was lean, the sauce was flavorful and the purple slaw and corn gave everything a nice a crunch.  The only drawback to our evening was the table.  We were seated a tall table for two on the main aisle whic is also narrow with 4 banquet tables right beside it.  The closeness to the  banquet  tables was painfully obvious when two women arrived to join two already at the table.  Everyone stood up to hug and greet each other all right in front of our table.  It interruped our conversation and was as if they were joining us.  I appreciate you may have close quarters and have sat at my fair share of tiny tables that you have to pull out to be seated at but this was just too close and thought I was next for the ""air kiss"".  I never like tall tables because I am short and my legs are often not long enough for my feet to rest on the rail of the chair.  This means my feet dangle and I end up feeling like a little kid and the big kids table.  It also means my feet end up going numb.  I would definitely go back as the food and service were great.  I would just ask for a low table next time.",2014-12-07 06:52:32

uWjy-wfhiCaZvsySuYegHg,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,4,2,0,1,"Finally got to try this place out. Granted it was later along during their soft opening than I had wanted but unfortunately due to scheduling and what not, this was what i had to do.

Came here on 11/19/17 for their soft opening invited as a special guest. No its not because im a Yelp Elite or anything. It was open to anyone who wanted to sign up online on their web site, then contacted later to ""reserve"" for the date and time you wanted. Granted with this, each person who ""RSVP'ed"" got a free entree of their choice, a free mini bowl of their choice, and 2 tempura of their choice as well. With a check-in on Yelp, you get a free drink ! Unfortunately, they had to change their ""policy"" a little and ""limited"" how much you could order as a RSVP'ed guest. Another friend who had came here in the beginnings of the soft opening, he was allowed to order more than 1 entree. More of this later ! 

Had a friend who came here at 11 and said the kitchen was confused and was really behind. By the time i got there at 12, anyone that was ahead of me, outside the door, had about 30 minute or so wait time. Upon entry of the restaurant, to the left is a pretty large dining area with a lot of tables/seating. Directly in front of you, wax samples of the food available on their menu. Very popular style you see at almost any restaurant in Japan. People love seeing examples. Its like a life-version of the food. To the right, is the area you order/pay. Based on a U-shape kitchen, you'll instantly see the area where a person is preparing the dough and putting it through the machine which cuts the udon. Beside him, another person is working the large built-in cooking the freshly prepared udon. After it is cooked, it is cooled and portioned. All this is to prepare for the ""ordering"" station where each bowl is made specific to order. The layout/order of the kitchen reminds me of Marukame Udon in Honolulu, HI. Price wise, very similar as well. I was getting super excited ! 

By the time we had gotten to order, we were told #4 Kamatama, #7 Ontama Bukakke, and #16 Clam udon were all unavailable. BUZZKILL ! Apparently they were out of clams and eggs. According to the owner, Henry, who was also helping in the kitchen, and his girlfriend running food, he stated the eggs are directly from Japan. The eggs are a specific type which is from a vegetarian organic chicken which provides eggs that you can eat raw in Japan. Sad ! The friend who came 1 hour prior had gotten the egg, but an hour later, they were out. SO SAD ! He said it was super good too ! Was planning ordering 2 udons too ! Since my friend is not too much of a fan of creamy udons, i opt'ed to get the Mentai Cream Udon #12. Since its a cream udon, it has to be prepared on order, which will be delivered to you when ready at your table. I had asked about if i could do extra noodles (Not to Henry but to the worker preparing the udon orders) but he gave me the reply something like ""because of a specific amount of cream we use to cook the cream udons, it would not be as flavorful as the normal one"". Yes that makes sense but ... cant you use more cream? Yeah there is a specific amount for a normal order, but cant you put more? I didn't ask for more mentaiko (though that would be nice) but cream is fairly inexpensive. This answer didn't really make sense to me. In the end, i opt'ed out of the extra noodles. SAD ! 

I had also ordered a Miso Garlic Pork Belly rice bowl. After, you arrive at the tempura station with a variety of tempura ranging from pumpkin, fish cake, kakiage, chicken, shrimp, sweet potato and fresh made onigiri (rice balls). On their list, they list like 8 different onigiri but when i went, there was only 3 styles left. Mainly the konbu (salted seaweed), spam, and mentaiko (last one took by my friend). We asked if they had more, and got the answer of ""we only have what we got. All are fresh and not kept to keep its freshness"". 

Paying took quite the long time. The girl who worked the cashier was still not that familiar with the system and took her time. As said before though, free drink with yelp check in, giving you access to their ""Drink Station"".

The ""Drink Station"" includes 2 fruit teas, house special lemonade, a pyramid of italian flavored syrups, water, and a coke machine. I didn't try the other stuff. Their lemonade was pretty good. Not too sweet. Not too tart. If anything, its milder than most lemonades out there. It kind of reminds me of yuzu. Mildly tart but sweet. Was really yummy. I drank a lot !

Food amount seemed very small, because they use HUGE bowls. Its like those expensive restaurants using a nice plate and giving you a bite of food. For some reason though, the Seafood Tomato Cream, was MUCH larger than any other udon i had seen this day. I've sen multiple orders of the Seafood Tomato Cream and seemed like it was probably twice the amount as any other udon. Mentaiko was really delicious. Udon was super soft. Need more al dente. No chew/bite at all. SAD !",2017-11-20 17:41:56

q3ybT6ukLFPJjdeJNwC7Dw,0SbZc-oRoMiVtrZjxcIDUg,_WvEXsx2eZ53lTWHlIx9kg,2,2,0,0,"I have been to Blue Hound five times now, once just for cocktails and four times to eat dinner, so I figured it was time to review it.  I really want to like the Blue Hound, and I know people that do like it, but it has three big problems.  1) The service is too slow  2) it takes itself WAY too seriously (which leads back to #1) and 3) the plates are USUALLY tiny for the price (and there is too much variation in sizes between similarly priced items, so you never know what you're going to get.   Let me expound.  I have no problem with hipsters.  I live downtown, it comes with the territory.  I like the buzzwords ""crafted"", ""local"", and the such.  That said...

The Blue Hound has good cocktails.  Good, very expensive, very slow to arrive cocktails.  The ingredients are quality and the drinks are inventive, but $10-$15 is just too much.  I also would rather get mine quickly than watch your bartender painstakingly shave off the Mona Lisa of ice cubes and perform other elaborate rituals.  Also, and the food suffers from this too, the description of the drink is way too preciously obtuse to actually divine what is in it.  Here's an example: last night Sweet Pea ordered something called Thirstn Howl (pardon my spelling.)  It listed the ingredients, and one of them was something called banane something or other that nobody has ever heard of before.  So, you expect it to have banana.  This thing came out and it was a banana milkshake.

The food, well- the food.  Again, I'm a vegetarian, so take that for what it is.  Blue Hound doesn't have a true veg entree, but they have a lot of veg options in their small plates.  I believe that one time when I was there, they did have a veg entree, a risotto or something, but that has somehow fallen by the wayside.  I would like to see it come back.  Anyway, the problem with the veg plates is that they are too small for a single person to eat one for dinner (and I don't eat a lot), so you have to order a couple. And then the variation between plate sizes is all over the map, so you have to either ask your server or you have to cross your fingers. The time before last that I went there, I asked my server if the Panzanella salad was enough for me as my only food for dinner.  He said oh yes!  It came out, and it was a very small bowl filled with 98% hard, tasteless croutons.  The ""artichoke, fava beans, burnt baby leeks?""  Again- it is hard to tell what it's going to be from that description, but there were 3 small pieces of each.  

Last time I was there, I tried the roasted cauliflower based on good Yelp comments, and the collard greens salad (because I love collard greens), and I have to admit- they were my favorite things I've had there.  Although, the collard green salad was VERY salty, and both were too oily (which is something that I find in general with BH's food.)  The two of them together were enough for me for dinner, but as I said- the plates there are small.  And pricey.  And all over the place in terms of relative size, and you can't tell what you're going to get.  

I've been with a lot of people and seen a lot of different things ordered.  Lots of people get the ribs and like the ribs, and that's a big plate. Unfortunately, last time we were there, Sweet Pea (a notorious carnivore and lover of meat) got the ribs and said that he felt sick all the next day, and they were just ""OK.""  He asked for extra blue cheese on the grits and got a ""well...I can ask..."" from the server.  When it came out, there was a big production of saying ""with the EXTRA blue cheese"", but Sweet Pea said he couldn't taste it, and the grits were very bland (I heard that from too others that ordered the same on the same night also.)  I've also seen someone order the scallops, which came up strangely lined up with no accoutrement on the very outer edge of a very large, oval plate, which only emphasized how little food she was getting for $20.  The food comes out VERY slow.  

Service:  I've seen no earlier than 45 minutes and as long as 1.5 hours to get the food.  That's kind of a bummer.  It would be better if my cocktails were quicker to arrive and not so costly.

Anyway, I think I'm done with the Blue Hound.  I really really REALLY wanted to like it.",2014-05-11 00:03:10

I love how they have converted and renovated this place to be a nice new casino. It's attached right next to the Flamingo and in a great spot on the strip.

The whole place feels upbeat and had terrific rock music playing along with the prerequisite Jimmy Buffet tunes.

Had no problem getting drinks as cocktail waitresses were always coming by and they are served up by cuties in bikinis! Even the crowd gambling here seemed more happy than at other casinos.

One thing I did notice is that this casino is on the smaller side, with a nice selection of the newest slot machines to go along with the standard table games, but not that many of them. It's a great spot to drop in to have a few drinks, gamble a bit, and begin your night of carousing. They even still have the outside balcony area overlooking the strip that you can drink on and people watch and make catcalls to the sexy ladies and gents passing by.

In the back of the store, there is an entrance to their backyard, which was definitely my favorite part of the store. It was beautiful- fountains, exotic plants, gorgeous hanging baskets... really beautiful and relaxing. My mom and I wandered around smelling the flowers and admiring all of the plants. One thing to know and prepare for would be their very high prices.. There were many hanging baskets that were over $100 each. The one item I saw that was pretty reasonably priced and I considered purchasing was a bouquet of dried lavender, for $10.

Their food is also needlessly spicy, even if you order it extremely mild.  I'm not talking curry dishes, I'm talking simple stir fry.  So, if you don't want a fire in your mouth, you have to stick to fried rice or bland noodle dishes. 

Thursday night at 8:30 with a half-full restaurant and it took about an hour from the time we walked in the door until our entrees arrived.  From our table we had a view of the kitchen where only one person was cooking, and at a snail's pace.  Clearly this cook has never worked in a restaurant before.  You can take your time slicing pretty pineapple garnishes and arranging spring rolls in martini glasses when you are at home, or when you are adequately staffed, but when you have tables of people waiting for food, you need to learn to step it up.

I ordered the charlot, a pastry made with ladyfingers, vanilla custard and topped with fruit, and was stunned to see it cost $5.75.

I walked in for my 5:40 appointment & was immediately told there was a small delay, say around 5 minutes.  While I waited I was able to take in this 3 day old store.

This location is so huge & so much brighter than Southpark. Naturally, the layout is basically the same.  The employees are much friendlier, too.

Unfortunately, when my 5 minute wait turned into 40 minutes :( - the ""check in"" associate kept me informed every so often. As my recent experience @ the Southpark location, they seem to underestimate the time it takes for Geniuses to look over iPads, iPods & iPhones.  When I finally did get seen by my Genius, he was patient & did not rush me.  He talked to me ""one on one"" about my issue (which thankfully I only needed a hard reset of my iPhone) & actually did the reset there.  Afterwards, he checked my phone out to make sure it worked & I was happy with the resolution.

Horrible horrible horrible....once again servers walk right past me. Or they are running through so fast that they don't even give me a chance to flag them down. 

What is the deal with getting drinks while you are spending money like they used to??? 

I might as well go to tribal casinos where I have to pay for drinks because that way I wouldn't feel so bad for complaining but it's seriously ridiculous. Servers are pointless. Why do they have them if they seem to pick and choose who they give drinks to. I spend quite a bit of money in stations casinos so if it's because they think I'm not spending enough...how do they know?? 

So, I use my card to check the perks at the kiosk. There was a guy using one in front of me. Something seemed to go wrong because it cut his sessions short and then the card wouldn't work. He tried several times but left. Then, the same thing happened to me. While trying to access the multiplier, it cut out and my card wouldn't work. So, I head to walk all the way to the players card desk. 

First problem, some guy cuts right in front of me and not one employee stopped him. They helped him. I saw he was president but so am I. Not cool. Then, the guy that finally did help me had a really bad attitude and his manager MICHAEL was standing right there and did nothing. The employee was telling me I had to enter a pin code But I didn't want to. So, I asked him if he was making me change my code or just to enter to verify. He got upset and threw up his hands like I was supposed to know what the heck was going on. He repeated to me again to enter my pin and again I asked him if I was supposed to enter a new one or my old one and the gut couldn't answer. It was really frustrating to ME but the guy was acting like I'm the one bothering him!!?? And still, Michael the manager, was standing right there and did nothing. So, I actually stepped aside and asked him to assist because I was confused and my patience was running out with this guys attitude. 

I still don't even know what happened but I guess I changed my pin...no one told me why or anything. 

This is what makes me not want to spend any money in casinos. I'm already losing my money, So, can you at least talk with a smile and do your Damn job when it's needed?? I really don't appreciate bad attitudes towards me when I'm the customer or for any reason, for that matter.",2018-03-07 00:52:03

Unfortunately, the food at Kenzo was a disappointment. The Orochong Ramen ($8.95) was not flavorful. The supposedly Hokkaido favorite topped with stir fried green onions, green peppers, red peppers, mushrooms, chicken and cabbage was over powered by salt. 

Takoyaki (around $9.00) filled with octopus, green onion, cheese and shrimp flavouring was doughy. It lacks the crispy exterior one comes to expect from Takoyaki. 

Chicken Karaage (around $7.00) traditional Japanese fried chicken was one of the worst dishes we had that day. What is supposedly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside was spongy on both counts. How Kenzo managed to create such an abomination is beyond my comprehension.  

There is an endless loop of 90s heart-wrenching music playing the background in Kenzo. One speculation was that the chef was crying in the back kitchen. The sodium from his/her tears was incorporated in the soup and perhaps also contributed to the soggy Karaage.",2015-01-06 03:27:44

That's usually a clue that a restaurant is good as the chef is implying they will make the food just right and just how it should be tasted.

We have ordered nearly all of the most recent menu and remain impressed. Some highlights include the beef tartare, oyster po' boy, mussels, and Mac and cheese. They all hit the spot and provide a combination of flavor and texture. And, as the expectation is set, it is well appropriately seasoned.

Overall, definitely one of the winners of Madison dining. Hope you enjoy!",2017-09-01 01:11:30

The hand stretched also appears to be a little larger, and is more filling than the thin crust, so it's good to share.

Imagine my surprise when they had a window from BD to Old Angle! Perfect! And, the bartender at Old Angle welcomed us to eat our sandwiches at the bar. 

We both ended up ordering the Philly - although the Clevelander looked pretty amazing too. 

Here's the deal: You can order ""crunch"" or ""no crunch"" - meaning do you want kettle chips thrown on? Then, you have your jus options: Soaked, Wet, or Dry. If you get dry - they still give it to you on the side. We both ordered wet. It was a bit messy - but so good, I almost wished I ordered the ""soaked"" version. 

The meat was juicy and roasted in-house. None of that luncheon meat stuff you'll get most other places. They also have a house cheese sauce - that you could probably slather on any of the sandwiches because its THAT good. I wish I would have asked for extra. YES - it's THAT good.

The brunch menu is pretty solid, with a variety of savory entrees (scramblers) as well as pancakes. There is full service at the bar, and it wasn't busy at all so we ate there. The atmosphere is cute, hard to describe but probably best described as ""modern American"" or ""upscale family style"". You can definitely tell it's a newer spot.

We ordered scramblers with a side of cheesy grits. There isn't gluten free bread, but the servers/bartenders are knowledgeable about gluten free options. The food arrived fairly fast. It it was very mehhh. Not bad, but not super flavorful either. For what you pay it didn't seem worth it.

The staff and owners were very accommodating to us and friendly as well as inviting. The atmosphere is upscale although the space it occupies feels a little cramped. The food itself was excellant and while a little pricey I didn't feel like it under delivered. The one area it lacked in was service. According to one of my friends who had been there before we must have caught them on a off night but non the less service was terrible. I'd recommend it to anyone who lives in the Ballantyne area but not highly to anyone who has to travel more than 20 minutes to get there. If it weren't for the service I'd go 4 stars but I'll have to stick with my 3 star rating with the quality of food and value being the saving grace of the evening.,2010-03-17 15:18:13
dXarwnvsKEjkfdY7h12NBA,gxVQZJVeKBUk7jEhSyqv-A,WfroD4iB5M1nFw8j8iwAdA,1,9,1,4,"Went to Arizona Auto Wash and had one of the worst consumer experiences in years. 

I was taking my mom's minivan in to get washed so there was a $1 upcharge. Fine.  I bought The Works wash. That is 2 grades up from their basic wash. Cost me $18.99 + tax. That's not like super cheap for a car wash, right? Could expect something? Or maybe I'm way off base.

The Works supposedly includes the basic wash, sealer wax, triple foam polish, tire dressing, air freshener, clear coat polish, deep clean dash/console/cup holders, exterior dressing, dress dash and console w/SunGuard protective coating.

So it's a minivan and we borrowed it for a trip to Flagstaff & the Grand Canyon. We have 2 little kids so went for the higher end wash. Needed a bit of TLC. Some debris on the carpet, some drippage in the cup holders, etc.

So watched the van come out of the wash and pull up to the wipe down location. Sat there for quite a while. Was even thinking that it was taking a long time but maybe they take a long time so you think you're getting your money's worth. I did notice the main guy on the car going back to the dash over and over and over again.  Then to the front windshield over and over again. Kind of seemed like he was milking it, which is fine (as long as the car was clean).

Well I had my tip ready and walked up to the car and figured I'd just check it out before handing it over.  Once I looked in, I went from surprised to frustrated to outright bitter.  

The windows weren't super clean. Ok fine. Windows are a pain in the rear to clean perfectly. 

There was debris, loose debris, all over the floor. I also get that stuff gets stuck in the carpet. This was not that.  Cup holders were full of debris. One of the main reasons to upgrade to ""the Works"" was to get the cup holders at least a once over. Both middle row chairs had been folded down. Of course they didn't bother to open them up and check. Loose debris all over the seat.

There was spillage on the walls in the back by the cup holders (kids) and spillage on the leather strip at the bottom of the sliding doors on each side. Now I don't expect them to go crazy for $20 but they didn't even try. 

I ended up grabbing a rag and spending 10 minutes cleaning and wiping down the car myself.

Then I drove back over to the vacuum station and asked them to turn it on.  I spent another 5 minutes vacuuming the car. I did a little extra (pulled up the floor mats and such) but I definitely didn't expect that.  I at least expected them to get up the loose debris on the carpet, not the stuck stuff that you have to suss out with the vacuum head.

Of course when I got home later and looked in the trunk area, that hadn't been touched either.

The dash they spent so much time pretending to wipe was a mess as well. Blotchy uneven application of who knows what. Some areas had no coverage & others were almost wet.

When I was vacuuming the car, the manager on duty came over and I told him I was bitter. Told him what wasn't done and what I was doing. He took a look and agreed that it wasn't a good job.  He asked if I wanted someone else to do it. I said no and kept on.  

When I was pulling out, he was standing around, didn't come up again. I drove over to him & again said I couldn't believe the quality of their work. He said next time I come, tell them his name and say he said I could get a free wash.  Sweet.

The other thing that's such a disappointment is that I've been going to this car wash for years and  years. It has been a good while since the last visit though. You can definitely tell something happened with the ownership. Lousy work and complete lack of concern. It even extends to the inside store area, looks quite run down.",2009-06-09 00:41:53

At first glance i wasnt sure this was going to turn out good. There's a huge commercial sized dumpster almost blocking the front of the place so from an approaching angle all you see is the dumpster. The dumpster belonged to the hydroponics place next door.

The AYCE for dinner was 25.95, tea was included as well as some limited ice cream or mochi.

I thought the menu was a bit limited compared to other AYCE sushi joints but the size of the place and having only a handful of staff it made sense to keep the menu to winners only.

Anything that had slices of green onions i either took off or requested they not top off with, mainly for the reason that the green onions werent fresh, they were dry and a bit wilted. 

One big disappointment is their lack of a seared tuna dish. I asked and the waitress kind of understood where i was going and brought back what she took as 'cajun albacore' pretty much lightly seasoned albacore sashimi on rice with ponzu sauce poured over it. Nothing like i was expecting so i stopped asking.

The Dynamite they did a great job on. Possibly the best i've had in vegas so far. My buddy ordered it i tried a few pieces and it was pretty...dynamite...

Things i'd recommend:
Dynamite, Green Mussel, Cucumber Salad, Kimmy Roll, Ninja Roll, SSS Roll, Tiger Roll, Elephant Roll, Sashimi Roll, Tuna Carpaccio (i call it the tuna salad)",2010-11-29 22:29:44

Miguel kept the name, his partner kept the location and renamed it Mr. Mesquite. That brings us to the present.

This time, instead of going into the restaurant for dim sum, we ordered Chinese takeout.  The soups were meh.  Neither the wonton nor the hot and sour soup had much flavor.  

Next came the entrees.  For our family dinner night, we ordered Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken entrees.  Neither of the kids cared much for the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  They said it ""tasted funny.""  They didn't even want to put on the sweet, sticky red sauce that came in a big container on the side.  And what kid doesn't love that?  That's never been an issue before.  My partner had the Orange Chicken which looked and tasted like chicken covered in the exact same red sweet & sour sauce.  He, too, was not thrilled.  Mine was the Sesame Chicken.  It, too, came in what looked like the EXACT SAME red sweet & sour sauce with a few (a very few) sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  I've never had Sesame Chicken that wasn't in a flavorful BROWN sauce and covered in sesame seeds.  Mine, too, was practically flavorless.  The accompanying rice they gave us was pretty dry and sticky.  Lastly, there were no fortune cookies to finish off a below-average meal.  

To top it all off, the restaurant had apparently significantly raised the prices on everything since the last take-out menu we had on hand.  So, when picking up the order, we paid more than expected and the quality was practically non-existent.  

Dim Sum is OFF our list FOREVER for both take-out and dine-in.  As our once-president once said, ""Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again.""",2013-10-07 13:28:41

We've been coming here for a couple times a year for a couple years now. We always remarked how quick the service is and how super friendly the staff is.

Never drove that way before, so that was cool.
 The place was empty. One very friendly gal took my to go order and we chatted a bit.  Sat in the shadow of a cheesy framed poster of Cleveland from what I can only assume was the Hopkins airport periodical shop from 1988. Watched the sun come up on our sleepy burg through the window. Charming.
 Food was ready(gyro omelet, my usual, and two eggs two-hotcakes for the wife). I was given an even friendlier sendoff with bags full of butter, salt, utensils, etc. That's when I had an epiphany. Cleveland girls are the most beautiful girls in the known universe. No pretense, no sense of superiority. The same goes for this diner. Just homey and down to earth as possible.

Who doesn't love black sesame?! The sauce was overly salty this time and I just wish that it came as the same time as my rice so I could mix all the leftover sauce in.  My other go to is the kinoko bibimbap (rice, mushrooms, cheese with seaweed sauce in a sizzling stone bowl).  Comes out piping HOT and then they mix everything together for you.  This combo I know sounds weird but honestly it's my fav dish here.  The best is when you leave the rice on the sides of the bowl untouched so at the end the rice becomes crispy :D

Drinks are not free, as if you want to have a HK style tea or other hot drinks there are an additional of 65 cents. I might passed on that as the tea was kind of lukewarm and lack the taste.

It has a nice interior and a patio in the back that would be great during cooler weather. I was greeted promptly and advised of how to order. You stand in line at the register and place your order and they give you a number and bring your food to the table. I'm not a real big fan of this style of ordering but the process did seem to go quickly. Since I was waiting on my friend I decided to order the chips/salsa/guacamole for $3.50. It was okay however I really wished there had been more guacamole. The salsas had a good flavor and none of them seemed to be really spicy. I ordered 3 tacos as I knew from reading the previous reviews that they were small. I probably would have been fine with just 2 (since I had been snacking on the chips) but I couldn't decide on which ones so I went ahead and went for 3. I ordered the fish, the carnitas, and the carne asada.  All are served with the traditional onions, cilantro, and limes. Hands down my favorite was the carnitas. I just wish there had been more meat in it. The little tablespoon or so just didn't fill up the corn tortilla it was in. The fish was okay but just had too much breading in my opinion. I prefer my fish tacos grilled and unfortunately they do not offer that option. And the carne asada had a good flavor but unfortunately I encountered a giant piece of fat/gristle in my 2nd bite of it and it kind of ruined it for me after that. They only serve bottled soft drinks and bottled iced tea (Pure Leaf) and if you want to add sweetener to your iced tea then you have to make do with their simple syrup from the bar which I despise. So at this point I doubt I will be back anytime soon as I thought the prices for each of the tacos was pretty steep ($3.50-$3.75 each) and I can think of a lot of other places to get street tacos at a better price.",2018-06-01 14:16:26

3.  Food - Interesting selection of ban chan, sushi, other bits and pieces. My kids liked them all.  The bbq meats and seafood could have been much better labeled per type of meat. Instead, there were generic labels - Seafood, Pork, Chicken, Beef.

4.  Cleanliness - Come on , this is an asian restaurant, so we have to focus on the cleanliness.  While I did not like the oddly ""cleaned"" grill inset, once they covered it with a clean oiled grill, I was able to ignore what was ""lurking"" beneath the grill.

5.  Food Choices -  Forgot to mention the food choices were plentiful and just about right. 

Overall, the place was pretty good for plenty of AYCE bbq.  I like the style and atmosphere of Mothers, but they do not do AYCE.

Nice place if you are hungry for a lot of meat!",2012-04-03 07:00:20

I am obsessed with this place! As much as you feel yourself getting stronger and leaner, the routine never gets easier. I have been attending since the end of March and the instructors always add ways to make the exercises more difficult to challenge your body every time! 

It is the perfect place for toning! I recently completed the 30-day challenge and was able to see a 4% body fat decrease (without focusing on dieting). My entire body has become leaner. 

The instructors will keep you coming back! And although I have my favorites, I haven't found one that I don't like. They all have great ways of motivating and challenging you to get the most out of your workout!

Pure Barre is open 365 days out of the year and offers several times that can fit your schedule. I know, as my schedule has varied greatly over the past few months and I'm always able to find a time to go. Lastly, your membership applies to Chandler, Scottsdale and Phoenix locations!

If you're new, definitely give the New Client Special a try ($100 for the month). I have been fortunate to run into several specials since starting at Pure Barre in March and have yet to pay the full monthly price.",2013-08-06 02:33:12

Service was good and apparently I should have hitted on the hostess because from what my friends supposedly said, she was giving me the eye. Call is modesty, I didn't believe it. She was cute though. Kind of reminded me of a girl who I lost my..... nevermind.

Mind you, the sushi rolls they've come up with are not especially creative and I find that far too many of them have fillers like cream cheese that I'm just not looking for. (If I wanted shmear on my salmon, I'd have a bagel.) But it does have some redeeming qualities. The menu is very very long but you can pretty much skip the whole middle section because, although they list many Vietnamese options, these are not their forte. You'd do better to go down the street to one of the many Pho restaurants in Plaza or Eastland. 

There are a few of the sushi rolls which I do like a lot, but I find it difficult to find multiple I really want each time. The seaweed salad is delicious, and the in-restaurant serving is generous, but the take-out serving (although the same exact price) always leaves me wishing I hadn't paid for it. 

I'd say the most economical thing to order at Akahana is by far the soup. They're very reasonably priced (I love the egg drop and my husband always goes for the wonton) and they come in HUGE bowls, perfect for warming you up on a chilly day.

The first disconcerting thing is that the perspective on the frescoes on the wall is just subtly off enough to give you vertigo the moment you walk into the dining area. Starting off the meal with a faint sense of ill-ease doesn't help the experience. They have beautiful white cloth tablecloths on the table - they cover that with a big sheet of paper, which totally detracts from the ambiance. 

Then came our waiter. I don't know if he had left his girlfriend in the walk-in freezer mid-stroke and was anxious to get back to her, but he was about halfway through our drink order before he was already running away. I almost had to shout across the dining area to get him to hear that both of us wanted a drink, and not just my wife. He disappeared for a long time, and resurfaced after I'd decided, forgotten, and re-decided what I wanted to eat.  We put in our order, he disappeared. He returned a reasonable amount of time later with our carpaccio.

The carpaccio was, quite simply, delicious. However, at any of the other highly-priced Italian restaurants in this city, for the same price, we'd get about double. I expected better; at this point, I was already regretting not going to Scarpetta or The Grotto. Once we finished that, they brought out the bread. Normally, in other restaurants, that comes before the appetizer, but, hey, however they want to do it. 

I ordered the Tortellini Abbruzzese. It had a nice flavor, but could have benefited from using prosciutto instead of sausage. A stylistic choice of the chef with which I don't agree, I'm sure, but it would have made it more enjoyable to me. That said, I still enjoyed it. 

My wife, however, ordered the Linguine Mediterranean. The seafood in it was probably fresh three days prior to us ordering it; by the time it arrived at our table, however, it had a distinctly Billingsgate odor and taste. It was not pleasant. At $22 for a pasta dish, I expect fresh seafood in it. Fortunately, when we got home and gave the three-fourths of it that we had left over to the dogs, they were ok with it. And, of course, my wife won't be happy until I point out that, unlike other quality Italian restaurants, they gave us that nasty Kraft Parmesan-substitute cheese, instead of some fresh-grated Romano or something else of note. Again, the disconnect between what they pretend to be and how they execute is staggering. It's like they're trying to be Olive Garden at Batali prices. It doesn't make sense. 

Finally, the waiter, whose conspicuous absence the whole evening was keenly felt, came back and tried to get all chummy with us to order desert. If he'd interacted with us in any way, I'd not have felt my skin crawl during the interaction; however, since he had reacted to us as if we had leprosy from the moment we sat, it came across as smarmy and car-salesman-y.  

I hated every second I was in the place, and cannot understand the glowing reviews this place gets. Since I can't imagine that all of the other reviewers are idiots, it really MUST have been just an off night last night. Too bad it was SO far off that they will never get a chance to prove that to me. I wouldn't even accept a free meal from them. 

If you are looking for a good night out of high-quality Italian food, hit up the places where Scott Conant and Mario Batali have restaurants. If you want a smaller name, hit the Grotto at Golden Nugget. If you want cheap and edible, go to Olive Garden or Strings. If you want to drop a ton of cash on stuff that my kids could knock together in our kitchen, go to Fellini's.",2013-02-25 02:09:52

Pros:
Good value
Quick Service

Cons:
Little Greasy

Was trying to find somewhere close to eat and landed here. I had seen it on DDD before but have learned that doesn't mean great food.. just.. interesting food. I have no real complaints. The service was quick, the prices were low, the food was decent. The whole experience was just above average. With so many other great places in the valley I an unlikely to make a return visit anytime soon.

Onto the food:

Chile Relleno:
The sauce was great, the breading held up pretty well. It was slightly undercooked so the pepper was still very stiff. Had to hack away at it with a plastic knife to cut a piece. As usual it was filled with cheese.. and unusually filled with diced potato. This was a new one and I'm not sure what it really added to the dish. Initially I thought maybe just extra filler to cut down on the cheese needed, but there was plenty of cheese. Good but far from the best.

Hard Shell Tacos:
This place is known for its street tacos. So just stay away from the hardshells. You'll be glad you did.

Street Tacos:
Carne Asada:
There was a lot of bold seasoning going on here. Street tacos are notoriously two/three bite'ers so I didn't really get to break it apart. If I went back I think I might get a burrito to really get a good amount of the carne. I sometimes worry when things are so obviously heavy seasoned that they may be covering something up.

Al Pastor:
Very strong citrus flavor. Almost like the marinade was made with fresh juice that had been cooked down and condensed. It was very salty and pretty greasy.

Carnitas:
Not to bad.. Had a decent flavor but again was a little over salty/greasy.

Rice:
Decent

Beans:
Really liked these. They were very rich and creamy but still with some whole bean texture. I'm not sure they can taste that good without lard but I suppose its possible. I've never been afraid of lard anyway ;)

Cheese Quesadilla:
Flour tortilla filled with mexican white queso. Was decent but nothing to super special.

Green Salsa:
Bold, spicy, and very heavy tomatillo flavor.

They have refreshments in the lobby and the whole place is dog friendly. The location is also prime, right in the heart of Scottsdale. It gets loud on the weekends! Old Town and Camelback Mountain are short drives away, and plenty of places are within walking distance as well.

I liked their BBQ pork with rice. Their sauce and toppings complimented the rice very well.

Ramen: I liked how they cooked their egg. Not too soft and not too hard. And their pork slices had a nice balance of meat and fat. However, I wasn't a big fan of their noodles and broth. The noodles were very similar to the wavy egg noodles I used to buy at a grocery store in Japan. It was just unremarkable. And I felt that their broth lacked depth and flavour.

I do however want to come back for their non-ramen items since their BBQ pork with rice was nice.

The staff was very nice and attentive.",2018-05-10 18:13:50

It's got a really cool vibe inside, contemporary gothic, and a farm-to-table mantra that seems authentic.  The beverage program features trendy wines on tap which are an excellent value.  There are standard starters and entrees and a seasonal menu featuring more starters and entrees.  My large group got to try a number of items.  We did not have dessert.

Good:
French Onion soup - decent.
Fried oysters - Delicious!  These are not on the menu but are apparently always available.  Fresh oysters are on the menu but were not available that night.
Deviled egg with crispy pork belly and pickled cucumber - ok, but why not just say bacon and pickles?  I see, for $2 each, it's crispy pork belly and pickled cucumber!
Chef's market steak (NY strip) - nicely prepared.
Cedar planked salmon - good, not great.
Fried brussels sprouts, spiced maple aioli - tasty.

Not so good:
Butternut squash bisque with maple foam and roasted butternut squash seeds - soup was good but the squash seeds weren't husked so they were chewy and bitter.  Would have been much better to just use roasted and husked pumpkin seeds.
Slow roasted pork belly - the meat was tough and the cornbread stuffing was cold.
Mushroom bolognese - this dish was strangely light (as in not hearty) and was not served with any grated cheese and when we asked for some, it took so long to get it the dish had become cold.

Service was great up front but then became scarce.  Where were you in our time of grated cheese need?",2016-11-12 22:34:29

My doctor sent over my prescription to this location electronically 10 minutes prior to my arrival. Since I was so used to how slow the pharmcist service was at Walgreen (specifically the one located at Alma school & Germann), I didn't even bother pulling up the drive way expecting my meds to be ready. I parked my car and walked up to the pharmist slowly. I planned on letting them know that I was here at the store (aka please hurry up with it). During the meantime, I was thinking about what I could possibly do that this store while waiting.....

To my surprise, they already bag up my meds and had it ready to go. I was so shock and impressed. Also, the pharmist who went over the instruction with me was super nice. Within 5 minutes tops, I was in and out of there.

I started worrying about what was happening, and when he was done he didn't give me a receipt. I asked, ""Can I please have a receipt?"" and he replied, ""It's totally messed up"" and sort of threw his hands in the air. OKAY ....

We got there at 8 PM on a Thursday night and the restaurant was fairly empty but as the night went on it started to fill up. The decor is very aesthetically pleasing and the whole restaurant much brighter than you would think from the outside. The feel inside was much like that of a trendy Vegas restaurant with dance music playing loud enough to drown out background noises but not so loud as to not be able to hear your waiter/waitress or others at your table.
We started off with the calamari and shrimp appetizer. The appetizer was quite large and came with a side of a flavored horseradish sauce. The breading on the shrimp and calamari was good and the shrimp reasonably sized. My only complaint with it being that the larger calamari were actually cooked too long and were a bit burnt making them very rubbery. Otherwise it was a solid appetizer. Dinner for me was the butter poached lobster and scallops with papperdale pasta. The dish appeared deceivingly small whenever it came but actually contained quite a bit of food. The pasta was fresh and the cream sauce rich. There was also a lot of lobster in the dish with at least both claws, the tail and some other sizable pieces. Overall it had a good flavor. My dining partner ordered the crab cakes and the two crab cakes that came out were large and displayed beautifully. I took a taste of one and it had great flavor with enough citrus to make it delightful. With all of the food that we ate for dinner, we ended up being too stuffed for dessert which was a shame since they had a few items that sounded good.

They offered a VIP option that got you in an hour before they opened and had some exclusive items just for VIPS. The VIP tickets cost $150. A DAY.

The one Constant of places that I do go out to eat at was Los Sombrero's and the Trout was prepared tasting exactly the same as when I dined there 3x between their two locations.

I really enjoyed when the Chef from Hana took the time to explain to me her whole buffet she was serving and how to eat the food. Her Sea Bass was tiny and intricate and one of my favorite dishes of the two day event.

The tastiest small bites thing I ate was from Little Cleo's Seafood Legend. I wasn't sure if I would like it because I don't like smoke flavor too much but all together The buttery oozy seasoned Quail egg over the house made sturgeon with herb ed creme fraiche on toast was popping like magic in my mouth. Will it be that good when I visit that restaurant? Hope so.....

I don't get wowed by too much by a slab of beef it's just not that special to me and is very filling but one of the best I tried was from Roka Akor and it was only skirt steak however the shiso chimichurri sauce made it special.

The simple vegetables and dip from Phoenix Public Market was stunning.
The Vegetable Terrine from Tertio Wine Bar was tasty and pretty and a bit zippy. I thought it was a very thoughtful dish among the mostly heavier foods offered.

One of the best desserts had to be from the Gladly. They did some sort of Whiskey Blondie that was delicious. I wasn't going to eat more than a tiny taste but it was one of the things I finished after sharing with my husband.

For my taste I enjoyed the wines most from Merry Edwards.

There is a lot that I left out....

Karaoke.
Ever.

For my boyfriend's birthday, I went balls to the wall with their uber-fancy, 20+ person private karaoke room with its own patio. At $150 an hour, I was cringing a little at the outset. However, after a number of surprisingly inexpensive vodka cranberries ($5 each.... and this is Scottsdale!), I found myself fondling my boyfriend's boss as he sat on my lap while watching my normally prim liquored-up friends work the conveniently provided stripper pole like pros. Plenty of Journey, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath provided the perfect backdrop for the shenangians. We made sure to keep the door open even though the staff kept trying to tell us to close it, and even those too-cool-for-you Scottsdale fuckers walking by the bar were stopping and checking out the mayhem. Fabulous. It's almost a week later and people are still talking about it. This will be an annual birthday tradition -- mark my words. Worth every last penny.",2009-08-15 00:06:57

The bountiful food served was so good that night that I vowed to be back.  And, even though the food choices appearing on the regular menu were totally different than what was offered buffet style to Yelpers a month earlier, they were still of 5-star quality.  Meatballs 3-Ways with Ricotta Cheese, herbs, and spices was a large and comforting appetizer that was served with Alfredo, Marinara, and an interesting Green Pepper Cream Sauce.  When requested grated Parmesan Cheese arrived, I liberally sprinkled what appeared to be fresh cheese onto the meatballs, and was quite pleased with the result.  Breaded Chicken Fingers were mild, well made, and also satisfying.

These fine apps were followed by an excellent cheesy French Onion Soup prepared with nicely caramelized Vidalia Onions and a well-deconstructed crouton in a Sherry Wine Beef Broth that was capped by a lid of melted Swiss Cheese.

An enormous entree of off-the-menu Beef Stroganoff was simply excellent, with abundant lengths of lean beef, an immense amount of flat noodles, and creamy, heart-warming Brown Sauce intermixed with sour cream.  What I took home was too big for lunch, so it served as another delicious dinner.

Beer Battered Fish & Chips included moist deep-fried cod and a tasty homemade Lemon Tartar Sauce accompanied by creamy Coleslaw.  

Our request to put our leftover food in the cooler while my party of four adjourned to play several hands of Nevada Poker League-sponsored Texas Hold 'em upstairs was graciously granted by our server Katie.  Hours later our food was cheerfully brought to us, and we left.

I live in the neighborhood, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!

I wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza ""well done"" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly ""fell"" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy.

Next I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now, I'll give it 3 Stars.

I'm just going to be real....this place is Fiyaaaaah!!

Next door to costa verde (which is also fiyah) at keele and wilson is Best Kebab & Doner- a Turkish family owned restaurant that is just doing the most amazing things in the north west part of town. The furniture is not all that- but if you see the kitchen- you will realize where most of the money was spent for this operation.

Char grill, Shawarma rottiserie's , stone oven's for turkish pizza's and glass displays for fresh meat. You know that you are getting some quality stuff just from the sight of their kitchen.

Menu was also innovative- a 2 sided laminated sheet with items pictured and description below. It was very easy to pick what you desire- even if you are a novice to the Turkish cuisine. We ordered the Lazelar kebab and also a beef doner dinner.

The Lazelar dinner was an experience on its own. lamb skewer plated over eggplants and covered with cheese. My brain was amazed and confused. It felt like I had all my favorite things in my mouth. Am I eating BBQ? rack of lamb? Is that Baba Ganoush?? charred meat with melted mozzerala? what? So good....

I cannot take anything away from the beef doner- however I would much prefer it in a sandwich instead of the dinner I got. The doner was a thing of its own. Ever walk in to a shawarma place and debate if you want a gyro or beef shawarma?

say no more fam- Booom! The doner at best kebab tasted like a combination of the both!!

I highly recommend it!",2016-03-19 02:49:23

He seemed indifferent to it, didn't hate the food but had some issues with the whole lack of ""local"" which I totally understand.  So when a Groupon became available I figured I'd take a chance.

I often wonder if places like this read critics reviews.  In the case of Local Bar + Kitchen, it seems they did read what Munch had to say and did make some adjustments.  He wondered where exactly the pierogies made in McKees Rocks were from; the menu now clearly states that they are from Pierogies Plus.  Another one of Munch's criticisms was the lack of local brews; I can now say that they offer selections from both East End and Penn Brewery.  

I went ahead and ordered up the pierogies as my appetizer and Big Steve's Meatloaf sandwich as my entree.  The sandwich was very tasty.  I really liked the spicy Heinz glaze.  The pierogies were amazing, of course, but when you start with perfection and add butter, you can't really mess that up.  My service was okay, however it did seem to take awhile for someone to initially take my drink order and then when my pierogie appetizer came out my sandwich followed about 30 seconds later.  When all was said and done, though, my drink was not included in my final bill.  I wasn't sure if it was an oversight or my waitress being nice, but either way I left a nice tip.

One random note: the bathrooms were very clean.  At least the women's room, anyway.  

Local Bar + Kitchen is a place I might try again, but it's not the best place to just go for food.  And not all the food is actually ""local.""  The bar was hopping, though, and it stayed busy.  My suggestion would simply be to omit the word ""kitchen"" from the name of the establishment.  If it was only called ""Local Bar"" people would see the name as describing the place, not their offerings - leading to less confusion and disappointment in diners.",2012-03-05 10:01:26

I ordered 2 vegetarian tacos and a side of chips and cheese. 
 They have a lot to choose from whether you go strictly veggie ( like me) or choose the meat options.
My tacos consisted of beans, cheese, peppers, guac, sour cream, lettuce, cilantro, med salsa, and burrito sauce. 
Everything was fresh, fresh fresh, and what I like best about Mexican food, the bright snappy flavours. However they were a MESS to eat, which would have been ok if they were wrapped for eating, but they werent they were just sitting on a paper liner in the middle of a large metal tray. 
A mess to eat, but still delicious...next time I may ask for them to wrap them or something.

Though I trust her recommendations, I really wasn't anticipating that much. The name -- Harris Grill -- seemed a little ho-hum, and I was expecting your typical Pittsburgh-type place with basic appetizers and lots of Yuengling.

However, as soon as I sat down, I knew this place was going to be different. First of all, it was packed! The cute little patio had lots of young professionals ranging in attire from girls in maxi dresses to guys wearing dress pants, button-ups, and ties. Thankfully, one of my friends had arrived a few minutes before 5pm and secured the last available table on the patio. Lots of local residents were taking advantage of the absolutely incredible weather to sit outside.

After quickly becoming intimidated by the enormous drink ""book,"" I just took my friend's recommendation and ordered a frozen cosmo. Wow! Delicious!! It was the perfect blend of cold but not too icy and not too sweet but not too sour. I could drink these things every day! Well, maybe not every day... because they pack a serious punch! I was warned not to order the additional shot when it was offered to me, and thankfully I heeded the warning. After two of these beverages, I was definitely tipsy! In my opinion, two of these little frozen cosmos pack the same amount of buzz as 3-4 glasses of wine.

In addition to amazing frozen cosmos, I enjoyed trying their appetizers. The spinach dip and pita was tasty, and the pierogies, though very different from the pierogies that I have had in the past, were out-of-this-world good. I was tempted to order a second round of the pierogies but didn't want to appear gluttonous. 

Service was pretty good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was and how tightly we were packed onto the little patio. Our waiter both resembled and acted like Conan O'Brien, which was just the icing on the cake of a great happy hour experience.

And, finally, the check arrived. My jaw nearly fell on the floor. Three of us girls drank 7 frozen cosmos and ate 3 appetizers... for $40. How is that even possible? If I had known in advance that the frozen cosmos were $3/each, I might have just chugged them and taken a cab home.

I was pleased with the dish selections but nothing really stood out to me besides the samosa and naan. I'm glad I came to try it though.",2016-09-09 03:16:52

I would avoid the soups as none of the ones I have tried hit the note as far as flavor goes. But the meats are ok, just don't expect any of it to wow you. The banchan is pretty good.

Service depends on how busy it is. If you're one of the few ones there, it's easy to flag the waitress down. But during busy times, it can be more difficult as there is usually only one waitress and she becomes busy trying to serve the whole room.

It's a fairly small dining area so it can become crowded or boisterous depending on the day and time. But they also do take out, which is pretty fast (usually only takes 10 minutes).",2009-06-02 02:51:02

The BF and I have been wanting  to try the Sunday brunch for the longest time. Cooked to order buffet sounds amazing! There's not enough places that do that and breakfast items are so much better fresh. There are different tiers you can do- continental ($7.99), continental and hot dishes ($12.99) or continental, hot dishes and specialties ($16.99). We did the complete brunch menu and most of what we ordered was from the specialties side of the menu. 

We shared so we can try more items-

*Montecristo- this was just okay. I did like that the cheese was generous and melty. 
*Chicken & waffles- chicken was fine, waffles was more soft and cakey than crisp with a fluffy interior.
*Surf and turf benedict- eek. Lobster meat was fishy so I think its canned. Hollandaise was sour. Filet was scarce that I thought they'd forgot... it was gyro thin cut so it didn't really add much texture/flavor to the dish.
*Steak & eggs- stated as NY strip but did not taste like it...it was a pretty thick cube of meat more like a cutout from a sirloin. Was just okay in taste.
*Salmon & bagel- good. Came with cream cheese, red onion, green onion and capers so it was enjoyable.
*Pastrami hash and poach eggs- this was pretty good. Good poach, the flavor was decent. Wouldnt really say its a hash since the poatoes werent crispy fried but more like boiled, tossed with seasobing and meat.
*Stuffed french toast- this was pretty good.  It would have been better if I could have had some ketchup. I know, I have a bad obsession with ketchup, but seriously- salty, sweet and tangy works well. I think syrup by itself gets a bit tiring.
*Cheese Blintzes- crepe was good consistency, and I like that they added strawberries and strawberry puree to them. Love fruit on crepes.

The food was just okay and nothing really stood out as seriously delicious. The BF nailed it in the head what the major problem was, that even though it was made to order, the food didn't taste really fresh.

Service wasn't too consistent or personable. She wasn't rude or mean, but didn't seem to really want to be there. Our server came to ask for our drink order then waited a while to get a drink back or an order in and I started to get worried when we were sitting there for 15 minutes. I honestly think we should have left then. Then sometimes we were hoping she would come by and kinda disappeared. We had someone else check on us and we had them go find her. Then of course once we put an order, it's again a wait for items so there was a lot of downtime in this meal. We had to sit a while and wait to ask for the check since she wasn't on the floor. Payment time came and I showed her my groupon on the groupon app and she starts to tell me I needed to have printed it out for it to count. I go back to the previous page where it has the rules of the deal and it specifically said ""print out coupon or show groupon app to the business"". It took them a while to figure it out and I had another person come up to ask me about how the business redeems on the phone.... 

Food wasn't good enough to want to sit and do a lot of waiting and more waiting.  I live in the NW and this was a waste of a drive across town.",2011-05-02 05:33:56

We ordered Spicy Pork Bulgogi with the accompanying sides of Kimchi of cabage,  marinated potato  and another kimchi of sweet potatoes, pickled beansprouts and one that had a fishy taste.

We decided that we were not fans of Korean cuisine.  Our friends ate Bibimbap, a heated stone bowled rice dish with meat and veggies and an egg on top.

A couple of small plates we ordered... they should change this title of the menu to TEENY TINY PLATES.  2 scallops were 12 bucks and 2 pierogis for 10 dollars. Not even big scallops or pierogis just normal sized. The scallops were good, there was some other junk on the plate, I believe  shaved brussels sprouts, grapefruit and some pomegranate... not impressive nor would I order again- simply not worth it.  The pierogis were filled with some kind of beef, cheese and potato, my first bite was just a doughy edge, two pierogis in my book are never worth 10. Maybe 4, (MAYBE) but measly 2?  I always feel I don't mind spending a little more for better food, but I just felt ripped off and taken advantage of at this point. I always felt before coming to Deagans I got a fair value, maybe a little more than your average restaurant, but it was always worth it to me. Now, maybe we won't be rushing back. They removed the osso buco from the entrees, which was my husband's favorite. They still have chicken and waffles, fried fish, which were two standbys for us. I noticed a few people getting cheese boards at the bar, but that's not for me I like real hearty portions that don't leave me hungry.

Recently, I had friends in from out of town who have joined me there before and loved the burgers so it was our first choice for dinner. Upon arriving we noticed that the bartender was the only employee we had seen (they have roughly 8 - 10 tables in the place). I sympathize as I've been a server in an understaffed place... but, he didn't make an effort to actually serve us at all. We had to ask for drinks and stop him as he rushed away in order to put in our dinner order.... and with that he seemed annoyed.

Sadly, my punjabi mac & cheese was cold by the time they brought it with the other burgers. I had to again flag him down to ask for it to be heated. When it came back out it was warmer but didn't have much flavor. The report on the burgers: they were ok, but not as good as in the past.

I'm not ruling out returning to the E. Carson location - but it won't be anytime soon... and I'll be sure to see how many people are working (and if it was that unfriendly man) before I actually sit down next time.",2016-07-08 14:50:05

I had the lamb korma and it was great. Samosas appeared and tasted homemade. That would be a first in any Indian restaurant I have ever been to in the Las Vegas Valley. Great job guys.

Pros:
Very good congee
portions are very good

Cons:
Not as big as the other Keung's

Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  We were originally going to go to a HK style cafe in the same plaza but all of them were super busy and we didn't want to wait for a table.  We were the first customers of the day so we had our choice on where to sit.  This Keung's is definitely not as big as the one I frequent at Finch and Midland.  After about 15 minutes, the place was basically full and anyone else coming in would have to wait.  The turnover time here is not as fast as a HK style cafe so it could be a wait depending on busy it is.  

On to the food.  The menu is the same one as the other Keung's so you'll know your way around if you already frequent that one.  I had the special salted pork bone congee which was on sale at the time.  My GF got the pork chop noodle.  We ordered some dough fritters for the congee as well.  My GF's noodle was pretty good.  She noted that they give you a lot of noodle.  The bowl is not the biggest, but they pack as much as they can.  

On to the congee. I'd have to say this was one of the best congee's I've ever had.  The salted pork bones they use give the congee a great bast taste.  The mustard greens give a contrast to the salty nature of the congee.  The pork bones themselves were a higher quality cut then you're garden variety ones you can find in a Chinese super market.  I'm not a fan of the preserved egg, but the congee was so good I didn't mind.  We ordered the super bowl size and for $8.99, it was worth every penny.

All in all, it was a nice experience.  It was a blessing in disguise that all the HK style cafe's were full and we ended up here.  I will definitely be back for the congee again when I'm craving it!",2015-07-20 11:25:16

At first we wanted to go to The Gaberdine for some comfort food, but it was so packed we ended up coming here to Mercatto. Not too bad a fall back plan, I ended up finding a new favourite dessert here! (don't worry, I'll get to this later =] )

The menu is printed right on the place mat, and consists of 4 main cateogries: 
Appetizers, Pizzas, Pastas, and Entrees. 


Table Bread

The meal started off with some complimentary bread. Warm and toasty, with a pat of butter; just perfect!


""Fritto Misto"" ($12) -shrimp, calamari, crispy chickpeas, smoked ketchup

Jess is a big fan of calimari, she orders it every time we go out! I didn't mind it though, and I enjoyed the lightly battered array of seafood that the Fritto Mistro came with. The smoky ketchup was a nice addition, but surprisingly enough my favourite part of this was the fried chickpeas. So crunchy and good!


""Arugula"" ($8)-apples, walnuts, lemon vinigrette, pecorino

We thought we'd keep our digestive systems in order by ordering a plate of greens to go along with our carbohydrate heavy Italian meal. I suggested the Argula salad because I love apples in salads. Not overly drenched in salad dressing, and a sprinkle of cheese.


""Spagehtti"" ($16) -pork meatballs, tomato, smoked provolone

Whenever I visit an Italian restaurant, I try to order something I can't make at home. But I guess sometimes it pays off to stick to the classics. The pork meatballs in this Spaghetti was delicious. It tasted freshly made with lean meat, and none of that other preserved junk. While I really liked the meatballs, I found the spaghetti to be lacking sauce. As a result, it was dry and bland.


""Diavola Pizze"" ($15) -spicy sopressata, tomato, mozzerella, basil

This was a  nice thin crust pizza, but was not very memorable for me. I did like the spicy sopressata that gave a kick to the otherwise plain pizza, but nothing too special. It also very quickly became unappetizingly tough and chewy after it cooled. Make sure you eat this promptly!


""Tiramisu"" ($7) -italian cookies, espresso, mascarpone

We were quite full, but decided it wouldn't be a meal without dessert!  I had envisioned the Tiramisu to be in cake form, so was surprised when it came in this small little glass jar. It is filled with balls of cake soaked in coffee and  mascarpone cheese. I really liked the cheese filling which was thick, creamy, and smooth. The cake balls, not so much. I found there was too much coffee, and so the cake was a little soggier than I would've liked. Still quite good though.


""Torta"" ($6) -lemon cake, blueberries, whipped

This second dessert we ordered I liked much better than the Tiramisu. It really surprised me how much I liked it because I generally don't like anything with lemon (It just makes me feel like I'm eating dish detergent!) But this, was just heavenly. A moist buttery cake that is not as heavy as pound cake, but light enough to melt in your mouth along side the generous heaping of whipped cream. The light hint of lemon went well with the sugared blueberries. My new favourite lemon dessert!


Overall, this was a nice place to grab some casual classic Italian fare. You're not going to get anything too fancy here, but nothing sub-par either. Expect the ordinary. I think the only thing I would come back for, is that lemon Torta!",2012-02-03 23:08:23

bc07qmuEcwqoIjezgd-vng,J9OSJ7Xl9wnS0tL709AIqA,c2YDEpYQ-2IqB57tN0HKbQ,1,23,0,6,"I was a pretty regular visitor here for over a year, stopping in probably close to once a week on average (usually to grab a post-dinner cocktail with a friend). It was one of the first places I would take any friends from out of town; the drinks were excellent, the vibe was relaxed, and they seriously had the best bar staff. There were several regular bartenders who were always super friendly, informative, and seemed to actually care that their patrons were enjoying themselves and their drinks.

Shortly before one of my best friends moved out of the city, we made it a point to stop in. We found that the Highland Ave. entrance was locked, which was odd. We were redirected to the small entrance around the side, and knew something was up. Upon entering, we were greeted by a hostess and informed that there had been ""some changes"" and that they were now a full-service restaurant. We asked if we could just sit at the bar and order a cocktail, and were told with snarky attitude that that probably wouldn't be possible without a reservation. She did disappear behind the weird thick curtain that now hid the main room and returned to tell us that she could ""probably"" squeeze us into one of the corners. In the meantime we had glanced over the menu only to find that the cocktail list was reduced to less than five lackluster choices. This, combined with the weird interaction that had occurred, caused us to decline her offer and leave to find a drink elsewhere. 

Now, I'm not lowering my rating so severely due to a change in concept. Change can be good, and obviously the owners can do whatever they want--it's their place, after all. My intention is not to whine just because I happened to like the way it was before. I can't say I understand it though, considering this place seemed super successful (the few times I went late on a Friday or Saturday, it was packed). Also, it doesn't seem to make sense as a restaurant. There are about four tables; the rest is all bar counters. 

Pittsburgh Magazine posted an article in early June announcing the changes. The article also suggested that the staff (who, as I mentioned, were part of the reason we loved this place) were not given advance notice of the changes, and that the majority moved on or were let go. That was unfortunate to hear. And everything I have heard just sounds shady. 

I posted a link to that article on Twitter to show some other friends who enjoyed going here, and in turn I was literally blocked by the Livermore. Bizarre, right? I started to look around on Twitter, and found that a few others had posted the article. In one case, the Livermore (publicly) referred to one of the people who posted it as a ""f*cktard"" which is a really curious approach to PR. Sorry, but I can't support that kind of business.

Maybe it's not fair to give one star considering we didn't even stay long enough to try the food. But I feel it was certainly earned through these bizarre experiences. The food could be amazing, but unfortunately I have no intention of trying it and supporting this or Bar Marco, given the circumstances.",2015-08-22 19:28:02

The food is now inedible (with the exception of the buffet in the clubhouse which is hit or miss but at $9.50 worth it, especiallywhen they carve pork belly).

The chicken sandwich I had was cold in the middle and luke warm on the top.  The pretzel was highly over salted and must have been microwaved because it was hard and rubbery in some places and soft in others.  The hot dog was simply cold.  What makes all this worse is that we were one of the first people in the stadium so everything should have been hot and ready.  The lines are unmanageable.  Aramark has supposedly been doing stadium concessions for years and you think they would learn what works and what doesn't but I waited in line so long I ate my pretzel and if I wasn't honest the cashier would never have even known.  With the exception of the nachos in a helmet, there isn't even any interesting food other than the buffet.

I've tried several pizzas over the past few months and have enjoyed all but one.  The chipotle chicken was very good although spicy and I also liked the roasted artichoke and spinach and the california club (minus the bacon).  I know.  I know.  I'm probably one of the few people in Pittsburgh who doesn't believe bacon makes everything better.  The only one I haven't liked to date was the five cheese and fresh tomato.

G_cmqrMo8ZWuRMjAdTcX5w,3cC726zwgerKNNasnidAww,oDzfxyhB0XIIcMQWl9S3HQ,2,2,2,2,"The location of this Krispy Kreme is great in theory.  Located on Bell Road, just feet from State Route 51, the store's sign is clearly visible from the highway.  I drive past it everyday and thought it had opened weeks before it actually did just because how much the sign sticks out.  So when I was hungry the other morning and craving something sweet, and just about to pass that sign, I decided why not indulge in a doughnut.

So here's why this location is only good in theory;  Being so close to the highway entrance/exit, it's quite a challenge to get in and out of the plaza during the morning rush hour.  Bell road is packed.  You're going to have to wait quite a while to make that left turn on 36th street.  Then when you're trying to get out, you better either want to go south on the 51, or keep driving east on Bell road, because it's going to be a very tight squeeze if you want to get into the lanes heading to the 51 north, and turning left on Bell is going to be nearly impossible.  During my wait for an opening in traffic, I kept asking myself if this was worth it for a doughnut?  My answer is a resounding no. 

Having not had a Krispy Kreme doughnut in years, I didn't realize how expensive they are.  99 cents for a plain glazed doughnut?  $1.10 for one of the variety doughnuts?  Unless you get a glazed made hot on site there's nothing special about them.  There's also plenty of non-chain shops that have a much better product for cheaper.  I decided to try a chocolate iced creme-filled and one of the specialty doughnuts, the oreo cake.  The chocolate iced creme-filled is okay (this was one of my favorites when Krispy Kreme was at the peak of its popularity), but I could get the same doughnut at any supermarket for 50 cents cheaper.  The oreo was awful.  It's just a regular chocolate doughnut with crushed oreos on top and a dollop of cookie and creme filling in the hole.  It should work, but for some reason, it just doesn't.

To make a long story short, neither was worth the calories or the price, and both made me wonder what was up with the Krispy Kreme Kraze in 90's.  Remember the lines at the drive through for the original location at Arizona Mills?  Remember when the donuts were sold in supermarkets and gas stations all over the valley?  But mostly, I remember when I didn't care after they all disappeared overnight.",2013-03-22 22:59:33

So much love makes me a bit bias, but I truly have to say that this place does deserve its five stars.

The atmosphere is intimate and warm.  We had very attentive and friendly service.  The menu for the lunch included an appetizer, a main, dessert and coffee or tea.  There were about four choices for each category so there was bound to be something that everyone liked.  I got the pate for appetizer and a 'ploughsman' plate of proscuitto, pate, and salad.  Little did i know that the ploughsman plate was actually very much like the pate appetizer (had the same pate), but since it tasted so good, I didn't mind so much.  I got to sample my mother's spot on and very filling roasted red pepper soup as well.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee which along with the coffee was the perfect end to the meal.

Since I get to stay at all of Harrah's chain hotel/casino free, if it weren't for the new Go room, I'd probably never stay here.  The Go room's primary color is Flamingo pink.  It has a huge white vinyl headboard with sleek modern furniture.  They upgraded the bed to ultra-soft pillow-top mattresses and plush linens which are quite nice.  The room is also equipped with 42-inch flat panel TV and a built-in one in the bathroom mirror.  I love the jetted shower fixture but I hate the vanity bowl (only 1!).  And how can they forget a magnifying mirror?????  How was I supposed to apply my make up without it?  Ugh!  It also has a host of cutting edge digital accessories including top-of-the-line sound system, iPod docking station, CD/DVD player, electronic window treatments, all of which I really don't care for.  I mean, how much time do we stay in the room when in Vegas????  OK, so I give them credit for renovating the rooms, but they did nothing to improve sound-proof.  It was so noisy even with my ear plugs I could hear my neighbor's TV and everyone talking/walking down the hallway.  

The buffet was horrible even though it was free to me (comp'ed).  I only ate here because the diamond lounge was not open yet and I was hungry and too lazy to walk/drive anywhere.  It was only breakfast, so how bad could it get right?  WRONG!  It was BAD.  If I actually had to pay $17.99 per person, I'd have been pi$$ed.  

The diamond lounge opens at noon.  It's different from the other diamond lounges because it actually serves SUSHI!!!  How cool is that?  I mean, it's not fancy sushi, but California roll, spicy tuna, and a couple of other ones are really nice additions to the usual deli sandwiches.  They also serve soups which are not found in other diamond lounges.  

The casino is small compare to the rest of Harrah's chain casinos.  It doesn't bother me because I just play else where and still accumulate my total rewards points.  

The spa/fitness facility are not the greatest but the massage therapist, Annacita (spelling?) is the best.  I would have never thought to get a spa treatment here.  But I got a Spa Get-Away offer with 3 days 2 nights stay and 2 spa treatments, all free on the house, I had to take advantage of it.  I chose 2 deep tissue massages for 2 days and I was in heaven.  I've since come back and booked massages with Annacita.  $125 for 50 minutes (on weekend) and it was worth every penny of it!!!  The staffs at the spa are super nice and hospitable.

Usually, the folks working checkout are very nice, and that's a positive way to end a typically frustrating run through the store.

They have a good selection of cheeses and cold cuts. Take a number and decide fast; this area gets crowded during rush hour. 

If you are into charcuterie or you are having a party, in here you'll find what you need to please picky, gourmet and vegetarian individuals (they have plenty of olive options and gourmet antipastos). I like the smoked  provolone, the manchego, the spicy calabrese, and the imitation caviars.

The veggie section is solid, I've never seen about to spoil produce or found some fishy veggie when bought big bags. I was really happy when I found poblano peppers and calabacitas from Mexico. During Summer time you can also find happy plants; this was the only place where I could find cat nip.

They have a whole aisle for bread, cookies, pitas, and flour made products.

The pasta section is trippy: lots of colours, forms, ingredients and brands.

It would be perfect for me if they sold more mexican products and the aisles were a lil wider.",2016-01-19 01:22:18

Delicious and totally filling.

The pharmacy is at the far left of the entrance rather than awkwardly placed at the front. I personally still do not use the pharmacy because they were slow before and I found a better one. 

Some groceries have been totally changed around but I would say its better. No more walking alllllll the way to the end of the store for a quick loaf of bread. 

I would say the most noticeable change since remodel is the sale of beer. (Finally. Youd think the neighborhood known for drinking would've been one of the first GEs to sell beer.) the prepared foods area seems larger. There's also a seating area with coffee (closed off late night so don't worry about people loitering inside).

Although the remodel is great, the cashiers honestly are still pretty slow. & while the self check outs have moved away from front door area to cut back on congestion,  there is still no designated line and an awkward line and blocking of aisles happens.

Stayed 2 nights here due to a discount rate I scored online. The hotel casino is dirty, run down and very small. The check-in process was pretty easy. However, when I booked the room a month earlier, I was told the resort fee is only $7. Within a month, it had become $14/night. WTF?? Doubling the amount in a month is absurd and this is a scam to increase their room rate. 

The room definitely has been remodeled. However, b/c the hotel is so old, the drain is constantly clogged. After a 5min shower, I was standing in calf high dirty water. In the am, when I want to brush my teeth, after 3 min, the sink was overflowing. The gym luckily opens until 11pm, great for gym rats. The carpet is filthy, but the machines are fairly new.

I thought the jalapeno cornbread was the standout item here, which along with the honey butter was a great complement to the kick-your-ass spicy/sweet BBQ sauce.  The steak fries (not too crispy and not too soft) and cowboy baked beans were surprisingly terrific as well. 

The service was OK, it seemed the server was in a cranky mood for some reason -- but it wasn't horrible.   The pork though, was just really bad - stringy and overcooked.

I've visited Chef Chamberlin's other Phoenix creations (Phoenix Public Market Cafe & St. Francis) with mixed results.  Chamberlin certainly has a penchant for beautiful adaptive reuses of old buildings, but the food more often than not has left me underwhelmed.  In Taco Chelo, Chamberlin is making his first venture into the Mexican food realm inside a building on Roosevelt Row that most recently housed Flowers Beer & Wine (a craft beer & wine store that I dearly hope will reopen again nearby someday).  I don't always observe Taco Tuesday, but with a new taqueria just a few blocks from my apartment, I decided this Tuesday at happy hour was the right time.

As of my first visit here, the restaurant had been open for just barely a month.  You'll find it on the southeast corner of 5th Street & Roosevelt inside the old Flowers building (now part of a growing adaptive reuse complex called The Blocks).  Taco Chelo takes up about half the space that Flowers Beer & Wine once did, and the space is a hip modern urban neighborhood design that dreams are made of.  An absolutely gorgeous array of exposed brick, gold trim throughout the ceiling, wooden tables and seating, as well as turquoise hues throughout the bar area.  You'll also find beautiful art on the wall courtesy of artist Gennaro Garcia.  The space is completely unrecognizable from the Flowers days, but in this case I mean that as a compliment.  Inside there's seating for close to 30 (including the bar) & probably room for 40-45 more in the picnic table seating area outside.  They will most definitely need to get more shading for the outside before summer hits, but the foundation is solid.  Here you order at the front register helpfully marked with a Taco sign, grab a number, & sit wherever you want.  Dining solo for happy hour, I saddled up to the bar.

The menu at Taco Chelo (co-created by Chamberlin & chef Suny Santana) is somewhat limited, but concise & easy to digest.  You've got 4 apps, 5 tacos, 2 salads, & 1 dessert to choose from on the food side.  On the drink side it's more diverse with a fairly wide array of cocktails, beers, wines, & non-alcoholic drinks.  I haven't had mezcal in ages, so I started things off with their Mezcal Paloma.  Lime, ginger, bitters, grapefruit soda, and of course the mezcal itself.  I think they threw in a little house spice mix in there as well for an extra kick.  A very pleasant refreshing beverage to start with a spicy tartness to boot.  For the apps, most are ones you find at most sit down Mexican joints anywhere.  Chicharrones however are somewhat unusual to see on a menu so I grabbed those.  Basically fried pork rinds covered in cotija cheese and chimayo chili mix, with sides of guacamole and Cholula hot sauce.  Mine came with ten pieces in all.  Super crunchy (sometimes rock hard) & messy, but a pretty good vehicle for the guac.  The cheese & spices also work well here (that is of course if you can keep them from flying everywhere).

Now then, this is Taco Tuesday isn't it?  And I was feeling particularly ambitious today.  Taco Chelo's five taco offerings include:  Vegetable, Fish, Carnitas, Carne Asada, & Beef Barbacoa.  Although I'm disappointed they don't offer Al Pastor or Lengua tacos yet, I decided to give all five current varieties a try by ordering one of each.  For those wondering about the veggie, just know that there's a ton of mushrooms in this version.  Mushrooms aren't my thing so I wasn't a fan of their veggie taco, but you might come to a different conclusion than I did.  As for the rest of the tacos, I was mostly impressed.  The tortillas are made fresh by the staff for each order & the meats were quite delicious.  The Barbacoa fell a little flat for me but the Carnitas, Fish, and Carne Asada tacos were perfect.  After all that food, I had just enough room for their one & only dessert.  Their Tres Leches cake dessert is about twice the size of a hockey puck & topped with almonds and orange slices.  Its served cold with a smooth creamy texture, which certainly helps to soothe your mouth after all those spices from earlier.  The flavor profile overall was respectable, though not spectacular.

Total cost for all the food and my drink including tax and tip came to about $45.  First impressions?  A fantastic space and neighborhood hangout with decent (at times great) food & drink options.  My biggest beef is really what's missing from the menu.  Horchata?  Al Pastor?  Lengua? Nowhere to be found.  Even the most basic taqueria should have those offerings (in my humble opinion).  Its early yet so maybe that will be on the menu in due time.  For now, its worth a look if you're curious & definitely a great hangout spot for small groups.  With so much great Mexican food throughout Downtown, its not easy to compete.  Taco Chelo has potential.  Potential I hope they'll be able to fully exploit.",2018-04-18 01:54:02

rCR_1_Taj22-uWOzrNcWQg,6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,C6C_dc78Zhzei9wrZs-tdQ,4,9,0,2,"I have to be careful with hotel reviews.  I have 4-5 star aspirations on a 1-3 star budget. I must be careful not to rate a 2.5-star hotel poorly just because it doesn't have the offerings of a higher-rated property.  And this is indeed a 2.5 star property.

Based on Expedia and AAA, stars refer to services and amenities more than aesthetics.  Hotel #1 with high-percale, Egyptian bedding but no internet, limited room service and no on-site eateries will be lower-rated than hotel #2 that has those services, even when hotel #2's rooms have cheaper furniture and lower quality bedding.  So I use stars along with customer reviews to determine whether I might like a hotel. 

For me, hotels in old Vegas/Fremont are fine as 2-star properties because I'm not there for the hotel. I'm there for the wackiness known as Fremont. I'm not a gambler;  $10 - $20 on the slot machine will last me all weekend. I care more about the food, internet and about room safety and comfort than anything.  

I stayed in the renovated tower section of the El Cortez, and I should say that I won a free hotel weekend through my travel agency.  That won't affect my review (although it might have gotten me the renovated tower room with the Strip view, a perk about which I will not complain!)   

Upon entering the room I was struck with the comfy look and design. It doesn't come across as small.  While the nearby California Hotel was almost comical in its extreme plainness, this room has homey-looking, interesting furnishings, like brass pineapple lamps.  It even has a cute little sitting area by the window. Truth to tell, the loveseat was very light-weight and the coffee table looked like it came from a garage sale. Somehow, this all came together for a  home-away-from-home feel.  The room was quite clean, the view was great, and I appreciated the multitude of lighting fixtures.   The TV is the older, bulky kind. Internet was $11.99 for 24 hours PER DEVICE. That's just crazy. I tried it with my iPhone and found it to be decent quality with little to no lag or disconnects. There doesn't appear to be internet in the public areas.

The bathroom was odd- VERY tiny. The toilet/tub/shower room is separate from the sink area. The shower is basically no different than one  you might install in your own home- a Home Depot-style plastic molded shower insert.  As tiny as the sink area was, the ""closet"" and the safe were packed in there as well.   Tiny, folks.  There wasn't even a light over the sink- light came from the toilet room or from the sitting area.   

The beds were comfortable enough, with three pillows each (I like extra pillows).  I liked the room a lot, really- just not the bathroom.

Whenever I stay in a hotel I purposely order room service.  Room service here is overpriced but is served promptly and my breakfast was really good. It apparently comes from the 24-hour Cafe Cortez. I kinda liked the Cafe. If I were a regular here, I could see myself with my newspaper or magazine,  sitting alone there and drinking my coffee.  The international waitstaff are attentive and friendly.

I got a really nice credit for the Flame steakhouse, so I invited a friend to eat there with me. The hotel was also giving guests a free bottle of Mondavi wine.  The small (but uncrowded) space, low lighting and live pianist give the place a slightly sophisticated air, but the sight of some of the patrons in jeans and old T-shirts knocked down the sophistication level by a few points. The wait staff were friendly.

I had the French onion soup as my appetizer, which tasted fine. My friend got the crab cakes and we were both surprised by the small size of the two cakes compared to the price charged for them.  They were tasty, though.  As for entrees, my friend ordered the salmon. I liked it a lot- juicy, moist, nicely seasoned. Companion said she LOVED it. We both liked the accompanying bed of ""sea beans"" - now, that was a creative touch!  

I got the shrimp scampi, which was shrimp on a bed of linguini. I didn't really love my entree; the sauce tasted a little dull. It wasn't horrid but for $21 I wouldn't order it again.  We shared an apple strudel for dessert and were totally unimpressed because there was absolutely nothing special about it.  

Our meal, including the $15 white zinfadel, came to over $80 (covered mostly by my credit), and for that price I want to be wowed.  If they want to maintain their prices, I'd like to see originality and a more sophisticated decor. Those sea beans stood out because out of everything, they were a new experience, and well-prepared.  People don't mind paying extra for the creatively (and deliciously) unusual.  More of that, please!

So would I come back? Yes, I would. The place is old-fashioned and homey, but that's a selling point. It's near Fremont Street. Great staff, decent price.  I'm trying the Cabana suites next.",2012-05-02 19:44:11

The inside is both cavernous and cramped. When you first walk in through the giant green door, it's like you are entering the walk-in closet of a Japanese slot machine hoarder. You have the option of sitting inside or on the patio, or renting one of their three karaoke rooms. We almost always sit on the patio since the inside is so dark that I'm afraid I might wind up in the wrong bathroom. The karaoke rooms are nice, although intimidating as you are being led down a dark hallway to a room in which your companions will most certainly make fun of you. Depending on your group size, 5 could fit comfortably in the smaller room whereas 8 is pushing the limits (imagine spilled drinks and dropped sushi). They larger room is intended for 10 - 15 and is pretty spacious. The sound system takes a bit to get used to, especially figuring out if it's plugged in correctly or trying to input numbers for the song selections. Once you get the hang of it, its smooth sailing and the only bumps are trying to decide which song to sing next. 

The Happy Hour here is fantastic - half priced karaoke rooms, maki, appetizers, sake, and house specialty drinks from 4 - 7pm every day. We can get away with a ton of food for very little money - it's great. I think we've tried almost everything in the appetizer section - our favorite being the teriyaki ribs. Then, we normally order the dragon roll. Their sushi is good, standard for the most part, but the specialty rolls have some pretty cracked out names. One of our favorites is the Gaijin - a chimichanga styled sushi roll, deep fried and delicious with cream cheese and avocado. We haven't ventured much into the other areas of their menu - salads, noodles, etc. The green tea gelato is good, but we've had better that tasted less freeze burnt. (If you want ice cream after this meal, definitely walk around the corner to Lee's Ice Cream Liquor - alcohol infused ice cream to die for!) 

I would definitely recommend this for happy hour or a birthday with friends.",2012-09-14 20:29:24

However, whenever I do and I bring it to this Hyundai, I'm always satisfied with their customer service and leave feeling like my car has been taken care of.

I've been here a few times. The last visit was for just an oil change. I didn't make an appointment because I didn't need my car back right away. So when they quoted that it could be three hours (Saturday is definitely busy), I said sure. I was going to get picked up and could come back to retrieve my car anytime.

Hyundai called within 1.5 hours, informing me my oil change was done. My car was also washed when I came back for it. Nice!

I've been here for the major servicing, and they've always informed me of all they will do and what the charges will be. Once, they even were notified that my car could possibly have recalled parts. When I came to pick it up, after doing their research, they learned it wasn't in my car model. However, if it had been, they would have made sure I made an appointment with them to get it taken care of. They always have their work done in the time quoted, which I can't stand when it's not.

The food is adequate, and frankly perfect for the multitudes of hung-over Tempe bar hoppers.  The menu is large, and there are items on the menu that are great, and some not so great. 

For example (great):

Read the other Yelp reviews, people seem to concur that the Huevos Rancheros is where it's at.

I personally like their traditional 2 egg breakfast.  There is Cholula on the table, and the food is done right.

For Example (not great):

If you are there for lunch, and a BLT sounds good, order ANYTHING else.  The BLT is a skinny little slice of a sandwich on wonderbread.  Nothing cool.  (Go to Wildflower Bread Company if you want a BLT done right).

Why this place is special:

In the early days it was called May West, and a despute over the name resulted in the renaming to Harlow's.  In both cases the diner is ""Early Hollywood"" themed-- Starlettes and old movie posters line the walls.  

The dining experience is down-home, and small-town-ish, which is something Tempe used to have a whole lot more of-- charm.

- The food, aside from the sushi (which I don't get because I'm not a big fan) is relatively priced low and they give large portions. 

- Though I'm not big on sushi myself, they have an incredible menu with as many options as you can think of. 

- The decor here is nice and doesn't feel cheesy at all.

What I don't like: 

- The service! It's terrible! The waitresses we've had (four different ones) have always been awful (with the exception of one). The last one we had takes the cake for being the worst waitress I've had--maybe anywhere! We went for dinner. She took about 15 minutes to come take our order. We knew what we wanted when we got there, but she took forever. She then took almost as long to bring out drinks and never gave refills. She also took about 30 minutes to come pick up the check, and in fact never came--another waitress grabbed it AFTER we asked if she could ring it up. I wanted to leave, but my boyfriend insisted we pay and we left. I should also mention that the restaurant was by no means busy and the same waitress was helping a couple across from us who got there after we did.

I arrived 10min early for my appointment to be polite, I know that walk-ins welcome too though. I probably stood at the reception desk for 5 minutes straight. No one greeted me or asked if I needed help but everyone did look at me; the girl I found out later to be the receptionist finally stopped talking to the nail tech and said, ""Yes? What do you want?""  I told her I was there for my appointment and it was my first pedi ever, which I actually called earlier that day to confirm again, and she then asked if I had an appointment. After some silence she told me to pick out a color, I actually thought there'd be more color choices, it was mostly pink and red, so I did and came back, then she told me to sit down, looking at me like I had 2 heads and I was totally stupid. 

Finally I waited 10 more min and got seated with Richie. He seemed distracted the whole time, I think looking at the owner or head woman, he even dropped the nail polish while mean muggin' her and she wasn't even looking. It seemed to have a catty, selfish, vibe, I gathered they were arguing about money and the receptionist was trying to overcharge and had to be scolded. Then I was told move down while I was drying even though there was only 1 person at the opposite end because a family came in, and they didn't even all have pedi appointments, they actually said that in front of the techs, not surprised they wouldn't pay attention though. 

I saw my same tub kind of splashed with what I thought was alcohol, but not wiped at the bottom or at all and filled up with the blue flake stuff. I really hoped I wouldn't get an infection after I saw that. When I was drying Richie gave my coupon to the receptionist and when I paid and asked for it back she said she never got it, even THOUGH she explained I got a discount. Then she went back to Richie and came back and gave it to me so I could use the other coupons on the flyer. Like you don't want me to come back or get $2 off? OK? Also, cash only tips.

There was a weird scuff left on my nail that's not natural and some polish left on my skin, but I thought it was pretty.

I would only recommend to go if it's a surprise gift or you have a coupon and really really really need it. I didn't get the point of the basic spa pedi, basically it looks like what any girl could go with a small tub soak, scrubbing pad/stone, and nice polish. It didn't look or feel different, just glossier because of the bottom and top coat used.

Your tip was that extra $40.00 you tricked me out of!!!! Hope it was well spent. 
Here's another tip for you....Stop being greedy and value your customers.
Never again! I'll take my business elsewhere.
I also notice that whenever someone has an issue the owner and/or manager never takes responsibility for what occurs but rather likes to clap back at the customer. Not good business. Buyer beware! And yes I have paid for dematting before but this time they were NOT matted. Since there was knowledge that I paid extra for dematting in the past, you're not going to just look at them each time and say they're matted just to warrant an extra charge. NOT! They're NOT matted now and I'm going to go have them groomed but I'm sure had I brought them there I would have been charged extra. I'm good. Thanks. And yes I know what a gratuity is.

Hearing about the legendary $1 taco Tuesday, my friends and I decided to give Sachsenheim Hall a shot. 

When I first walked in, I scoped out the scene for a table for 4, which doesn't exist. Sachsenheim offers bar seating and communal tables. Time to make new friends... 

When we asked our waitress about happy hour specials, she said that there was no happy hour since their prices are already so low, despite the big sign at the bar advertising happy hour until 7. For whatever reason, there is no written beer list, and our server seemed on edge and annoyed when we asked her to run through the beer options. 

Fast forward 45 minutes and empty beer steins and we couldn't track down our waitress. We waved down another server who wished us luck finding ours when we offered up a physical description. About 10 minutes later, we spotted her, waved, and were told that she would be back. It took at least an hour to place an order for our second round of drinks and food. So frustrating! 

When the food finally did arrive it was equally cheap as it was tasty, which made the wait feel somewhat worthwhile. The Korean Beef tacos were the hands-down favorite. I asked for non-dairy and my empanada was super cheesy. It was only a $1.50 loss though (we didn't see our waitress for another 20 minutes once we were served, at which point it didn't feel worth it to ask for a cheese-less empanada).

I would have preferred regular cornbread to the fried corn egg roll thing, but my kids all ate it just fine.

Drawbacks would be that I wouldn't want to eat in that place-do takeout, and the bar does seem a little depressing to me.",2014-09-14 06:34:10

I'm always looking for unique ethnic restaurants for my social group to try, this hidden gem was a home run! I called ahead to make a reservation a few days before and whomever I spoke with that day and day-of were quite polite (had to amend my count day-of). Have no fear if you feel a need to reserve seating since their dining room is small (maybe 10-15 tables total). It's kind of hidden off of the road and is highly likely you'll miss the entrance to the parking lot (shared with an auto shop). 

That evening I was first to arrive and the young guy manning the room let me select wherever I wanted to sit. Since it was fairly quiet, we had our pick of spots. LOVE how cozy it is! The guy immediately started pouring water for my friends and I as we sat. He also ran thru the menu since we were all n00bs to Cambodian, his favorites and fan-faves. 

Everyone started with a spring or egg roll. Since it is BYOB, I opted for one of their fresh juices as well- so delish! The rolls were a great start to our meal. All of us ordered our own meal. Wish I could remember the name of my plate, but it had chicken and lemongrass flavors. The four of us shared a biiiig bowl of rice, which was more than enough.

I especially like the dragon roll and the tempura rolls. However, I generally prefer more simple choices such as sashimi and nigiri, and Pacific East definitely does a great job with these! My current favorite dish is the hamachi don, which consists of pieces of hamachi sashimi over rice with a few different seasonings. Its really amazing and I always recommend it!

We had reservations and were seated promptly on arrival, which was great considering there were only a handful of people in the restaurant for a Friday evening. I was surprised at how long it took for a waiter to greet us and further more disappointed then how long we waited for our order to me taken. 

Dover Sole is my absolute favorite fish and is always a treat when we make it at home. I was very much looking forward to enjoying this dish at my visit. It was a decent size portion and garnished nicely, however was absolutely tasteless. I would say that the $42 was drastically overpriced for what i received. 

My husband got a steak that was flavored well and cooked to his liking, which made me regret my choice in menu selection even more. We shared the mashed potatoes and asparagus, which were both good and well portioned. 

After we completed our dinner they spared no time clearing our plates off the table, but then waited more than 10minutes for someone to bring us our check. i have no ambition to revisit this establishment in the future and will continue to buy my Dover Sole at the store (previously frozen) for a reasonable price and better taste.",2014-09-29 21:51:42

Prices were affordable, not too bad. Then I got the chef's special. I was really contemplating getting the Mac n cheese and I should have done that because the chef's special was not so special at all. The battered fried fish was smokey and way way too salty!!! It was horrible. Each bite I took, I had to down it with water. I wasn't the only one who found it too spicy. A couple of people on my table who ordered the same thing had the same comments about. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. I tries my boyfriend' s grilled octopus and it was delicious. Great bold flavours in there and the potatoes were delicious with it.

I would definitely come here again to try the mac n cheese now since I didn't get it last time. But for my first experience, it was decent. Just really disappointed  about the chef's special.

Such a lucky find a boba place slow close to where I call home. The store personal were setting up new promos when I came in.

Although the guys working the front counter did not share my same enthusiasm. 

I love the extensive menu that they have here with so many different selections of tea with or without boba. Some of the teas come with a milk pairing or even yogurt. I decided to try the yogurt tea with grapefruit. It was so refreshing on the hottest day on record for Vegas. Not a bad way to beat the heat grapefruit boba and yogurt tea.

The lobby was very comfortable to wait in while they prepared my drink. It took them no time at all and I was refreshed by my Kung fu tea beverage. I have to say that it really hit the spot. The guys that served me informed me that if you download the app, and connect your credit card to it then you will automatically get a free one.

I stopped in for lunch today and experienced great service.  I ordered one tea-flavored egg ($1.50, 3 are $3.25), a fried tofu appetizer, and an off-the-menu avocado boba smoothie.  The smoothie came first in a huge mason jar - I ordered the regular but it almost appeared like mine was large!  It is more sweet tasting than avocado tasting, but still good.  Next time I should go for almond milk tea because that is another favorite of mine.

The tea flavored egg came next.  I peeled it (I am terrible at hard boiled egg peeling but this was at least cracked for me in the kitchen).  Unraveling the shell bits was an almost tie-dyed egg, a beautiful contrast of brown shades.  It was a bit salty, and the yolk over hard (I am partial to eggs without grey-shrouded yolks) but it was a new experience nonetheless and not bad.

Lastly, the tofu appetizer.  Mini fried and marinated tofu squares with salt and pepper sprinkled on top.  Tasty and simple.  With the drink, definitely filling.

--Pulled pork - was good.  Tried all 3 sauces and they were ok, no great.  There was no 'hot' sauce, though, for those who like the red hot version.
--Mac&cheese - I agree with previous comments.  It was OK, but too velveeta-y.
--Cheese grits - fabulous.  Like dessert, almost, due to (I'm sure) the amount of butter.
--Fried okra - good.  Sprinkled with a spice with a bit of a kick to it, so it had a nice flavor.
--Meal served with texas toast.  In my opinion, that's just a waste of time and food; can't imagine how much of that stuff they throw out.  A BBQ plate should be served with cornbread.  In fact, cornbread should be a freebie for the table.
--I appreciate that soft drinks are served in a small bottle with a cup of ice - it's better flavor than a fountain drink; however, I missed the free refills.  Our waiter did explain that an additional drink would cost us and offered to bring water instead.

If Rob ever stopped by to quote you, you will know what I mean. He said cuts are noticeable, reason why he mentions the wrong way (with no cuts, but installed sideways) perhaps his installers are not that good, cause I got the right way and cuts are no noticeable. Btw, he adds even more sq.ft. to quote you for the right way.

These make your own options consisted of things like:
burger and fries
hot dog and fries
quesadilla - i did have this, and it was extremely greasy on the outside. It was almost as if they buttered the tortilla? gross.
asain stir-fry
and pasta dishes

I won't be going back, and I'm glad that when I did go I had a comp. However, if I get anymore comps I won't even bother going over there to use them.

Also, the desert selection is now much smaller then it used to be (however same crappy quality).",2016-04-01 19:35:48

I loove the Taro Mochi- It has a mochi taro filling and the bread is fluffly like clouds but looks like a cute cupcake.

I made an order for the Tomlin Chicken Sandwich with modifications. The Tomlin Chicken sandwich served without modifications is a chicken sandwich with mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, & tomato on a roll. Served with mild and wild wing sauces. Choice of fries or chips. 
 I requested that the onions & mushrooms be kept off of the sandwich. And that the wild wing sauce be held. Wild is too spicy for me these days. The sandwich comes with both mild and wild sauces. I also requested for Swiss cheese instead of pepper jack. And that the sandwich come with chips.  I asked for a side of honey mustard and ketchup. 
Since I ordered from home and my husband brought it back, I didn't check the order before it left the restaurant. 

What came home & I got was a chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese and red peppers. With French fries. And hot sauce and a mystery sauce. I'm not sure what the mystery sauce is. It's got a kick to it but kind of tastes like dressing. It's not honey mustard. The hot sauce isn't very tasty. I don't know what it is. But it's salty & bland. No ketchup.  However the chicken sandwich with just cheese and peppers is very tasty.

MUST TRY:
- Grilled Kalamari
- Garides Rodou (shrimps with tomato and feta sauce)

Recommended:
- Kria Poikilia (Dip platter)
- Saganaki (flambeed cheese)
- Lamb Chops
- Dolmades
- Kalamari Gemisto (good, but not an improvement on the grilled version)

(I haven't tried any of the pites. Athens pastries is so good that I'm scared to compare.)

I was not particularly impressed with the octopus. Not that it's bad.

Service has been solid, but it's based on a small sample size.

The dishes are fairly expensive. But it still compares favorably to something like Tapas, where the portion sizes are smaller.

Also, I recommend ordering things piecemeal... start with the dip platter and Grilled Kalamari. Then order more, working your way up to the heavier platters. That way the food comes out continuously but at a slow pace. You end up eating less and enjoying the food and the experience more.

Also, if you really love a particular dish, you can order another one before you're full.

The wait at the drive-through is extremely long, it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in. I was the only customer in the drive-through, after placing my order I spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected, but tolerable.

However, on the plus side there's a DRIVE-THROUGH.  Although it may take less time to just park and walk inside, the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night. The drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a day...how many more ways can I say ""amazing""??

Next - I love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to Chandler for a decent one from Boba Tea House in Lee Lee's market place complex. Not anymore! This place also sells my favorite taro milk tea. 

Finally, not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly, but in a positive way), the donuts are delicious and fresh -- I'd recommend this place over the big chains (Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme) any day!

Everything I've had from here has been spot on. I honestly don't think I've ever had a bad experience from Brew Tea- only good experiences!

There are a few tables to the right that are great for hanging out with friends or just catching up. There's ample electrical sockets as well, so if you're looking to study, it's also a solid option. It can be a little loud during peak hours. If you're studying and want some background noise but you don't want a distracting environment, try going at non-peak hours.

I've tried the almond milk tea, hokkaido milk tea, caramel milk tea, and the jasmine milk tea. They're all so very distinct in flavor, but they're all well done. The hokkaido milk tea is very fich and sweet, so consider getting it less sweet. 

The egg pudding and boba toppings are amazing. The boba isn't over cooked nor is it too hard/undercooked. They got it jusssttt right. The egg pudding is soft, slightly sweet and custardy. Everything you could ever want from light and creamy egg pudding.

Overall, everything I've ordered from Brew Tea Bar has been amazing in terms of taste, consistency, and sugar level. Just make sure to reduce the sugar level for certain drinks like the hokkaido milk tea.

It's a gorgeous space with huge windows, very chic and very bistro.

Of course the service was impeccable and our server was very knowledgable. They also make a VERY stiff drink. I forgot what the name was, but I had the signature drink. I swear I was tipsy after 2 sips. It was definitely worth whatever it cost. 

The food was very good, but I didn't wasn't really blown away by anything. The baguettes were great and so was the polenta that came as a side to my mom's entree. We had a special braised rabbit appetizer that was interesting. The bf and I both had croque madams which was surprisingly a little bland, but the fries...OMG the fries were soooo good, I wish I had room for all of them. For dessert we shared the waffles. I believe it was also a special. It was fun and interactive. Even if you don't order dessert they bring out a plate of cookies and candy for you.

Funny, when we came in here, we were asked if we had reservations and only about 3-4 tables were full.  I kinda thought they were joking, and said, no we don't, is it okay or do we have to go to Olive Garden.  Anyway, of course they were ready to accommodate us and boy did they get busy quick.

1.  Service - I am not sure, but it seems that the owners are the one to meet and greet you. They know their stuff and are very pleasant. I really felt at home.

2.  Clientele - Seems to be a lot of regulars. You know what that means!  People looking for good quality and good value keep coming back.

3.  The food - 

Bread and Olives - Wow, I kept eating the Olive dip that they made. No idea of the proper name, yet it was amazing.

Salads - Nice mixed green salad with parmesan cheese and other bits like roasted peppers and onions.

Calamari - Light, crispy tender morsels of squid.  This was recommended by the owner and it was nice.

Lasagna - The wife had this, her standby favorite and she enjoyed it.

Steak Filet - Had the steak which was named also after the owner I believe. I cannot recall the name. I am a huge converted Filet person, as normally I prefer Rib Eye.  More tasty, more succulent, more tender. I originally was going to order their equivalent of the Cioppino and they recommended the Steak. It was okay for me. A lot of sauce, I wanted it med rare and I thought it was well done. A bit chewy for my taste.  However, the taste was pleasant, the service great, the people very friendly, so I ate it.  Not my most favorite Filet in Las Vegas, yet okay.

4.  Dolci and Vino - We did not have any of the dessert as we were going back to the house for dessert and coffee.  On the wine, we did not have any, however, I did overhear others ordering and I think it is best to ask what the owners have , as they may have certain wines depending on what they like and pair with their menu.

5.  The bill - Our friend paid for us as it was the wife's birthday. It seemed that they were quite busy and had others waiting, so I got the sense the bill came quickly and then the owners come by to ask you so nicely and courteously if all was good and they hope you come back.  Very cool, and I really did not feel like i was being asked kindly to leave so they can turn the table.....

I will try this place again. I enjoyed it.  For now, I give this place a 3.5 star, so I round it to 4 and we shall see next time I come... if it is a 4 or not....",2012-03-05 04:15:34

When it came, it was served to me in a tumbler filled with ICE.  What horror.  Honestly, who serves single malts with soda or ice?  To the waitress' credit, when she saw the look of consternation on my face, she whisked it away and brought me a proper glass of Balvenie with a water back for me to add myself.

Being renovated from Sound Academy to now REBEL, the venue is nonetheless the most spacious venue down in Toronto which is great for a lot of different events (Concerts, Corporate, Raves). Lights and sound is amazing no matter where you are standing. The upstairs also has an amazing view and is perfect for people who like to have their personal space.

I think the only downside to this amazing venue is the location. It's really hard to get too and a lot of times there are other events like Cirque Du Soleil happening around it so it gets even harder to get in and get out. You either have to drive or uber and it gets annoying cause of the congestions. On the rare occasions I drive, I tend to wait anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes until I can get out without encountering any traffic.

I ordered some fried mushrooms and some of their specialty fries - the chicken/Mozzarella fries.  Also, one side of ranch because mushrooms + fries came to 14.98 and the minimum for delivery is $15.  While that part was a little irritating, I get it.  

Mushrooms - yummy.  I love fried mushrooms, and I get that most places just buy frozen ones, drop them in the fryer and call it a day.  These had some extra seasoning on them and were very tasty.  They got to my house piping hot.  5 stars!

Fries - also yummy.  The portion was huge.  Others said that the portion of the fries was skimpy, but I really disagree.  I ate these as a meal and still had about 1/3 left over (more on that in a minute).  The fries were well seasoned, with grilled chicken, mozzarella cheese, and some garlic sauce (mayo?) on top.  I could also add my choice of two extra toppings - so I chose mushrooms and tomatoes.  They were amazing.  The mushrooms were sautéed and garlicy, which the tomatoes were fresh and cool.  All together, this was an amazing dish.

Since I was home alone, I had leftovers.  So I used the leftover fries to make breakfast hash the next day.  I kind of threw it all in a pan, broke it up, cooked it until it got a little brown, and then put two eggs on top.  It was so delicious.

The prices were reasonable and the menu offered your traditional Mediterranean dishes. The owner greeted me, took my order, and was very friendly to my family. 

Everyone really enjoyed each meal and my daughter raved about the gyro. I had the Greek salad, which was excellent-- especially the tzatziki sauce on the side. I will recommend getting the dressing on the side though as it seems to come with a lot. 

My husband has the chicken shawarma plate, which wasn't like what we get in other Greek establishments, but he really enjoyed it. It had a little Middle Eastern flare to it.

We started out with some type of a spring roll appetizer but it wasnt just a plain spring roll (I cant remember exactly).  My girlfriend got the pad thai and loved it.  I dont remember the name of what I got but it was beef and vegetables stir fried and then placed into a ring of deep fried bean paste.  It was served with a little cocktail umbrella stuck in the bean ring.  The presentation was quite unusual and unique and it made the meal that much better. 

The meal was moderately priced, I think around $30 for the two of us including our app.  The service was great too, in fact our waiter recommended my dish.

We knew coming in to not over order tacos like we did the last time, which put us in good shape. To start we had the classic guacamole and the Poke appetizer. The guacamole was as good as the last time with some homemade, still warm, tortilla chips.

The Poke? One of the best appetizers we've ever had. It was served with a spicy soy dressing, whipped lime and guacamole (which we weren't expecting). You eat it over some rice crackers and it melted in your mouth.

For our tacos, we decided on the bistec and the special Korean fried chicken which were both incredible. The couple next to us overordered like we did on or first visit, you could see it in their face immediately.

We were drinking beer and a cucumber margarita that had my wife salivating... After dinner we had a pour it Reposado to go with our sangrita. They didn't have sangrita last time we were here, so I'm glad they added it to the menu (as their manager promised).

Which led us to dessert. Fresh cheesecake served in a bowl with vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, and a lime (strawberry?) sauce. I'm not even that big on cheesecake, but once again, perfection. It didn't have any ""crust"" or ""crunch"" element but the fresh berries and mint were fantastic.

It was a special occasion, but the bill was only $100, which for what we got was incredibly reasonable. I booked the reservations 3 weeks in advance, so plan ahead of you want an early enough reservation. They definitely cater to couples of two, as opposed to parties.",2016-08-15 01:23:47

We decided to stop by La Comida as it was one of the few places that allow underage diners after 8pm on East Fremont. SMH @ The Park on Fremont!  I had a great experience here at one of the Yelp Elite events earlier this year and wanted to see what the place was like without the VIP treatment. 

To begin the restaurant is pretty unique in it's design and decor. What used to previously be a laundromat has been transformed into a chic cantina style Mexican eatery with plenty of Catholic influences. The bathrooms are gender separated by pictures of Mary and Jesus while rosaries hang from the light fixtures. I wonder if anyone ever gets offended by it?

The menu is little different than most Mexican restaurants. No combo plates or nachos here, instead you find an eclectic spin on some of your south of the border dishes. The menu isn't huge but everyone should find something that they like. I ordered the Mexican burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were delicious and the burger, complete with ancho chilies and jalapeno bacon, was pretty unique. Word of caution: all of our burgers were served very rare - specify to your server if you want it cooked longer. My cousin ordered the enchiladas which would have been great if not ruined by the heavy serving of mole sauce all over them. La Comida serves unlimited family style rice and beans with their entrees for everyone at the table to share. 

Service was great. Our server was very friendly, on top of refills, and very knowledgeable about the menu. It was nice to see the manager out on the dining floor interacting with diners as well. 

You can tell La Comida specializes in margaritas from their massive tequila selection. Extra props for serving up these concoctions in a mason jar!  The walk-up window by the outdoor porch and the giant wooden swing by the bar are a nice touch,

The reason for the lack of 5 is because merely of the two issues I encountered. 1. The monthly rate was supposed to be reduced by $10 for my wife as I was told by one of their sales people. Go figure the next month and months following that never happened. Then I called back and mentioned what happened and that the rate never changed. They told me the manager would call me back, weeks, months later never a call. That's just one issue.

The 2nd is that I went in to downgrade my membership and with that mentioned the same issue about never a call back from the manager about the rate issue, but also that to downgrade my membership one level. They were happy to downgrade my membership to the lower level; however since I was required to provide a 30 day notice and I only provided a 20 day notice, not only were they like oh well on the first issue, they told me that They can't do anything about my rate downgrade for 2 more billing cycles now since I was just charged. They weren't even willing to make a 9 day exception so that my next billing cycle would be reduced to what I wanted. I can't imagine the GM or managers aren't able to do something like this, but I guess everyone needs a buck and technically I gave a 21 day notice instead. 

I find it interesting that their 30 day notice required to upgrade/downgrade turned in to them not being able to make the change this next month, but 2 months from now. I almost gave a 2 star because of this, but couldn't find it in me to do this even though their rep from a few months ago said one thing, then when I called back a month later they said another thing and then management wouldn't help in anyway at all on this visit with either issue.

We had a wonderful time and brought back with us a love of many things Belgian.  1.  Fries, the Belgians are brilliant at fries, and as a sign of good fortune, a few years ago, Point Brugge opened up in Point Breeze and catered to our cravings.  2.  Beer, the Sharp Edge has been around for long enough that we have never felt a deficit on this one.  3.  Chocolate, Chocolate Moose, and Eureka and others have made sure that we have access to the really good stuff.  But.....Number 4 True Belgian Waffles have been denied to us UNTIL NOW.  Real Belgian Waffles are NOTHING like their Eggo kin, or even like the waffle press stuff that we can find at breakfast buffets all over.  These waffles are not just pancake batter thrown into a waffle iron.  This is thrice leavened sweet dough with pearlized sugar that results in a layered waffle that is both delicate and chewy in texture.  As I sat in this very cute, very tiny space, I saw a number of folks pass (I assume based on the $3 price for a basic waffle).  This is only because they know not what they miss.  For one thing, the best (and I apologize the the good proprietors of  Waffalonia if this hurts revenue) way to eat these waffles is straight up and plain (they are sweet on their own with no accouterments).  You take them wrapped in a napkin/paper, and you can walk around Squirrel Hill tempting everyone that you pass with their aroma.  This is pretty much the way it works in Belgium--at least in Bruges.  The ice cream toppings, Nutella, etc. are great but not really critical, although as long as the toppings allow you to walk around afterwords, pile 'em on.  The point is that these waffles are designed not as breakfast treats, but sweet treats that you can walk the lovely eclectic shops of Squirrel Hill with (too bad they are not in Shadyside).  These are not your mom's waffles, unless you came from Belgium and your mom had a special waffle press, access to the right type of sugar, and the patience to let her waffle batter rise three times in order to create the perfect waffle.  If all of that applies, I humbly stand corrected.",2011-02-20 06:07:44

Granted, I will admit my fault for not reading the sign correctly for their hours between the drive-thru and the actual store. However, because of this experience and other reviews, I know that I am not the only one who got mixed up with the Hours and found it confusing. It also doesn't change the fact that I really did feel a sense of rudeness coming from one of the workers who was cleaning and just staring at me. 

But let's move on to the food now. 

When I went for my 2nd meal, I noticed the inconsistency of their food. I understand mediocre food if the prices are dirt cheap like normal fast food joints, but the prices here are much steeper, and because of that, I expect to get the same quality of food every time I go. 

The saving grace from my last review here was the fries. They were thin-cuts, super crispy, lightly salted, and just wonderful. When I came, I got soggy ones, as if they've been out from the fryer for a while now. 

So without the mix-up of the hours in my scoring, I would still rate this place at an average of three stars.",2016-12-06 16:21:55

Not a single smile on any of the staff the entire night I was there! I also feel that the prices have gone up recently, as I went in on a weeknight and I felt I was paying a fortune! At $23.99 before tips & tax, that's getting a bit much on a weeknight, even for AYCE. 

Even so, it was surprisingly busy on a Wednesday night, and we had to wait a bit for a table. Upon our arrival, we were told to wait multiple times for a table by different staff. Seemed a little annoying being told that many times and probably should have 1 person as a host, rather than 2-3. When we got seated, our dishes were dirty and couldn't get anyone's attention to replace it. Definitely not a good start to the dinner. 

We started ordering and getting our food, but was a bit hard to see if the servers understood what we were saying. No responses or reactions when taking our orders, we had to repeat ourselves in which case made them question our orders. When they brought us our food, they practically threw the dishes on our table! They even had dishes stacked on top of food on other plates while carrying them to the tables! Definitely not hygienic at all! 

The only redeeming factor was that some dishes were quite good. The Beef Sashimi was decent, the sashimi were good overall, and the teriyaki foods were good too. I would say they got the 1 star for just the food itself. 

Service is definitely not the best here. Felt like the staff were constantly annoyed and hated serving their customers. There are definitely much better AYCE Japanese restaurants in the neighbourhood. I would highly recommend going elsewhere.

First off the food is very light and a bit on the bland side. more often than not i find myself wondering if i could get away with asking for some table salt or some soy sauce but that'll defeat the purpose of eating wholesome healthy vegetarian food.

Another reason i like Veggie house is the food doesnt exactly bloat you up unlike...well pretty much everything else. It's a good feeling of full without actually physically feeling like you're gut is going to explode. 

Recommendations?
Ice cream is always a good choice as they get supplied from Perfect Scoop so expect yummy high quality hand made ice cream 100% of the time, all the time.

The crispy spicy beef has got to be one of the greatest items on the menu. Not judging this based on taste, if this was a taste game then the rating would be 5 stars not 4. This is due to the texture of the faux beef. Other items such as the kung pow beef or beef with broccoli the texture is close to a tofu like mushroom and carries a similar taste if it wasn't for the sauces.

So overall this place is definitely worth a stop for lunch but dont expect a 100% accurate vegetarian replacement for meat.

As for the vegetarian alternatives for fish...we'll see about that in the updated review...

I'll start with the good: There was a huge group of us celebrating a friend's birthday during happy hour. The sitting areas were quite cozy and perfect for a large group. There was a lot of food ordered. The happy hour prices on munchies were great. I tasted the jalapeno dip, fingerling potatoes, and the stuffed mini peppers. The dip was delicious, spicy, and rich. Fingerling potatoes were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and served with a delicious dip. Mini peppers were stuffed with a mild cheese and topped with a balsamic drizzle. So good! The cocktails were priced very well during happy hour and they were great. I had a couple Arizona mules. I also tasted a whiskey cocktail my friend had and thought it was tasty.

The bad: the service! Our server was pretty much non-existent. Most of the time we ordered our food and drinks from the bar. The bartenders were not very friendly. They spent a lot of time catering to and chatting up regulars. Our empty dishes were piling up at our table. Sadly enough, we found an empty cart nearby and cleared our table ourselves.

Wi0Sbqhay9iWsMgFHQHW0A,TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g,eHhBGqQbDpCcSpz7SZPTbA,3,3,1,1,"We were having a conversation with a local pizza maker a few months ago about the varying opinions about what constitutes ""good"" pizza. He shared with us that one of the most common opening remarks he receives from customers is: ""I'm from New York . . . ""  

Okay? And?

I guess it gives people a sense of credibility and a perceived ""edge"" over others, who lack the credentials to judge what's good vs bad when it comes to this style of pie. Given that I've never visited New York and will unlikely be going anytime soon, I'm not entirely sure what the keys are to doing the pizza right. I've just always associated it with big, floppy slices of pizza that are foldable and contain dough that's extremely high in gluten. The quality, more or less, lies within the skill of the maker and the quality of the ingredients used.  

Some say that NY crust has a distinct flavor, which is largely attributed to the minerals found in the city water. Hell, I've heard that some owners even go so far as to physically import water from New York in order to duplicate this. That's what I call hardcore dedication! Apparently, NYPD uses a specialized water filtration system that allegedly gives it the minerals required to emulate the ""New York taste"" in its crust. Whether or not it works, I wouldn't know - but it's definitely a clever little approach and a great marketing tool if anything else. 

As for their pizza, I actually don't think it's too bad in comparison to other chain-level options. Before the wood-fired and fast casual concepts consumed the city, I used to pick up pizzas quite regularly here. The crust does have somewhat of a distinct flavor and the ingredients are a notch above what you would find at many other places. In fact, I remember one instance when I went to pick up a pizza, the girl opened the box and deemed the pizza unacceptable for being just slightly overcooked. Although I said it was fine, she insisted that they make another one properly. It's nice to see some quality control in place.  

Is it the best pizza you'll ever eat? Probably not. Nor is it a place that I'd ever make it a point to visit for a Saturday night dinner. But in terms of the convenience and a quick pizza fix, I feel that they do their job just fine.

Unfortunately, I'm from Phoenix, so my opinion on New York pizza holds little value.",2016-11-12 19:51:01

-I feel very confident in saying that the Clevelander has the best burger in town.

-Patio perfect. Great drink promotions will have you sipping a cold one all afternoon in the warm sunshine.

-The seating is not what I would consider comfortable, but this is also not the place I would go to for comfort

Some of the decorations and chairs are straight from Ireland, the pub grub is all a spin on more traditional Irish fare, they've got a few Irish beers on tap and it's not unusual to spy a celtic band playing for the crowd. They do what they do well, but as Calgary's foremost Irish pub, the Joyce also charges a bit of a premium.

I love their appetizers here - the potato nachos are hilarious and delicious, and the Strawberry Brie dish is to die for. The beers on tap are very good, as is most of the food. It is a great place to stop by for lunch, or to grab a pint with friends. 

The atmosphere is pretty joyfully Irish, and I like that.",2009-11-01 04:15:11

So, like a normal human, I took them up to the toy counter and asked them if I could exchange them for a larger denomination so I didn't have to carry $20 in tokens home with me. The sent me to the front counter. Ok, fine. So I went to the front counter and spoke to the Manager who told me their policy was they couldn't allow that. Something with inventory in the tills will be off and the cashiers are held accountable for it. Lame. So I go back to the table and my fiancé walks back up there and the same Manager does it for her. So.....why as a policy does Peter Piper not want us to be able to change in our 20 tokens and just take a single $20 token? Cruddy customer service but really not entirely her fault. Stupid policy.

They had a raisin bread that was to die for - outstanding. My wife and I shared a Caesar salad and a shrimp cocktail. The Caesar salad was outstanding. Lots of mozzarella cheese. It comes on a small shell that had an excellent cheesy flavor to it. The shrimp cocktail consisted of 5 jumbo shrimp on a bed of ice with a delicious cocktail sauce that had just the right amount of horseradish. The cocktail sauce was delicious. The shrimp themselves were just ordinary. But that was OK because the presentation was beautiful, the shrimp were huge. Overall a very enjoyable dish.
Ambiance: Despite the fact that Happy Hour requires sitting in the bar area, the setting is quite lovely. Nicely spaced tables, so the conversation stays at your table. Overall, very classy.
The service was excellent. Within a couple of minutes of our sitting down, the busboy was at the tale with the bread. He was followed almost immediately by the waiter. We had decided to share our salad. They brought it to the table having been split in the kitchen. Nice presentation! 
Value: Half price for the salad and the shrimp cocktail. And because we had spent a few minutes in the casino, I was able to bring my drink from the casino into the bar area with no problem. So dinner with wine, nice setting, great service, and good food for about $10 a head. This was a great value. I will return often.",2015-09-13 02:14:53

In Depth Review: As locals we used to go to the Pink Taco for a good meal, tasty drinks & high energy atmosphere that made it a great spot for people watching. Wife and I went to the HRH this past Friday, May 9th (2014) and walked into a casino that was as dead as I have ever seen in the city for a wknd night. Music was quiet, the circle bar empty, what happened to the energy and atmosphere of the Hard Rock? Made our way past the death metal fans there for an OTEP concert and got to the Pink Taco check-in at 9pm. Had to wait a few minutes to be acknowledged and brought to our upper level inside table. The restaurant was empty and maybe a dozen tables sat, I counted 4 people at the bar. Strange vibe. Not the typical atmosphere we remembered in this restaurant in the past. 

Chips and spicy salsa sauce was delivered to the table right away. The salsa dip was delicious. No water was delivered and the spicy salsa was a bit too much as we had to sit for 10 minutes before our waiter made it to our table to introduce himself. He did stop at the table next to us first that was sat 5-6 minutes after us. We ordered drinks and the Taquitos appetizer. They were a little too chewy and hard to cut in half. My wife enjoyed them though. For our entrees we ordered the chicken Enchilada and the Carnitas Platter. Timing was OK between the appetizer and the main entrees as we waited to order the entrees until after the appetizer was served. 

The chicken enchiladas were tasty, a little messy and fell apart, but certainly tasted good! The Carnitas sampler was all over the place, the beans, rice, tortilla and grilled tomatoes were just fine. The carnitas meat was a bit hard and dried out. Some pieces were chewy and tasted like they had been cooked earlier and sat under a heat light. Not sure what that was all about? 

Wife loved her Margarita. So that is important to note. The poor girl at the bar looked beyond bored. The entire experience was all overt the board. May have just been an ""off"" night and weekend. Staff looked bored and we saw a few of them eating dinner in the back of the restaurant behind us. 

Was a bit shocked at how quiet the entire property was. Hope this is a rare exception and not the new rule over there. Mothers Day Wknd may have played into the property being slower than usual, who knows? Will we go back? Sure, but we are not going to go out of our way to go there as there is too much competition in the Mexican food department in Vegas - and I feel the Pink Taco may have lost it's edge?!

The area for larger dogs is fenced so they can be off leash (as well as the small dog section) The perk of the large dog area, is that it is A) bigger B) has obstacle courses and even a pond/lake thing for them to swim in when it gets hot!

The owners are really friendly and I have yet to encounter a terribly behaved pup or owner for that matter!

I saw on Twitter the night before that Poppy Den had a certain menu item that I went gaga over- pork belly fried rice. Now, I usually don't like to grub on swine, but there is just something about crispy pork belly that always perks my interest.

So after hearing about this dish, my husband and I headed over to Poppy Den on Thursday as we couldn't get the idea of it out of our heads!

Got a beautiful booth around 7pm.  Such a comfortable atmosphere and gorgeous interior!

Started off with the Pumpkin Woodchuck Cider.  Whaaaattt?! Yes and it was delicious!

My husband and I decided to order two appetizers for dinner and share:
1. Crispy Crab Dumplings w/ tomato jam
-delicious! Great crab flavor and the tomato jam had a lil kick to it (not acidic at all!)
2. Pork Belly Fried Rice w/ Kimchi
-ummm holy shit! Interesting & amazing flavors (I can't even explain cause I have no idea what all the flavors are!).  Pork belly was perfectly crispy, the rice is a perfect 10: fluffy and not over cooked, great egg and veggies.  This also had a lil kick of spice.

We loved this so much- we ordered another one to go so we had lunch the next day!!!

We ended the night with the homemade fortune cookie w/ fresh berries, pineapple ginger sorbet and a strawberry whipped cream.  This was a refreshing and light way to end the night.

While the entire menu had incredible choices and was super hard to choose, it would be hard to come back and not order that pork belly fried rice, although, their menu changes, so it might not be around for long!",2013-11-17 05:17:01

Their spring rolls are kinda gross. There eggrolls are standard. The chicken wings are like crack. They have MSG in them and are spicy.

Every other time I've gone, the place has been packed with a wait of over 30 min - and no space at the bar to even cozy up for a beer. Fortunately, a friend and I made it there early during the week (5pm on a Wednesday - only a few tables taken). 

Well worth the wait! Every night they have different specials, with Wednesdays being ""vegetarian/vegan"". While the vegan options were limited, the regular menu has plenty of things for vegetarians (I'm a reformed vegetarian). The vegetarian cheese special had a goat cheese with maple syrup and figs. The waitress highly suggested it, and won applause - it is one of the best appetizers ever. My dining mate and I fought over the last bits and left the plate clean. I can't speak of other servers, but ours was attentive, funny, and had great suggestions. Never once did my water glass go empty.

1ekmjgWn1knK55pbyH_1Kg,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw,5,5,2,2,"Until the Red Rock (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2) came along, the Green Valley Ranch was option numero uno among the growing property list of the Station Casino empire. It was and still is a very complete resort, a property with a little bit of everything. GVR recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, which in Vegas years means the novelty has worn off slightly. Despite that, it remains a great destination for all and is a great value for any stay.

Similarly to Red Rock, GVR is off the strip. So off as a matter of fact, it's in Henderson (i.e. not Las Vegas). Relax I-only-stay-on-the-strip fans, it's a 10-15 minute shuttle ride at best from McCarran airport and is probably faster to get to than the Sahara, which is technically still on the strip. But like any good off strip property and especially those in Henderson, it means this joint is likely a locals casino (#1).

As a hotel, GVR is definitely delivers. There are a multitude of room types, all of which are modern, contemporary, and feature some of the most comfy beds I've slept in. Everything from the regular sized rooms to the mega suites that could sleep 30, are available and for far more reasonable prices than most of the ones along Las Vegas Blvd. And at nearly 500 of them, there is plenty to choose from. I say, try to score a room near their pools - the view of the strip is nice, as is the amenities poolside.

Casino enthusiasts should be able to appreciate the large casino space, which offers over 70 table games and over 2,000 gaming machines. Blackjack fans should be able to get their fill of over 30 tables dedicated to the game and poker fans will have a  decent variety of games to chose from as well. Their player rewards program is competitive, comp points from play is definitely transferrable to other Station properties. Dealers are usually quite friendly and the cigarette smoke is controlled rather well for a large space. The cocktail staff could definitely use an upgrade, but I digress.

In terms of eats, there is a decent selection but the outstanding venues are a bit limited. Hank's Steaks & Martinis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson) is the obvious winner of the bunch and then there is the pitiful TIdes Oyster Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tides-oyster-bar-henderson). I echo the pains of eating at Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-cafe-henderson) though the Feast (Around The World) Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/feast-buffet-henderson-3) has been fantastic and mediocre at varying times. It's no In-N-Out, but Fatburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fatburger-henderson-2) is gut bustingly good. Sushi + Sake (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-sake-las-vegas) is a fun time, especially for their AYCE deal. Italian joint Terra Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-verde-henderson) is decent during lunch, though I much preferred it when Hell's Kitchen winner Rock was still running the show.

GVR has a lot of random amenities, which really distinguish it from it's nearby (or far away depending on how you look at it) properties. Like the Red Rock, there is a movie theater. The Pond (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pond-henderson), is a real cool and relaxing alternative to their sick pools. A great place to catch an outdoor concert is at The Backyard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-backyard-henderson) and Ovation (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-henderson) is a real concert venue. Every casino has a center floor bar and in GVR's case, it's the Drop Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-bar-henderson). I'd also recommend visiting the Lobby Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobby-bar-henderson) as it's probably the closest thing to a club GVR has. The property may not boast a lot of shopping, but it sits right next to The District (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-district-at-green-valley-ranch-henderson), a village of boutique and luxury stores, just perfect for those looking for an escape from the casino. It's rarely ever crowded, but then again, neither is the casino.

Though GVR could probably use an upgrade on a few things, the property itself is good enough to warrant a 4.5 star rating. It's versatile, stylish, and spacious enough for all visitors. Folks who are teetering the idea of staying off the strip with almost everything at their disposal, should consider GVR as their next destination.

It's tough not to order off the wall chalkboard menu but I did get the starter pork belly lettuce wraps last time from the actual menu. My husband shushed me because I apparently made a bit too much of an enthusiastic sound as I took my first bite. My fingers were sticky by the time I was done and I didn't care. I did share 1 with hubby and I believe he made a similar noise as what I did & I also remember him saying 'wow!' Pork belly cooked & sauced to absolute perfection.

My chalkboard dinner entree was veal medallions with roasted root veggies, spinach & black truffle hollandaise that I didn't leave a single speck of on my plate. The veal was super tender and a really nicely sized portion, the sauce to die for! 

Service was fabulous on both of our visits. Reservations are always required here with some advance notice to get what you want. You must call because they aren't on Open Table. The restaurant is small and usually packed but there's still enough room between diners that you don't hear their conversations.

I started off with the Korean cooler. Tasted just like the yogurt drink I used to drink as a kid mixed w soju. Very good. Then I started off w panfried gyoza and crispy shrimp. I was a little disappointed there weren't more happy hour options besides $2 off selected menu items. 

Then I ordered the jalapeño albacore crisp dish which came out so pretty topped w flowers. It was delicious! The mix of jalapeño n cucumber w the albacore was delicious! 

I also got the tataki maki signature roll. Spicy crab, shrimp tempura, avocado topped w seared tuna was not what I was expecting. I personally did not like the chimichurri sauce topped on the roll. It was a weird combo and wished I got it w out this sauce.

As my main dish, I got the kimchi fried rice (a Korean favorite of mine! Comfort food!) and it was the best!! The portion was huge so I was happy to take some left overs.

This place is always crowded and there is a line. You go inside and write your name on the list. The wait list does move at a decent pace so you won't be waiting forever. On average, I've waited 20-40 minutes. Meanwhile, you can get a beer from the bar. They have a large selection and used to have flights of beer. Their fresh-squeezed lemonade is so good! There's also a waiting area with a table outside where you can enjoy a beverage. 

You can't go wrong with any of the food on their menu. Everything is delicious - from their entrees (e.g., brisket sandwiches, smoked chicken, smoked catfish; my fave: burnt ends) to their sides (e.g., twice-baked casserole, pit beans; my fave: cornbread embedded with bits of smoked meats and beans) to their bbq sauces (my fave: Milo's Mustard; runner up: Georgia Peach). There are daily specials as well. Even if you picked something at random, it'll be delicious. 

The space is small for the crowd that it tries to accommodate. It can get hot in the summer. There are booths, a few tables, and bar seating.

pTjfWQTjkOiZFvDmWIzqZg,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,ii9kqE9s4456Jn9asz-BPQ,4,1,0,0,"I like a good pizza. Scratch that - I love a good pizza. It has gotten to the point where I am experimenting at home making my own... and getting decent success as I keep working out the kinks. It's not perfect but in the meantime, that is what good restaurants are for, am I right? Last month, following a wonderful few hours at La Mondiale de la Biere enjoying many many brews, my friends and I got the hankering for some pizza. Thinking about the options closest to us, I figured a visit to BEVO in the old port was in order. So we casually walked over ready to enjoy some good Italian cuisine.

Located just off Place Jacques Cartier in the heart of the Old Port, BEVO visually is in keeping with many of the Old Port establishments - a mix of the old brick and stone foundations of the area buildings with some more modern elements to add some glam. In this case, BEVO uses red tinted glass around the atrium, a very large chandelier and an tile entry wait which includes a glass wine cellar. The first floor has a huge bar area where the backbar is lit up in red and the front of the actual bar is just a light box. Add an area where there are 70s-style hanging bubble chairs and you have a spot that is clearly a solid happy hour zone.

On this occasion however, we were there too late for happy hour and too early for any late-night bar scene. The two dining areas are more straight forward than the bar - wooden tables and chairs, paper tablecloths with cute info-graphics about pizza making and red checkered napkins for that little old school Italian restaurant touch. On the first floor, the wood-fired pizza oven is visible for all to see and gets you excited for what is to come.

Our first starter was salsiccia e Rapini - a house made sausage with garlic rapini. The sausages were delicious although a little small for my liking. Rapini is one of those vegetables you either love or hate - personally I am a fan of its bitterness. The combination of bitter with the garlic made a nice partner to the fatty sausages.

The second starter was arancino - saffron parmesan risotto balls with meat ragu and mozzarella. The risotto ball itself had a good crust to it and that didn't come at the cost of drying out the risotto itself. It still had nice creaminess although I really didn't get any hint of saffron personally. The meat ragu draped over it had a nice meaty richness to it and paired very well to the ball itself. Like the previous starter, I just wanted more!

Because one of the friends with me doesn't eat cheese (i know, i know.... i've tried to show him the error of his ways) we did order one non-pizza main dish: the cavatelli bolognese - dumplings, meat ragu and fresh parsley. Excellent plate of pasta - same delicious meat ragu as before with the perfectly cooked cavatelli. A little bit of parmesan would have been nice but that was a lost battle from the start in this case.

Now we arrive to the main attraction: the pizzas. First up, I got the parma in blanco - prosciutto di parma, arugula and reggiano. This is probably my favourite pizza type when dealing with classic thin crust pizzas. The salty rich prosciutto, the pepper arugula, the sharp reggiano and a little bit of olive oil... a perfect balance of items on top of a pizza. However, all of that is wasted if the actual pizza isn't up to snuff. BEVO doesn't have that problem. The wood-fired oven gives a nice crispness to the bottom but allows for just enough rise to create some chewiness. A wonderful pizza.

The other pizza we ordered was the cotto e bocconcini - prosciutto cotto, portobello, tomato sauce, mozzarella and bocconcini. Same solid crust as my pizza although this one had been cooked a little more as the extra charring around the edge demonstrated. The melted bocconcini brought some more creaminess compared to just the mozzarella and the earthy portobellos added some contrast from the prosciutto. Another excellent pizza.

BEVO is a solid experience from beginning to end. Solid starters, delicious pizzas and good pasta. All the beers from Beerfest prior eliminated our desire to test the cocktail and wine lists which seemed interesting. There was also the temptation of the nutella pizza for dessert but we decided to pass. Just gives me another reason to return. If you are looking for a good pizza in the Old Port or just a place to go enjoy a drink and a quick bit, BEVO is worth your consideration.

Cheers!",2014-07-16 15:30:10

The young lady behind the counter didn't notice it until I walked up and she removed the sign. I just found that strange for a 24 hour store... 

So she didn't even say hi or good morning, just continue talking to her 2 other co workers. When one of them walked over, with a damaged item, she pulled out her cell phone and yelled out ""Omg let me take a picture!"" So this is all happening as I am swiping my card and entering my pin. 

One of the older cashiers says in a whisper ""You have a customer""...

The young girl says ""I know, but I have to capture this moment""

If you're really wanting that brunch, the extra 30min of sleep is not worth the extra hour of waiting at the door! Go early!

Ordered the Blueberry Hill, which is a lot bigger than it looks! The tower of pancakes get bigger as you get to the bottom (4 pancakes), and they are super fluffy!! The brown sugar butter was amazing and I wish they gave me more... The blueberry sauce/jam was just alright, nothing special. Bacon was fried very nicely and again, wish there was more than just 2 strips because the saltiness went very well with the sweetness of the pancake (that is, until I finished all the bacon). 

Service was great- water and coffee never hit the bottom. Although I wish I could've seen the separate coffee menu earlier because drip coffee and specialty coffee like an americano are all $3.

The ""tamales"" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it, rubbery, frozen, slightly off flavored. The rice and beans, generic.

The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.

Those that know me know that I prefer to eat breakfast dishes all day every day.  It was just a matter of time before I finally got to check this breakfast bookmark off my list.  Metro Diner is a hit with locals and it's not uncommon for there to be a wait. I attempted to dine here about a month ago, there was 3 groups ahead of me, and I didn't want to wait.  I finally had the opportunity to dine here last week on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was full and the restaurant was busy.  There was plenty of tables open and I was immediately seated.  Metro Diner's menu is extensive.  They're known for their Charleston Shrimp & Grits, the Fried Chicken & Waffles, and the Bold City Burger.  I know what I want and it was their special...The Meat Lover's Omelet.  This meal consists of 3 large eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage. The meal also comes with toast and grits.  In my opinion, the grits were a little too salty for my liking.  My omelet was good and highly recommend.  I thought that the portions are average and the prices just a tad higher than the other breakfast joints in town.  The highlight of my first experience at Metro Diner is the service.  The entire staff was very attentive and checked up on me multiple times.  Overall, I recommend Metro Diner because they have so many options and the service is top notch.",2017-05-30 23:43:28

One friend had the open-faced sloppy joséphine ($15) - duck fat confit lamb shank, spicy antipasto-aioli, shredded iceberg and focaccia. She particularly liked the bread. Unfortunately, I didn't try any of it because of my dislike for lamb. 

The bday girl and I shared two things- the first being the funghi flatbread ($17) with woodland mushrooms, chèvre noir, grand chevalier chèvre, garlic paste, truffle oil, caramelized onion and fresh thyme. This came highly recommended by her co-worker, but unfortunately, neither of us read the description properly. It turned out that chèvre was French for goat cheese, something that both of us hated! Anyway, we tried our best to pick off all the cheese, but despite our best efforts, we still weren't able to. 

We also shared the Buckingham blanket ($14)- rare flank steak, arugula, caramelized onions, wasabi-aioli, Yorkshire wrap and red-wine jus. I was intrigued by the concept of a Yorkshire wrap, but was somewhat disappointed that it was pretty much like a regular pita. The filling was nice, but the flavours were a little one-note. I wished the caramelized onions were sweeter. That said, I did enjoy dipping my sandwich into the red wine jus. The side of fries was pretty good and we pretty much finished it all. 

On the whole, I thought the food here was decent, but nothing really wowed me. But to be fair, I can't really give a sound assessment because the only thing I could judge was the Buckingham blanket. In the future, I'll be more careful about ordering things with goat cheese.",2013-05-15 23:18:42

Upon further inspection, we determined that the menu looked pretty good, and that it looked like Neapolitan style pizza cooked in a pizza oven- our favourite!

We didn't make a reservation, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes before being seated.  Funny, because when we were seated, we found that probably 30% of the restaurant's tables were empty.  Maybe they were understaffed on this particular Saturday night?

The server we did have was extremely slow at everything from taking our order to bringing out our drinks and refilling our water, and then finally taking forever to bring our bill.

There were four of us, and we each had ceaser salads, and determined that we'd share the truffle and margherita pizzas.  The salads were great, no complaints there, as was the margherita pizza.  The truffle pizza was completely overwhelming, and I think it has put me off truffles for a little while!  Too much truffle!!

Ultimately, looking back on how much time we spent debating over which pizzas to choose, I think some of the choices were a little too ""out there"" and there seemed to be something on each one of them that one of our group couldn't handle.

Definitely wouldn't return to Five50, considering all of the other choices for food in Vegas.  To get more stars in Vegas I have to leave feeling not only satisfied, but like I'd return for another meal.",2013-10-08 18:41:55

They also have a small variety of baked goods should you be in the mood for food.  The prices are a tad expensive but that is to be expected from a third wave coffee place.

They serve up Dispatch coffee which admittedly isn't my personal favourite but it still beats the major chains by a long shot.  I got a latte and the espresso was on the sour side which was expected as Dispatch espresso usually is that way.  The milk diluted that sourness though so it wasn't too bad.  I also was in need of a snack so I got a chocolate chip cookie to satisfy my hunger.  The cookie was fresh and moist and ever so delicious!

I love its location (Town Square is just so convenient), the ambience, the sophisticated, yet casual decor, and most importantly, the food (and the drinks). I love planning lunches here with girlfriends, intimate dinners with my fiancé, or happy hour after a day of shopping. It's always wonderful.

I haven't had a meal that I've disliked, but of course there are stand-out dishes. I really enjoyed the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper (Hawaiian Red Sea Salt, Wasabi Soy Butter, Almond Rice, Asparagus), Rustic Chicken Pasta (Whole Wheat Spaghettini, Grape Tomatoes, Spinach, Cippolinis, White Wine Broth), and Seared Ahi Tuna & Kale Salad (Lemongrass Crust, Edamame, Corn, Hearts of Palm, Mushrooms, Pine Nuts, Tahini Miso Dressing). I have enjoyed the other dishes as well, but these I would order again and again. 

During happy hour, I really like the Blackened Fish Tacos (Tomato Relish, Chipotle Aïoli, Lime Sour Cream, Asian Slaw) and Jerk Chicken Lollipops (Macadamia Nuts, Jerk Remoulade). The World Famous Coconut Shrimp (served with Papaya-Mango Chutney and Asian Slaw) make a tasty appetizer and their desserts are crazy good! My favorites are the Piña Colada Cake (Vanilla Cake, Myers Dark Rum, Diced Pineapple, White Chocolate Mousse,Toasted Coconut) and the Pineapple Creme Brûlée (Tahitian Vanilla Bean, White Chocolate Mousse). Seriously make room for these desserts and you won't regret it!

I love the island-themed cocktails - they're potent while tasty. The Pineapple Plantation (Van Gogh Pineapple, Honey, Muddled Pineapple, Lemon) and their Classic Mojito (Cruzan Citrus, Cane Syrup, Mint, Hand-Pressed Lime, Soda) are great! They're also usually $11-12, but just $6-7 during Happy Hour!!

Overall, they have great seafood and wonderful flavors. The service has been great every time I've dined as well. Keep in the mind that Happy Hour (4-7pm daily with a good selection) is only offered at the bar, but there are tables surrounding it as well! They also take Open Table reservations for dining in.",2013-10-08 09:07:30

This was usually reserved for my birthday but we've started doing this for hers as well, determined to conquer Toronto's Afternoon Tea options. What can we say? We love a good crustless sandwich, hot brew and a good gossip session. 

VIBE 
DEQ wasn't what I expected. I think I thought it was going to be more ""formal"" and though everything in the Ritz is formal, this had a nice, casual atmosphere to it. Decor is beige and black with hints of white. Chairs are comfortable which you will need if you are around for over two hours. 

Service is top notch, as always. There was no menu. Everything was recited by memory and with a smile. 

We didn't have a chance to see their Terrace done up but apparently it is the HOT spot and looks gorgeous. Another time! 

WE ATE/DRANK 
We had the NOT SO classic tea added to the Afternoon ""Tease"" which is their afternoon tea with the option of alcohol. I had the Berry Berry Bramble. This includes black berries, citrus and sparkling wine. For me, it was a bit too acidic. I tasted my friend's choice: pinot grigio, citrus, soda and felt like it was too dry and strong. I personally wouldn't order the drinks again if I were back. 

What's interesting about the presentation of the tea compared to other places is that the server brings you out about eight choices in a box and names each one and gets you to smell the tea before you make a selection. I think it's a bit time consuming. It's a nice gesture but time consuming, especially if it's busy. It's also a bit awkward. I didn't feel like the tea options were on par with its competitors but the teas we did have (chai and peppermint) were fantastic and topped up. 

Now onto the FOOD! 
As you can tell, this is not your typical tea sesh. The presentation of the sandwiches and sweets comes in a circular tiered object (I'm not sure what else to call it).  But it works and doesn't take up a lot of room on the table. 

I LOVED the salmon croissant sandwiches. It was a good size and the cream cheese had a great dill kick to it. Favourite! 

Everything was fantastic but we enjoyed the chocolate truffle, chocolate mousse cake topped with raspberries, madelines and scones. They give you a cute little ceramic boite for the cream and two choices of jams. I wasn't a fan of the marmalade but was a fan of the strawberry jam. You also get two raisin scones and two regular scones. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
It was a delicious, indulgent afternoon tea that made me feel at my utmost leisurely. Go in with an empty stomach because you will be rewarded. For those looking for a non-tradition afternoon tea experience, I would say this is a good bet and even better if you can get the terrace in the summer!",2012-06-04 05:07:25

Which is to say that douchebag vegans have ruined the concept for everyone, since the popular vision is an emaciated hipster with BO berating you for killing the planet.  But there's another kind of casual veganism, one that involves actually just liking the taste of the food and wanting the health benefits....

...and you know what?  The Flaming Ice Cube is cozy. The place is small, but comfortable.  The staff smile and will answer your questions.  And they all look healthy, happy, and at ease, which means you will be too.  

Let us be honest and say that if you're seeking for the heights of vegan cuisine, you'll want Pura Vida a few doors down.  But Flaming Ice Cube is about sandwiches, smoothies, wraps, and muffins - quick lunch fare, served tastefully.  It's kind of like a great B-movie, like, say, The Princess Bride or Galaxy Quest - they weren't shooting for high art when they made their films, but like Babe Ruth, they pointed their finger and hit the ball right to that goddamned home run. 

...did I just mix sports metaphors with movie metaphors while describing food?  Crap, I did.  In any case, what you get are sandwiches and veggie burgers - never the pinnacle of haute cuisine - but the sandwiches are triple-A sandwiches.  

The sandwiches, it must be said, focus pretty heavily on the meat-alternatives - you can have a variety of soyburgers and tempeh.  But they're smart enough to realize that nothing is going to replace the taste of a juicy burger, so all the sandwiches concentrate on the flavor you put on top of the burger.  So you get pesto burgers with cheese topping, or chickenless salad sandwich with a lot of vegan mayo, or mushroom burgers with cheese and onions.  Which makes the burgers pretty tasty. 

Also tasty: their smoothies, which may be the best in town.  They're pure vegan, which is to say you're getting yogurt and not a lot of corn syrup (if any!), but they do layer the flavors so they're amazing and candylike. 

The disappointment is their hummus, which is a little dry and tasteless.  But their side dishes, which change daily, are usually very yummy, and today I had a marinara ""meatball"" sub that I couldn't have told you was faked.  (Again, you put the ""meat"" in enough zingy sauces and ricotta cheese, and you won't notice it ain't meat.)  

Also, they have vegan cupcakes, which are damn delicious.  As someone who'd never had a vegan cupcake, I approached it like it was carob - which is to say, the kind of thing someone would only say ""tastes like chocolate"" if they'd forgotten what chocolate tasted like - and I couldn't tell it wasn't filled with eggs.  It was moist (unlike some of the vegan cupcakes I've tasted since, which err on the dry side) and the frosting was delectable.  

So for the price, this is a slam dunk.  It's a comfort restaurant, with thoughtful design and placement and very nice people.  It might just change your mind about this whole vegan idea.  It makes me happy to know they're in Cleveland.",2013-03-21 23:20:59

There are many places close to me in Peoria. Until you start looking you don't realize just how many places there are. This is one place I had not been. So far this is the best place I have tried. Remember this was just the first visit so until I get in several visits and try more of the menu will I really know how much I like them. The star rating could go up or down. The service was great. The meal was about $2.00 more than I have been paying for something similar. It was better tasting. Fresh distinct tastes. I am looking forward to a repeat visit.,2012-05-06 16:07:29

This place is a typical diner and you get an authentic diner experience. It's not over-stylized or contrived like ""5 & Don't Eat Here"" and the value for the price is incomparable.

My friend Jason K introduced me to this place years ago and I forgot about it.  The BF & I recently started going again as he's a breakfast fanatic and I love the wide variety and selections they offer from brekkies to lunch offerings.  A few faves include:

- The Nicholson ( massive omelette of sausage, onions, peppers, folded around an order of has browns and covered with cheese).  This big boy is HUMUNGO and only for the most massive of appetites.

- Turkey Club (the fries are decent and the cole slaw is delish!)

- Pancakes are light, fluffy & filling

- Packard Breakfast Burrito - eggs, sausage, diced ham, hash browns, cheddar all wrapped up in a delightful tortilla & served with salsa & sour cream

- Three Duces (the name is disgusting but it's my BF's fave) 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon

Admittedly it gets busy in here on the weekends but we've never really had to wait more than 2 minutes for a table and the food comes in fair order. 

The servers are fast, efficient and no-nonsense.  They serve you, check-in on everything & refill drinks but they don't bug you.

There's hilarious hand-made signage everywhere that makes me laugh every time I'm in.  Note that they're only open until 2pm, but if you get your ass outta bed like a normal person it wont be an issue to enjoy the deliciousness that is Fast Eddie's Diner!",2011-06-05 17:35:19

When I first moved here, one of the things I noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to Asian cuisine. So nice to see something a little less common like Cambodian food get represented. 

The spring rolls are a must. For $2, you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken, shrimp, cilantro, carrots, etc. The beef salad is also a winner. The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul. The sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice. One day, I got one plus a roll to go--all under $6. Of the desserts, everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once. The tapioca is my favorite. Light and warm. 

The best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind Cambodian family. I have spoken with the chef/owner's son every time I go in. A real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room. Speaking of, I love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on Cambodia at every table. 

I really, really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer. I've been disturbed by the lack of customers I've seen a few times. I want this restaurant to really succeed.

They close at 3 to prepare for the dinner rush so come early if you want the lunch menu. It isn't as extensive as the dinner menu though. 

I ordered the tan-tan noodles combo (or something along the lines) which was around $14. It was a reasonable price for what you paid for. Portions are generous if not reasonable and it comes with a side rice dish along with two other small side dishes. The soup flavour is A+ and the noodles are nice and chewy. 

For dessert I ordered the black sesame gelato which was really good, I must say. I also ordered the frozen matcha creme brûlée which was really good and creamy on its own; personally I liked it better without the red bean saucing.

We were cruising around and discovered that the fish markets will shuck your oysters.  We approached the first one we saw a little tentatively, not entirely sure that they would be shucking oysters at 10am.  Everyone looked like they were still busy opening shop.  Anyway, when a little Filipina lady saw us, she quickly bustled over and offered her help.  After not seeing any in the rest of the market, we very much appreciated her hospitality.

We ended up getting a dozen oysters (2 each of 6 varieties) and she quickly and expertly shucked them for us.  (There were a few shards but no one's perfect.)  Their standing bar was nicely stocked with hot sauces, sea salt, pepper, ponzu, etc. but she also ended up bringing lemon wedges, wasabi and three mignonettes out for us.  This was interesting especially since we had to BUY the cocktail sauce??

Service was pretty spot on- and everything was delicious.

5  out of 6 of us ordered their American Kobe Beef Rib Cap. Medium Rare. This is a Steak, this is what mouth watering was based upon. You needn't venture to any other entree. Even your server will tell you that. The roasted onion garnish is surprising, yet perfectly harmonious. ($65)

Everyone seemed to rave about the complementary fries, they were good, but I don't understand the hype.

We began with half protions the Ceasar Salad- complete with anchovie, and when my Aunt wanted a little extra, they didn't hesitate to indulge in her request.

Our Sommelier was 'sort of' helpful. My table was happy with my choice, but I think had he been a bit more descriptive or able to communicate with me, the wine would have been exceedingly more impressive and we might have spent a bit more on the bottle in the end.

For sides, the Scalloped Potatoes were the most memorable and delicious of the four we chose. (mac and cheese, asparagus, ?)

Dessert was a real treat. There was some kind of pecan maple carmel something or other dish with Beignets that was incredible.

Our server was excellent, but I couldn't help but notice a table of 5 looking around uncomfortable for someone to help them throughout our Entire dessert.

This deal includes an appetizer, two pasta entrees, desert and your choice of two pasta entrees to take home.  Just think about that---that's a sh-load food for $40.

As our appetizer we ordered a fried zucchini dish which was fresh, crisp and came with this absolutely delicious sauce.  Definitely try it.  For our entrees we ordered the egglaplant parm, which was pretty much perfect, as well as the cheese ravioli which was rich, but yet satisfying and not overbearing.  To finish things off we had a slice of cheescake which was slightly fluffy, but nevertheless tasty and enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.

The next day I was split the aglio bowtie pasta and fettuccine Alfredo with my mom and brother.  The bowtie pasta was my favorite dish from Maggianos.  It was topped with some veggies and had a very nice olive-oil and Parmesan cheese based topping to it.  The fettuccine alfedo also was tasty, though was a bit too rich for my tastes.

Our server was incredibly witty and personable and not in an annoying way. In an awesome way.  The experience of sitting outside while also watching the chefs do their thing is definitely 5 stars. The turquoise glassware our water was served in was so unique. And the MUSIC ahhhhh amazing. It was faint, but I definitely heard some of The Weeknd and Wiz. 

My favorite cocktails always seem to center around cucumber... so I was really excited to try the Spicy Cucumber margarita ($10). It did not disappoint. The exact right combination of Espolon tequila, cucumber, lime, and Serrano....  I can almost still taste it.... seriously, so good. 

We started with the build your own guac... what! Awesome. There are lots of add ons to select from (we opted for pineapple, goat cheese, and smoked salmon) and the portion was generous. 

We split the Baja tacos ($12) and the special beef barbacoa tacos ($13) (spicy cabbage, sesame seed salsa, avocado). The tacos themselves only get a 3.5 or 4. They were good, not great... and for the price I was hoping for great.  I also prefer grilled fish tacos instead of fried... but the beef was flavorful and tender.

They do not season the zucchini, it's battered and deep fried. But, I like my zucchinis plain usually, maybe grilled for a little more flavor. Overall, it's more healthy grilled, steamed, or stir fried.

I have to tell you, those zucchinis are Albertson's size and cut into quarters. So, if you are expecting fast food bites, think again.

I was glad to see this nearby from my work from the Grabb app. With Chipotle being in the spotlight and close by it's easy to miss this joint which is a little walk east from Yonge and Dundas.

Food
Must try their fish burrito! I really like their haddock version which is a bit cheaper and I think comparable to the halibut. 

Service
I ordered from my grabb app which allows me to skip the line and have it prepared in advance to pick up. (FYI Use promo code GW2AI for $5 off food/drink when you order). I arrived maybe around 15 mins after I ordered. I realize they STILL haven't even prepared my food yet. Apparently the manager explained that they normally prepare the burrito bowls without a wrap once you arrive because it prevents it from being cold. This defeats the purpose of ordering from the app. They haven't even put the fish in the fryer yet when I arrived. They should at least have the toppings ready to be assembled. Manager said for next time to leave a comment on the order to say that you want it ready for pick up. This certainly doesn't need to be stated in any other restaurant when I order from Grabb, it's expected. I have a feeling they were just busy and forgot to start on my order earlier. 

Environment 
No seating, small take out joint. But if you need a seat, there are neighbouring food courts you can hit up after you order. 

Overall 
I like it better than Chipotle because it's tastier and is has fish option, which I find taste better than the meat. Beware when you're ordering the no wrap from a take out app -You have to explicitly state that it should be ready for take out or expect to wait another 10 mins or so. A little annoying when you're hungry and tight on time.",2016-04-01 00:33:31

Windsor has been a bit of a let down.  We did dinner with friends here a few weeks ago, particularly this restaurant for the kids menu and our friends had 3 kids under 10.  Good idea? Yes.  Dinner for 8 was good and affordable.  I purposefully ordered a slightly bland meal due to preparing for a half marathon later that week.

Cocktails are good.  Apps are yummy.  But goodness me, do not come here when it's actually busy.  We had a group of 8 so we were able to get a reservation for dinner.  All of that was fine and we finished with ice cream at Churn.  It was a good night.

Brunch.  NO.  We arrived at 12:15.  We're post church brunchers.  We waited for 45 minutes to finally sit down, order a pitcher of pimms, and there was NO PIMMS in the pimms.  It tasted like lemon juice.  We asked to switch it out for a pitcher of beer (bad idea for this girl who doesn't really tolerate gluten).  Then we ordered.  Loaded chips, frittata for me, matador for husband, donuts to share.  No donuts.  How do you run out of donuts?  Seriously?  He comes back, no matador.  So, we have bad pimms, no donuts, and no matador.  All the food my husband was looking forward to, was a disappointment or unavailable.  

My frittata was decent, husband's basic breakfast unappealing (I make a better basic than that) and the fruit cup saddening.  It's summer -- where were the berries!  Neither one of us was in the mood for beer so that didn't life our spirits.  

Our lesson: don't go to brunch here.  The most depressing thing was that we tried it because we enjoyed our last experience.  And this experience we did not enjoy.  We know of other places where it may not be as gourmet, but we're in and out quickly and always leave happy.  What makes me really sad is that we probably won't return or recommend this restaurant.

The store is much smaller than the Markham location. I think this location is more meant for take-out order, as there were very few tables, and the seats weren't that comfortable. You order at the counter, and once your order is ready, they call it all from the counter, and you pick it up yourself. This is very different from the Markham location, as the Markham ZenQ is actually a sit-down restaurant. This location is also a lot less busy, as the whole time I was there, I didn't see that many customers come in.

I ordered the Milk Tea Creamy Frappe, which comes with tapioca and lychee jelly. This is one of my favourite menu items at ZenQ. I love the texture of the frappe, and the milk tea flavour is infused in very well! The portions at ZenQ are huge. I shared this with my friend, and the two of us could not finish the entire bowl.

I ordered the fish burger, which was $4.99 + tax. It was more a fish sandwich than a burger, given that it was a grouper fillet, and not a patty. I'd rather it as a sandwich. More fish for me! The bun to grouper ratio was decent. There was lettuce, tomato, and processed cheese on my burger as well, which was surprisingly generous of them. To my recollection, there was no sauce, but it didn't need sauce. The grouper was cooked to order, the bun was toasted, and because the bun and grouper were hot, the cheese was melty. The grouper was very juicy, and seasoned just right. It was definitely the star of the show.

I'm guessing this is mostly a takeout place. There's one table for two inside, but the store itself is awkwardly shaped and it's difficult to get in and out of if someone else is standing inside. They do have a table or two outside in their tiny patio, but it was raining that day, so I didn't want to eat outside. I was waiting inside, sitting on a stool. When my order was ready, the owner told me to sit, moved a table over for me, and moved a chair from outside in so I could sit inside. It was incredibly kind of him, especially because I said he really didn't have to do that for me. 

If you like fish sandwiches, this is a great one for a fantastic price. I highly recommend it.",2017-10-26 00:20:28

The type of comfort food I love involves a hot bowl of rice and a hearty piece of protein (preferably grilled or fried) -- like Chicken Teriyaki.

Sushi Xtra has one tasty Chicken Teriyaki.  Chicken is juicy, moist and wonderfully caramelized.  It has good balance of color and smoky flavor that I look for.

Their sushi is not bad either, especially Dragon Rolls and Spider Rolls.  Shrimp tempura and soft shell crab are always crispy.

Friendly service, always a delightful experience.  An extra plus:  Reasonably priced.

I ordered the strawberry, banana, nutella and a bottle of water.   I stood there and watched as it was cooked and filled.  So I saw him pile the strawberries in really early and then cut up a half rotten banana right on top.   The entire thing was warm all the way through, which did not hit the spot in 85 degree weather.  I'd have preferred the fruit to be a little less cooked; because served warm as it was, it was a mushy mess.

My HOA told me I needed to fix the issue or they would not approve the sunscreens even though they were already on the window and had been for a long time.

I called CC Sunscreens and spoke to Seth and he came out and looked at the issue and said it was a mistake they made and they would rectify it at no charge even though I offered to compensate them some way since it had been so long ago.

We decided to go here after all the rave reviews we had from friends. We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken. We decided to split the queso and a chicken quesadilla. Our waitress (as listed per the receipt) was JWOO. She was spunky with piercings and was perfect. She was quick and even asked the kitchen to split the quesadilla between 2 plates since we were splitting (that goes a long way). 

The food was excellent, although I think the queso is meant to be taken down in 5 minutes, because once it starts cooling off it can get a bit hard.

a short drive from the house in my most fashionable dirty yard work clothes and nasty sun hat and the wife and I were enjoying a fabulously cool concoction that is frozen custard. 

there is something strange about custard....it's not frosty cold like ice cream or fro yo, and it's rich and creamy and cold, but doesn't give that cold belly/head feeling. which can be good or bad. 

in any case, i stuck with the boring swirl vanilla and chocolate but was very happy with my choice. the wife picked the smores italian ice with vanilla custard thingy. it tasted like cotton candy to me...a little too sweet...which is why i had 3 bites instead of 1. 

they have fresh daily italian ice in all sorts of flavors and you can have them mixed with or without your custard, and there's even a DQ style blizzard mix they can fix up for you.

If you've never been, the decor and atmosphere can be classified as Americanized-Mexican.  Plenty of parking available. The ambiance is nice, decor is that of a mix of modern and Pier One Mexican decor.  There's modern American music playing, but it is very possible to have a conversation with people at your table. 

Clientele is a good mix of stay at home mothers, old pals catching up for a drink and others there to have business lunches. Most are dressed from casual to business casual. Bar area wasn't busy, 3-4 patrons sitting at the bar. They offer daily drink specials but I didn't partake in this during my visit. 

Our waiter was very attentive.  I was there for a quick meet up, to have some appetizers and not having a full fledged meal.  We ordered the Prima Guacamole (made at our table) and were very specific that we did not want anything spicy in our guacamole.  Waiter listened to us and made our guacamole perfectly.  Fresh tomatoes and lots of lime and a smidge of cilantro - just how I like it.  Chips were warm and had perfect salt seasoning - not too much, not too little. 

We also ordered the Chicken empanadas off of the appetizer section.  This includes 4 triangle empanadas filled with  cheese, chicken and Pico de Gallo.  Perfect serving for two people. The plate was garnished well with a bed of lettuce and bits of tomatoes for the empanadas to lay in, empanadas were drizzled lightly with chipotle ranch and serve with side of guacamole and sour cream (not spicy). These empanadas were flavorful and served at perfect temperature! 

We then shared a Cuatro Leches Cake to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Cuatro leches is a cake with four types of milk poured over it.   It is topped with a sugar-merengue, garnished with mint leaves.  It was DEVINE but very rich for just one person to have, in my opinion.  We shared this cuatro leches cake and between the both of us were unable to finish it.  

We enjoyed our visit to Cantina but felt a rushed at the end, as our waiter brought our bill at the same time as our dessert.  Our total visit was less than a hour long, there were lots of open tables and no one waiting to be seated so I thought perhaps it was shift change.",2018-02-04 18:48:03

We went last night to check it out and though the changes being made so far are subtle they are a great indication of new life and exceptional cooking happening in the lovely old room looking out over St Laurent. 

The classics are all still there, just better: the bread is all homemade and is so freaking good. The goat cheese balls are still changing people's lives, the rapini now comes with kale and preserved lemons and is way better than before, and the chorizo is juicier and tastier than it has been in years. We tried the specials, a pumpkin soup with caramelized onions and toasted seeds and it was unlike anything I've eaten before and I want to eat it every day until May. The other special was Southern-friend quail in lemon gravy on pickled brussels sprouts. Everything about this dish was amazing, except I'm not a quail fan, I think it's stupid, but that's just me.

The service was very slow and the place was not packed. I waited maybe 15 minutes for my friends to arrive and the waiter did not offer me any water and did not ask if I wanted a drink in the meantime. It took awhile to get our food and the waiter brought one cocktail at a time. Also when the waiter saw that the water jug was empty he wasn't going to fill it up! I had to ask him to do so. 

I started with the Egyptian Karkade cocktail, which consisted of dark rum, saffron, hibiscus lemon and angostura bitters. It was not good. :( My friends tried my drink too and they all didn't like it either. I then had the Pina Koala mocktail and asked the waiter to put white rum in it. It resembled a pina colada and that drink was actually good. It was made up of coconut milk, pineapple, eucalyptus, kombucha and mint/chlorophyll. I then decided to stick to Beau's beer and play it safe.

We all had the poutine. The sauce is miso based. The poutine was good but I would have liked there to be more sauce. It was all at the bottom so the poutine was a dry on top and you couldn't mix it.

Pamier Kabob is something different. It's clean and well-decorated (dare I say, almost classy) and has quality customer service. I was impressed by my visit to this shop at Spadina and Adelaide.

Though I ordered my meal to go, it's quite splendid inside by kabob-shop standards. The floors are large-format porcelain tiles and there is stacked stone on the walls. There is PLENTY of seating here too, which makes it a reliable lunch spot for those working nearby.

There are a jaw-droppingly staggering amount of options. Can we get a nerd to do the math?[1] You can choose your protein (chicken, beef, lamb or fish) and your style of kabob. Most come with sides, and give you an option to add rice for a few bucks. I ordered the Shahi Lamb Kabob ($10.99) which comes with naan and salad. As a special bonus it also came with a spicy beef chaplee kabob -- like a round spicy burger. I devoured it with reckless abandon. I was impressed with how soft the afghani naan was and the meat was really flavourful and tender.

If I had restraint[2] and saved the rest for later, it would have doubled the value proposition of this place. As it is, it's still a great value for the quality of service and fare you'll get here. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: KABOB'S your uncle.[3]

Menu Readability: Overwhelming. There are some 50 types of kebob to choose from.

Need to mention: I ordered lamb, but got a beef surprise with it. This is worth checking up on if you are particular about this kind of thing. (I am not.)

What this place teaches me about myself: I have no idea what ""Pamier"" means. It could mean ""death to infidels"" and I'd probably still eat here.

I asked the front desk at the hotel if they had any recommendations for locally owned coffee shops - they were unaware of any - so to the Yelp App on my iPhone I went!

Juma comes up as being 2.5 miles from the hotel. I asked the hotel staff if they were familiar with Juma - they were not. Juma has lots of good ratings - So off to Juma I go!

There is a parking lot around back - along with two entrances. I took the entrance to the left - and found myself in a clothing store. Confused, but undeterred, I continued on until I found the section of Juma that is a coffee house.

I ordered their version of a cold brew - they pour a certain amount in a cup and then cut it with water. It's super strong! I came in the first day around 4:00 pm in the afternoon - and I was wired for longer than I wanted to be - meaning I was still partially wired when I wanted to go to sleep later that evening!

They also offer some baked goods, and there is plenty of seating. They have installed a garage door that is open during the day to the street - so lots of fresh air and sunlight streaming in the front.

It was officially my first time at a Red Lobster. Not normally a place I'd choose, but all the hype about the endless shrimp event was enough to get me to try - just once. 

One of our crew has a shrimp allergy, (I know, we're terrible people for bringing her here - and on her birthday, no less!) but the staff handled things with ease. The manager came by our table to explain how her food would be handled, and that it would come out before everyone else's meal to ensure there was no chance of cross-contamination. Very well-handled, Red Lobster!

The menu is quite large, with lots of choices. Of course, it's mostly seafood, but there are plenty of options for anyone in a group who may not be a seafood eater. Two of us had the endless shrimp, which comes with a side salad and your choice of rice, potato or broccoli, and every table gets a basket of the cheddar biscuits - I just love these! 

I chose the Nashville Hot and the Mediterranean shrimp to start, followed up by the savoury garlic shrimp. I really didn't like the Nashville Hot, because they tasted like they were doused in sugar and I found them to be way too sweet. I had to smother them in hot sauce to make them edible. The Mediterranean shrimp were ok, but tasted a bit under-seasoned. I did enjoy the garlic shrimp, but I had to blot off a lot of the butter with some napkins, as they got to be a bit greasy-tasting after the first few bites. This is going to sound weird, but I really love that you get a good-sized serving of broccoli with your meal. Too many restaurants these days treat veggies like a garnish and you don't usually get many on your plate. I felt less guilty eating all that shrimp, having a big pile of broccoli to go with it. Especially since I didn't eat the side salad (it was basically swimming in dressing, which I forgot to ask to have on the side) so I couldn't eat it. 

Despite my food tasting fairly mediocre, I give this place three stars because of the service (especially the way they handled my friend's allergy) but they don't get full points because we did say it was her birthday - and not so much as a free drink or dessert was offered. She did enjoy her salmon entrée, though, so she left quite happy. 

I don't think I'd ever choose to return, but I know that if I ever went again with a group, there are plenty of choices on the menu. Plus, the cheddar biscuits are almost worth a return visit.",2017-10-26 18:53:46

vhjK0YKX_9kkiPMDC32vug,NnMN10F4wDuBKv25vCqcCg,mJYzopHZZEXVJJrsue34aQ,4,1,0,1,"On Friday night we had dinner at Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria, across from the Biltmore Fashion Park at 32nd St. and Camelback. It's a relatively new spin-off of Tomaso's Restaurant which has been at that location for 32 years. Where Tomaso's is upscale, dressier, and heavy on the proteins, Tommy V is casual and carb-oriented. It's interesting that the prices on most of the appetizers, salads and pastas are pretty much the same at both locations.

     Tommy V's is divided up into two rooms. You enter the bar area which also houses an open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. It's light-filled and colorful. and also very loud. The second room is more sedate, and unfortunately somewhat gloomy. It's dimly lit, and the faux brick, dark wood, and taupe painted walls don't help. There are some windows cut into the front and back walls, framed with curtains, which look into the bar area, and a third back room. Very weird. However, the gloom was dispelled when our cheerful waitress brought us a basket of crusty bread and some fabulous pesto butter, redolent of garlic. She informed us that happy hour was on (from 5 - 7), and we could get most of the wines on the menu for $5 a glass or $20 a bottle. We decided to share a glass of red Primitivo 'Layer Cake' (I don't know why it was called that, but you knew that I wouldn't be able to resist ordering it). It turned out to be delicious, rich and deeply fruity. Because we had arrived quite early - I didn't know how busy the restaurant would be and reservations are only taken for tables of 6 - we ordered a roasted beet and goat cheese salad ($8) while we awaited our friends Walt and Maria. While it was quite good, it didn't live up to the one we had at The Parlor since the beets weren't multi-colored and the dressing didn't have as much zing. However, there was lots of cheese and toasted pistachios.

     When Walt and Maria arrived, our bread basket and carafe of butter was swiftly refilled (the bussing was top notch). I suggested that they try the Primitivo, and they ordered the Romaine Wedge salad ($7) with bacon and gorgonzola. It was beautifully presented, with a pile of whole romaine leaves holding the accompaniments and dressing. All the salad ingredients were quite fresh. I ordered an Eggplant Torta ($15), described as ""Baked Multi-layer of Eggplant, Cheese Fondue, Pasta"". Ken opted for V's Kick Ass Burger 9 oz ($12) - ""Handcrafted with Short Rib, Brisket & Kobe Beef, Caramelized Onions, Heirloom Tomatoes, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Arugula, Truffle Aioli & Parmesan Herb Roasted Potatoes"". The combination of meats made this too interesting to pass up. Walt and Maria decided to share a pizza. These are ""personal size"", 10 - 12 inches, and range in price from $10 for a Margherita with mozzarella and tomatoes to 
$16 for a Proscuitto and Fig pie with gorgonzola and arugula. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind they had, but they said they enjoyed it, and it was actually big enough that 2 pieces were taken home. The burger was great. It was big and juicy with a fascinating texture because of the short ribs and brisket - it's now my favorite Phoenix burger, and the price is comparable to the other good ones served elsewhere. Ken loved the roasted potatoes, and while they were flavorful, I prefer nice crunchy fries. My eggplant torta was a pleasant, non-confrontational variant of eggplant parmesan. But having taken a Zantac, I was looking forward to confrontation - a spicy sauce and loads of gooey cheese. This was disappointing, but edible. It was also a fairy small portion.

     There were no surprises on the dessert menu - tiramisu, cannoli, etc. We ordered a tartufo for the table. When it arrived, nicely sliced, there was none of the zablione promised on the menu. I asked the waitress about that and she tried to tell me that it had been ""mixed in"". When I gave her a skeptical, unhappy look she brought over the owner/manager (I'm not sure which he was), and he apologized, saying that there's been a dispute with the distributor over that item. We weren't charged for it, which was very nice, since we did eat it all.

     The parking in front of the restaurant is limited, but Walt said to tell you that immediately to the east of the strip mall containing the restaurant there's a large parking lot, not particularly visible to the street. All in all I'd say this was a good dining experience and we'll go back to try some of the interesting pastas like braised short rib gnocchi ($20) or butternut squash ravioli with amaretto cookies, toasted almonds and parmigiano sage sauce ($15).

Now to the food. We started with the crab wontons. Crunchy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside. A delicious start to the meal. The next thing we ordered was the papaya salad. The vegetables were fresh and imparted a crunchy texture. Combined with the sweetness, acid, and spiciness of the dressing, the papaya salad was very nice. The shrimp on the salad was perfectly cooked. A lot of places tend to overcook their shrimp. The chef in this place does not overcook his shrimp!!! Next was the panang curry. I look for sweetness, creaminess, spice, and overall aroma. With the aroma, the basil, garlic, chili, and coconut aromas are well complimented by the spices. The little dab of coconut milk in the middle was a nice touch. It added more coolness to the dish and it attributed to the overall visual appeal. Next was the pad thai, it was sweet and the noodles had a really nice texture; springy but just soft enough. The last thing we ordered was the mango sticky rice.

I went through his binder to find out that he needs to start this week with a topic and research for a school project. First it was to figure out how to make electric work. He was so excited about doing that, then he realizes.. Its a lot of work. So we surf the internet and he found making glow water. GLOW WATER is the final answer. We looked into more and more. There was a doctor on one website that gave the easiest way to make a glow water out of the smallest amount of supplies (highlighter, water, and darkness). I told him that we needed to show different ways of making glow waters. SOOOOOO, we went to Walmart to discover that they had a selected few highlighters to choose from. BUMMMER!! Then it was off to Michaels... YAY for Michaels they had everything we need except the black light bulb. They had the wooden boxes that we are gonna use to contain the glow, felt cloth to put inside the box, stickers to decorate inside, and chem lights. Thank goodness for chem lights. We were happy to get almost all the supplies in one store, yet it was quite the drive. In the end, we didn't mind because we sang along with the radio on the drive and got just about all the things we need to start the research. Thanks Michaels.",2010-05-19 05:24:08

Every time I visit Chicago I always make sure to stop at a Giordanos and eat there. Well they finally opened up a location on 83rd and Bell. We first started off with the calamari. It was good but there was 2 calamari balls. What I mean is when they deep-fried them they a lot of them stuck together. Still tasted good but was frustrating to eat them properly. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza deep dish. Let's just say it's nothing like the one in Chicago. Everything about the pizza was wrong. When the server brought us the pizza and cut us slices the cheese melted completely off the pizza and It wasn't even in the shape of a slice after it was put on a plate. Looked like a round circle of cheese with crust on the end. Cheese tasted different , there were was not enough pepperoni for you to even call it a pepperoni pizza. Also the crust underneath the pizza was missing.... in the center of the pizza. The center only had cheese and then as you move towards the outer crust it builds up. So at the beginning of eating this pizza I was just eating pure cheese.I'm not complaining about any wait time which was one hour. Giordanos always takes about 40 minutes to an hour. This whole complaint is 100% the pizza. I was very excited about them opening up in Phoenix but after this experience I can say that I will NOT be attending this location again...

Goes to show.. if you love your dog, you'll shop here ;)

This store has everything.. . with 3,400+ unique items. I was simply amazed how much inventory they carry. All the items were neatly stored in rows. Clutter-free and clean aisles. I can see why they won the ""Best Pet Store In Las Vegas"" for 2015. 

I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door by a few sales associates. The cashier girl asked if I needed help and I asked if they carried any dog car seats. Another male sales associate walked me over to the area and opened a few up to see the size difference. Both asked what kind of dog I have... I told them a Pomeranian. Thinking it was a tiny teacup, they showed me the small at first. I told them mine is like a little lion and I don't think he will fit in that. Then they showed me the medium size and that was it. I'll take it!

A female sales associate asked if there was anything else I was looking for? And before I finished my sentence.. she walked me over to the shampoos/conditioner section. They had many different brands to choose from. I ended up getting a 2 in 1 Buddy Wash Shampoo and Conditioner for relaxing. The smell is Green Tea and Bergamot. And also for dry skin and itching I picked Earthbath totally natural pet care in Oatmeal and Aloe. The smell is Vanilla and Almond. And they even had South Bark's Blueberry Facial! It's a face wash, body shampoo, and overall brightener. All natural, tearless, aromatherapeutic, ph balanced, safe for dogs and cats. The cashier girl loves this product too and couldn't stop raving about it. I told her my dog loves it too. He looks so relaxed and smiling! I remember using this particular product when I took Mr. Ruffin, my dog on his Birthday to a self wash place. He loved the experience. So I must buy him that Blueberry Facial!!!

He loves new toys.. so I also found two cute tiny stuffed animals. A pig and lamb :P He likes to carry it in his mouth or sleep on it. 

I tried out the dog car seat and it fit him perfectly. Mr. Ruffin just sat down and enjoyed the scenic view of Las Vegas. It was comfortable enough that he didn't move around everywhere and he lied down. So calm and not antsy pantsy ;)

Mr. Ruffin's Birthday is tomorrow and I'm sad. I don't want him to grow old so fast :/ Yet I'm grateful and happy to still have him in my life.

They have a few screens going for the game and usually have the latest UFC/boxing matches on the big screen. They charge cover though on the popular ones which can be a turn off if you just want to grab a pint and some wings. 

Food isn't terrible, but don't expect five star gourmet. Wings are actually top notch, as well as the shared platters.

1.) They have a dumb policy where you have to make an appointment even for a minor tech question. They will literally refuse to help you even if there is NO ONE waiting.

2.) So you make said appointment where they rush through your tech issues. Wait, didn't I make an appointment so you could spend the so called designated half-hour with me?

I'm not a huge fan of public coat racks (I always have a fear that someone will snatch my coat up) so I didn't use it, but the coat rack is free so you should definitely take use of it if you don't mind!

The waiters, chefs, bartenders all greet to you in one large voice which is typical at Japanese restaurants. This always makes me blush a little. Hubby and I were seated very quickly and we dived for the menu. The menu was in two parts: the regular menu, and the 'Chef's menu' which also looked like a comic strip. There were so many delicious looking tapas that we wanted to try, so we had a pretty difficult time narrowing it down to a few.

We decided to order 3 tapas to start, then we ended up ordering dessert, which we weren't planning on having! The waiter was very prompt, and always alert, which brought us fast service. My hubby was able to flag down a waiter almost immediately which satisfied both of us since we were very hungry that night.

We started off with mackerel sashimi, one of my favourites. When not done right, the fish can be a bit hard to eat because of its distinct scent and taste, but here at Imadake, it was done right. The waiter, after bringing it to our table, blowtorched the sashimi right in front of us which made all neighbouring tables turn their heads. We couldn't wait to eat it as we saw it torched in front of our eyes! The taste was amazing; it had a distinct vinaigrette taste to it although there wasn't any vinaigrette on it. This taste was because they added lemon juice on top of the mackerel, taking away a lot of its distinct taste so that it is easier to eat. The fish almost melted in our mouths and we definitely knew that the plate of sashimi was not a portion to share!

The tuna tataki was done very well, just cooked enough on the outside to provide it a different texture yet keep the inside very moist and delicate as sashimi should be. The yuzu sauce marinade was very tasty, and we were both happy with how sweet yet fresh it was. When the tuna tataki was eaten together with the marinade and shredded onions, it was very refreshing and we were able to enjoy multiple textures which balanced everything out. As an ending note, there were pink pepper (the small pink balls on top of the tataki) which was a great contrast to the sweet and sour tastes of the dish.

We are a fan of ramen, especially good ramen. Here at Imadake, their miso broth was very rich and savoury. The portion of the ramen was surprisingly large relatively compared to other tapas we had ordered. The pork belly was quite soft but still chewy, pretty average. If we were to compared Imadake ramen to regular ramen houses, the only downside would be the price: since Imadake is a tapas-oriented place, for the price you pay, the portion is smaller to what you would get at a regular ramen house; however, the taste is just as good if not better than some of the many ramen places we have tried in Montréal!

After our bowl of ramen, I really wanted to try Imadake's taiyaki parfait, as I had been craving the traditional taiyaki dessert for awhile. The actual taiyaki was the real stuff and it tasted just how I imagined it. The cake batter was very fluffy and the sweet filling was just how I remembered. On top of the taiyaki, there was vanilla ice cream with raspberry syrup, which was a great balance, since the taiyaki was pretty hot inside. The coldness of the ice cream played very well with the hot sweet red bean paste in my mouth, and I was one happy girl. The raspberry syrup was a surprise, as I didn't expect it to go so well with taiyaki. The strawberry pocky and frosted flakes at the very bottom of the parfait provided much needed crunchy texture to the dessert, and also acted as a good ending note.
Would I order it again? Yes. Although I really want to try their other Asian-inspired desserts!",2015-05-15 17:59:02

I have visited PastaBar twice now. Both times I have been left with the ""Eh.. it's ok"" opinion about it. 

The first visit was during their opening week, I believe. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. I noticed the very stark decor and the nice big mirror they had to make the room look huge. We were seated in a corner booth that is not very comfortable for two people that want to sit next to each other, not across from each other (just a note). We took the time to look over a simple menu. They had just obtained their liquor license and our waiter was stumbling on the wine selection. While I understand that the liquor license is new, your knowledge of wine should not be. For such a nice place, the servers should have a slight knowledge of wine and be able to advise on them. When it came time to ordering our meal, our waiter was nice enough to advise us to order a side to split with our pasta if we were hungry. Good to know! 

On my first trip, I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara. I enjoyed the dish, except for the fact that it was a tad salty and it had a lot of black pepper in it, personal taste is one thing, but when you're chewing into black pepper...woah. I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the guanciale in the dish because of the pepper in the sauce. The pasta was very good, I like my pastas al dente and this pasta met my expectation. My date ordered the gnocchi. It was again just ok. On the side my date and I split the meatballs. I thought they were ok. The sauce wasn't your run of the mill spaghetti sauce. It had a smoky, almost barbecued flavor to it. It was good, but again a little crazy with the black pepper. At the end of that trip I was left with a ""yeah....uh...I think it was good"" and vowed to come back to render my final decision. 

The second trip sealed the coffin for me. We were greeted and seated immediately, once again. I took the time to really check out the place. Oh! They put new artwork up....um... I will refer to the art as ""Signs of the Apocalypse"". Timothy McVeigh? Really? I found it tasteless, but to each his own. Knocked the restaurant down a notch for me, personally. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozz, Marinara ""crudo"" to start. Our waitress left us to take our time looking at the menu. I decided on Orecchiette with homemade sausage and greens. My friend and I shared the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder. We noted that our appetizer was taking forever and when I spotted the waitress to ask her about it, she was delivering our dinner.... HUGE pet peeve. I gently said ""You delivered our entrees before our appetizer."" She stood looking astonished and said ""OH! Yes I did!"" and continued to stand as if she was lost. Well after we told her we still wanted the appetizer, she came back MUCH later with the incorrect appetizer, and offered to leave it and not charge us for it. NO. Wrong. If the customer ordered an appetizer, they wanted that one for a reason. Our appetizer finally made it as the dessert course of our dining experience, but that's not it folks! Rewind to our meals. My pasta was lukewarm at best. It was like I rewarmed leftover pasta and didn't warm it all the way and decided to eat it out of a Tupperware bowl. This was definitely not the marking of a 17 dollar bowl of pasta. By the time I was about 5 bites into my dish, it was cold. At this point, I was so irritated, I truly didn't care. 

I know we're not in Scottsdale, but does that mean we need to sacrifice quality and service due to a different zip code? I know we're in America, but do we need to offend patrons with artwork of mass murderers while they're trying to eat? Again, to each his/her own, but I doubt I will visit PastaBar again. I'm sure it will thrive without a few people with discerning taste. 

It's not a place I will crave, it's not a place that I would jump to visit again.",2009-03-17 00:51:09

According to the staff, the popular and recommended item was the gamjatang but we opted for the soon tofu and seolleongtang (beef bone soup).
It was a Friday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was half full, soon after we were seated, the place got super full. We were asked if we wanted tea or water and also got our side dishes shortly after. There were 8 different side dishes which is a pretty good variety and a lot more than I expected. I really enjoyed the tofu seaweed and potato one. In less than 10mins, our dishes arrived, boiling and hot in the black stone pots, it was very satisfying especially since it was a chilly and windy evening. My friend and I enjoyed our meals and we finished quickly...In about 30 mins. Thank
 goodness the service was fast since we had plans for 8pm!

I also wanted to add, our table had a built in grill so this spot would be great for kbbq. Oh! The rice that was included was the mixed purple rice, which was unexpected but definitely something I enjoyed.

Thumbs up to Quick service and Good food!",2018-04-28 22:10:41

Stopped in for some Thai for lunch.  This place is across from the Wells Fargo building and gets a good business crowd.

Very friendly young people took our order and bussed the table.  Did a good job of keeping drinks filled throughout the meal.  I also liked that they made sure I wanted real spiciness for my meal. So many restaurants are timid with the heat.  Maybe I looked non-pale enough that they believed I could handle it.  

An ""adult"" came and served us our meal.  Excellent curry and noodle dishes.  And the spice was there as desired in my dish-- just the right level to give some heat while not totally overpowering the flavors.  Eggroll and soup were only okay, though.

Our waitress told us that her favourite was the Squash Tacos so I took her suggestion and ordered that to share.  It may now become my regular order.  It was so good with so much flavours - cilantro jalpeno lime sauce with crispy squash and tomato/onion/kale topping.  I also shared the Jerusalem bowl which was good as well.  

I also recommend asking for the little jar of hot sauce. Very tasty!

We have used this service seven times, and too many of them were so bad it's just not even worth trying. Why should I pay a delivery fee plus tip for something that ends up taking more time than just doing it on my own?

Requests from the comments section are never fulfilled, and once the driver acknowledged that he didn't bring part of the order--too bad! I wrote asking for a refund and never got a response, and when I called they said it was too long ago to do a refund. It was an argument instead of them actually giving a hoot, and that's even more trouble to deal with.

No way do I went to spend $70 on takeout and have to spend ten minutes on the phone with the delivery gal trying to talk her into the building when it's not that hard and her only job. Again, I would have actually saved time had I done it all myself.

The wait. We waited for one hour to be seated and there were only three groups ahead of us. There are very few tables; three booths and a couple of tables for 2. The wait for their chicken waffle is at least 20 minutes but it's more like a 30 minute wait. So, the brunch here is a 3 hour affair. Be ready to wait. 

The extras. Beware that any addition will be an extra 0.50 to have a little sauce and $2 to make it hot! This is what is added to the chicken and waffle. 


Pros
The portions. They will be big enough even for those who eat a lot. The majority of the tables had a take out bag by the end of their meals. 

The taste. The food is pretty good. The chicken waffle was crispy on the outside and still tender and moist on the inside. It also wasn't overtly salty but still well-seasoned. The burger with bacon was a tad saltier but if you have a green side, it would be perfect. The chips option though is very good and crispy. The macaroni and cheese option was the least of my favourites. There is also a huge garlic bread that comes with it.

Here they bring you an entree, soup, salad, rice, and an egg roll or potsticker for 5.95. At a casino that's gonna cost you 30 bucks and it wouldn't taste half as good as here.

After trying some samples, I settled on the affogato ($5.95)- a shot of espresso poured over a scoop of gelato of any flavor. I chose a scoop of Creme Brulee gelato to accompany the shot of espresso. 

I don't know what happened to the gelato during the making of my affogato because the gelato I had in the affogato was not the same gelato I sampled au natural. Before being affogato-fied, the Creme Brulee gelato was yummy and smooth, with crispy flecks of burnt sugar. However, after being doused with espresso, the once smooth gelato turned gritty and powdery, making for a not-so-great treat, texture wise. Flavor wise, the affogato was good- the bitter espresso balanced the sweetness of the gelato. 

I don't think I'll be visiting Tutti Gelati anytime soon. Maybe if it was closer, I would give this place another try, but because it is all the way in Lake Las Vegas, I think revisits will be hard to come by.",2011-01-18 00:35:05

We found this little gem while doing errands in the area and thought we'd give it a try. Boy, are we glad we did! Everything was better than we expected. Just for starters we both have tried many thai restaurants and have appreciated the differences from place to place but my gf has been to Thailand and remembers how the food tasted there. She says this place brought back such great memories. The owner was chatting a bit with us since it was the slow time on a weekday afternoon after the lunch rush. She was so nice, personable and gave us many ideas for what to order when we go back again, which we will! We ordered the Red Curry w/shrimp and the Panang Curry w/shrimp and shared. I have to say both were kind of similar but you could definitely taste that one had more of a lemongrass flavor to it, both absolutely delicious. For dessert we had the Mango sticky rice which I'd never tried before because I'm not crazy about mango. The owner suggested it so we gave it a try and it's my new favorite Thai dessert! It was perfection, the mango was sweet, succulent and beautifully presented on the plate, the sticky rice is served warm with a coconut cream, it was just perfect. I can't wait to go back and try the green curry, they made it sound so good I had a hard time deciding what to order initially.

When at a banquet not too long ago, I noticed that the quality of the food seemed to have gone a bit downhill. I had heard that the restaurant changed hands, but that shouldn't have affected standards, or was I being naiive? 

At that banquet, well...

- the fish wasn't properly de-scaled... having to spit out scales as you're eating really isn't all too palatable;
- shrimp dishes were basically overdone.  It wasn't tender, it was tough;
- is there a premium for rice requests?
- I was served the wrong dishes, and even given extra dishes (we tried to alert the resto as we didnt order it, and did not want to be charged for stuff we didn't even want).  But admittedly they redeemed themselves by knocking off the wrong stuff and so on.  

These were the big things, but really, in the end, while the rest of the food was ok, it just wasn't, well great. I might still give it another shot, since I really want to host a chinese banquet meal one more time before Xmas for my friends and I. 

Ever since I moved to Calgary, this place has been my fall back position when it came to dim sum and large banquet meals.  The food has been good is not legendary, everyone has always enjoyed it, and there was rarely any problems.  Now... hmm... hard to say.

I've yet to go back for Dim Sum lately, so they might still redeem themselves hopefully.

As for the product, I've had my water softener for a few weeks now. The water is soft, so that's good. The price was much better than for comparable products offered by their competitors. My water tastes very metallic, but I'm hoping that goes away after the new pipes clear out. I might get a reverse osmosis system if my water still tastes weird in a few weeks. If I do, I'll likely go with AHW.

One bad thing I did notice, though, is that there was some mud tracked through a tile area of my house, however, this was not enough of an issue for the company to lose any stars. They cleaned and swept up pretty well overall.",2015-07-08 03:05:49

If you aren't aware, soup dumplings are magical. They are basically a steamed pork dumpling with broth inside. You have to eat them off of a spoon so you don't lose the broth when you bite into it. 

Since these are the only soup dumplings in the city, they are the best in town. However, not the best I've ever had. Again, more expensive thank what you'd pay for them in larger cities. The pork tasted a bit like sausage, which seemed just wrong. I prefer to taste the ginger and scallion that usually accompanies the pork in a dumpling. 

My noodle dish, was flavorful, but contained only noodles. No meat. No vegetables. A bit disappointing if you're looking for a dish with variety. 

The pork belly ""sliders"" are nothing but. You get one, and its huge. You need a fork and knife to eat it. The pork belly could have been rendered more as it was a little chewy, but the flavor was good.

The good: to contradict a previous reviewer, I found the beer selection to be quite respectable.  You've got mainstream goat piss, mainstream Irish, beer snob local, national and international.  I was very pleased by the Gaelic ale from Asheville.  Very pleased.  Also, the nachos were truly a work of art.  I can't stand flour tortillas but flour tortilla chips are great for this mouthwatering mountain of peppers, beans, tomatoes, olives, cream and little chicken bits.

The ok: well, I found my pasta - the Honey Chicken - to be just ok.  The chicken itself was nice and juicy.  I don't know what I expected from the pasta.  I think it was overall a bit sweet, and perhaps a nice pungent feta topping would have broken that up a bit better. What it came with was a bland kind of Parmesan, I think.

PastaBAR struck me as oddly pretentious, filling its wine list with choices unrecognizable to the average person and batting about completely foreign Italian phrases on the menu. I'm not a total wine moron, yet I needed the server to translate for me. The safe-bet Syrah and Cabs were something ridiculous like $18 a glass. Huh? Luckily, the red I went with was perfectly tasty. 

Vegetarians? You are shit out of luck here. I'm not even certain what a vegan would do. The only really vegetarian items on the menu were two noodles and butter dishes, which sounds as interesting as baby food. The twelve-ingredient streetwalker's pantry dish has anchovies in it, but since its description didn't put me to sleep, I gave it a shot, dead fish and all. The mix of textures with the pasta, sauce, and toasted bread crumbs was good, but the overall flavor simply didn't wow me. And, perhaps I am mistaken, but there were little sweet bits of mystery substance in there also... raisins? That's just Trying Too Hard. My SO got the butter and pepper noodles, which did indeed taste like an entire container of black pepper was dumped in the sauce. Spicy, but really one-dimensional.  He liked it very much, but he tends to choose pure heat over complexity in flavors.

The restaurant itself is cute but nothing extraordinary. The server was helpful, but slightly on the used-car-salesman side. Bread and butter, like someone else mentioned, does cost extra. WTF is that? The bread was good, but nothing special. Somehow, I kind of resent the idea of pasta dishes without pricey shrimp or fancy meats being expensive. It's frigging PASTA.

Going to Art In The Park in Boulder City year after year signifies that the Summertime and its dreadful heat is on its way outta here. It is best to arrive early so that you can find parking on the streets nearby and not have to worry about the bumper to bumper traffic that happens later on in the afternoon. 

They have a shuttle service nearby for those who wish to arrive later, but that will set you back $10. Almost every shop has some kind of sale going on for Art In The Park  weekend, so keep an eye out for that as well...you may end up with a sweet deal!

The Halloween inspired gourds once again were the hot ticket item this year. we didn't get any artwork this year, but we got some cool Coconut Body Butter which will help sooth our skin with this wicked Winter season around the corner!

Of course, you can't come here and not enjoy the food! Kettle Corn, Roasted Corn,
Funnel Cakes, BBQ, Burgers, Pizza, Greek, Italian, and many more! Reasonable prices, and great portions too. If you haven't gone already, Art in the Park happens every first weekend in October. ALOHA!!!

They found out there was a screw in my tire and finished the job within 35 minutes and they filled my tires back up and I didn't owe anything.

It kinda looks like the cool parents of the 70s basement - in the best way possible - funky wall art; cool sofas/chairs and a picnic table style seating or 2.  

Maybe because it was Family day (Monday) when we went but it wasn't packed (it picked up a bit later in the evening) but that's totally fine with me because they have FREE SNACKS.  Not free snacks....but FREE SNACKS.  And not shitty FREE SNACKS.  Amazing FREE SNACKS

The front of the bar has a long board of all kinds of stuff (this apparently changes every once in awhile - they've had different kinds of sandwiches; they've had a Bollywood theme, etc).  What they had when we were there was:

 - cheeses
- several types of different crackers - the beet crackers were really yummy
- what looks like a homemade style hummus as there were chunks of chickpeas in it
- veggies - pickles; green beans; roasted peppers, etc
- a pate/mousse like item 
- nuts (almonds)
- some kind of nut/trail mix thing
 - garlic stuffed olives

I'm sure I'm forgetting some things.  I believe I heard the server say the snacks are free on weeknights - some of the other reviewers seem to indicate Monday only so I'm not sure if it's just one day a week they are free.  But either way check this place out.

It's fun, it's funky, the drinks are good and not too expensive, the service is lovely.

Shamone down, the price is right here!  The fun times are right here!  

Definitely will be back!",2017-02-21 20:59:25

Anyway, I submitted the online request form and was emailed back almost immediately to schedule an appointment. Scheduling was INCREDIBLY easy, and the customer service person was very friendly. They were able to schedule a service for me on the day that I requested, which is nice because I've used other service companies for other things in the past and sometimes you have to schedule like a month out (which is super annoying). On the day of the service, the guy called me 20 minutes before getting to my house to give me a heads up that he was on his way (suuuper appreciated that because I have dogs and need to get them settled before someone comes over). They had given me a time slot of 10am-3pm, and the guy ended up getting to my house about 10:15 or 10:30 (also really appreciated that- I hate wasting my day waiting around for 5 hours at home). The guy was respectful of my home, and didn't make a bunch of noise to upset the dogs. He was exceptionally friendly, and explained the service to me so that I could understand it. It was only $99, and he was able to use a credit card thing on his phone (I appreciated this because I hate writing checks only to have them sit in limbo for days and days).

Ten Minutes already in negative status. Finally got our drink order and an appetizer ordered. Steamed BBQ pork Buns. Bland and sticky. Not what i have ever experienced in past Noodle houses. We then ordered Shrimp fried rice Hand pulled soup noodle with Chicken. The decor here is all white almost 3D in its appearance to the eye. Floors were very dirty and ambiance was very loud. As we waited for our food a large table was sat order taken in a language I did not speak and not soon after and before our food arrived they were receiving dishes. Thought that to be odd. Our food finally arrived. I can't speak to the goodness of the food as it was bland. We were going to a show so it seemed like an easy stop on the way. Too many good or excellent noodle shops in this town to put this even on a list. 
Thank you for dining at Beijing Noodle No. 9. I can't say I will go here again. They will not miss my business. Not sure they really even wanted it to begin with.

Although the prices are slightly higher than average, they have tons of specials that can be found on your place mat and the walls of the restaurant.

The menu is very extensive but I recommend coming here for the black bean noodles (jajangmyun) and you won't be disappointed. Hands down the best around. A bowl goes for $7.99 but you can get two for $12.99. Steal! These noodles will make you feel some type of way with its perfect consistency and chewiness. Along with the sides (kimchi, bean sprouts, stir-fried glass noodles, yellow pickled radishes), order a sweet & sour pork (tang soo yuk) to share and you'll be eating jajangmyun like a true Korean! The sweet & sour pork shows on the menu to be $21.99 but there's a poster on the wall offering it for only $16.99 as an every day special. Portions are extremely generous. We couldn't finish everything although we were starving.

From the outside, it really gives off a grungy, hole-in-the-wall kind of vibe. But you'll be surprised to find that it's very spacious with traditional decor (pretty much identical to the Song Cook's in Thornhill but without the floor seating). It's a very relaxing environment to come for a meal. I like that it's not too loud although the last time I came in it was a little TOO quiet (no music was playing).

I will stipulate that the results of the evening were heavily influenced by under-staffing and a first night on the job cook  regardless half an hour to be served a chill bun, with tepid meat dragged down by cold ingredients ,in a very cold restaurant , was unpleasant to touch let alone stick in the mouth. That it comes at a premium was just annoying. 

Side onion rings were not hot either  which is kinda a no-brainer to get

We ordered 2 pizzas to go.  Bf was a little shocked by the price but I say whatev, we took away two 18"" pizzas to enjoy for the rest of the weekend.  I ordered a vegan cheese pizza with carmelized onions and olives.  It was great.  The crust was thin but the edge was thick and soft-chewy.  There was plenty of cheese and when you use a pizza oven the Dayia actually melts like cheese should rather then turn rubbery.  I would have preferred more onions but that's just me.  I think the olives were kalamata instead of canned black ones so I will skip those next time.  

Bf ordered his with onions, jalapenos and mushrooms.  He had the same positive comments about his crust and taste so I see more pieces of Pop Up Pizza being consumed in our future.

QfUcQdRjEGedBw7yzszF8A,4Urg4tXL_m6nYsOt34mAeQ,OFnif1n1Za196N1qyx25wQ,4,0,0,0,"I relatively like this supermarket, but it is hardly perfect. So it is time for another episode of Leslie's famous Pros and Cons:

Pro:

Clean. You know how you go to a Walmart or No Frills (unfortunately I get dragged in by someone once every two years or so to these dumps) and come out feeling dirty, yucky, needing a shower and want to use wipes all over your hands and body? Fortino's does not give you that feeling. The supermarket feels and looks clean on the surface. Unfortunately, like all supermarkets it has that depressing warehouse lighting, which only softens here behind the cashiers.
 
Tidy: the shelves are relatively tidy and orderly and importantly things stay were they are. Sobeys/Empire has a regrettable trick where they constantly move things around. The theory is when customers get lost not locating what they want, they start walking around and see and buy things they did not want. It is deceptive, disrespectful and a waste of time for shoppers. Fortinos doesn't seem to do that.

Large and a good selection: the supermarket is big and has a good meat, produce and dairy section. There is a large prepared food section (which supermarkets are emphasizing because the margins are better than on grocery for them) and Joe Fresh aisles (because Fortino's is just a Loblaw brand) if you care for those items, which I do not.

Organic: they do have a dedicated organic selection, which I like. The items are quite good.

Cons:

Produce price: For the amenities and cleanliness one pays a price in the produce section. The fruits and vegetables are not cheap.

Employees and their carts: employees cut off customers, take up and block aisles, leave their carts in the middle of an aisle or having cut you off leave their cart with haul of whatever they are carrying to place on shelves in front of you implying you have to go around them. All these employees would be fired if this were Europe. Fortino's has a European name, but the service is decidedly Vaughan. I suppose that is what you get when your employees are minimum wage and as a company you fight against unions.

Check-out: a nightmare. They have 1- self check-out to not even hire minimum wage  employees and 2- very few aisles ever open. The process of going through check-out is a choice between the slow, confusing and dehumanizing self check-out or joining the 30 other customers waiting in 3 open lanes. This is the second most annoying thing about this supermarket that makes me go elsewhere.

Parking: there is no parking. This plaza has joined others like Vaughan Mills and Hillcrest Mall (and nearly every other business landlord) to exert maximum greed and anti-customer behaviour by building so much on so little land that there is no parking space ever. Good luck.This is the #1 reason not to come here.",2017-12-06 14:54:28

On par with The Drake, they take their time to cook the food properly and when the dishes arrive I'm never disappointed. I've had pretty much everything they serve except for seafood; I am allergic to shellfish.

I like the spicy hummus they serve at the beginning of the meal. 

Universal is the best place to visit if you're a fan of roasted chicken. The skin is seared to perfection and topped with a tasty duxelle of mushrooms and onions in red wine and served with scalloped potatoes and green veggies, usually rapini. 

I always order a side of home-made onion rings with my food; it's a delightfully crispy dish I enjoy sharing with a dinner companion.

Universal Grill is good at bringing in seasonal foods too and keeping the frequent attendees informed of specials by email. Hint: get on their email list. A friend ordered a side of fried fiddleheads and they were sublime.

I've enjoyed nearly every dessert they make (not all at once). They're not store bought nor brought in from a franchise bakery (Dufflet Pastries). Everything is made on premises.

The staff act like they care for their patrons. Universal Grill has a decent selection of wine on hand and the servers are good at pairing them with the food the kitchen sends out.

We were helped by Mike and he was great! He even came outside to the patio to take our order when there's a sign that says to go inside to place your order. We ordered i'm Imosa, Balenie, and a bloody Mary and it was all delicious. They make their Bellini's with peach purée and peach schnapps and their Mimosa's taste like fresh squeezed orange juice. Delicious!
We ordered the Terrace Burger and Oz Burger with arugula and it was tasty! Mike was great, so we had amazing service and the atmosphere was perfect to spend the day here drinking the unlimited deal. For this I rated it 5 stars. I would definitely recommend this place to spend the day and come back here again, it was perfect.

It is order at the counter which I typically have a real aversion to, but after I ate, I couldn't hate on it because my food was so gooooood! We ordered tacos, chicharrones and horchata. The menu isn't big, but what was served was really delicious. I'm still thinking of the horchata, and it was the best I've had in a really long time, maybe ever. There were two things that I'd like to make note of, and they are the reason for minus two stars. First, some customers brought a dog into the restaurant, like actually inside. The employees were petting the dog and they were allowed to sit at their table inside the restaurant with the dog while they ate. Now, this was clearly not a service animal, and I don't even need to tell you how the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department feels about this. Big no no for me, I do not need pets where I eat my food. Secondly, the prices are pretty high! For our above mentioned food, we spent over $40. At $3.50 a taco, it adds up quick.

We came here for lunch with a group of 5, the seating was a bit snug for even the large round table.  Once seated, they bring out all the side dish; the kimchee, sales, veggie, etc...sorry I can't seem to name it all, but it was all DELICIOUS!  The menu is very clear to understand and I love the fact they made ordering for groups of ppl easy.  We ordered the large Hobak Family Combo for $89.99 (feeds 3-4ppl).  We did not go hungry for the amount of food in ratio to people.  

Now here is the part that I wasn't a fan of...I'm use to going to a Korean BBQ, order my meat, and cooking it on my own time frame, here they cook it for you.  Now with a group of 5 people around a crowded round table where the grill takes up 80% of the table space, to have a server (a 6th person) standing in between you and another person, first, makes it hard to talk to that person next to you, and secondly, it became even more crowded.  So for me, it was a bit annoying, but it's not to discourage other Yelpers from going!  I definitely encourage everyone to go and try it out.  And decide on your own if it's your cup of tea.  It wasn't for me, but I had a great time!  Servers were all friendly and tentative, the food was amazingly delicious, and I definitely love the atmosphere.  The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was having someone cooking the food for me.  But again, this is my personal preference.

I encourage everyone to at least try it once because it was definitely a positive experience.  And I would definitely go back if someone was throwing a party or if I was invited.  I just wouldn't go on my own, only because I prefer to cook my own food.  Overall, it is definitely a great place to check it out and try.

I've been here twice and I had to wait a while both times.  First time it was 20 minutes.  Second time it was 50 minutes!

First time:
I was grabbing food from L &L next door and my wife wanted pizza.  So she goes in and orders two slices of white pizza and the zappoles fried donut powdered sugar things.

We waited over 20 minutes for her order.  There is no place to wait for your order in the front. It is like trying to smash 20 people into a refrigerator box.  The owners really need to rethink the shelves full of groceries lining the front counter.  There is NO ROOM. Especially when it is crowded. 

The white pizza was good, the zeppoleswere AMAZING!  A whole brown bag full for under $5. Not bad.

Second time:
We ordered a white pizza and a meatball pizza TO GO.  They said it would be ready in 20 minutes.

Well, I arrived 20 minutes later and waited another 50 minutes for my pizza to be made.  Apparently the guy making the pizza mistook it for a meatball sandwich and didn't make it until 30 minutes in.  While my white pizza stood in a box on top the oven for 30 minutes to cool down.  No real apology from the guy at the register either after they realized.

When I finally got my pizza and left, the meatball pizza was UNDERCOOKED / Doughy and the white pizza was COLD.  Big FAIL!

Imagine having to stand in a long, thin corridor with other people waiting for their orders like me and others trying to order and make it to the back of the dining room.  GET RID OF THOSE GROCERY SHELVES PLEASE!  There needs to be more room, it's almost like a fire hazard.  People were tripping over each other and myself and my very patient son.

My impression of Rocco's was that that it was a stand-only-waiting-room-of-semi-organized-chaos-in-crowded-hell.

I asked for it cooked Medium, but it came out Well (...with every drop of moisture cooked out of it). Also, there was no sauce on the burger of any sort; so just a dry, airy, flavorless bun and a way overcooked burger. Exacerbating the problem was this mouth-drying peanut butter on my burger. I felt like I was in one of those ""Got Milk"" commercials. Not good.

Conceptually, the ""burgers across America"" idea is sound, but the execution is not. The quality and attention to detail (and taste) is not there.

I had also heard that they did consignment and decided that the old W.W. Greener that I had could possibly find a new home through them. 

After walking in I noticed that it has a different feel than most gun shops in town. All of the other shops I have been in have the concrete grey floors and the very minimalist/Bunkeresque feel to them. It seemed to me like they try to make this place feel a little more inviting, it could just be that the place had wood floors and and a different feel when they leased the place but it works. 

I presented my shotgun to the clerk on duty and he was very knowledgeable and friendly when it came to researching the gun and giving me a strait forward answer. He had mentioned that He could put it on the shelves but due to where we live and what people want that unless it is an assault rifle that looks like the ones in the video games it will probably sit for quite some time but he would recommend listing it myself on Gun Broker and sure enough I did and it sold.

A took a few minutes to chat with the guy before walking around and checking out accessories, which I must add, they were definitely not cheaper than other shops when it came to those. I priced a Black Hawk Paddle holster and it was insanely marked up but the guns seem to be okay.

The salads are also chock-full of veggie goodness and covered in mouth-watering homemade dressings.

If you want a really filling meal, try their tasty veggie burgers or noodle bowls! The desserts (most are gluten free) are also worth a try. I would avoid the smoothies though as they tend to taste a bit weird.

To me this translates into almost ice milk texture (if you remember that stuff).  A previous poster referred to it as sorbet-style gelato and that is a close description, too.  The reason for the 3 star review is I felt the flavors weren't as bold as they could have been, with some of the combination flavors over-delivering on one flavor and falling short on the other (see:  Coffee cookie and the Ginger something or other).  The best surprise and delight of the Sweet Spot experience?  Having your gelato served in a metal cup.  It keeps the gelato nice and chilled...awesome.  Sweet Spot has A LOT of flavors to choose from (Beeramisu) and everything is sourced locally which I totally dig.  Will I return?  Probably.  This place sits in a 'weird middle' for me.

They brew it up real strong and remind me that when my cup runs dry, they've got some ready and free refills. Perfect. 

The gluten free pumpkin chocolate chip muffin at Fair Trade is where it's really at. This guy is how I define the perfect muffin. I like gluten, but man this dude doesn't need it. The lack of gluten makes for an incredibly chewy texture so unique that I'm left in awe and craving more. The chocolate chips and pumpkin flavor only add to the happiness. 

Friends rave to me about the zucchini muffin and I finally tried it today over my usual pumpkin muffin love. While I personally favor the pumpkin chocolate chip, there's no denying this is one tasty muffin. When something is covered in a cinnamon-oat streusel topping, it's hard not to be amazing. Think banana bread, in a portable muffin shape. And this muffin is huge, so double thumbs up. 

Oh but I can't forget the brownies. They are similarly ginormous like the muffins, studded with copious amounts of chocolate chips, and oh so rich. If you like dense, flavor packed brownies, then this is your brownie. Best in town in my book.

The wash, cut and blow-out took about 90 minutes, Cassie was meticulous and repeated what we had agreed upon several times before cutting. She offered me water/soda during the cut as well, checked what water temperature I preferred and used the Moroccan hair products they sell there. I love my haircut, couldn't have been happier with the service and would definitely recommend Cassie. I opted out of the style after the blowout because she did such a great job already and I was already pleased.

Getting to their location isn't too terrible but the problem is that it is difficult to see from Banksville road.  The inside of the shop is nice and clean and you can see all the meats that they have in a giant display case.  If you happen to order some ribs or brisket they cut it right then and there in front of you.  The workers here are also very friendly and have talked to us quite a bit each time that I have been there.

For dinner on this night my fiance and I decided to share a number of different meats and so went with the pulled pork, smoked chicken and brisket with sides of cornbread and macaroni and cheese.  We were also asked what kind of sauce we would like: spicy, regular or a combination.  We choose the combination which got us two of each which was more than enough for all of food we had ordered.  The spicy one had a nice little burn to it that seemed to grow as you ate more or it yet wasn't too spicy while the sweet one also had a flavor that I enjoyed.  One thing that was nice about all of the meats here is that you could easily taste the smoke on all of them.  My favorite of the meats that we ordered happened to be the brisket which was seasoned nicely.  The smoked chicken was my second favorite which surprised me since I am not much of a chicken on the bone type of guy.  It was moist and had a great smoky flavor that didn't overpower the chicken flavor.  Finally the pulled pork was also pretty good although not nearly as good as the other two.  As for our sides, I am not a huge cornbread fan and so only took a small nibble of it and it tasted fine.  The mac and cheese ended up being decent but it seemed to be more like something I could make out of a box than a really good mac and cheese.  Of course I should probably remember that this was a side dish at a BBQ place and not a gourmet mac and cheese at which point it was fine.

The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  I have enjoyed all of the meats that I have had here and really enjoy their BBQ sauce as well.",2014-05-12 22:18:04

Yes, I know its a ""bar"" atmosphere, but I had eaten there before with my family and it had been a good experience in all manners ( both food and service). 

But recently an experience that I had was horrible in both manners. First of all , the food was HORRIBLE. The order had 2 different things wrong with it and besides that , the taste was NOT fresh at all. The tacos werent good at all. 

Then , the person I was with had ordered a beer , which was on happy hour and when the server ( which was horrible too ) , came back asked if he wanted another beer, he said yes and she didnt bother to tell us that it was going to be regular price which was more than double the price of happy hour cause we missed it by a ""few minutes"" .. So the happy hour beer was 2.00 and the regular priced same beer ws 4.50.!!!!!!!!!!

Will I go back?!?  Maybe if I'm in the Mandalay Bay and I'm hungry but not sure if I would make a special trip to go just for HOB.
The mgr was walking around and specifically came to check on us.  I did see him walk around checking on others but I feel this should be a standard, especially on busy nights. My first visit here, we did not see one mgr in the 2 hours we were there.
Overall, much better experience than my first visit.
Thank you Sasha, Marketing and Promotions Mgr for everything you've done!  It is much appreciated :)",2015-04-20 17:57:28

They are not and thus I'm finally writing a review for a place Ive gone to probably 3 times a week for the last 5 or 6 years.  
We had to stop last minute at the target on spring mountain and rainbow last night.  No one wanted to help me, my questions were answered with ""i don't know"" and immediately the associate went back to doing what they were doing before.  
At this target everyone is so helpful, taking time to walk you to a different area rather that saying ""its in aisle 15"", asking if thats when you were looking for, and smiling, always happy to help.  The shelves are pretty well stocked, aside from that whole lilly pulitzer thing that happened and like back to school and whatnot.  
But you know what I really appreciate after my venture to the target from hell? How clean the floors are.  Ive never seen someone going through with this tennis ball scuff eraser contraptions, but holy hell if the target from hell didn't look like every asshole kid walked through intentionally trying to mark up the floor and no one had cleaned for months!

When we placed the order we were told it would be about 35 minutes. After about 50 minutes we called to check in the status and the person told us the guy should have already have been here and that he hoped the guy wasn't in an accident. He said he would call right back. Ten minutes went by and we called again and he said he was shocked the guy still hadn't arrived. He offered me $10 off my next order and said he couldn't do anything on this order. 

The delivery guy finally showed up and blamed the guy at the store for misquoting the delivery time. 

We order finger with buffalo sauce. The fingers were ok but the buffalo sauce was awful. It was like butter and tabasco mixed together. 

We also ordered BBQ chicken fries too. The BBQ sauce was not very good and the chicken was super bland. 

Another person order the chicken ranch fries and he said it was pretty good and liked it.

Kitchen is equipped with fridge, freezer, coffee maker, blender, toaster and electric stove top. No oven, so don't plan on baking pies. Pantry isn't stocked with any silverware or plates, just a heads up. 
The room has two balconies, access, however, is restricted. As I understand it, penthouse suites have balcony access, but I wasn't interested in coughing up another $275/night. 
 Bed was awesome, fluffy comforters and pillows. 
 Rain shower head in a massive shower fit for at least two people.

Overall, the pho was the highlight and very delicious but other items weren't as flavorful and just missed the mark a little bit.  Here's a break down:

Fish taco: just ok, kind of fishy but it was a good concept.  Needed a flavorful relish or something else.

Spring rolls: crunchy and the garnish (perilla leaf, lettuce, mint) was amazingly fresh and abundant. (I hate it when they only give you one perilla leaf or mint).  But the radish and carrot chips could've been marinated longer.

Manila clams: good and full of clammy goodness but again, not super flavorful.  Lacked salt and maybe more herbs.

Cornish game hens: well cooked, sauce was good, tomato rice could've had more flavorful.

Ribeye and flank pho: we got this just to see how their standard pho was and it was deeeelicious.  Beefy broth with a hint of sweetness.  As with everything else the garnishes were super fresh.  Tender meat, and a lot of it.  It definitely makes me want to try more of their pho.

Service:  I don't care about service that much especially because service at a lot of Asian spots on spring mountain is almost non-existent but this place was just odd.  Our wait staff were all young and very nice, but you could tell they lacked experience.  They sort of seemed to want to talk to each other and hang out with their friends who were sitting at another table.  One time we wanted another beer and tried to make eye contact with one of them and he just looked at us and waved awkwardly and turned around and sat down so he can talk to his friends some more...was hilarious and very weird.   And then 3 of them cleared our table but none of them offered to get us our check.  It's like if I opened a restaurant and hired my little brother and let him hire all his friends. 

But all in all I love that we have a new late night pho place!",2014-04-21 23:03:03

I was hungry, forgive me for being a glutton. I followed them up with the beef pho with raw slices and thin noodles. It smelled good and like others have said was a little bland. I doctored it up with toppings and went on ahead to shovel it down. I ordered a lychee water to go with my meal which was super refreshing. It's just syrup and water but for $1? I gave it a go. They have lots of drinks but knowing I wanted to go to the tea place downstairs kept me from ordering a bubble tea. The server was nice and quick. As soon as I sat down, he swung by and asked if I was ready to order. I thought this was odd and said I needed time to look at the menu until the table next to me sat down and was ready immediately.

I should preface that this was the first time I have eaten in at Burgatory, as other attempts were halted due to extreme wait times.  In the past my office has ordered takeout from the Waterworks location.  The take-out was still yummy, but through transportation and whatnot the burger arrived pretty messed up.  So eating in is my preferred method.

Last time there was a real treat as I usually don't get to go out to eat for lunch due to time constraints and this chain they have on my leg attached to my desk, however I was in luck this day.  My Operations Manager was in town that week and asked if he could take me out to lunch to talk about some things.  I happily excepted and strongly suggested Burgatory, so off we went.  

When we got there we didn't have to wait for a table, which is something I had yet to experience with other attempts to eat here.  Seated I looked at the menu and decided on the build your own burger...  I went with the Dry Aged Wagyu, on a wheat bun, with Diablo Dust, Smoked Gouda, Sriracha Remoulade (on the side) with lettuce tomato, onion, and jalapenos.  I like my burgers cooked medium rare, I think Burgatory cooks closer to rare in the middle but that doesn't bother me, but as a tip I would suggest most people would like it a little more cooked.  I on the other hand was extremely pleased.  The burger didn't take too long to come out so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in complete silence as we ate...  Oh so much better than takeout!  This is up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had, and since it's on the boss it was also the cheapest, meaning free.  Can't turn that down ever.

A chef arrived just the other day
He came cooking food in unusual ways
There was duck to sear and then he would sautee,
And then added seafood straight from the bay
And he was cookin' for I knew it, a mousse or two
It's chicken liver with chutney too,
Served with pear saffron chutney too

And then he had me try a bit of (his) kimchi stew,
Some crispy Smoked Oysters with some hot sauce too,
What you cookin' now chef?
(It's) a dish for two, ""A 20oz steak for two, yeah,
A grass fed ribeye steak for two....

Chef Darren had made food so totally rad,
Then made me carpaccio that I never had,
It was beef with wasabi-celery remoulade,
He proved to my palate that it rocked egad
And walked back to the kitchen with some more to do,
And said, ""You're gonna love coq au vin, yeah
You're gonna love (the) coq au vin

Some crispy Smoked Oysters with some hot sauce too,
What you cookin' now chef?

It was time for some dessert, and the choices with there,
A flourless chocolate cake or red wine poached pear
I was dithering away and wanted everythin' there,
Staring at the awesomeness all made with flair
And then Chef Darren said, with a mischevious smile,
""I've got fresh lemon tarts, won't take me a while""

And then he had me try a bit of (his) kimchi stew,
Some crispy Smoked Oysters with some hot sauce too,
What you cookin' now chef?

My belly was stuffed and my date even more,
Then Butter'd Beer was served, just enough for four,
He said, ""it's not complete if you don't (try) this drink""
I said, ""But I'm so full, I can barely think.""
But it looked so freakin' awesome that I had to try,
It was so tasty that I almost did cry,
It was so tasty that I almost did cry""

And as I rolled out the door, it occured to me,
The meal was awesomness for me
An awesome meal just for me

Unfortunately, the best thing I can say about the restaurant is that I loved the decor. The service started off well with drinks and then our server disappeared for so long we eventually had to summon her over to place our order. Subsequent drink orders took a long time.

I started with oysters which were the tiniest ones I've ever seen. Then I had the scallops and the cod. I found the scallops under seasoned and the cod quite salty. One person has the smoked fish which they didn't like at all. Some of my party had the steak which they said was good. Desserts were just ok.

Whatever the reason for the place being occupied by us and the employees preparing food, I hope it continues for just a little bit longer.  I can see myself coming back here for their shaved ice (and I can't wait to try their coffee) and chatting with friends.  The interior is cute, with lots of bright colors, flowers, coffee products on display.  The back of the chairs even have a coffee cup punched into them!

Ohhhh no, you end up with something much more beautiful: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnLa8RM80ZmRfM6YwGVn3g?select=uLcaBz5SDvNJuWlMtNZOHg.

All served on a glass bowl with a  cute little wooden tray.  It was flavorful and refreshing, and like I mentioned, completely unexpected based on what I saw on the menu.  

I'm excited to go back here and try their coffee and some of their treats.  Maybe it's the colorful setup and the bright lighting, but it just felt pleasant sitting inside Tiffany's and taking my time.  With the limited seating (three or four tables) this place can get full quick, which would mean eating out in the Greenland Food Court.  With the several dining options nearby and shopping at Greenland Market, Tiffany's makes for a great way to wind down.",2010-08-28 05:38:21

I love Thai food. I can eat Thai food everyday. Sadly up in Markham, my hood, it is hard to find good authentic Thai food. Every time when I come downtown, I ended up going to Pai, KSR, Sabai Sabai.....

Little Khao has a limited selection but that's all you need. In Thailand, you might even have a stall that selling just one item of their specialty. If it is good, people will come.

Pad Gra Prao ($17) so much flavours from the holy basil. The large portion is good to share as there was quite a lot of minced pork. The poached egg maybe a little under cooked.

Big Shot Bob's is a hole-in-the-wall, mostly takeout place. There are a few tables, but it's not really a cozy place to eat. The guys at the counter were very friendly and there is a TV in there. However, these wings are incredible. I'd eat them in a box, with a fox, on a boat or with a goat.

First of all, you've got all kinds of flavor options. I had the Frank Sinatra which is covered in blue cheese, hot sauce, and parmesan cheese. I also had the Talk of Beaver Falls which was spicy and tangy in a unique way. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My wife tried one that had sauce and garlic and it was fresh chopped garlic chunks! AWESOME.

You can add on a bed of fries under the wings and slathered in sauce. After doing this, I'd recommend just getting a side of fries separately. There is likely to be plenty of sauce to dip anyway, and this will give you an option for something to cool your mouth if you get a spicy flavor. The fries are fresh cut style and very good however you serve them.

Your best bet is to call in a pick up order, arrive early enough to pick them up as soon as they're ready, and head home to enjoy! You can't split flavors in an order, but it's amazing how filling six of these wings can be. For an average person, I'd suggest two orders of six and pick two flavors. There are more than 100 flavors, so if you do this every day it will take about two months to try them all!

I can't wait to be back in town to try more!",2015-01-05 20:09:47

The decoration is still one of the best I have seen for a Persian restaurant. You will definitely enjoy your time there if you're a little bit open minded.
I'm giving a:
Atmosphere 4.5/5: As I said earlier, it's definitely one of the best atmosphere I've seen for a Persian restaurant. I'm not giving a 5 because I think that the owner could have included more of the Persian art into their decor but it still looks really good now.
Food 3/5: I read all the Yelps review and yes the food isn't maybe the one your grandma will cook but I think it was some descent food. I didn't have the feeling to eat something bad. I definitely ate worst than this! But as a key note, I usually always order a side of Hummus everywhere I go because I can tell first, if the Hummus is fresh made or in a can, and second, it gives me a good feeling of how things turn in the kitchen. Well at Habib's, they unfortunately use Hummus from a can which is ok for certain people, but not for me. A simple appetizer like that should be freshly done and it gives you a nice overview of the rest of the food. That's one of the reason I am not giving a 4 or 5 because I think they can still improve in their food presentation and preparation.
Service 2/5: Service tends to be sporadic I agree. It really depends if you know the owner, if he had a good day or not etc. at the same time, it's rare to have also exceptional service in a Persian restaurant. It's pretty much in the culture.
Overall, a 3/5. I would still go there and I like to support them. It might be a little overpriced maybe depending on what you're ordering and you can end up with a bill of $70-$80 for 2 persons.",2012-01-05 05:33:40

At the end of the weekend, we all determined that we could've went to Vegas and got much more for the dollars than we did here.

The best fish tacos ever made can be found on our Mexican boarder in Nogales. But I'm now bringing to question that previously held belief of mine. This fish taco was awesome! Although it only got one small strip of deep fried fish, it was hot, crispy and delicious.

Usually only one line, but when it's game time, it's a long line.  The good news with a longer than usual line is that you're given enough time to decide what to order. 

What to Order?
-1/2 Hot Dog:  Yes it's that big and grilled to perfection. Not a hot dog fan, but you can't watch a sporting event without eating a hot dog.

-Fries: My favorite, steak fries!!

-Onions Rings:  Huge, good, but not good for you.  That's the best kind

-Burgers: Made to order and takes about 5 minutes.  Good portions.  

-Fried Chicken Wings: Probably their best item.  Tasty, fresh, and breaded just right.

Prices are a bit high in my opinion ($10 for a burger), but locals get 25% off and if you have an Total Rewards Card, even cheaper.  

If I'm at the Rio and want that quick something to feed my belly, I have to make a decision.   Do I wait 30+ minutes for the Carnival Buffet or do I get in and out at this deli.  I choose the deli every time.",2012-11-12 00:00:42

I was on Adelaide with a few girls and I'm not into too much of the pop scene. A friend told me about this place and walking up to it, looks shady. Actually - VERY SHADY.
however. . . .when you walk in, you feel the love right away. The love for drum and base. Boy did I feel the love. 
Everyone is in the world of music and feel it to the bone.
I partied here with a few people from abroad and they absolutely loved it.

I highly recommend this place for trance heads and drum&bass lovers!, The DJ spins amazing old dubs too, which only keeps everyone pumped up. The energy is really positive.

The only downside is the room itself is TINY. The bathroom is TINY and awkwardly by the front exit/entrance door.
Also, to smoke you'd have to go the same way.

Its a cream cheese artichoke spread, which ended up making me sick. The turkey tasted like chicken and was cold and hard and tough. Nothing like the warm gooey sandwich it used to be. 
      Also...be aware.... the 6.99 any 2 price is only for like 5 sandwiches and a few salads. You have to add an additional dollar for anything else, and then 55 MORE cents to get half the menu. So- before drink, you have already spent almost 10 bucks...when the board says 6.99. Now, back to sandwich....once again, either the cream cheese or the turkey made me sick.

Their egg waffle looked good but friends said it looked smaller this time. In their picture their mango for the black sesame waffle filled 2/3 of the waffle this time it didn't.

I'm taking CHM I, Bio I, Ballet I this semester.

Academic advising waits: the last 3 times I was there:  2-3 hours long.

The lectures are done in decent rooms.

The labs can use some improvement.

School Policy:
rely on your own resources and go talk to your instructor first.
(make a list)
and THEN they can follow up with a formal complaint if it is not resolved.

Instructor capability: three stars on average.

Chem: Llako... recommended.
Bio: Scott Erickson...fairly new, communication and organization needs improvement.
Chem lab: Indu Mishra... difficult to understand/ follow, but very intelligent.
Ballet I: Sonia Valle... highly recommended. Excellent teaching methods and critique.

Also, read the material beforehand bc some profs have very little experience and they skip around or can't pace themselves.

Campus security go patrolling, but I wouldn't take night classes bc its not the best hood.

Library is kind of small, but the staff are helpful.

School cafeteria is kind of small, but the staff there are very kind.

Bookstore, they try to operate efficiently by having additional registers during first week of school.
Usually they're pretty chill and help you out with finding your books,
but better prices can be found across the street (Union hills) at a secondhand book place for fractions of a cost.

Learning support center (tutors) are free, and they are usually very helpful.

Career placement center is helpful with editing resumes etc.

First, I'm not sure what the capacity is in the place but considering they literally jam pack all the tables in I'm thinking they maybe over ""comfortable"" capacity lol. Our chairs were touching the chairs around us and we are not huge big people. Picture this we did have a group of 10 but when our server was one one side of the table in order to get to the other side of our table she had to walk around the table that was next to us. Seriously, she had to go around another table?!!! BC that is how close the chairs were. Totally uncomfortable seating BC even the people at our own table were elbow to elbow. Now granted the booth eating or tables on the outer edge of the restaurant did seem to have more room. But geez if you dont have seating for a large party just say so, dont make it up. 

As for the food it was ok. Nothing too unique that would draw in someone on food alone. I will give props for the grilled cheese, tomato soup. Loved how it was served on individual spoons and the soup itself was really good. Tuna poke tacos very good!! Yellowtail sashimi, disappointing,  being an avid sushi lover it definitely didnt taste fresh at all and for that price you would think it would be somewhat fresh.

Lots of times when food/drinks are quite inexpensive ... you know they are cheap... quality/service etc. is poor.... NOT the case at Ticoz... its a $3 sangria disguised at a $10 sangria  :)

The sangria was beautiful and delicious.  We tried both the passion fruit and the white kiwi (passion fruit was the best!).  Also got a mango mojito... also pretty and tasty. The lettuce wraps were only slightly disappointing.... once again very pretty but they had dried fruit, nuts etc so it tasted more like chicken salad in a lettuce cup.... not your typical 'mexican/asian' flavored meat.

There were so many items spread between two rooms in the store - various articles of clothing to stuffed animals to stationary to silly cute gag toys...and so much more.

Nowadays half of the store selection is gone - most of the clothing was removed, leaving some toys, sticker books, those sorts of things. You can barely even fit in here anymore because after eliminating half of their space (not exactly sure when or why this happened) they crammed as much stuff as they could into what little space was left. I hate walking in here now; it always feels like I'm going to knock every single thing in the store onto the ground. 

Not to mention, everything in here is pretty generic now. for example, my old favorite, the stuffed toys that represent various germs or microbes, are long gone. Everything I can find here now is just...average cuteness, in the vein of Hello Kitty. Nothing spectacular, nothing that I can't find online.

In winter, it is harder to find a car park space in its parking lot than a table in the restaurant.  It is advisable to book a table rather than walk in and wait in a long queue.  Before you can get a table will require most of the people to be there.   I think it is fair so that no one can occupy a empty table for long time to wait for the whole party to come.  In that case lengthen the wait time for everyone.

There are lot of variety for Dim Sum.  The Dim Sum list is rather long.  We tend to order the Dim Sum that is not common in other restaurants.  Once in a while, the manager will recommend dishes in addition to the Dim Sum order.  The last recommended fish pot is full of fish and is very tasty.",2014-02-28 22:29:32

My friend's mimosa was so flat and she told me that she saw the bartender poor from on already opened bottle. Being that it was 9am and we were the only people in the bar, the bottle was probably from the night or day before.

My bloody mary was basically cheap vodka mixed with tomato juice and tabasco. It was so gross. I felt bad for dragging my friend here for breakfast to a place I promised her would be awesome.

I was totally thrown off when we walked in the place.  It was very nice... almost too nice... especially considering the name.  And likewise, the prices were very nice.  Much more than we expected for a ""filling station"" but we'd talked about giving it a try for so long we decided to splurge.

After viewing the menu, I was so intrigued by the blue corn meal crusted calamari, that I decided to skip out on the veggie burger, and ordered the calamari and the ""best fries in Charlotte"".  The calamari was super super salty and sort of soggy.  Not very appetizing.  I tried to flake off the corn meal crust but it was stuck on, along with all the salt.  Between 2 of us we couldn't even finish them and they were just an appetizer size.  The fries were okay, but I wouldn't say ""the best"".

I have not visited Sultan's Grill in months. I used to come regularly over the span of seven years. I stopped coming frequently due to a rapid decline in customer service, food quality, and the inflated pricing for what you get. 

My previous experience nearly ended it for me when the staff couldn't wait to rush me out the door fifteen minutes before closing time. The lamb was cold and appeared to be scraps - as though they turned everything off and put everything away prior to my walking in and then made my food with what they were going to toss out. So naturally I thought - coming in around closing time is not a good idea since closing time is not literally when they close.

This visit, I figured I would see how the restaurant is handling customer service and food quality prior to dinner rush around 4:30pm. Well, customer service is still not very good. Staff is much more preoccupied with dinning at the front table and chatting with friends than providing even a small amount of service. 

The food quality this round was good. We each had a large Greek salad with gyro meat. I have to that say though that serving a large salad on a flat plastic dinner plate makes tossing and eating the salad a little difficult. Since all the toppings are on top, you kind want to toss the salad without dumping your salad on the table. The pita bread that comes with the salad is good and they offer two types of dressing for the Greek salad. I always get the house vinaigrette.",2015-10-25 23:58:36

(Pro tip: they don't ask for any type of proof you are a mall employee, but if you lie, God will know.)

I got the Gogo bowl, which comes with a choice of brown or white rice, salad, a mix of tuna and salmon cubes, wakame (seaweed salad), krab, corn, cucumber, and a few other veggies. The ginger sauce was nice and bright, and tossed with the salad greens and the fish. The tuna was bland though, and tasted very frozen/watery. The salmon was better; richer and better texture. I wish the rice was mixed with sushi vinegar but instead was served hot, with cold ingredients on top. I didn't care for that.

The portion size looked good at first. They aren't stingy with the amounts of fish/krab/seaweed, but still didn't keep this little Asian girl full for much longer than an hour.

Maybe we didn't order their best menu items, I don't know.  We did order the specialty drinks...which I expected to be special.  Not so much.  I expected more, better.

Everything was bland.  The roasted pork, black beans, anaheim pepper and cotija cheese omelette should have had a nice kick and big flavor...nope.  Bland.  It took lots of hot sauce to pick it up.  The egg part of the omelette itself was overcooked and dry.  

The hubby had the jerk wings which he said were ""fine.""  And our daughter had the huevos rancheros....again, nothing to write home about.  Very disappointed.

While the room was quite fine I find the casino and dining options a bit lacking.  I'll start with the room since I spent most of my time there.  The hubs and I got a good deal at forty five dollars a night for a basic king room.  They were having an on line sale, so don't expect that to be the rack rate, but I feel like it was a great deal.  The room was clean and up to my standards.  (Which are high for cleanliness.)  It had most of the amenities most would expect like a safe, hair dryer, ironing board, basic toiletries, clock radio, and there was even a little coffee maker in the bathroom.  They do have a Seattle's Best for gourmet coffee, but it's on the other side of the casino farthest away from the rooms.  The room could almost be described as a suite because they are large and include a love seat and a two person dining table.  Our room on the sixth floor opened to a great view of a wall, but I'm sure higher floors have a better view.  The things I wanted to see in the room were more pillows and extra blankets.  Two pillows on a king bed is just not enough.  Even the Plaza downtown had three.  

The casino had it's ups and downs but I doubt I would ever get the notion to come and gamble here again.  The slots were pretty tight for me and the blackjack here has some of the oddest rules I've ever seen.  (I am a dealer, I would not recommend playing blackjack here.)  Most places would have the dealer check for a blackjack if they had a ten or a face card up.  If the dealer has a blackjack the had is over, everyone loses and they play the next round.  Here they do not check and let people play out the hand.  So even if you hit to 21 and the dealer has a blackjack you still lose.  That makes me mad.  When I found my husband at the dice table and told him of the unfairness of this, another player chimed in that while he was playing they let his hand push.  (No win, no lose.)  That just added to my frustration about the strangeness of it all, and how the dealers here don't know their own rules.  

Another thing that bothered me about this place is the floor supervisors.  When I arrived I signed up for a players card and was given the speech of how you give it to the dealer to be rated for play.  I know how this works, as I work in gaming.  So when I sat down to play I turned in the card.  The floor took over twenty minutes to get me rated on blackjack, and when I moved to play pai gow  poker I played for over thirty minutes with my card sitting on the table and me not getting rated at all for my play.  I work as a floor supervisor once in a while and that is an epic fail of service in gaming.  It just makes the place look bad.  The poker area had seven games open with two supervisors, so one watches three games the other has four.  When I'm a floor supervisor I can watch up to seven games alone and could run circles around these guys.  

They do offer three dollar dice games and the cocktailers bust out those drinks fast.  As other reviewers have stated, what is up with those outfits?  Those poor girls.  They look like they are in an eighties work out video with those black thongs up their bums.  Come on South point, those uniforms are straight up tacky and no player really cares what the ladies are wearing so as long as they get their drinks quickly, and those ladies haul it so why not let them be comfortable?  

As for dining options, the whole reason we got a room to begin with was the gourmet food truck festival they held in the adjacent parking lot.  We went to the first one and this one was even bigger.  It was fine for dinner but when we got hungry later we went to Steak and Shake.  Tho only other late night dining option was the Coronado Cafe.  The dining option mostly reminded me of a knockoff Station casino.  Mexican, Italian, steakhouse, coffee shop, oyster bar, and a gourmet coffee place, the only difference is the South Point has ultra fine dining at Michael's and no food court options.  

Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you need a clean room to lay your head down that's not too spendy and close to the strip with easy access to the I-15.  I don't recommend you put your money down at the tables though.  If you are traveling and not renting a car, expect cab fare to get a little high because it's not really close to anywhere you want to be.",2012-02-03 16:33:35

I had lamb with rice and tikka and tandoori veggies along with a side salad and a mango lassi. 

The only thing I'd say is that the price and the serving sizes aren't a good match. The servings should larger for that price in my opinion. 

Unfortunately, I'm back to being a glutard and wasn't able to have any of the fresh naan. Clearly the operation is centered around the naan ovens, so I would expect it to be excellent.

Along with the traditional fajitas, rellenos, chimichangas, and hand rolled tamales, this unique venue offers up gumbos, gourmet chili, chilean sea bass, an oyster bar, and build your own margaritas.

Not only is the menu exciting, but the moment you walk into the place you are enchanted. High ceilings, graced with a colonnade of bronze, life size horses galloping across the ceiling, fountains, gothic lamps and oversized candles, a second story looking like a scene from Three Amigos...you feel transported to another world.

On the weekends I highly recommend venturing there after 8pm to see the performing band of mariachis. The group of girls are geared up with instruments, costumes, and beautiful singing voices, and they serenade all of the patrons.

Recommendations:

Drinks:
1. Their very popular coconut margarita, with the rim of the glass dipped in honey and smothered in roasted coconut flakes, or

2. My favorite, the Sangria Margarita. not listed on the menu, but available. 

Appetizers:

1. Tableside Guacamole 
fresh avocado, spices, pico de gallo and fresh-squeezed lime. Prepared fresh at the table and served with tortilla chips

2. Chile con Queso
my absolute favorite! An assorted blend of quesos and Hatch green chile. Served fondue style with fresh hot tostadas. 

Entree:

1.The Burrito Magnifico
It's a burrito, not that exciting, but I love it!
Large flour tortilla filled with refritos, carne adovada, machaca and cheese, topped with Hatch red and green chile. Served with refritos and arroz

2. RED CHIPOTLE CHICKEN PASTA 
Something different and delicious!
Fettuccini pasta with marinated chicken, confetti corn strips and our red chile chipotle alfredo sauce.

It's a case of misplaced expectations, hurtful to both the restaurant and the customer. 

We have been happy with Poros, having enjoyed several dinners there. We chose to 'sacrifice' last night, a Friday in lent, by treating ourselves to a seafood dinner. As always, it was excellent, consisting of the humus starter, crab cakes, halibut, and the requisite California Chardonnay. Service started out fine but slowed down considerably as the meal progressed. The dining room is modern and very attractive, and the menu and wine list well-conceived.

Sad to say that Noodle&Co's pad thai tasted better than some pad thais that I've had at ""authentic"" Thai restaurants.

I feel like I'm going to be a regular [depends if my friends drive] cause I'm from the east side.

There was 5 of us when we came in as a walk in around 7:30 on a Saturday. The place isn't too busy - the place is spacious enough.

Activities: 
- SO MUCH OPTIONS! It is an escape room/ board game cafe. There were lots of options in terms of board games although there could be more. As for the escape rooms, I believe there were 4 options available and they are working on another one. 
- The staff recommended Sherif and we had no idea how to play it. We read the manuals and enjoyed the game!!
- Luci's Room [$25 WEEKEND]: VERY CREEPY. Wasn't expecting ""the surprise"". We had 50 mins. to complete it but failed to do so. They gave us extra time since there was no other booking left. I must say, for a rating of 2 star difficulty - it kinda threw us off and the puzzles were pretty clever. 
- free PHOTOBOOTH [unlimited pictures] at the end and also you can write on their wall and make your mark!

Food: 
- Their food is really good [beef panini + japanese popcorn $6 + taxes] along with the sauce that comes with it. I also ordered the cookies n cream milkshake and it was delicious. I'm easy to please with food :)

Staff:
- Super friendly and helpful. They made us feel welcomed and offered help whenever we needed it. A guy actually explained an entire game to us. Another staff had to reset their router b/c their WiFi isn't working. Some places do not take the extra step to at least satisfy their customers.

Sure, there's no sense to the layout of the bakery, the lines can get long, and they'll offer seasonal items that blow your mind for a few weeks only to never return again (ex. religieux au caramel)...but it's worth the ""hard times"" to visit and load up on the sweet goodness that fills up this small French bakery.

The sweets are incredible. Macarons, tarts, eclairs, etc. I've tried every single item in the displays case at least once...and for the most part, I've rarely met a dessert on this level that can match La Gourmandine at other bakeries. From savory, to sour, to sweet, they nail all of the flavor profiles. They have a dessert for everyone. Rich, decadent options and more savory ones. One of my favorites on the sweet side is the macaron au fruit. It's a giant macaron with raspberries and cream in the middle. Talk about the perfect variety of textures and an overload of flavor! I could go on all day about their desserts...so amazing.

If you don't have a sweet tooth, not to worry. They have excellent baguettees, sandwiches (albeit only three varieties), quiches, and things like the tarte aux brie. I seriously can't say that I've ever had anything bad from the place. Sure, I haven't loved everything, but that came down to me not being a fan of hazelnut (gasps from the masses of nutella fans), more than the Paris-brest being at fault. Ha. 

Overall, you can't go wrong at La Gourmandine. Great food, desserts, and smells paired with super-nice employees and reasonable prices. Also, it's fun to chat with the other people in line for a sense of community in the mornings. What's not to love!",2014-10-14 18:01:44

There's no point in asking questions because the majority of the employees don't understand English.

Came here for brunch, and while the menu was impressive and the service was fantastic the food was just not. The portions were ok but the main ingredient of the dishes were are so sparse. 

The Smoked Salmon bagel for 13.50 should have more than one sliver of salmon. Same goes for the salmon egg white omelette. The sausage hash was ok, and the pizzas were tasty, just very greasy. 

My son barely touched his grilled cheese as it was very dry and had an embarrassingly thin layer of cheese.

So our club went out here for a good time, and upon entering the waitress seemed like she was less interested in helping us.  We asked for a table for about 20 people, and she looked rather irritated more than helpful.  We didn't wait that long to get everything setup in a place that was deserted.  But hey, that was just the bottom of the totem pole.  

I'm a person, who knows what to order once I get seated.  I say it out loud and maybe a little too fast, but I say it clearly.  The waitress kept on saying ""what?"" how many times after I repeated myself like 3 times.  Once everyone got their order down and taken care of it took them more than half an hour to get the orders out. LIKE COM'ON?!  There's like NO ONE IN YOUR STORE?! And when the orders did come out, it wasn't all at once. It was like 15 mins after the other.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, maybe I'm not.....but I swear, a restaurant that has no customers to service to, should have their undivided attention in pleasing the people they do have.  I don't know, maybe that's just me? As soon as my order arrived, the waitress notifies me, that she drops my wings and says... ""Sorry, we're making another batch."" I was like ok, that made everything worst because it took me even longer to eat. There was no, here's a complimentary this for waiting for your food. NOT even a refill for my drink, which she failed to do multiple times! 

This isn't the worst restaurant experience I've had, but it's pretty up there.  You should try to avoid eating here if possible.  Plus, the food isn't all that great.  I personally like Buffalo Wild Wings better, at least it has flavor.",2010-12-05 07:10:53

They still present photographs, paintings, sculptures and more throughout the cafe, most, if not all, for sale. The clientele has changed, as has the interior. Regardless, it's still a nice place for coffee. For those who haven't been, it's set in an old house on the southeast corner of 3rd Avenue and McDowell. Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area.

14anQB0pFb7ZftnzmsjSFQ,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,VQaZf8APldXwA-qZHIM1UA,4,13,6,8,"On October weekends, the Las Vegas springs preserves a spooktacular tradition. It is the Haunted Harvest at Springs Preserve. On October Friday and Saturday nights from 5 to 9 P.M.; ghosts, goblins, and creepy creatures haunt the Springs Preserve. The admission to see them is $6 and half off for Springs Preserve members.

    Haunted Harvest at Springs Preserve is anything but the night of the living dead. It is alive and hyper-crowded. It gets so crowded that last October, we couldn't get into the parking lot and had to delay it a year. It is so popular, that many of the guests are left to park across Valley View Avenue in the Meadows Mall parking lot. Tickets sell out. This year, I did things different. I'd get to Springs Preserve at noon, spend hours on the trails and have dinner in their Divine Cafe. Upon entering the park to walk the trails, I brought the tix. This guaranteed me that I would be getting in, saved me time on a long line, and granted nearby parking.

    The Haunted Harvest takes place in the public areas west of the trails. The stages of the Haunted Harvest are the Springs Amphitheater, Desert Living Center, and Botanical Gardens. The following paragraphs explain each of the stages in detail.

Springs Amphitheater :

   This was the least crowded and where the carnival games and shows took place. At 6 p.m., Las Vegas boys band Chimps on a Blimp took the stage. They were scheduled to start at 5:30. Oh well!  Before they started I enjoyed a $5 can of Dale's Ale from the Divine Cafe booth. Beyond the Springs Amphitheater is the Haunted Train Ride that is an additional $5.

Desert Living Center:

   This is where the Harvest gets spooky. A creepy clown and other creepy things decorated the walkway. This is where Ghost Stories, Lil' Gliding Paws, and Candy House Craft were. This was the stage of the majority of food venders.

Botanical Gardens:

   This was the creepiest land of Halloween Harvest. Everything was outdoors. It was kinda dark in spots with effects creating a spooktacular place. There were witches, goblins, skeletons, ghosts, spiders, but no trolls. The cacti and plants were decorated in colored lights with the Stratosphere towering above in places. There was even a cemetery. The cemetery was more droll than creepy. The Botanical Gardens were mobbed. There was no way to be scared. I think that Frankenstein and Dracula would be spooked by the hyper-crowded walkways. I couldn't even pass into the petting zoo on account of the body to body please give me some breathing room congestion. Forget about the hay maze. There were barely any live Halloween characters mixing in with the crowd. This isn't the place to expect a costumed Freddy, Jason, or Chucky to jump out of a cottonwood tree.The result was that Haunted Harvest was more cool than creepy. It was body to body with people, who were mostly families having a fun time. This is a safe environment for trick or treating. When children walk into the event, they present them with a trick or treat bag. Sprinkled throughout the Halloween -transformed botanical gardens are trick or treat stations. They included Frankenstein's Fun House, Mummy's Mad House, and Dracula's Dungeon. 

The Exit:

   My annual October hike in the Springs Preserve is a tradition. During these hikes I had spent time in the sun looking at all these creepy before leaving at 4 p.m. I had to see these creepy things in the dark. It was a mental bookmark erased to finally experience the Haunted Harvest. By the time I passed the creepy exit, I had been in the Haunted Harvest for two hours. That was sufficient time to explore the event and beat the crowds when it closes. I left the exit with the impression that Haunted Harvest is more of a family friendly event than a scary event.",2015-10-18 06:07:03

Having been a long-time fan of their cakes and ordered from them for every occasion from their cafe in Cosmo Music on Leslie, I was ready for more unique desserts promising the same high La Rocca quality. Over the years I've seen their products more widely available at major grocery stores, cafes, and saw diversity come into the picture with cakes, cupcakes, and my personal favourite, Euro tarts.

I got the chance to drop in on a whim about a week ago, and was greeted by none other than Mark, the same guy that's taken my family's orders from the Cosmo Music location for years. Following a quick intro of the location he immediately recommended the hazelnut cube and the yuzu coconut dome - both immediate crowd pleasers in my household. We also picked up the peanut butter mousse, peach and raspberry tart, strawberry cupcake, and raspberry pistachio eclair. Aside the hazelnut cube and yuzu dome, my next favourite was definitely the strawberry cupcake. Not to be confused with their usual cake flavour cupcakes, this is a ""cupcake 2.0"" (said Mark!) and it makes the icing a fundamental part of the dessert as opposed to a sweet addition. The other desserts were solid options, but did not stand out to me as something I need to go back and get again.

My most recent visit steered me towards the fig tart (new item!) and the orange and ricotta cheese tart. As promised, the ricotta was light and fluffy, and the non-traditional crust gives it an interesting crunch that contrasts from the smooth tart filling. The fig tart is quite something else - the fig slices aren't too sweet and definitely not drenched in syrup, and the crunchy tart crust is just right to go with the fruit - great for those ""I don't like my desserts too sweet"" people!

The store features modern interior decor with clean, geometric shapes similar to tangrams - fun and shows the creative spirit of the La Rocca Kitchen. A coffee and tea bar is available for your perfect cup to accompany your treats, featuring Illy coffee and LOV tea.

This place is located on Pecos Road not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself has a typical fast food layout, and can get a little crowded at times so you should maybe avoid the lunch and dinner rush hour. Keep in mind that this place is very small.

We had chicken wraps and falafel plates and they all tasted good. The price is also reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for most items and also expect to be filled after that.

our out-of-towners are not familiar with the mexican food the way most phoenicians are and asked *lots* of questions that were met with nothing short of annoyance from our server. then my dad demanded the server re-explain an entree for my mother, who ""might"" want to order it (she didn't). yes, our table was probably a pretty annoying one to be stuck with, but that's part of being a server. suck it up. i'm sure you dealt with people far more awful than our group before.

our food arrived within a reasonable length of time. the server and her helper had a hard time figuring out whose food belonged to whom - fine at applebee's, but i expected that this place would match the entree to the diner with ease. the food, admittedly, looked great. i had the fiesta chicken salad, complete with not ripe avocado and delivered with the wrong dressing. i ate it anyway. chicken was way too salty. hub had the carne asada steak. it was served charred but tasty, and portion was really small. we just didn't understand how that cheap cut of meat could fetch $18.99. i can't speak to what the other 5 in our group had; i was focused on choking down my salty chicken. 

after our food was delivered, our server failed to appear again until she asked if we would like dessert. i could have used another vodka tonic 20 minutes earlier and a water refill. dessert, a chocolate nut brownie thing with ice cream, was created table side and everyone agreed it was the best part of the meal. my bottom line: the food we ate was overpriced. our food was just ok. service sucked. there's no reason to go back.",2009-10-26 19:58:22

When I read some of the reviews, it just goes to show how ""petty"" some Yelpers can be.  C'mon, complaining about long wait, efficient but less than polite service when the place is packed/turned over 8-10 times a day?  I almost bet these Yelpers have never worked a real job that requires some sweat and wits to get thru the day (try standing on your feet 10 hrs straight serving over 2000 people during the entire time).  Fancy is many notches above the typical good tasting restaurants in this ultra competitive city.  If Fancy migrated to NYC Flushing, FORGET about getting a seat unless you slip an envelope of cash to the manager (Andrew Jackson or above), that's how good this place is in my opinion.  

Food quality:  10 Stars.
Price:  5 Stars plus (10 Stars if outside of Toronto due to competition/comparison locally)
Service:  Good enough for the pace.  Truthfully, anyone who lounges around and not eating quickly and go home should get bad service so the next person can have seating to enjoy.
Ambiance:  Simple decor but aesthetically pleasing.  Look at the geometry and spacing, some Feng Shui in action here boys n girls....
Details:  Yes, all about details in the whole shebang.  Dim Sum, snacks, main dishes, fancy food, street like food, dessert, nothing disappoints.  No waste at all, this place is like an elegant machine that just keeps on churning out high quality eats.

Any newbies who hasn't tried this place, ignore the negative reviews.  Take it from someone who has eaten 000's of roast ducks, 000's of lobsters/scallops/, 000's of live fish/Geoduck/fresh Abalone, giant scallops, live prawns.  This place is too awesome to pass up if your #1 priority is good tasting Cantonese food.  

Only thing you will not find here are those odd ball dishes made w/ funny parts of animals or insects, which can be delicious too, but not main stream enough to warrant them as menu items.  You know, inner parts mixed into the Dim Sum dish, funny herbal body parts soup, fried insects or worms, etc.  And yes, I tried them a few times too, just proves I don't pass up any potential culinary experience for my taste buds.",2016-05-21 03:04:06

They're open really early every day of  the week too, so you can come grab a quick breakfast as early as 6:30am before you head out to work.  They also serve lunch and dinner, and they have quite a few different menu options.

I've tried the veggie burger, tuna salad and vegetable sandwich- all were really good. Your meal also comes with baked fries or some kind of rice.  It's nice that they give us the calories, fat, protein etc. for each of their meals, so you actually know how much of everything you're consuming.

They have a small staff doesn't detract from their service. Our waiter was great in making recommendations and answering questions. It may take a few extra minutes to get your order, but well worth it because it is all cooked fresh! We started with spring rolls and egg rolls. Both were great, the egg rolls flavorful with a flakey shell, the spring roll delish as well but huge! The main course was fantastic!

Came in on a Sunday morning at 8:00, just 4 days after they opened.  There was no wait and only a few tables were taken.  I was seated promptly and brought water and coffee.  Both came in carafes, with a lemon (nice touch) slice in the water.

I saw on the menu that their salsa was homemade, so I had to try the Southwest omelette.  Got it with hash browns (crispy) and sourdough toast.  Came out of the kitchen in about 5 minutes.  It was most excellent!  The salsa did not disappoint, with big chunks of tomatoes and spiced nicely.  Matter-in-fact, I got so wrapped around the salsa, I realized I didn't have any meat on the side so I asked for a side of bacon.  Had that on the table in less than 2 minutes.

Needless to say, the food was great and service was fast.  Coffee was fine, but not spectacular.  I feel like Jack Reacher when it comes to coffee.  He would have been satisfied, but not thrilled.  The water, on the other hand, with the lemon and a carafe full of it on the table, was great!

I was going to sit at my table and type this review, but realized a line had formed and people were waiting for tables...all within 30 minutes of arriving.  It may be due to the novelty of the place, but to be on the safe side, get here before 8:00!

Updated on 9/12/15...I was a bit generous with my first review as I recognized there were growing pains this place would have to experience.  I've read the other reviews about rude greeters and poor food quality, so I came back this morning to see if I should change my rating.

5 stars it was and 5 stars it is!  Even better than the first time.  The evil greeter was not there, the proud grandma was, and the food was outstanding!

I gave this place 2 different times to surprise me with their original flavors and quality of food but alas.. it's seems to be consistently poor.

Cook on Wok has maintained 3 out of the 5 stars for the following reasons:

1) their not so delicious food is still reasonably priced on the lunch menu
2) I'm lazy and they deliver
3) I'm EXTREMELY lazy so not only do they deliver but you can order it to be delivered ON-LINE, haha.

iyTluxeed-6EmR4owkTnXQ,jkVaPj3MIS69-OcfX0c_CQ,q_KQbgnaYDlPx8EHTydcBQ,3,1,0,0,"This is a slightly outdated review (came here on May 13 for afternoon tea). I've heard from many other people that this place served delicious food and since I was in the area with a friend, we decided to give it a shot. Sadly, it did not meet our already low expectations...
We did not have to wait in line as most people seemed like they were just eating and leaving rather than chatting. I had a feeling this place spoke Cantonese (which they did) but because I am not that fluent, I spoke English. I understand that this is an Asian based area however, it is close to LA fitness and other non-Asian stores. Therefore, I feel like the waitresses should at least TRY to speak English and start a conversation and/or respond to our questions about the dishes. 
We ended up ordering a chicken dish, a latka (I believe that was the name), and their French toast cubes. The chicken was flavourful and I liked how their rice was fused with bok choy. For my friend, she ordered latka but stated that this was not how latka was made. It was in soup with noodles rather than rice and there was no indication of that in the menu. In addition, there was close to no flavouring so my friend added a lot of hot sauce to compensate . The French toast came later on with a side of butter and syrup. This dish was hard to mess up. Some cubes were more soggy than others but it is difficult to give every cube the same texture. I wasn't a fan of this but my friend was. 
The only positive thing that I remembered as of now was how one of the waitresses brought over a sample of soup when I was asking what soup it was. Luckily, we didn't get charged for this as we didn't like it (or she probably just forgot or didn't care). 
For the 3 dishes, we ordered 1 HK style milk tea and 2 lemon tea. 
This is your typical HK style cafe in Markham. There is more variety compared to other restaurants but some dishes do need improvements or clarifications.  Also, some servers need a change in attitude, which seemed apparent towards anyone who wasn't a regular or fluent in Cantonese.",2015-05-28 16:15:00

Lemon Tart- this was also awesome. As my dinning companions noted it was also like 3X the size of the chocolate tart for the poor soul who was foolish enough to order that. It was super lemony tasting so if you don't like that bitter bite than this probably isn't for you.

Comfort.
Value.

These words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. 

Right away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.

We received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. 

I'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. 


Here's what we tried:

//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary 
The cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5

//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95
We savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5

//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95
This dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5

//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95
A dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalapeño slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5
*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! 

//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 
A traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5

All minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. 

I applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.

Just a block or two away from Fremont Street and half of the rooms have stunning strip views. Solid casino and a no-nonsense feel to it it appeals to those who demand value. Proximity to FSE is excellent. Those light shows are loud if your too close.

Like all of Downtown this hotel is becoming ever more beautiful. Renovations and cleaning things up just like at the Plaza. When I was a freshly minted 21 year old and a student I particularly loved and appreciated the low prices on room rates. Today though I'm a bit less price sensitive.

There is something to really love about downtown Vegas. Its slower paced. More diverse people. Shorter walks to get to your hotel room and car. More alive... 

I usually stay at a Harrahs property with loyalty benefits but on NYE or EDC or CES this hotel would be high on my list as an option. For gambling and food its always a good option.",2017-10-06 06:46:20

Had his son (smaller size) get behind dryer (tight area) and remove vent and back of unit. Checked heating controls, heat output and cleaned the inside of the vent attached to dryer. Could find no problem, but that wasn't good enough. He thought maybe the vent tubing as too short and not letting the hot air to vent up to the roof. He replaced same with a longer hose.

Food:
The sushi seriously tasted like tofu, no  flavor. I probably tasted more of the rice, than the sushi. Maybe my taste buds were really really REALLY off that day, but I doubt it. No toro that day. Uni was decent.  The saving grace about this place was the non-sushi items like shrimp heads, oysters, gyoza, and dynamite. The most interesting meal of the day was the tofu cheesecake. Trying to cram an unhealthy cheesecake into a healthy food like tofu just boggles the mind. Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.

Service:
No complaints here, just nothing stood out. Felt like I just went there, order got my food, ate it, paid, and left. Didn't get the same good vibe from the staff like I did at Naked Fish, Raku, Hikari, or Sushi-Mon.

Price:
$22 for lunch from 11:30am - 4pm, $26 for dinner 4pm - 11:30pm. This is the going rate for AYCE sushi in town. If you're coming for lunch, you can pay for dinner price to get the Uni and sweet shrimp + shrimp heads. Worth the extra $4.

Here's the situation: Mother, Father, Aunt, Uncle are visiting from Nova Scotia, staying at the Sheraton. Walkable dinner location for a meat & potatoes group? Pretty obvious. We head to The Keg at 8pm.

Waiting area is crammed - but it's a Friday night. Of course. Lady hands me a spaceship beeper and we're lucky to score a just-abandoned table in the bar.

Then things got a little awkward. 2002 R&B blasting on the speakers, loud financial young bucks talking loudly in our peripherals. Not the ideal scene for a group of 50+ maritimers who unironically enjoy truck stop dining (which, as an aside, I also happen to enjoy A LOT). However, once some cocktails started flowing, everyone got comfortable and perhaps I even saw some head-nodding to the beats, Auntie Cynde? 

Anyway. Fast-forward 45 minutes later and we still haven't been seated. No biggie, but I went to ask for an ETA on our table. The hostess apologized and said it shouldn't be much longer. Minutes later, Mr. Manager himself came to apologize - insisted that he was working on getting us a table asap, and PLEASE, will we have some appetizers while we wait? He even kneeled down to our eye level. Real this-guy-knows-how-to-be-a-Manager type stuff.

They whisked us off to a table and almost immediately filled our faces with apps (1 more than we ordered). From then, things were unbelievable. Our waitress was perfect - just chatty enough and checked in on us with just the right frequency. Mr. Manager would ensure everything was perfect, even checking with the kitchen that the prime rib was to my Dad's ""blue rare"" liking. (*shudder*) Just wonderful, wonderful service.

See, it warmed the cockles of my heart that The Keg staff are so accommodating - we didn't even mind sitting at the bar for 45 minutes, but they did everything in their power to make the rest of our evening run seamlessly. It seems that in many cases, people get that kind of treatment when they complain, but to know that they still take care of the easy-going folk is brilliant.

First off, it's not a place that is good for the differently abled as it is on the 2nd floor and access is via the steps outside.  

Up the steps, you see a few tables outside on a metal catwalk.  Inside it's fairly dark with mood lighting.  There's a bar that extends to the small kitchen and sushi prep station.  To the left if a DJ area and more comfortable seating.  To the right are 3 booths with high backs so you cannot see the tables next to you.   Our group of 5 was seated here. 

There is an interesting selection of wines.  One of my friends and I were intrigued by the Velvet Devil Merlot so we both ordered this.  Good stuff. 

Now for ordering.  We ordered in spurts.  Tried a few plates and then added more 2 times, trying everything from a sampler to a cheese platter, then moving on to proteins with the ham plate, the shrimp ceviche, the shrimp sashimi tuna tacos, the spanish chorizo,   Everything was tasty but I think my favorite was the sashimi tacos which is way outside of my comfort zone.  The spanish chorizo almost had the texture of beef jerky,  There's nothing wrong with that, I just wasn't expecting it.  Same with the Shrimp saviche.  I wasn't expecting it to be so saucy with the coconut milk.

This is definitely a good place to go with a group because you get to sample everything,  And it does fill you up.  None of us had room for dessert.  

The place is relatively inexpensive.  After 2 drinks each, and about 10 different tapas, we decided to split everything evenly 5-ways and it only ended up being $26 each.  

The only flaw was with our server.  When we wanted to order more food, we didn't see her for about 15 minutes and had to flag her down.  This cost the 5 star rating.",2011-08-04 01:47:30

MAN: No not there! (Gestures to seat at four-top with one setting)
ME: Ooookaaaayyy....

So, an odd way to start my dining experience, but it didn't really get much worse than that. Otherwise the guy was pretty friendly. It was a small place, only a few tables (of which I must have picked the wrong one), but clean and quiet -- the perfect place for a quick break while running errands, all conveniently on the corner of Warm Springs and Arroyo Grande.

I went to my absolute favorite dish, Pineapple Fried Rice. It usually combines the sweet with the savory with the spicy perfectly. But this place just didn't hack it.

First, I had to ask what kind of meat came in it. Almost everywhere I've been has had either chicken, pork, beef, or something mixed in. Then he told me it was just the pineapple and the fried rice, but he said I could order some meat with it, so I got some beef added in. Again, odd, but not too off-putting.

The portion was nice and big... and pretty plain. It was just pineapple, egg, and a tiny bit of green onion on top. Don't most fried rices come with more veggies? At the very least some carrots and peas, right? Not this one. And it was pretty bland. I was kind of disappointed. It wasn't BAD, per se, but it left a lot to be desired.

I don't anticipate the lines to be that long going forward but either way there will probably be a wait for quite some time until more people try out Shake Shack. Anyway I have to say that I was fairly impressed with both the food and service. The people working here were super friendly despite the opening day rush and it was great to see people excited to try out Shake Shack for the first time.

After looking over the menu and what they have to offer I ended up deciding on the Shack Burger, Chicken Shack, Crinkle Cut Fries, and a shake. I know that was a lot to eat through in one sitting but I really wanted to try out as many of their offerings as possible. So far I would have to say that the Shack Burger was my favorite as the burger was of very high quality and it was everything that I expected. I was also impressed with the fries as the outside texture of the fries had a nice crunch to them that most fries don't have. The Chicken Shack was very good as well however I would still prefer to get the Shack Burger over it. Lastly, the shake was nothing too special and will most likely not get a shake next time.

I know a lot of people do compare Shake Shack with In N Out. In the end I do prefer Shake Shack for their burgers and fries however their prices are on the higher end which will deter me from coming here more often.

The concept is ideal (Neapolitan stone oven),  the choices offered are tantalizing (rosso or bianco; nice ingredient combos);  the pizzas come fast and hot - - it's a great place for a quick, tasty meal, and very good value, really.

But where Novanta misses, where it consistently lacks,  is the kind of alchemy that makes for succulence, for deliciousness, and for ultimate pizza satisfaction.  The pizzas look great, they have some nice aspects to them, but they are just not a delectable, satisfying whole, as pizzas go, and I think the main problem is a crust that is as clunky in texture as it is disharmonious in flavor.  A Neapolitan crust should blend dancingly with the toppings - - crisp here, almost sloppy soft there - - and always bright and enchanting.   But for me, the crust at Novanta is not particularly tasty on it's own - - more dark cardboard than fresh, bright wheatiness in character - - and in my last tries it has also been over-toasted, so it starts to have a flavor that is like a blend of whole wheat toast and tree bark (see attached picture).

The ingredients all look splendid,  but, again, something in the alchemy of flavors that makes for a great pizza is missing.  The mozz is excellent, the sauce is good,  but on the capricciosa the ham had little character, the peppers had an over-cooked casserole-ish sort of flavor - - and you add it all together, and flavor-wise, it just doesn't WORK.  (Though, admittedly, it can be difficult to get meats and veggies that have actual character and flavor, in the upper midwest.)    My prior pizza, a couple months back,  the salciccia also just wasn't a cohesive flavor ensemble, and the crust again killed it. (I've also had the 4-cheese twice, and once it was sublime, and the next it was unmemorable.)

Although I would love to say this is great pizza, I'm afraid it just isn't.  The concept seems right,  but there is just something missing in the flavor profile of the ingredients, and in the final execution.  Making great pizza is  an art - - and although this is high concept pizza, elaborately constructed,  it is simply missing the alchemy that makes for a succulent color/texture/ flavor bomb.",2017-02-20 21:34:36

Now that we have that taken care of, this place opened up and I just kept driving by and never stopped in because I will admit it, I was a self service car wash snob.

I really thought that a full service place was the way to go, that is until  I found this place.I drive a Hummer H3 and I always like it to be clean. 

So here is how this place works, you can buy a wash as a per wash fee, or you can pay for the unlimited wash plan. That is what I do, they have a $16 a month plan, which covers you for a basic wash. I really don't think that type of wash does too good of a job, that was the first plan I bought. I was going to cancel, then I learned about the $26 a month plan. This one does a much better job and to my surprise you even get your wheels dressed right inside the automatic car wash. If you get the automatic tire dressing, make sure you wipe the tires before you drive. Otherwise it will splash all over, I learned that the hard way.

First of all, because my husband and I love food so much, we tend to eat out and crave restaurant dining more than we should to be friendly on the wallets and our waistlines. Because Fresh and Easy has such a variety of good-quality frozen and pre-prepared options that can easily be combined to create a meal, I'm a lot happier eating at home and the total price is much less than we would pay going out. As an example, we combined their refrigerated vegetable samosas ($3.99) with their frozen paneer meal ($3.99; also comes with rice and green beans) and some naan ($3.99) and had a delicious, easy Indian meal for about $6/person. The other thing I love about this place is how, unlike at Trader Joe's, certain gourmet or more exotic ingredients are staples, and not special buys for a specified time period.  Before moving to Phoenix, my husband and I made Trader Joe's our gourmet market of choice, but would get very frustrated if we went there to get dinner supplies and found everything but basil and fresh thyme and had to make another stop. At Fresh and Easy, however, things like creme fraiche, Thai garlic & chili sauce, and herbs stay in stock so you can do all of your shopping for a recipe in one place. And then, there's just the deliciousness factor - many things I've randomly tried - red pepper hummus, pre-prepared flan, espresso fudge ice cream, and fresh grapefruit juice - have just been that - delicious. It's wonderful to feel that grocery shopping can tantalize you just as much as trying a new restaurant. Of course, I don't think that F&E would be as wonderful if it weren't right on 19th Ave. and Baseline, four minutes from my house. And I still LOVE Whole Foods. But I find F&E much more exciting and enjoyable of a shopping experience than a regular market or Trader Joe's.",2008-05-10 17:14:23

I couldn't resist since it's scarce in Vegas to find a good quality Korean BBQ place. The newbie on the block, Hobak made it on my list for stupendous quality of meat and service!

- FREE slushies while you wait for your table
- You walk towards your table and the entire staff 
   welcomes you
- Table is ready with side dishes, water, and all 
   the fixins
- Affordable prices, simple menu and three  
   different combos to choose from
- Charcoal and gas grill combo are used
- Server does the grilling and the meat cutting
- Grill is changed often
- Quality and flavor of meats are superb!
  (Highlight: skirt steak and spicy pork belly 2      
   thumbs up)
- Oral hygiene supplies are complimentary in 
   restroom areas

On a little side note.. I felt the round table was cramped for a party of four with all the dishes on the table. Although the banchan they offered were not all that bad, I prefer other options. The server does all the grilling and the cutting, but would rather do the work myself. To pull all things together, Hobak gave me a lasting impression that has persuaded me to come back for more!

Dealt again with VIP Golf (great company) and wanted to play some nice courses.  Our criteria was nice courses but not terribly far from the Strip.  They had a few private country clubs available for play to the public.  This course fit our needs perfectly.  It was only a 5-7 min drive from Palazzo and was reasonably priced ($180 per player Fri 11:40am).
Service:  No one met us at the front.  There was a phone that I picked up and someone came right away to get our bags.  Starter was really nice and helpful.  There is no cart lady so you have to stock up at the snack bar (after hole 3 and 14).  They give you a few bottles of water in your cooler.  
Golf:  Driving range and practice facility is nice.  The course was in really great condition overall.  The fairways were lush.  Tee boxes level.  The greens were probably in the worse shape (not saying much).  They were recently mowed so were hard and fast.

Over all a very very enjoyable round of golf.  The view was great with the hotels in the backdrop.  We were a twosome and finished in 3.5hrs.  Will definitely return",2012-11-14 03:48:27

I stopped by here for lunch on a weekday and was surprisingly greeted by an almost empty restaurant.  Only 1 server on deck for several tables.  Being the old colborne lane, I suppose there were some expectations.

The food here is excellent.  I was recommended the organic beet salad to start, which was a fresh and healthy suggestion to some of the other options.  The dressing did not overpower the sweetness of the purple and orange beets.  My colleague had the digby scallops which were small, but meaty.  Went with the roasted muscovy duck breast as my main.  Absolutely delicious.  The bernaise type sauce it comes with is a clash of flavours and went amazing with the duck.  The breast itself was generous and cooked perfectly and juicy.  There are also a number of seafood items on the menu that look to be worth trying if I return.

The cocktails are only $10.  I had the new fashioned and woods boulevardier.  The new fashioned is a great twist on the old fashioned while the boulevardier is more of a sweet cocktail (vermouth).  I definitely recommend the new fashioned.

Service was good but on the slow side - evidenced by one waiter who was waiting tables, running food and also the bartender.  He was polite and I don't blame him, but our cocktails took 15 minutes to arrive.  I'd return to The Woods.  It's expensive, but a great spot for a special occasion.",2014-03-19 02:49:40

The food is delicious, the fish is fresh, and the service is fast and friendly. But there just isn't anything about this place that makes it ""a great deal"" or ""worth the high price."" But the food, for the price, is just average. It's basically, exactly what you expect to get for the price you pay.

The options here are neverending. Seriously, the roll menu is HUGE. With so many different rolls, there's going to be something you like, no matter what your tastes are.

If you're a lover of fresh fish, definitely try the screaming orgasm, it is so yummy. 

This place would be 5 stars if it was just slightly cheaper. While the fish is definitely good, I've also had a ton that's better quality for the same prices. And I guess that is I Love Sushi's fatal flaw: it has, ever so slightly, over-priced itself.

The prices are about average for a sushi place, but definitely not on the cheap side.

I went here for lunch a couple times for work. It was good for me to spread my wings and try the offerings of this asian fusion house.

It's a lovely space which I would expect in Yorkville. Love the choice of art and boxed chopsticks found at each table.

The food was good but not spectacular. I would say as a lunch experience in the area it is one of the better places to go. Fast, fresh and not as generic as what is around you.

Having tried the sushi, bibimbap, bulgogi bowls, gyoza and edamame I would say like many - a 3 to 3.5.  The food compared to what you'd find in even small mom and pop places in little korea is not as good.  The depth of flavour just not there but it's satisfying on a quick lunch.

Make no mistake, eating in yorkville will mean you will pay much more than any other area of the city. Take advantage of the lunch special where you get salad, miso soup and your entree for under 20.

An assortment of French macarons was sure to score me more points than Russell Stover ever could. What's more, my girlfriend is a tiny thing, so I was guaranteed to be the ultimate beneficiary of the gift (evil laugh).

I asked for one of each and ended up with 11 different flavors. They were kind enough to go and get me some flavors from the back which had just sold out in the counter and patient enough to explain which each one was. (In retrospect I probably could have figured out the flavor of the one with the coffee bean on top).

The macarons looked amazing...the colors were so varied and vibrant. More importantly, they tasted as good as they looked. Our favorites were the cinnamon chocolate ganache and the pistachio, but all of them had their own unique charm. The vanilla bean macaroon had a pink heart on it in honor of Valentine's Day which my girlfriend really appreciated.

as i waited for this surprise special to come out (i dont think there was a choice what you could get;  they made the same for everyone.)  i sat at a table beside the front window, facing inwards towards the kitchen while one of the waitresses was just finishing to mop the floor.  

shortly after i sat down they brought me a teapot with the standard chinese restaurant tea - whatever that may be - but it was much need and fine by me.  

that need was further quenched by the first stage to arrive as part of the unknown meal.  the soup was a sweet corn and tofu soup.  its consistency was thick and kind of gluey and frankly snotty looking.  but im sure weve all seen chinese food that is not appetizing at first, second and third sight but mighty tasty when you eat it.  and so it was.  i put some soy sauce and a little hot sauce on it for a bit of the white mans spicing preferences and finished the bowl clean.

next was a gorgeous plate of freshly stir fried vegetables with that soft tofu that looks like its been wrapped in a glistening paper bag if that makes any sense.  it was flavourful and again warranted the extra sauce choices.  

coupled with a small bowl of rice, this dish and the soup left me with no space left for food and i was all the better for it.

i will come again for sure, and perhaps update this review, because i think this place tries to make itself known for more innovative vegetarian dishes where you can get faux duck, beef, seafood, etc. and id like to give that a go.  what i had was good, nothing extraordinary, but good nonetheless.

The garlic bread they serve was delicious and I also ordered a bowl of Italian wedding soups one of my favorites. The soup was the real deal! All the entrees include a salad which is a great bonus and the salad had lots of toppings and comes served with a house dressing. For my entree I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. It very tasty and the meatballs and red sauce were exceptional. Those in my party order the salmon and scallops and raved about how delicious they were. Almost to full for dessert but room to  take a bite of a homemade cannoli. Also would have loved to try a homemade rum cake. My biggest complaint of the evening was the BYOB policy. One person in our party brought rum and they charged a $10 corkage fee and for the coke. We also had beer and they charge $1 per beer. Beware of the high corkage fee. Luckily the excellent food almost made up for this,2015-07-07 17:41:26

I mean, the actual physical setting for a concert is fine, the sightlines are actually pretty good.  There are reasonable chairs, there is a stage, and.. speakers.  

And if that's all we expect from a concert stadium then ok.  It's a bit of a hike to the closest public transportation stop.  Ir can be a bit of a pain for thousands of people to stumble to the ttc stop after a concert, if you know what I mean.  How hard would it have been to have had the ttc stop be on the south side of the CNE grounds?  However, if you plan on driving, be prepared to get robbed for parking.  When you get there, just step out of the car, pull down your pants and bend over.  Seriously, wtf?!?!

Not only will you get robbed for parking, my can of freaking tall boy cost $11.  No.. that's not a typo.  $11 freaking dollars for a can of beer!  Seriously? WTF?!  Even if the concert itself was ""free"", between the Ticketmaster charges and these other pillaging fees, I'd still be paying at least $40!  Seriously? WTF?!

There's also no surrounding amenities nearby, so it's not a convenient place to grab a bite before or afterward.  You're essentially cut off from the rest of humanity.  You're in a marina!  It's about as joy kill as it gets.  Seriously?  Wtf?!?!

Plus why does the overhang roof only cover some of the seats??  I can understand keeping the lawn open air, but the roof only partially covers most of the seating except the back of the 400 section.  Did they just feel that the last 5 rows don't deserve to be covered in rain?  That'll teach you for skimping out and not pay $20 more to sit in the front.  SERIOUSLY?  WtF?!?  

Some people love the lawn seating, but I'm old now.. it hurts my ass and my back after an hour or so. They couldn't make it slightly less inclined than a crappy bunny ski hill at Blue Mountain?  SeRiOuSlY?  WTF?!?!

rxrjqSty3UBYVQDiX_ZqSA,lvD3j2ikhB48CZWMf-uLlg,f8IMQgRwo-8GP372MElDGQ,1,0,1,0,"My family and I stayed at the Plaza Hotel and Casino in November 2016, and felt this hotel is in desperate need of a complete renovation and completely new staff.  Our hotel stay was so bad it actually made us laugh.  The first thing that comes to mind is this hotel is old and tired, along with the staff.

The Plaza is located at the North end of the Fremont Street Experience.  The first thing you'll notice when you check in is lots of uniform security personnel who are in need of grooming standards.  I later realized the reason for all the security is to keep the drunks and transients out of the lobby and hotel.

The staff were all nice, but none appeared very happy or eager to make sure we were treated like valued guest.  Like the hotel, they all seemed tired.  There is a $20 ""RESORT"" fee, which includes in-room WIFI, and self parking.  I feel the hotel should actually have to be a RESORT in order to legally charge a resort fee.

The front desk is small with only a few staff, which made for long lines during check in/out.  The hotel is old, and lacks upkeep, maintenance, and cleaning.  When checking in, I asked for a room facing Fremont Street.  The agent ask if I was noise sensitive, because they play loud music till 2am.  Instead I opted for a rear facing room.  The music coming from Fremont Street is very loud, not really sure how anyone could sleep with such loud noise till 2am.  The rear facing rooms is not much better.  I was in the South Tower, on the 16th floor, and around 11pm, I woke up thinking a plane was crashing into our room, only to find that I was in a scene out of the movie ""My Cousin Vinny.""  A very LOUD train was passing directly behind the Plaza and does so several times a night!

The Hotel has a food court (McDonald's, Subway, Zabas Mexican, Coffee/pastry shop), Oscar's Steak Restaurant, Hash House, a pizza stand, gift shop, Las Vegas Jerky store, a wedding chapel, Pool and Jacuzzi, Gym.

The gym is located on the 3rd floor and is open 24 hours a day.  It is small with just the basics.  There are 3 treadmills, a stepper, and a lifecycle, a strength machine, and a rack of dumbells.

The pool is the only bright spot at the hotel.  It's located at the South Tower on the 5th Floor.  It's seems to have been recently updated.  It over looks Fremont Street.  The small pool is not heated, there is also a nice small jacuzzi.  They have lots of seating couches, a bar, a food truck, and several gaming tables.  They also have numerous pickball courts and tennis courts.  I loved the protective covering around the light post, it was BUBBLE WRAP!!!  No kidding.  Management is smart enough to realize there is a potential hazard of their guest running into the light post, but stupid enough to think bubble wrap is adequate protection.  Can you say lawsuit!  You can rent the courts and paddle ball gear.  Unfortunately, the pool/jacuzzi is only open from 9-5pm.  It's very nice out there in the evening.  It looked like some of the South Tower rooms connected directly to the pool/jacuzzi area and have private patios.

The room was medium size and clean, but like the hotel needed better maintenance.  The furniture was old, battered, and seemed not to fit in the room.  The room had a desk and chair, a medium flat screen television, iron/board.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.  The in-room WIFI had a good strength.  There was limited drawer and rack space.

The bathroom tub/toilet area was extremely small, when taking a shower it feels like one foot was in the tub, and one foot was in the toilet.  I don't think I've seen a smaller tub/toilet area.  The sink was located outside the tub/toilet area, and the sink had a funky smell.

On my first night, despite requesting housekeeping for our room, we came back to a dirty room without any fresh towels...

I will not ever ever be staying at this hotel, and would advise my friends and family to sleep in their car rather than stay here.",2016-11-27 19:07:21

I loved both dishes equally. The heat level was ""medium"" which for me was perfect. The rice in the biryani was lovely and perfectly prepared. Each grain stood alone. The chicken was on the bone, tender and plentiful. The fish was excellent, not overcooked and really enhanced by the curry sauce.

Given that the ice cream is homemade, I was disappointed to read that many of the ingredients that make up the ice cream were not more natural. Cutting corners by using high fructose corn syrup instead of natural, unprocessed sugar and other chemically named additives, took some of the appeal away as did the simpleness of the flavors.  The most exotic flavor appeared to be peanut butter ribbon in vanilla ice cream and Lord knows what kind of peanut butter is used in that recipe.

This is my second time visiting. The first time I arrived for happy hour the week prior. The bar service was so slow. I had to give the bartender the evil eye before I could get a drink after staring at the two bartenders for 15 minutes. I had a mojito since it was a happy hour special (still $8), but it was good. A little more lime-juicy than a normal mojito, but I liked it. 

The next time- I came for lunch with co-workers on a Wednesday (I figured I would give it another shot). My one co worker made a reservation for us at 12pm. I was impressed that we were seated right away considering the crowd, and that we were a few minutes late. 

The interior of the restaurant is nice- It's also a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.

We were seated, and our drink orders were taken quickly. Our water arrived after 15 minutes, and my mojito arrived after 25 minutes. The manager brought my mojito to me, and advised it was on her for the delay. I thought it was a nice gesture- until I tasted the mojito. Too much simple syrup was added, it was horrible and very hard to drink. Not at all like the one I had last time. Couldn't taste any lime at all. I didn't complain any further as it was free. I opted to try their sushi for lunch. The California roll was decent, and made with real crab. The spicy tuna roll had too much sauce and not enough tuna for my taste. My friend tried one of the tuna rolls, and liked it. 

My co workers each had burgers and fries. First off, one of the burgers never showed. The one co worker was so hungry after waiting 40 minutes for the food, she started eating hers. She said the burger just tasted like patties from a box (they also looked liked patties from a box). After the second burger arrived, the same manager gave it to the other co worker for free. 

To top it all off, my receipt should have showed the sushi since my mojito was free. There was an additional charge of $1.00 for pepper jack cheese that one of my co workers actually got on their burger. At this point, I'm so annoyed I deducted the $1 from the tip.

Server was nice, bread was awful and the food was nothing to write home about. I had the shrimp fradiavolo, nothing special, small shrimp floating in sauce with, over cooked pasta. My daughter had the pizza, pizza dough was terrible and raw like the stale bread they gave us. My wife had the puttanesca and they actually put olives with the pitts ...LOLOL! i guess they can't afford pitted Kalamata. Do they not warn people of this so they do not chip a tooth. I hear the owner is from Westchester NY. WOW is he fooling the people in Henderson. I asked the waitress why the Faux pizza brick oven in the front was not on and she said it was too hot! LOL. You would think they would have thought that out before investing in a oven of that caliber. Personally it looks like this may have been place that was owned by someone before that was smart and got out. The ownner now is clueless about Italian food and service and is trying to fool the people into believing it is authentic when it is really just...cheap food done wrong.  If you are going to try and sell a authentic premise...have authentic food. I will be surprised if they last much longer with whoever is cooking in the back.

Located in the Financial District, you'll be dining with swanky bankers, business men/women with briefcases, and really good looking people dressed in really good looking suits. It was pretty packed for lunch, so be sure to make a reservation.

I've gone today with a friend for a lunch date as it was nearby and didn't look too shabby. Actually that was one of the best traits of the place.

DIAVOLA: spicy sopressata, fior di latte, san marzano / 17

Actually really good pizza. I don't doubt it's antipasti, but in my opinion, the pizza had a lot of flavour and sauce that sticks to your face but it just tastes so good (warning for dates!!). It was also actually spicy, and I'm the type of person that chugs away at least a half of a Tabasco bottle for a meal (Nando's is one of my favourite places). *Almost* as good as Pizzeria Libretto for roughly the same price and in downtown Toronto. 

TORTIGLIONI: crispy pork belly, red onion, capers, tomato / 16

Not too much of a pasta fan, but it's decent here. Good meat to pasta proportions. However a bit on the salty and dry side for both the pasta and the pork. It was more ""scratchy"" than crispy, but it was okay. 

I guess the only issue I had with this place was the service. Our waters weren't even filled within the first half an hour and we were sitting NEXT to the water post! The servers also took a while to finally notice us to take our orders. I understand that it is a bit busy, especially at lunch time, but it would be nice to be acknowledged that someone would be coming our way. The servers weren't necessarily rude, but a smile here and there wouldn't of hurt anybody.

Overall, decent place. But I probably wouldn't try another one of the chain, considering there are so many other options.",2015-05-16 00:36:51

I was dragged here by some friends because I was a depressed mess following a bad breakup... 5 year relationship, she ended up sleeping with my best friend of 9 years - ouch. 

Anyway, this club is fairly small and easily forgettable. I swear I never remember it's even there even though I've been here at least twice. I also hadn't remembered it being ""fully nude,"" but their website says it's true so I have to believe it. I would think I'd remember seeing a vagina though. Hmm... maybe I did. I don't know...

What I do remember is that the girls are fairly attractive and there's a really nice hostess that acts like a used car saleswoman offering to get you anything you want and trying to get you to go back to the VIP room with one of the girls of your choosing. This kinda feels like a VIP treatment in itself... it can get a little annoying though if you don't want to be bothered. I found the hostess to be quite charming though.

The second time I was here, I had a few dances from some nice girls. The dances don't happen on the floor - they happen in a different area which seems a little more private and they are 20 bucks rather than the 10 which is typical of most clubs. I tend to chit chat with them rather than get ""into it"" and enjoy the ""sexy"" part. I never went into the VIP area, so I couldn't tell you what goes on back there... the hostess would have you believe it's ""more."" I would be skeptical.

We went through the whole rigmarole of the ""sales pitch"" and all that.  We traded in a nearly perfect 2015 vehicle just to get something better suited for our family.  The sales manager Beau was brought in to tell us what an ""amazing deal"" we were getting.  He was RUDE, condescending, and he even realized at one point how rude he was being and came back to apologize to me (too late buddy, who insults a customer like that?)  Despite being super annoyed by his treatment we were exhausted and wanted to just finish up.  Beau INSISTED that we had to buy this Zaktek paint protection plan for $300.  We had no choice, it was already on the vehicle and that was that.  We explained that we live almost 2 hours away (had only come to that dealership for the specific car we wanted and found online at their location).  I wasn't interested in driving nearly 4 hours, every 6 months, and having a 3 hour ""paint sealer"" put on my car.  That's literally a 7 hour ordeal for something I didn't even want.  Beau promised that we could have it done at another dealership closer to our home that was affiliated with them.  That is the only reason we didn't raise a huge stink about the darn Zaktek.  We figured ok we'll pay you the $300 and we'll take advantage of the service closer to home.  So today I get an email that I'm due for Zaktek and what do you know - Beau no longer works there (shocker) and there is no option to go closer to home for the service.  Apparently they lied and it has to be done at their dealership.  So... you're telling me I get to pay you $300 for a service I didn't even want in the first place and I get to waste 7ish hours of my day having it done?  Really?  I called and spoke to Beverly in customer service and she told me how great Zaktek is.  Yes, got it.  It's great.  But what does that do for my time, my money, my mileage?  So, so frustrating.  She said she will try to talk to the owner next week but doubts there's anything they can do.  Gotta love that kind of customer service.

Regarding the rest of our sales experience, when it was time to sign on our deal, the finance guy (I think his name was Ryan, had a Vince Vaughn thing about him) was slick as an oil spill.  He talked fast and flipped through the finance papers and tried to pull the wool over our eyes with the warranty stuff.  We were under the impression that he knew what the deal was that we agreed to with the sales guys and that was the deal we were getting.  We wrapped up, fatigued, and waited for our car to come out of the ""detail dept"" so we could go home.  Since it was taking forever I looked back over our agreement and saw that slick Ryan changed the terms and extended our loan to make the payment seem lower.  What the?!  I was so mad.  We had to find our sales guy, wait even longer, Ryan had shut down and left the building so we had to wait for another finance guy to re-open our agreement and fix it.  He was nicer but by that time we were just mad.  We waited even longer for the detail to finish (I use the term detail loosely, Pete our sales guy wiped down the surface interior of the car, that was about it, it was pretty dirty, even had the previous owner's dog hair all over the place.)

I rarely sit in the dining area of the restaurant.  The tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped, and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you.
Sit at the bar, where you are always waited on promptly, the bar tenders are quite knowledgeable, have time to discuss the art of being alive, and can whip up some delectable treats before you receive your fare.  My personal favorite beverage is the Thai Iced Tea.  Though non-alcohlic, it is delicious and complements any of the foods well. Ask the bartenders or servers about the wine list, often they carry imported beer from Italy as well.
I will start by saying I have not tasted everything on the menu,  but i do know what i will order again and again. 
If you are new to Thai food, an absolute must is the ""Tom Ka Gai"" soup.  A serving ideal for a party of three, it is a divine hot and sour interpretation with coconut milk, mushrooms, cilantro, lemongrass, galangal root, and kaffir lime.  It can be ordered with any meats, tofu, or just plain.  I recommend it with all white chicken, and at a number 2.  If you are unsure about how spicy you want your Thai food, remember that 1 is not spicy, and 5 (the highest) will probably burn offyour taste buds.  Perhaps you like spicy, but also note that too much spice will overpower the complexity of your foods.
If you want an assortment of various appetizers, try the Combination plate which includes Spring rolls, Satay, (marinated chicken tenders with cucumber and peanut sauces, and my favorite!) Thai Toast, (flash fried toast points filled with garlic and chicken, not my favorite) Crab Rangoon, (delicious flash-fried puffs of crab and cream cheese served with thai sauces) Siamese Kisses,  (chicken and shrimp in steamed shumai wraps topped with scallions and crispy garlic) and Potstickers.  
All come with an assortment of sauces, and if your eyes are larger than your belly, then you will likely have no room left for the divine main courses.
Quite frankly, I have never tried any of the house favorites, except the Pad Thai.  And if Pad Thai is all you know, I recommend you venture out this time and wrap your lips around some of the sweetest, most delicious curries this side of the West
I am not a fan of vegetables, which is something one finds an overabundance of in Thai dishes...but not if you order the ""Burma Gai.""  Flat noodles and chicken in a yellow curry with coconut milk with titillate and tantalize.  You can substitute, add, or remove anything in any one of the entrees, so you can basically customize your entrees.
If you like something with a little more pizazz, do the ""Drunken Dragon Noodles"" or ""The Evil Jungle Princess.""  Another curry dish, the Dragon, has rice noodles smothered with a wild green curry sauce, topped with chicken, basil, and onion. Again, if you are not a fan of the spicy, go very easy on this one.  Better yet is the Princess, which has a lovely coconut sauce with hints of mint, and two simple additions of chicken and straw mushrooms.  Though I prefer chicken or nothing at all, the Green Basil Curry with Pork is another incredible curry with coconut and various veggies.
You will also have a selection of seafood dishes, as well as specialty sushi rolls and vegetarian preparations.  Remember that the sauces here are the key, all dishes are served with rice, all ingredients can be removed or substituted, and if you really want to taste the diverse flavors, don't make your dish too spicy.
Don't be shy to ask, as all the waitstaff here is very knowledgable, and even if you are new to Thai, or a veteran, they can assist you in making the perfect choice.
Should you have room for dessert at the end of your robust meal, a must is the traditional Thai favorite, Sticky Coconut Rice with fresh mangos. Not heavy enough to warrant a wheelbarrow for the ride home, but sticky and sweet enough to make you feel like a kid again.
In short, I love this place!  And I have to come here at least once a month just for the soup and the great conversation with the bartenders.",2009-05-28 17:40:58

Food is fresh, unique, and wide in variety. The corn beef has at brunch has large chunks of actual corned beef, so much better than the canned crap I'm used to.

First off, the concert venue is perfect for Phoenix.  It is small enough to be extremely intimate, yet large enough that you don't feel cramped and can step away almost enough to have a conversation while the music is loud.  Drinks are reasonably priced, and there are 2 bars that generally don't have a huge wait.  Did you say you could buy a burrito to eat during the concert? Heck yes!  The sound quality and lighting are both pretty good, and they bring in great local acts.  I think they have a concert nearly every night of the week, and tickets are rarely expensive.

Second, the lounge area is pretty awesome.  There is never a cover to get in, and you can generally hear the concerts from there as well.  Most nights there is a DJ that plays some pretty sweet music, and people seem to always be happy.  There are a number of high-tops and tables if you want to chill, and by midnight people tend to create a little dance floor.

I don't have much experience with the food here, but the burrito I had was pretty good and I've heard good things.  Check that out for yourself.

So, why only 3 stars?  The big reason is the smoking.  Crescent has a sizable patio area in the front of the building, and it draws quite the hipster crowd.  I love hipsters.  But I hate hate hate how much they smoke.  Every single person on the patio is smoking at all times.  The problem here?  The patio has giant doors that open the lounge up to the outside, and the hipsters are essentially smoking inside.  Not in 2012, not in my book.  It kills me.

Reason number two for the star-deduction: what is wrong with the grapefruit juice here?  I've been told by every bartender that it's fresh-squeezed, and I have no reason to doubt that.  But seriously, there is something major wrong with it.  I've tried it with all of my favorite vodkas, and it just fails each time.

So, here's what you do.  Drop by one night, they're open until 2am every night.  Check out a concert if you can, for $10 who really cares if you know them or not.  Grab a drink at the bar and stay as far from the patio as you can.  And grab an Odell IPA, they never disappoint.",2012-06-04 08:46:29
MOsobySmPX_AzWgFPupqvQ,FSw3Kk2Ssn6vUe9asc5vsA,UOFTGqJ95xQxeYndG7hbbw,3,3,1,2,"I, like most everyone else who works in uptown, frequent this YMCA during my lunch.  It definitely gets crowded at that time, so if you can make it here during off-hours, it is a decent gym. Very clean and nice locker rooms.  Plus, I once lost a necklace here, and the cleaning staff found it and gave it back to me, so props for that.

I do have some serious issues with this gym, though. I am a group exerciser, so my main problem is with the group exercise facilities, which seem to have just been thrown together without much thought. Most of the classes are just randomly held in one part of the gym that is separated from the rest of the gym by sheer netting. As a result, when you're exercising the entire gym can (and usually does) stare at you. There also isn't a mirror anywhere for you to check your form. The YMCA actually has a proper group exercise room hidden away in another part of the building where a few classes are held, but it isn't clearly marked at all, plus you have get a special pass from the front desk to even get to it--very inconvenient.  The spin classes are held in the middle of the running track , so while you are spinning, joggers, often engaged in loud conversation, are constantly running by you, which is pretty annoying.  In general, the classes taught here tend to be different than at other YMCAs--the instructors are older and the classes are very Jane Fonda-esque.  I've been to a lot of them and have found the spin classes and the Body Pump (group weightlifting) classes to be the most challenging and have the best instruction. I've never been to the Athletic Conditioning class, but it seems pretty intense, too.  That said, in general, I don't think the classes are as hard as what you find at the Dowd or the Gateway (the Turbokick classes here are in no way as good as the ones at Gateway and the Dowd YMCAs).

This gym does have great pool going for it. Unfortunately, it tends to be packed with jerky triathlete types who either don't know how or don't care to properly share the lanes. Again, when it is off-hours, the pool is much better. 

While this Y does have parking in the basement of the building, but it is a little dicey to get around, and I believe parking is only free during off hours.",2011-06-01 17:24:21

Ok, so no other place in Charlotte does a sushi buffet like this joint.  If you are hungry you can't find a better deal, it's something like $10, for all you can eat.  You could easily spend that on just 2 rolls anywhere else.  The sushi here is kind of ""Americanized"" in my opinion.  I'm not complaining but seriously, just know that if you eat sushi that has been deep fried, um, that's not healthy.  

They keep time labels on the sushi plates so as to make sure the sushi is the freshest it can be but normally the sushi runs out before the time does, so that should tell you something!  It's really good.

The shop is really cute. Lots of neutral whites mixed with bright colors. In addition to the delicious sweets they also sell a few cutesy gift items. There are a couple of tables for those that want to enjoy their sweets on the spot.

I liked the selection of goodies available when I stopped in both times. My favorites being French macarons and the cupcakes. Every item I've had here was really good and satisfied my sweet tooth without being too sweet. The pricing is comparable to the prices at other bakeries in the area.",2016-04-17 00:04:52

I was excited to try Dillon's as it is close to my house, and I love good BBQ.

I'm sad to say I was less than thrilled.

We ordered hot wings. What we got were 12 fried drumettes, and a small bowl of sauce, that looked and tasted like dressed up Tabasco, rather than a quality hot wing sauce. We also got the obligatory carrot and celery sticks, and something that approximated, but fell far short of, bleu cheese dressing.

We decided to split the 50/50 Ribs, and we got Cajun for the non-St. Louis style.

The ribs were good, but not great. The actual ribs were nice, having plenty of meat, rather than being mostly bone. But the cajun sauce wasn't noteworthy, and the St. Louis ribs were again, an approximation of true St. Louis ribs.

Also, most BBQ places provide, or at least ask if it is desired, extra sauce. We got none. Further, the meal, which we specifically informed the waitress would be shared amongst three people, came with a single roll. Which looked more like a burger bun. Rolls are very cheap, and one should always be provided for each diner.

We had a dessert, as well, the Cinnamon Apple Dumplin', which was crispy cinnamon tortilla chips, baked apple dumpling, and several small scoops of vanilla ice cream.

It was really good, and we finished it off!

Hell, I'd almost go back just for that dish!

I was disappointed in the wings, but I accept that not all places do wings the same. I was disappointed by the lack of extra sauce, and additional rolls.

I was happy with the dessert, and the $3.50 beers.

I think they can do more.

I'm a pulled pork kind of guy, so I definitely intend on going back, and trying that item. I'm hoping it fares better than the wings.

All that being said, I will go back, because I know they're just opened, and may need some time to work out some kinks.

I poured over the menu while sitting at my desk at work and drooled at the thought of the bacony extravaganza I was going to consume. I envisioned myself moaning with pleasure over the house made salad dressings...and then...not so much. 

I ordered the grilled cheese appetizer and a salad for entree because they appealed to me more than the actual meals. I didn't care for the grilled cheese and the red pepper tomato soup was just o.k. The salad was alright but nothing to get excited about - I like a salad where the dressing wows you or there are a unique flavor and texture combination - that was not the case here. I also ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits - dry. Really dry. My last ditch effort at trying something awesome was the bacon s'more - it was ok. Nothing spectacular.

Nicely decorated and open.  We were welcomed by a nice lady who told me to seat myself and she'd follow me.  My little one and I sat down and were quickly greeted again by our waitress.  My little one had a Belgiam Waffle with syrup and butter.  Out of curiosity I stole a bite and thought it was good.  I had a standard egg sandwich (over easy) with ham on toast.  It was right tasty.

As spoken by other yelpers, let me re-iterate some key points. The menu is quite possibly one of the most colorful hand made works of art that doubles as a menu. The interior is similarly decorated as well.  You would never think that a place like this existed in such a location, but drive through a residential part of town, and then boom, there it is just sitting on the corner.  Server was friendly and offered us a selection of their beers on tap and information on what they had for the evening. Eventually my fiancee settled on being a traditionalist with the standard grand Regulaire, while I went the man route and got the  grand Bourguignonne, although I had them leave out the mushrooms. Pics were taken of both dishes and just staring at these took a year off our lives.

Mine could best be described as meat on a plate with starch under it.  The gravy was excellent and seasoning of the beef was tasty. Since I am not Canadian, I cannot say whether the cheese ""squeaked"" or not so I deferred to my fiancee who says ""It didn't squeak but it was still fresh"" you purists apparently will understand that..

She enjoyed her traditional poutine, however felt that the fries could have been a little less greasy, more cheese on the plate, and that the gravy was perfect. Definitely one of her top 3 poutines shes had so far to date.",2010-03-26 19:53:27

I guess that's a good sign of authenticity to their dishes since Japanese people frequent to this location.

Great selection of beer and sake.  Looking through the list, oyster stout sticks out more than others.  A bit apprehensive about getting it though due to the idea of it being brewed with shellfish.  Surprisingly, it tasted just like a Guinness with a minute hint of oyster sauce flavor.

Another first would be the bakudan--natto, tuna, yamaimo (mountain potato), and okra mixed in a bowl with spicy mustard and soy sauce.  This dish somewhat reminded us of the poached egg dish with sea urchin and salmon roe from Raku.  This, however, isn't for the faint of heart especially with the natto (fermented soy beans) that can be quite off-putting for those who haven't had one before because of its strong smell and slimy texture.

Everything else we ordered were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Too bad this place isn't robata, nonetheless, flavors were on point.  Go for the grilled Salmon Kama and you won't be disappointed.  Their yakitori are also reasonably priced.  I ended up ordering multiples of chicken gizzard and cartilage.

There are two reasons to visit and they are 1) sports games on the many screens throughout the bar and 2) karaoke on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays starting promptly at 10pm. I could really do without the guitar hero interludes, but the song selection is huge and if your song isn't listed in the book that's thicker than a Yellow Pages, the DJ can even play an amazing keyboard accompaniment for you - as long as you know all the lyrics by heart. But with a selection that spans Tenacious D's ""F*ck Her Gently"" to ""Defying Gravity"" (from the Wicked musical soundtrack but made famous by Glee) and a diverse enough cast of characters to sing them, you're bound to have a good time (or at least a good laugh).

All of the pastries I've had there have likewise been excellent. The little cream-filled cakes (deli manjoo?) are pretty tasty, although I've OD'd on those before and have to take it easy. Don't order the box of 20 and try to eat it all at once!

Beware the #8 Shredded Pork, a.k.a 'pork skin' sandwich... if you've never had one before, it probably isn't what you expect.

This sale was so good that I returned with my fiancé the same night so he could check it out.

As much as possible, we proudly create products in house or source from purveyors that are not only friends, but reputable artisans in their own right."" 
 Metro brasserie is the only French eatery in old town Scottsdale, though there are other competitors such as Zinc, Voltaire, and Christopher's. Stick with Metro, because here you will experience French with a southern flair. The chef is french canadian but lived in Louisiana for a spell - hence you are getting French cooking with a southern twist. If you are looking for good French farm house fare, you will find it here. From braised pork cheeks to duck breast and chicken fried sweetbreads - your taste buds will run the gamut of pickled vegetables, cold cuts, pates, and mussels.  Expect small portions on appetizers, ranging from $8-$21. Love fried green tomatoes? I do :) here you get a whole three, fried with so much cornmeal that you can barely taste tomato, but the accompanying blue crab and remoulade sauce make up for it. Dishes change seasonally, so don't come here looking for beef burgundy and bouillabasse in summer. The brasserie burger, voted best in the valley, is a must!  With sauce gribiche, smoked Visalia, and gruyere, it is a unique twist on the American fave, and it may rank up there with the most consuming passion I have ever felt for a finger food.  At $12, the consensus is it's the best burger in old town!  On the opposite end of this food spectrum is the ""potage of English pea"" woaw! Kevin Wooton, bartender extraordinaire, sums it up in one word: earthy. My dining companion and consummate food critic, Anthony Crain claims, ""I feel like I tripped and fell headfirst into a patch of moss, perhaps there was even an earthworm in it.""  If your palate is not so adventurous, head straight to the bar and stay there. I am a big fan of their lavish and inventive $10 cocktail menu. Currently, I am sipping on a raspberry presse (chambord, orange blossom honey, lemon wedges, raspberries, and soda water) many of their cocktails were made famous half a century ago, sip some nostalgia here. An old classic is the ""corpse reviver"" (gin 209, cointreau, lillet blanc, absinthe, lemon juice, and amarena cherry)  For first timers, bartender Kevin Wooton recommends the ""ramos gin fizz"" (hayman's old tom gin, lemon juice, orange flower water, vanilla, cream, egg white, and soda water).  There is a reverse happy hour after 10p, the bill is 20% off if you are in the industry. $5 recession specials are all day, such as belvedere, tanqueray, and dewars scotch.

Last but not least, the breakfast menu is extensive, the late night menu is available until 2a, and you can't leave here before you have had one of their beignets with nutella and raspberry coulis.  Sweet Jesus, they are divine!

Come here on an empty stomach, prepare yourself for a culinary adventure into France, and the dirty south.  And if at all possible, make sure Kevin is at the bar.  He is incredibly knowledgeable about not just the fabulous cocktail concoctions, but also the food and history of the place. Kudos for Kevin!",2009-05-29 17:10:55

If you want NY style pizza that's exactly what you get. Not that real NY pizza is the best mind you (far from it) but it makes for great comfort food. And this one is not tasteless like ""Tony of Charlotte""s pizza. Hey Tony NY called and they want their subway map back, you fake!

I had a slice of Sicilian with extra cheese the first time (Yes!) and a plain slice the second time. If you saw the pizza that Trump shared with Palin this is it. It tastes exactly like the pizzeria from across the street back when I lived in New Yawk, at least before the Greeks took over and ruined it. Plenty of cheese (extra would be an overkill) good sauce and a huge slice for $2.45. 

No, it's not crispy! NY style  pizza NEVER is -other than Frankie's in Miami, I don't know how they do it.  Not even Ray's Pizza* was crisp. NY style is rich, gooey and runny. And you tap a paper napkin on it to absorb some of grease so it doesn't run all over your chin. This is not fine food, it's pig-out comfort food. I've long outgrown this stuff. For dinner it's crispy, thin crust brick (open) oven or nothing but a slice for lunch ... hits the spot like the good old days.

Wanna know what's not authentic about this joint? No freaking way that you'd have to wait for a simple slice in NYC, especially not ten minutes like you do here. Are you kidding me?

I haven't tried any of their toppings and honestly they didn't look too famous, I'd stick to the plain slice or the Sicilian w/extra cheese.

*  Ray's pizza became famous in the seventies, there was only one location and it was called just  Ray's Pizza - the night shift cabbies stopped there at 2 -3 am, that's how the word spread around.

It was slightly busy when we arrived but got busier as the night progressed. We decided to start our meal off with cocktails, I forget the actual name of the cocktail but it had mango puree, lime juice and amaranth (I believe that's how it's spelled?). It was delicious! and we also had the vegetable samosa. Th samosa had a slightly thicker crust than I was expecting but filled with the right amount of spice and texture.

My bff went the traditional route and ordered the chicken tikka masala while I decided to go the more 'modern' route and ordered the black sesame-apricot-chili glazed chicken tikka. A giant bowl of jasmine rice and basket of naan accompanied our plates. The naan was light, fluffy and practically melted in my mouth. My plate of chicken tikka was so beautifully plated and tasted even better than it looked. So juicy and full of flavor. The vegetables were lightly spiced and slightly al dente.

I got to try some of the traditional chicken tikka and the chicken was so buttery. The naan was perfect for scooping up the chicken and sauce. Our meal was delicious, we didn't want it to end so we ordered dessert. We shared a bowl of the kulfi which was delightfully light and sweet way to end our time at Copper.

3. they only have outdoor seating. even when it's 115 degrees outside, or raining.
4. there are no restrooms. what restaurant doesn't have restrooms? guess you better not eat there if you have the little ones with you...

Now the unfortunate premise about my decision that fall weather is happening, besides the obvious fact that it is 103 degrees at all times of the day or night, is the price tag attached with this raving lunatic of a decision. Sure it is all well and good to make irrational decisions based upon nothing more than egomania until you start hitting the pocketbook and really that is were the fun stops! 

My answer - Turnstyle, tucked between the Federal Express and Sally's Hideous House of Beauty Supplies right off the I-10 and Ray. Not much on the designer bling, forget your Gucci, Prada or Chanel, think more Coach, plenty of Nordstrom Signature, Banana Republic, INC, Gap, oodles of Ann Taylor,  Nine West, and Anne Klein. Prices are great on the clothes, just soo soo on the shoes, I mean really they are used shoes, who is going to be paying $20 for used Nine West...? Another plus, does not smell like Fre-Breeze. A refreshing fact for this consignment junkie. Just like the retail stores, Turnstyle trots their fall wear out end of August - nothing more than 2 years old in style - so you too can start believing it is fall simply by dressing the part and lunacy will not hit you in the pocketbook...",2008-09-10 03:13:35

Last nights visit was a result of a Groupon purchased in November 2014 with a Xmas Eve expiry.  Cabo Wabo may be a hit elsewhere but in Vegas I'd have to say its an epic fail. Located at Planet Hollywood this place is H U GE! 

Multi level; huge outside seating area with a great views of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant itself occupies the ground floor. There is a stage, lots of tables with limited room to walk around. There is a lift and stairs to take you to the levels above. What is up there I don't know. I suspect a club and/or private rooms. Not exactly sure. What I am sure if is people were constantly on the move, up/down the stairs, causing quite the fuss. 

The music here is loud. Really loud for a restaurant. We were yelling at each other to be heard, as were other diners & staff. The restaurant & outdoor bar weren't busy so I'm not sure why our server Victoria took forever to greet & take our drink order. She was very nice though.  Lots or servers to be seen but none to be found. Food coming from the kitchen was ridiculously slow. 

I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger & my friend had the Cilantro jalapeño chicken breast. Hers was served with onion rings. Sadly, upon biting into one she immediately pulled a chicken bone from within the ring. Fortunately her temp crown from a root canal wasn't damaged. We still can't figure out how this happened. 

I order my burger med-well. Since it took forever for our food to come out I was hopeful the burger was properly cooked bSadly it arrived cooked LESS THAN medium. It was gross. The fries tasted like fish. It took a good 15-20 minutes to get our server. Why I don't know. Numerous servers walked by our table & never stopped to ask if there was a problem. It was obvious there was...both plates pushed away from us, untouched. 

Eventually Victoria arrived, along with a manager. He was quite gracious. Free margaritas & a redo on our food. Fortunately they both arrived properly done. 

Dare I mention there were other diners standing on the tables dancing?  Security guards putting on their own dance act, sitting down, hanging out with friends or trying to pick up girls. 

This place is a joke. Ok food not worth the wait or pricing. Irritatingly loud music. TONS of empty tables, inside & out. Bathrooms were disgusting: water & used towels everywhere. Servers galore but of no use. 

Not my sort of place. Not what I expect to see or experience when I go to dinner. No wonder they ran a Groupon. This place is awful.  If you're a local like me, there are better places off strip to go. If you're a young, classless, dumb tourist wanting to do nothing but show your ass, spit, & get drunk...then this place is great for you.  FAMILIES STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.",2014-12-22 07:25:05

- restaurant has now moved to ground floor of a new parking lot structure by 251 consumers rd
- perfect for customers working nearby the office buildings, parking might be a little tricky
- high ceilings bright lightning with limited seatings (around 16-20 people)
- friendly staff, fast with service
- mostly a take-out kind of place

Food
- tried their classic Veal Sandwich, which you can choose how much sauce you like. And it's how much the staff will dip the veal into the sauce
- I chose full sauce thinking the veal would be dry. Surprisingly, it's not! Cooked to the right level where it's soft and easy to chew. Thinly sliced but massive size
- also liked the bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Nothing like a hard bread/baguette
- sandwich itself is around $7.50, so it's a pretty good grab for lunch 
- definitely want to try their meatball or eggplant sandwich next time
- also serves pizza and salad/soup",2018-02-12 18:31:21

This is a typical Hong Kong type of cafe restaurant and they expect that most of their customers will read and speak Chinese and if you don't it will be a less than satisfactory experience especially where service is concerned. It's good cheap eats, I had a huge portion of shrimp dumplings with tossed noodles.
 I don't want to sound prejudiced but it's a typical fast Chinese food restaurant, the menu is horrendously hard to read, they skip the numbers of items on their list if they have a picture of it. Most of the lunch dishes are under $10 with some around $11-12. Some specials allow you to add a specialty beverage for $1. It features HK style cafe dishes that are a fusion of Southeast Asian, Italian, and whatever they think works.
If you enter Pebble Street from the parking lot entrance you will eventually realize that Pebble Street and Forbidden City are run by the same company, there is the cashier counter to your left and past that allows you entrance into Forbidden City restaurant and to your right is the cafe. 
Hot tea is served in a plastic tumbler right after you are seated. I would grab a printed take-out Pebble street menu though the prices are outdated (available at the cashier counter as you enter). It is much easier to read though there are no pictures it is definitely less confusing. The level of English spoken is from poor to not so poor so don't expect to discuss more than what may be in a dish and even then I'm not sure that if you have allergies that it would be safe, so for those of you who are gluten intolerant or have other allergies I would eat at your own risk.

Before I start there are two things you should know:
1. 3 weeks in Lyon, France more or less ruined me on French food in the United States.  Who knew something as simple as bread and butter could be so much better!
2. I stopped in about 2:30PM and didn't feel like hanging around so just got a couple of things To-Go.

I got the two things I remember being so common and so much better in France....  A chocolate croissant and a baguette.  The croissant didn't make it home and there are little flakes of it in my car.  (I never eat in my car!)  I mentioned the time of day because every time I had a croissant in France, it was in the morning.  It was a tiny bit less melt in your mouth than in France  but I'll bet that's only because it wasn't fresh out of the oven and still warm like the first batch of the day.  It was definitely best I've had in Vegas so far.  I haven't tried the bread yet but hopefully it's equally good.  (Note: I did confirm croissants are made with French butter... which is also better than typical American butter!)

The young woman was pleasant and helpful and as it turns out, actually from France...and of course tall, thin and beautiful.... life is so unfair!

The seating area is pretty small.  I didn't count the tables but maybe six??  They had quite a few savory items on the menu and a kitchen behind the counter which I didn't really look at since I was focused on the contents of the glass case.

I will be going back to try the French Burger because, yes, the best hamburger I ever had was also in France!",2017-09-11 22:17:10

Came here Thursday 28th evening for Glitch Mob...BOY was it epic. The bathroom is a cest pool of disgusting BUT when everyone is on something doubt it's noticeable. 

The crowd here is interesting. You have the skaters, the odd old Asian guy looking to re-live his Saturday night at Guv, the 37yr old girls with bad dye jobs aching to be noticed, the occasional goths with cool contact lenses, The abercrombie and Fitch daddy's car -kid that knows nothing about the band, The random cool peeps, the phenom dance moves kinda folk and last but not least the beloved drifters coming to check whats up.

The bouncer is a Pakistani guy who speaks broken English and looks like a tank. It gets packed quite quickly and they DO check ID. smoking section is just outside. Which is fantastic - you can walk out.. take a left keep walking and there's a tiny fountain with some seats around it. If you choose to, you can smoke a J, do some planking, do some double planking, do some triple planking, do some cartwheels, what eves. Get chilled and go back in. It's pretty sweet. 

There is a bar to the right side of the door that serves beer and standard alcoholic drinks. Don't bother ordering any mixes, it's so noticeably diluted with water. Shame shame. 

Overall, extremely fun place to come watch an electronic band. The group IS REALLY nice, they totally come down to talk to fans and are so open to take pictures. I would love to come back here for any event.

The decor is cute and as another reviewer said, you feel like you are in a hip Tremont restaurant.  The service was very good - not so quick that you feel rushed but not too slow.  My husband and I ordered the queso dip for an appetizer and it was amazing.  Very flavorful and just enough heat but not overly spicy.  I had to resist licking the bowl with a finger.   I had the chicken empanadas which were perfectly done.  I love the fact that you can choose your dish (emanadas, burrito, taco...) and then choose the filling.  My husband got the trio platter which was a burrito, taco and enchilada.  He said they were all excellent and very flavorful.   You could definitely tell that everything was freshly made.  No sauce from a can here.  Presentation of everything was very well done.  All our dishes were very attractive.  And the margarita.... YUM! I hate going to a place and getting a margarita that is made from a mix.  Once you have a ""real"" one, you never want the mix again. Real is exactly what you get here.  They are flavorful and expertly made.  I love the fact they have such a large variety of tequila here and that you can chose what tequila you want your margarita made with.  I will recommend Taqueria Junction to everyone and I will definitely be back!  As for price, I think they are reasonable.  You are getting fresh food freshly made.  Don't expect the super cheap prices of some mexican restaurants in the area because the quality of  food here is far superior to most of the local mexican restaurants in town.  The $8 and change I paid for my emanadas was well worth it.  I got three, huge emanadas for the money and I felt it was worth it.

So, what's my verdict on Café Santropol?

Well, I can definitely say that the place is basically how everyone else has described it - cute as a button. I took a seat on the outside patio close to the pond, and it, combined with the tree branches and fairy lights above me, made for a very cozy atmosphere. Based on the ambience alone, it would make for a perfect summer date to impress that special one in your life - it's that charming.

As for the food, however, I was slightly less impressed overall. I ordered the espresso milkshake and the Santropol sandwich with roast beef. The milkshake still had a decent espresso taste, but it was rather lukewarm and felt watered-down. The sandwich would have been perfect if they had used a better blue cheese-to-cream cheese ratio - the taste of the blue cheese was overpowering for my tastebuds. However, the rest of the sandwich's components tasted really good, and the pumpernickel bread in particular was super tasty. While I do agree with some of the reviews that they could use more filling (especially for the price), the quality of the bread alone is enough to excuse the fact, I guess.

Overall, come here if you love the idea of a cute and cozy date night (or ""me time"") with a perfect summer breeze to go along with it. While the food is a bit overpriced for what it's worth (and I would rather have awful ambience + amazing food than the opposite), I would, much to my chagrin, come back solely so I can experience those homey patio vibes once again.",2016-07-26 22:13:48

I walked in wanting to try their Lemon Soufflé and the Baked Alaska. We were warned right away that the wait will be approximately 40-45 minutes. Right at the 40-minute mark, our desserts arrived to the table.

The taste? When I was in Paris, I made it my mission to try all the restaurants famed for their soufflé. I am not afraid to say that Sweet Note Desserts can compare with those restaurants, as their soufflés are perfectly executed and the flavour is present throughout the entire experience.

I've tried better for cheaper. The balls are chewy, which is normal, but I didn't taste any taro or sweet potato, for me it was bland. The only thing that connects it with taro/sweet potato is the color of the balls. 

But what I liked it their unique way of serving their guests. They give you a buzzer and ask you to sit on the upper floor. The staff come up from the back when your food is ready and let you know through the buzzer that you can come get it (at the back, not at the counter on ground floor).

There are two younger gentlemen that are incredible at building your sandwich: they're patient, friendly and precise. Then there are two middle aged employees that usually work during the day that are very sloppy when making a sandwich. They're friendly enough but that doesn't make my sandwich taste good. I prefer to go when the two young guys are working but it doesn't always work that way.

We asked for more, and received yet another teeny-tiny veggie tray. We had to beg for bread multiple times, and the service was astronomically slow when the place wasn't even half full. My parents suggest perhaps it was an off night, but for me it was the clincher. The menu is old fashioned and the so are the prices.

Cooked Foods - some favorites:

Garlic Sirloin Beef Cubes - this is my fav order at AYCE. Juicy, flavorful, soft cubes , but second time was tough. 

Enoki Beef Roll - really the best I've had - not tough/chewy like others. 

Fish Soup, Steamed Egg

Raw:

Sashimi Selection - possibly the best selection for AYCE - in addition to the standard choices, they even have squid, sweet shrimp, mackerel (fav) and herring. 

They also have Tako wasabi!!! 

Beef Tataki

Rolls: I only tried mango roll and didn't like it

First night stayed on the 19th floor, beds were comfy, I opted for the couch, which wasn't way to bad. The bathroom mirror has a TV, and the room has a pretty nice LCD TV. The shampoo and lotions smells pretty good. There's a lot of stuff as in furniture in the room, so it feels a bit cramped. 
The second night, we gave the girls the nice room and stayed on the 6th floor. It's a complete contrast. The pro is it felt larger because the bathroom was smaller, and no fridge, no couch, just 2 beds, and not even a LCD TV. It's just one of those old school normal TVs. Beds were decent, not as good as the nicer room. I'm not sure about the price, 8 people, 2 nights, 2 rooms... $76 per person. Not too bad. The casino, isn't as nice as the Wynn which is good, cause lower minimum bets. Jimmy Buffet's margaritaville is a joke! $37 for 22oz of margarita, just go to Fat Tuesday.

Viewed this restaurant as a ""fast food"" place, since tipping is optional. Got the Full Pack Share Platter, upgraded to Caesar salad for a $1 extra. When ordering water, they will first try to ring up bottled water on the register but just ask for glass water (it's free). If dine-in, the servers will bring plates and silverware which is a nice touch. They will also bring the food on plates when it is ready. Classy touch for a fast food style place.

The servers will bring a variety of sauces and ketchup for the meal. The chicken is always moist (even the breast piece is done well) and cooked very well, with some grill marks. Just enough seasoning and sauce to flavour. Always ask for a little extra dressing on the Caesar salad, tastes better. The meal fed 4 and there was leftover bread and chicken for the next day.

Stopped in for a quick lunch. It was not busy at all but I still had to wait a few minutes before anyone addressed me in line. I was the only one... 

I ordered the special which was a chicken tostada and a drink.  The employee helping me seemed pretty disinterested in being there. She asked what beans I wanted and did I want chicken  then proceeded to dump a ton of beans and liquid on top of the corn crispy tortilla. When it was time to add the lettuce I said just a little lettuce. I got a ton!  She said is that okay and my reply was I guess if that's just a little. She also put a handful of cilantro - which is fine I like cilantro - but it was whole stalks of cilantro. It wasn't chopped and the stems were still intact. Weird. Guess I'm eating a salad today. Also she wouldn't look at me when talking so I couldn't hear anything she was saying. I had to keep asking her to repeat things since she was just looking away... At the cashier I had to wait another couple minutes again while the cashier wiped trays. Weird again- it's lunch time - could you please ring me up?! Got an iced tea for my beverage it tasted like it had been sitting for a while - it wasn't fresh. Tried the mint lemonade instead. That was actually really good. 

The chicken had a good flavor but of course my tostada shell was soaked and soggy. I had to pick out a lot of the cilantro stalks and through all the lettuce to get to the good stuff. 

I might say I'd give them another chance but this experience was so 'whatever' I don't think it'd be worth it.",2016-04-13 20:59:13

Now onto the rest of my review, I met a friend for lunch, I started by ordering the Hummus and a Spanakopita (see pics) 

The hummus was good, although I didn't get the the thick fresh pita I saw everyone else eating? I guess you have to ask for the good stuff,  Newbie mistake #1, the pita I got wasn't too bad though.

The Spanakopita wasn't all that it, tasted too ""green"" not enough flavor of feta, and by microwaving  it  the flaky crust became unflaky and jut soft and chewy, not good.

I ordered the Vegetarian Combo she ordered the Shawarma plate (see pics) My plate had babaganoush, falafel (hiding under the tomato salad) Tabbouleh and 2 stuffed grape leaves served with a side of yogurt / tatziki sauce. 
I thought everything was really good and tasted pretty fresh except the grape leaves, they were atrocious, the rice inside was unrecognizable, it was so overcooked it completely turned to a mushy paste, bummer, grape leaves are my favorite. ( I will make them for us Andrea, I Promise)

I wish I had more of their falafel I pretty much filled up on the tatziki, babaganoush and pita. Now I know what to get next time.

So our waiter come over and says ""Since this is your first time, I'll take care of the bill, just take your ticket to the counter""

WOW~ Are you serious, how generous!!

We wait in line, give our ticket to the guy and he keeps asking us to pay??? 
Well Apparently  there was a confusion of some sort, I don't know what the waiter meant by that, We though our lunch was going to be free.....it wasn't....but that's OK.

That's when I ordered my baklava, one piece.........I go to the car to eat it and went back in for 2 more pieces.....YUM!!

This act dates back to 1937 when Vernon Rudolph founded Krispy Kreme in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Las Vegas landscape is full of doughnut shops. So, once in a blue moon, I will step onto the Krispy Kreme stage to act out my enjoyment of sipping a cup of coffee with a glazed doughnut. 

  In recent times, Krispy Kreme is becoming a more difficult act to follow. Across the land, Krispy Kreme shops have been gradually erased. In Las Vegas there are a few Krispy Kreme's left standing. With far less locations, the Eastern near Silverado Ranch location services the market area of Southeast Las Vegas and Henderson. You would think it would be busy at 9:30 on a Wednesday morning along the hyper happening Eastern Avenue corridor. It wasn't. 

  The Krispy Kreme stage is an enjoyable space to act out the enjoyment of a coffee with a doughnut. The room is oversized with plate glass windows overlooking a mini doughnut factory. The mini doughnut factory is the production line manufacturing a glazed doughnut. This makes Krispy Kreme a unique act in the screenplays of the doughnut shop. However, Krispy Kreme has cut the miniature doughnut shop from other shops that include the Excalibur Hotel location that they subleases into a popcorn shop. Throughout the room the tables are plentiful and comfortable. The elbow room space in a Krispy Kreme is comparable to the calories in their doughnuts. 

  This past Wednesday, krispy Kreme was close by to my doctor appointment. I need a cup of coffee to start the day. I came into Krispy Kreme with a bias toward Dunkin Donuts and Pink Box. In my opinion they are a better product. I ordered a coffee with pumpkin spice syrup and pumpkin spice doughnut. One doughnut and coffee came to $4.88. Dunkin Donuts will give you two doughnuts from a better variety with superior coffee (my opinion). Dunkin Donuts coffee lives up to its name. Krispy Kreme coffee-nah I taste better. On my past and few visits to Krispy Kreme, they served Caribou coffee. I would be putting on an act if I said that the Krispy Kreme coffee was better than Caribou coffee. Krispy Kreme trails behind Dunkin Donuts  and Pink Box in their variety. I prefer the fruity donoughts. The chocolate glazes takes away from the taste of what is at best an ordinary cup of Joe. 

   Friendly characters star on the Krispy Kreme stage. Enthusiastic employees greeted the customers with a smile and were fast, friendly, and working hard. 

  Krispy Kreme is all right. In a competitive doughnut shop market area, you have to be over and above all right to make me a regular. I will occasionally catch Krispy Kreme's act in the future.",2014-11-15 20:16:39

There isn't a very large wine selection for someplace that calls itself a wine bar. That being said there were some great selections and the price is pretty middle of the road. 

They do offer some craft beer selections a few of which are unique and not your typical beer kind of choices, but it certainly is not a beer and shot kind of place if you couldn't tell by the name already.

The menu is limited like most wine bars, but they offer pizzas (which considering they are made in a beautiful pizza oven are only just mediocre) in addition to meat and cheese boards. The cheese selections are great from what I saw, they featured a lot of cheeses that I'm a big fan of. There is antipasti and some small plates, but those just seem a little random and disjointed and if I didn't see so many good reviews of said dishes I'd recommend they ditch them. They don't really go with pizza, and few of them would properly accompany a meat or cheese board. They mainly seem like things you might order if you were grabbing a glass of wine and some snacks for happy hour.

The ambiance is loud, like a typical bar/restaurant you'd see in an urban neighborhood like Ohio City or Tremont. There was pretty loud music. It's a cool place to go if you aren't looking for anything too intimate or for someplace to really talk because it's a bit more social than that. 

I probably wouldn't go back mostly because I would prefer someplace a little more intimate and with a large wine selection. That being said I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend looking for a lively place to enjoy a glass of wine and some small plates.",2015-04-20 03:17:09

This time, though, it was extremely cold outside, so we didn't have to make the decision about eating inside or out.  The outside patio is nice, but you don't get the full ambiance of the restaurant unless you eat indoors (which we did this time around).  The decor and interior are gorgeous.  When I think of a fairly upscale French restaurant, Georges is what I picture.  They're not so uptight, rigid, and formal, though, that you have dress to the nines.  ""Smart casual,"" opentable.com says.  

We were greeted by a very friendly and well-dressed young woman who immediately and professionally seated us.  Our server, Wade, came next, and he was fantastic.  He was also dressed very well, but was very down-to-earth.  He openly and knowledgeably talked about the menu, the food preparation, and the ingredients without sounding condescending.  

After the complimentary crunchy French bread was brought to our table, all three of us started with the French Onion soup.  It was different than any other French onion soup I've ever had before.  It was very sweet-tasting, and Wade explained that it was because they use sweet Vidalia onions.  

I had had the Beef Bourguignon last time and loved it, but I wanted to try something different this time.  I chose the Cassoulet (cass-o-lay) because I had remembered recently seen a recipe for one and thought it sounded good.   It came out in a cast iron oven skillet, sizzling hot.   This one came with duck and pork confit which, after seeing a few chunks of fat in the dish, I later looked up and learned (as I suspected) that ""confit"" meant that it was meat cooked in its own fat.  I'm not a big fan of eating chunks of fat, but luckily it was hidden (or I buried it) underneath the rest of the ingredients.  There was also sausage, white beans, spices, and a thick, tomatoe-y sauce in it.  I'd probably go back to the Beef Bourguignon or try another dish next time.   I can't slight Georges on the cassoulet, though, because that's what the dish consists of.  The flavor of the dish was fantastic, and it and was perfectly prepared, but because of the chunks of fat, I just couldn't order it again.

I also ordered a glass of wine with dinner -- the cheapest Merlot on the menu.  Don't let the pricing fool you, though.  It was deliciously mild for a Merlot wine.  I loved it.  

Georges has become one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I hope to return some day soon to try their Sunday brunch options!",2010-12-06 16:22:34

The atmosphere is much of what you would expect from a bar.  People jabbering away and TV's in the background with sports, all standard good stuff.  The decor is in the process of changing with the new owners, more cool stuff on the wall and the addition of the chalkboard paint listing all the tap brews (all 20) is really cool.  What makes Caliente welcoming is the staff, none of who I have ever had an issue with... From the handy man to the owners, they know how to treat patrons.

As for the food, it is pretty damn good.  The pizza is, in my opinion, the best in Bloomfield.  It is obvious that they use fresh ingredients, many of which I believe are local.  The wings are solid and the sandwiches are put on superb bread, which I think makes or breaks most sandwiches.

Drinking!  If you like craft beer then Caliente is your place to go in Bloomfield... The selection on tap is fantastic with Hercules Double IPA, Raging Bitch Belgium IPA and Dogfish Head Burton and Baton only to name a few...

But this is Pgh, you say, and that is correct. I'm just pointing out a fact. As with all gyms and work-outs, you choose the best for you. Sure, you may save a lot more $ by going to a low-cost monthly gym (I'm still a member and have been for 10+ years), but how many times will you really go? Are you getting an effective or as intense of a workout? Are you ok with the mediocre classes? What about trying to cancel the membership? In the end, you choose the gym that will get you closer to whatever goal you set for yourself, and for me, it's group fitness classes since it's more well rounded.

OTF caters to all fitness levels: there are some that are clearly fit, and some that look like they haven't been to a gym for many years. The workouts are what you make of it, and the atmosphere is not intimidating at all. The gym is new enough and the people are nice enough that I haven't felt that the atmosphere was ""clicky"" like the Soul Cycle groupies in NYC. The gym trainers are very nice and come to class with a good playlist. 

I've been at OTF since they opened- so about 25 or so classes. Even though I post on Yelp on the regular, I didn't want to write one on OTF since working out/gym is a very personal thing for me- I don't really know anyone at the gym, I don't really converse with anyone else, and I don't make small convo with the trainers. In these 25 classes or so, I've started to get to know the trainers just a smidge more, and that was really from the effort of the trainers, not me. The classes are personal enough that when they see you regularly, they notice you and what you're capable of. 

You can read about the workout on the website, and if you're reading this review, you probably have already. Out of the many gyms I've gone to for group fitness in Philly and NYC, this one offers the most classes, from 5AM to 9PM, depending on the day. They still have kinks to work out, but they'll figure it out. Yes, OTF is in East Liberty, on the ""edge of shady-ness,"" but as long as you don't wave Benjamins around on the street, you should be fine.",2015-08-21 01:51:43

This is a casual BBQ Restaurant from the Good Folks from Ocotillo (a really nice restaurant with a really nice menu). Like the sister restaurant Starlite BBQ also offers a BBQ Menu like no other. They offer many interesting appetizers like at this time like Grilled Squash with Mole, Fried Mac-N-Cheese, Grilled Cauliflower with Green Goddess and Crispy Black Eyed Peas and MORE! They also offer a variety of Sandwiches like Smoked Turkey, A Burger, Smoked Grilled Meatloaf, Fried Chicken (reg or hot) Brisket and Fried Green Tomato. Of course they also offer BBQ Plates, a Crispy Fish for Two and some of these plates are offered in two sizes. Sides as well come in two sizes. 

Atmosphere wise Starlite BBQ is a smaller restaurant. Seating is at the Three Community Tables on the Ocotillo lined patio that seats up to twelve each or at the bar or the High Tops off the side of the bar.

For me it was difficult to decide on my order because there were so many things I wanted to try. So we shared the Smaller Sized Brisket (I was told about 8 oz...it might have been bigger?), The 1/2 Hot Chicken and three full sized sides.

The Brisket WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! It was succulent with the perfect amount of fat. It had a thoughtful amount of smoke and was sauced just right. It was simply delicious and they gave us pickled onions that magically lightened up the Brisket and took it to another level. They also gave us this Whole Grain Mustard....I didn't use the mustard on the Brisket but I tasted it and now I'm sorry I didn't scrape it out of the container to bring home.

We also shared the HOT Fried Chicken (with tasty pickles). Yes it was hot(spicy)  with a nice hot CRUST. They gave a Big Breast and the Leg Quarter. It really was mighty delicious but due to an opening hiccup it wasn't served the proper temperature and was almost cold. Our server didn't check on us till we were finished with the (still delicious) chicken but we did inform her and spoke to management who thank us for informing them.

All three sides we tried were VERY GOOD. We tried the (either vegetarian or vegan) BBQ Beans that were nicely seasoned, a little spicy and also a bit sweet. The (vegetarian or vegan) Braised Greens with Tomatoes, The greens had some punch and the tomatoes were flavorful and sweet. The Macaroni and Cheese, like the middle of a American Grilled Cheese Sandwich, made with sturdy noodles and served with a crispy crust.

It's so great to go to a BBQ Place and enjoy things other than meat!

All the people working there were all friendly and welcoming to us.

Very Very Good!

*Canadian comfort food
*Located inside of the Bay

I tried bannock in October and that was already after all the woo'ing and ahh'ing has died down a bit after their grand opening. This post is way too old and I am sure there are so many posts on bannock already but I am still going to do a post on it just because I want to personally talk about how much I love this restaurant.

When I first walked in, we were told they didn't have liquor license for the day so all beverages would be on the house, YAY! Inside of the restaurant is not very big but they laid out the tables really well with nice touches of interior here and there.

Ordered: CLEARWATER LOBSTER ROLL + ROOT VEG CRUDITES 5/5
*Lobster roll served with root vegetable salad for $16.00
*This was absolutely delicious in every way possible
*It looks small but it's quite filling
*The bread is very soft (potato bread texture) which went well with the chunky lobster pieces
*There wasn't too much sauce for the lobster fillings which I appreciated because that over-rides the lobster pieces and will make your bread soggy
*Root vegetables sald was SO good! I loved the light and refreshing dressing it really complimented the lobster roll
*There were big chunky lobster pieces as well as bits of cucumber
*It had nice presentation plus sandwich was light and perfect for lunch
*I would absolutely get this again

Ordered: MAC & CHEESE 4/5
*Bowl of Mac & Cheese with Great Canadian Cheese and Crunchy flax granola toppings for $14.00
*Plate comes super hot and it's a big portion for lunch
*Because it was so hot, I burnt the top of my mouth when I took a bite...but so worth it! 
*It's drenched in rich creamy white cheese sauce and some more cheese melted on top
*There were lots of spinach in it which was really delicious with the pasta
*This dish would be good if you shared with someone since it is a very heavy dish
*Luxurious version of your everyday Mac & Cheese

Ordered: ROASTED DUCK POUTINE PIZZA 3/5
*Fries, Curds and Duck on Pizza for $15.00
*This was that one dish everyone talked about from bannock
*I love poutine, but wasn't sure if I liked it on my Pizza
*As I was trying to make up my mind, our waiter recommended it to me once I sat down so I decided to give it a try
*This is a huge pizza, probably enought for 2 girls
*It looks absolutely amazing and smells fabulous
*There weren't much duck on the pizza but it was covered in so much fries
*I liked the poutine part, but didn't really like it as pizza
*It just became a giant dough in my mouth as I was chewing it 
*I am glad I tried it but probably wouldn't get it again

Ordered: PICKEREL TACO + CUCUMBER APPLE SALAD 4/5
*Pickerel Taco on steamed bun with Caviar Tartar for $11.00
*This reminds me of the pork buns served at many asian restaurants
*It was very tasty but so small in portion (not enough even for a girl)
*Pickerel pieces were juicy and bursting with flavor
*Everything went really well together in the steamed bun
*Cucumber apple salad was light and refreshing
*Would be good as an appetizer

Ordered: ONTARIO VENISON CHUCK CHILI N/A
*Venison Chuck Chili with Great northern beans and bannock for $15.00
*My friend ordered this and I just had a bite of it
*I am not a big fan of chili (I've finally decided) so I didn't really like it
*But it was very hearty, rich and bursting with flavor

Ordered: ST-CANUT PULLED PORK TOURTIERE 3/5
*Pulled pork pie with honeyed roots and heinz ketchup for $16.00
*Pie crust was flaky and done just right
*Inside is filled with so much pulled pork pieces
*Honeyed Roots didn't need any sauce it was sweet and soft on it's own
*It was served with Heinz ketchup for a reason, everything tastes good with ketchup (personal preferance)

Summary: Bannock is always busy, and I guess people can depend on this restaurant to be at certain level (food & service wise) because it's owned by Oliver & Bonaccini. And they def did not disappoint! I've been back to bannock at least 3 times after my first visit and it just keeps on getting better. I always leave the restaurant satisfied with the delicious food they offer. Did I mention they have the friendliest staff ever? I officially love bannock. If you haven't been there, you are missing out.",2011-12-04 22:43:25

One day about a month ago we were planning for someone's birthday dinner and of course, we should go to Glass Nickel. After a pause, my uncle asked the group, ""you know, I don't see why we keep going there. Why don't we go somewhere else?"" After some brief confusion, everybody expressed their personal opinion that it is not very good, as though their previously great product created enough early momentum in the eyes of Madisonians to stay in our restaurant rotation.

The crust is best described as limp and flavorless (unless you count greasy as a flavor), the sauce has so much sugar you might get diabetes, and the amount of toppings you get vary widely with each pie. Tasty cheese though.

Glass Nickel occupies a place one notch above Dominos and Pizza Hut, but with all the fantastic pizzerias in town like Brutta, why would you go here? It's a poor man's Salvatore's.",2015-07-30 21:37:30

If you're going to charge premium prices ($9-$15) for traditional Vietnamese fare (pho, grilled steak with rice, egg rolls), at least spice it up with premium ingredients.

I was hijacked for $7 on egg rolls, for what arrived as two egg rolls sliced diagonally in an attempt to substitute presentation for value. Typically for $5-$6, you get 5-6 egg rolls. The ingredients \ end product I received was nothing special.

The pho was mediocre at best. The noodles were fresh, the beef (all 4 pieces of it) was pretty thick. The broth was lackluster. The bowl it was served in was definitely nice. For the $9 it cost, it was definitely lacking in both volume and quality.

If you are looking for an intimate, seemingly adventurous place to take a date, this place would be decent. If you're looking for authentic, delicious Vietnamese place, it should be a last resort.",2013-10-11 06:46:12

We were put in the queue for a sales associate, and were then called over by a woman with blonde curly hair who basically refused to help us at all.

Here's what happened:
Unbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. 

Me -So how do I change my name on my account?  

Sale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?

Me - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.
So how do I go about changing my name on my account?

Sales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.

Me - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?

Sales associate - Not at the store level

Me- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....

I then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.

The woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?

We had:
The tuna tacos -  The tuna was good. If only there wasn't so much salad filler.  Whole lettuce leaves and asparagus completely over powered this dish.  Also, these were much larger than tuna tacos I have had at other places.

The garlic bread - We sent it back. It was partially frozen.

The squash ravioli - My boyfriend loved this. it was too rich for me.

The fish entrée - my apologies. I can not remember what type of fish it was, but It wasn't salmon and it was $22. This was cooked to perfection but under seasoned. It had NO FLAVOUR. It was served on a pile of quinoa with WHOLE chick peas throughout, and veggies on the side. There was no reason for that many chickpeas in my quinoa. The flavours and textures made no sense. 

Milestones is good if you are looking for a reasonable place to eat with a nice atmosphere.

The place has a really fun vibe. Our waiter was very attentive and the food was really good. 
We shared the Lil Big Mack's, they have the Big Mac down to the tee. Nothing like the taste of a big mac, they came with a mini side of match stick fries.
My sister ordered for me, it was a carnita sandwich with a side of slaw.
This was the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had in Canada. The meat was moist, tender, and seasoned perfectly. The slaw was creamy and tangy.
My sister had a Ruben sandwich, with fries and a side of mini pickles in a small jar.
This too was very yummy, but still preferred the carnita. I think the Ruben could have been more tender.
My nephew had a Mac n Cheese, which I have to say was so fresh and I would go there and just order that and be satisfied.  Loved it.
We also had a Lychee Martini that was way to strong for me and my last encounter with a martini ended with me getting acquainted with porcelain.

They offer these warm delicious pretzel bread sticks and regular crunchy sticks to start off with. For dinner, I had the salmon and it was probably the best salmon I ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

I decided to try a dessert and went for the chocolate flower pot. It was HUGE!!! It actually looked like a flower pot and it was rich and chocolaty without being overly sweet. It was way too much for one person to eat.

The staff are definitely the most authentic bartenders in Las Vegas.  The patrons of thee Dive Bar are the most fascinating group of allegiant misfits you could ever wish to befriend.  That is how you will be treated here too, not as a customer but more like a valued friend after a while.  Loyalty is not forsaken.  As long as you are just looking for a good time and are a genuine individual you can find your place here among the regulars.  It will be a fulfilling drinking experience every time.

They have fostered some of the most legit bands of rockabilly and punk in this town for many years.  The likes of THE METEORS, AGENT ORANGE, DELTA BOMBERS, MURDER JUNKIES (G.G. ALLENS BAND!) NASHVILLE PUSSY, VOODOO GLOWSKULLS, 3 BAD JACKS, BOB WAYNE, HANK3, SUPER SUCKERS.  Those ones I remember at least.  Best part of the shows are that it's a very intimate stage and the sound system rattles yer bones.

This is a ""one of one"" kinda bar.  The best times of my life happened here.  The best friends I've had as an adult sprang from The Dive Bar too.  If you like the panache' of a fine hand crafted foo foo drink don't come here!  If you like all that ritzy shit go to the Downtown Cocktail Room.  You'll find no false advertising whatsoever.  No pretensions.  No inflation of ego neither.  Very much comparable to the Double Down for locals.  The null point I could say is that it has become much more popular in it's new location.  But, hey?!  That's the point of making a prodigious nerve center of drinking, music and comradery for it's customers.

I've been putting this review off intentionally as there is no exact way I could do justice in putting my love for this bar and it's staff in words.  The Dive Bar is not a bar at all, it is a juncture of good times, bad times, lows and highs.  Laughing and crying at the same time.  All this with a drink in your hand and a good band.  Many have found love here.  Some have found themselves here after they have love lost.  Unfaltering, it is a symbol of ragtag punkrock realism wrapped up in a rough packaging that has a heart filled cream filling.  

The Dive Bar will always be 5 Stars in my book.",2014-07-16 17:54:26

The buffet had a great variety of typical Indian favorites, and a few not as well known dishes. The rice was well cooked, fragrant, and hot.

On the other hand, they are so much better it's not even a contest.  For what it is, this place is probably the best I've had.  This is NOT the Cordon Bleu, and I'm writing this opinion with that in mind!

Their burgers are prepared fresh (no heat lamps!), and they taste fresh.  Even if you get a McD burger hot off the griddle it tastes like something that wouldn't spoil if you let it sit out for a year.  Fatburger's burgers are hot, tasty, and seem very fresh.  Made with real ground beef (it even crumbles a bit as ground beef is prone to doing...don't ever remember McD's doing that).

The curly fries are really nice.  A light crunch, very tasty.  Also fresh and hot.  And the shakes are pretty good too.  Not the best shakes, but pretty good.

The ambiance is supposed to be sort of 50's diner.  Complete with a juke box (that looks like it's from the 70s...ooops).  As they were established in 1952, according to their signs, I guess they are trying to stay in touch with that...at least a little.

If I have a craving for a burger and fries, this would be my first or second choice of places to go.  A tad pricey, perhaps, but you can order various size burgers from 5 oz up to 24oz.  Did I mention they're really tasty?",2011-11-05 04:44:51

For years now I had been wondering if an excellent Greek restaurant even existed here. Like Bigfoot, it seemed ever elusive, almost as if it didn't want me to find it! Well I found you, you rascal, and I'm not letting you get away. I even took pictures... wait. I didn't take pictures. I forgot. But I swear it exists! I swear it!

What is the deal with most Greek joints, anyway? You go in and you get food made with rice and pork and grape leaves and you get the bill and you're like ""wtf mate?"" Then your wife reminds you that you're not Australian and you get all sheepish... but I digress. Unlike pricier joints around town which will go unnamed, prices here were right in line with what I would expect to pay. A nice touch. Service was a bit slow on the uptake, but once we got our order taken, everything came very quickly. The true star of the show here though, is the food. So delicious!

Until I ate at Greektown, I thought I did not like pita bread all that much. If this is how pita was made everywhere, it would have been one of my favorites since childhood, this stuff is awesome. We ordered dolmades to start, grape leaves stuffed with rice and pork smothered in a light lemon sauce... fabulous. Eye-rollingly so. Seriously. I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken, the yardstick I apply to all my Greek experiences. The salad was competent, but the dressing was very bland. Surprising, considering how tasty everything else was.  Squeezed a bit of lemon over it though, and it came to life - it was AWESOME. The chicken was seasoned and grilled perfectly. Tender and tasty, a true pleasure. It came with a side of tatziki, by the way, very delicious. I was a happy camper. The wife ordered what she described as ""the best gyro I have ever had in my entire life."" I know that's a tad ambiguous. I try to nail her down on these things, but she INSISTS on being vague. Sorry!

Lastly, everybody is saying it and there's a reason: the guy who runs this place is definitely the ringmaster here, he's very fun and also an excellent server.

This is actually healthy for your nails because  nail beds can actually breathe unlike silk wraps, acrylic, or even the regular gel and shellac style products. 

So when you find a manicurist who specializes in calgel or any of the other nail gels processes made in Japan AND is artistic in top of that, you cling on like white on rice to that manicurist. Like seriously cling. 

Yuna is just that person! The ONLY salon to offer calgel and presto LED manicures in all of Vegas. She came from Hawaii a couple of years ago and set up shop 15 min from the strip. Very artistic and has a broad knowledge base when it comes to what kind of gel and shape would work well for your nails because not 2 nail beds are alike! 

ALSO the lady below who gave her 1 STAR review... Two sides to every story folks...she came in with no appt demanding service when the salon already had 3 scheduled clients waiting. I was there that day watching this all unfold. So don't believe everything you read here folks!

I've never been to Albertsons or this Albertsons before and since I'm a tourist to Las Vegas as well as the US, I can't really comment on their prices since from my perspective, I found the prices to be on the slightly expensive side (but I would say the same thing about the other grocery stores that I visited in Las Vegas including Walmart and Smith's). I was going to be eating out during most of my stay in Las Vegas so only needed to purchase some snacks and some juice/drinks.

Picked up some fruit slices which I thought were at a decent price (3 for the price of 2 so I picked up 2 containers containing cantaloupe slices and 1 container containing pineapple slices). I also picked up some sports drinks for after my workout at the hotel's fitness center, some juice, and some chips.

I lined up to pay at the cash. When scanning the sliced fruit containers, I noticed that I was charged full price for each individual container instead of getting the 3rd container for free. I made a comment about this and the cashier informed me that it would automatically be deducted at the end.

She bagged my items and I paid. With all the juice/drinks that I purchased, she only single bagged them (as well as put too many of my heavy juice/drinks in the same bag) which caused me problems as I was gathering the items from the entrance of Tahiti Village where the shuttlebus dropped some of us off and a few of the bags ripped  :-(",2018-02-25 15:47:12

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about.",2011-04-27 22:02:24

The name of this Korean Restaurant making me a little worry... 

I am not sure what is Congbul? And I know most place would not have serve me Shabu Shabu if I dine alone..since most of the places I went you need to order at least 2 portions...

Congbul is a mixture of vegetables especially bean sprouts, pork or squid, served on a flat iron plate.. mixed with noodles and rice? Sadly you need to order at least 2 portions.. so I just watch others eating that or a Shabu Shabu, while I slurping on 

Korean Seafood Noodle ($6.99)
- Extra Spicy Please... the waiter asked me twice if I am sure... Yes Please
- The menu said it is ""Home Made"" Noodle... but did they make it here? or they get in from somewhere... the noodle is surprising cooked al dente with a great bite!
- The broth was spiced with Thai Chili... and this really reminds me of Tom Yum Soup with a little sourness
- Squid, Shrimp, Bay Scallops and mussels, the squids tasted the best!

The banchan is a little disappointing! They don't even give me any Kimchi??! No Kimchi in a Korean Restaurant?!!!

Lunch Specials for their Shabu and Congbul. Most of the other items starts from $6.99... pricing are quite reasonable.

I've come here for dim sum before and now dinner as well and I have 2 very different opinions about that. I'll start with dinner: 

DINNER FOOD: THE BOMB! I don't remember what anything is called but the Alaskan king crab leg with egg was amazing (*drools*). I also liked the scallop and shrimp ""appetizer"". Everything overall was so so so delicious, 100% I would come back for dinner. 

DIM SUM FOOD: average, not worth the price. Since this place is a ""high end"" dim sum restaurant in the day, they didn't just serve your regular dim sum dishes- they served it with a weird side. Lots of dishes I had came with something a little extra (ex: one dish of meat came with cold, soggy McDonald's fries placed in a small pile)?? 

PRICE: be prepared to drop some bills

ATMOSPHERE: the decor is beautiful and the restaurant looks so modern. Definitely not your typical Chinese dim sum restaurant.

I ordered the Stuck market waffle and he ordered the Et tou, Brûlée? Milkshake.
The milkshake came first and it basically tasted like melted vanilla ice cream. Nothing too special. The waffle on the other hand was decent. It was served with peanut butter ice cream (which was a bit hard to taste out), and caramel sauce all over. Reeses chunks were sprinkled all over the waffle as well. The one thing that was a little disappointing was the waffle. The taste was quite good, but it was also quite dry. There was a lot of ice cream though, so if you eat it together, its fine. But separately, is a different story. In terms of the portion size, I was skeptical about ordering one waffle because I didn't want to share. But, I definitely could not have finished it on my own. 

The one negative thing about the place was that the tables are a bit small for plates. If my partner also ordered a dessert, our plates may have been clashed. Our chairs were also a little wobbly, so don't expect this place to be extremely comfortable.",2015-02-18 00:08:39

She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time.

They do have a lunch special and I opted on getting the galbi with steamed white rice. The lunch special also came with the traditional side dishes. (Kimchi, cucumber)  We also ordered an extra steamed egg, some cold noodle soup, and a steamed egg. 

The steamed egg was DEEELICIOUS. The hot pot was filled to the brim and the egg tasted so good and it was so fluffy. 

The cold noodle soup wasn't cold enough and it was way to sweet. The sauce they put in it was too strong. The portion was big though, and it can easily be shared within two people.

Boyfriend was craving Korean food and so what do I do? I yelp. I find this restaurant and surprisingly, it has been bookmarked for awhile, I never knew. The name of the restaurant sounds a lot like a Hawaiian restaurant and yes they do have Hawaiian food like Loco Moco, Musubi and whatnot but they also have another name something MyunOk which just means they sell Korean style cold noodles.

Walked in and no one paid attention to us. They were all super busy so when I finally got their attention, I sat down and waited for the menu. After a long time, another lady greets us and we asked for the menu. Their menu is pretty interesting because they sell a little bit of EVERYTHING from Hawaiian, Korean, Korean-Chinese food.

I decided to get their cold noodle combo which comes with half order of Cold noodle with broth and half order of spicy flavored cold noodle with no broth. My boyfriend ordered their oyster Jjambbong.

I got my noodles first and they were just OK. I didnt necessarily think that they were bad but they were definitely not great. Their cold noodle was kind of dull and had no flavor but I likes their noodles. Their spicy nengmyun was way too spicy for my taste but it was better than the Mool Nengmyun.  

My boyfriend and I ate together and even after we were done with our noodles, we still didnt get out Jjambbong. After a long period of waiting, he got his Oyster Jjambbong and it was huge! I tasted the soup it was OK. I dont really enjoy eating soup or broth and yeah maybe thats why it wasnt good but my boyfriend liked it so good for him. It did have  a generous amount of oysters in the dish and also lots of veggies!

Overall, their food was just average I guess. I dont think its worth 4.5 rating but maybe 2.5 to me. Many people seem to order Korean-Chinese food including the dishes. I dont know if I ordered the wrong type of dishes here but it was just OK.

Wish Yelp would let us give 0.5 star ratings, because I thought it was a 3.5 this time. I'm still holding desperately onto keeping Chinato as my happy spot in Cleveland, because it has potential. 

To recap tonight's visit... we arrived late since we couldn't find parking. There's always some special event going on downtown. We managed to find street parking maybe two blocks away. Yay! 

Had plenty of people pay attention to us during dinner. Water never left unfilled, bread kept coming. The only thing I have to complain about service, which I would have never noticed in the past, but due to watching too much Robert Irvine on Restaurant Impossible... noticed that one of the servers were not very delicate in putting down serving utensils, appetizer plates, filling water... nonetheless, not too big of a concern. Food came fairly quickly; I think we got the drink within 2 minutes of ordering, and appetizer came just as we were finishing off our first two pieces of bread. Note, if you don't like the salt that they put on the table for the bread, the butter that you can ask for is pretty tasty too. 

Drinks: BF ordered the Peroni beer. Big glass of beer for $5. He said it was good.. forgot what he said about the rest. 

Appetizers: we ordered the gnocchi (still just as good, bites of heaven; I forgot how the parmasan shavings added a nice bite and contrast to the creamy dough). Also ordered mussels.. huge plate of mussels. BF was unfortunately not a fan of the mussels (but he doesn't like fish... and said the mussels were more fishy than he remembered eating at other restaurants). Thus, had to finish the whole plate of mussels by myself, and left the rest of the gnocchi to BF. SAD. Need to go again sometimes just for the gnocchi. The mussels were good, but after 5 mussels.. you kind of want to just stop eating them. I think they were steamed rare or something; just thought they could have been cooked more.

Entrees: We both ordered the chicken saltimbocca since we had such a phenomenal experience last time. Sadly... it was not as good as when we went in October. I went and looked at some other Yelp reviews, and it seems that after our visit in October, people have been complaining about the polenta being too runny, and not just the polenta in the chicken dish, but also some beef polenta too. Sad. I remember last time, the chicken had a really crispy skin, and the kale was also yummy and crispy. This time, the polenta made it mushy. Also, a little salty, but I'm not sure if that's just because I am a light salt eater. 

What made me bump my 3.5 to a 4 were the following factors:
1) They had live entertainment today! There was a band of 3 men playing Italian music on accordian, violin, and some other instrument. So lovely sounding. Made me feel right like I was in Italy. 
2) The manager stopped by. I asked him if he was Zach Bruell... embarrassing, lol. He wasn't. Curious about the change in the chicken dish, I inquired, and he went back to the kitchen to find out why the chicken dish was so much more watery than last time. Turns out that they adjusted the water ratio or something, and they're trying to fix that issue now. Compensated us with a lemon polenta cake. I was looking forward to picking out a new dessert since we had that at the last visit, and since it was BF's birthday, would have wanted him to pick out a dessert that he would have liked. Fortunately, he said it tasted pretty good, and that it was better than last time, since the polenta wasn't gritty and dry. Seems like the extra water they put in the polenta worked out for the dessert! 

Will return again. I still have hope for Chinato! 

On a side note.. found out that Zach Bruell has a new restaurant??? Cowell and Hubbard, apparently close by Chinato's. Looking forward to trying that sometimes.",2012-05-05 07:10:13

The hotel does offer a free shuttle service to the strip which is a plus. However, you have to wait in a line in order to take the shuttle which sucks. 

The hotel is right in front of a mall which is a plus. The hotel shopping includes very little. The hotel offers ivanka trump's items (of course). I have one of her clutches and its a high priced item with poor quality materials and generic handsmanship.

The room we got was spacious and had lots of window. It has a pretty yet typical Vegas view. The room was fresh. 

I would have wanted a hotel closer to the strip but we wanted to be closer to the convention center. This hotel was a shorter cab ride to the convention center. It was a compromise we were willing to make. 

As far as the look of the hotel, it's definitely more traditional rather than the grand casino hotels surrounding the trump.

This was a to-go order and we weren't going to the same home! So another 10 minutes goes by and we just ask for a refund.

After a brief, dewy-eyed walk through - touching all the walls and grinning from ear to ear, we decided to explore the neighbourhood.  We are steps from St. Clair and so we walked along the strip in search of our first meal as home owners.

Prop seemed to fit the bill.  It was nice but not excessively expensive and had an interesting menu that included truffle risotto (yum!) and spaghetti with ginger, black mission figs and peppercorn (ooh!). 

The waitress sat us quickly and took our drink order.  Unfortunately, the wine we wanted wasn't available by the glass (we were saving ourselves for the bottle of champagne that waited in our fridge back home).  In fact, no wine was available by the glass other than their house wine - quite a disappointment. 

Appetizers were quite good and just the right size.  Orange and fresh fennel salad had a lovely salt/sweet balance with some italian black olives.  The mushroom polenta was homey and flavourful.  

Mains were more disappointing.  I had salmon with vegetables and, while the waitress promised a pink middle, my fish was overcooked, as were the veggies.  My husband ordered a simple penne and tomato sauce, but asked the waitress if the kitchen could make it spicy.  His pasta was good (yummy, but not mind-blowing) but when we got the bill, they had charged him $3 extra for giving him the spicy sauce.  This took his simple penne and sauce up to $17.  Bad karma (and bad business), we thought.  

Our meals were okay, but I'm not sure we'll be back.  There are just so many great places to explore on the St. Clair strip...

In a bit she placed a cup of gelato on the counter.  I was surprised because we'd talked about the flower shaped cone.  I took the cup and didn't complain.  I then sat at one of their high top seats and ate the gelato.  While the coconut was the best of the three flavors, the gelato itself is not creamy at all.  After having gelato in several stores in Venice and Milan this fall, I have experience with creamy, tasty gelato and Amorino just doesn't cut it.  Some of the texture was more like sherbet with ice crystals.

We were looking for a quick snack and a beer or two just to unwind before the commute home.  For such modest requests, we expected the famed Greenhouse Tavern to easily wow us.  Alas, we were vastly underwhelmed.

Remembering Lola's bone marrow appetizer fondly, we went for the Warm Bread and Butter Board as an appetizer to share (more than ample for 2 people) and a brew each: the house pilsner for me, Dogfish IPA for the mister.  The house pilsner was flat and very soapy; the Dogfish IPA was also on the flat side. The Bread and Butter Board was fairly good--not exceptional but decent for $15.  Different textured fresh breads and crackers with meat-flavored, buttery, fatty spreads, one of them literally whipped in lard.  But then again, if you can screw something like that up, you probably shouldn't be on 4th Street.

The service was uneven and the space, oddly crowded in certain corners.  The space was obviously a renovated boutique.  We sat in one of the nooks on the ground level, walled by shop glass, feeling claustrophobic and more than a little like mannequins on display.  Our server wasn't too knowledgeable about the menu but allowed us to sample different beers before placing our orders--props to her.  She also allowed us to order the beers and appetizer at the half-off Happy Hour bar-seating-only prices, despite the fact we were sitting away from the bar in the semi-privacy of the nook.  We were mostly neglected however once our orders arrived.  There must have been at least five servers clustered by the bar, chatting and flipping through their smartphones while we were there.  Follow-up was nearly impossible.

The ambiance was casual and the upper/loft seating looked intimate and elegant--we might try to snag a table up there next time.  Weren't too impressed with the ""green"" theme; other than the strained, rustic decor--heaps of wood furniture manufactured to look like rough-hewn tree stumps, branches, etc.--nothing else struck us as particularly eco-friendly.  Especially not the offering of foie gras and other imported, gourmet delicacies on the menu.

Still, the experience wasn't terrible.  Happy hour on a weekday perhaps isn't the Greenhouse's forte.  We'll probably be back to give it another run, with more extensive dining plans in mind.",2011-07-06 03:10:28

The good: dark and chic atmosphere. Friendly and caring waitresses and bartender/manager with one waitress ended up sitting to break bread and drink with her (by then former) customers! Motsunabe and oden are traditional Japanese fare and on the menu. They are well done too. Second floor has a dart game so they have tried something a little different.
The bad: too many fake or Western food items like pizza, French Fries and whathaveyou with a Japanese twist to give it that oh-it-is-Japanese feeling. They also have the Toronto-standard Korean items because naturally we found out the owner is Korean (but has a Japanese girlfriend). Also, do not sit in front of the door, which means half the first floor is uncomfortable to sit in, but again the waitresses and bartender are very attentive, caring and polite and try to accommodate or get the door closed as soon as possible (before you get pneumonia).

I came right as they were closing and the owner Olivier hooked it up with a deal on some of the baked goods. 

There was something heavenly about the croissant. Even if it had been sitting all day since it was baked and was past it's freshness prime and a bit cold it maintained a crunchy flaky exterior while having a tender bite and slightly chewy texture on the inside. If this is what the croissant becomes after a few hours it must be ten times as better fresh.

The soup, Mexican vegetable, was just absolutely divine. The soup it self could stand up on it's own but when you bite into the large cuts of assorted vegetables the melodies of the ingredients along with the broth just melds together in your mouth. The bits of lime in the soup add an excellent touch as they're able to retain their individual characteristic.

The pannini press was cold and it would have taken too much time to fire it up again so i asked for a cold chipotle chicken sandwich. Two more snags, they ran out of sun dried tomatoes and there was no more baguette bread which they normally use to make the sandwiches. I informed them it was fine and if there was anything they could do. Tomatoes were taken out and the sandwich was constructed on this roll. I took the foil wrapped sucker home and baked it in my toaster oven for about 10 minutes. WHOA!! What ever that roll was i want more of it. The crust was just absolutely divine. Crunchy and chewy and satisfying. Actual slices of chicken breast were used instead of deli sliced and the sauces were tasty. Could have used a bit more of a spicy kick but they this is a modified version.

I came here during their closing process and as a result got the day's leftovers. The left overs pretty much made my day. The bread is absolutely divine and the soup needs the skills of a poet to properly give it credit. 

If you are to come here and try this place out i would come at opening time (0700) when everything is fresh.",2011-01-16 00:40:44

We came here this past Sunday, and the place was really busy-- I'll give them that. We were seated immediately, by someone who I presumed was a manager, and they told us our server would be right with us. Ten minutes later, the same manager came over and said that our server was too busy inputting orders for another table so he would take our drink order. As per their menu, I asked if they had Minute Maid Light Lemonade, and the manager-esque person flat out said no. I would have appreciated an ""I'm sorry, we're out"" or something, but I just got a ""no."" I'm not sure if this had to do with incompetence or just laziness, but that was my first strike. I ended up ordering soda water and my boyfriend got Dr. Pepper. When I ordered soda water with lime, the same guy said ""wow, that's weird..."" Ok....? I didn't care what he thought of my drink selection, but I was more appalled at the way he was presenting himself. After he brought us our drinks, he asked is we were hot. The restaurant was significantly chilly, so we said no. He proceeded to say ""well I'm hot,"" and then walked to the wall and adjusted the thermostat. I was thinking to myself, no shit you're not, you're running around a busy restaurant... but whatever. 

Our server finally came to the table. No greeting, no introduction, she just asked what we wanted to order. We started with an order of mozzarella sticks, and said we weren't ready to order our entree. She came back two times while we were looking at out menus and asked if we knew what we wanted yet. Needless to say we felt rushed. Once we had decided, I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup with a side of broccoli, and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and fries. 

45 minutes after ordering the mozzarella sticks, they decided to come out. They were good. Not the greatest I've ever had, but very consistent with Red Robin quality. No complaints there other than the time it took to move the food out of the window. While eating the sticks, we ran out of drinks and they were not replenished until after our food was delivered. Additionally, I asked the server 2 times for an extra side of limes and she never brought them to the table until the third time when my boyfriend asked and she finally delivered them after our entrees were brought out. 

Probably about 30-35 minutes after the mozzarella sticks came out, our food was delivered. I really don't think it takes that long to pour a ladle of soup into a bowl and steam some broccoli, but apparently Red Robin thinks so. Anyhow, my soup was lukewarm. The cheese ontop of the bread in the soup made up about half of the soup's volume, and because the soup was no longer hot it was the consistency of bubble gum. I picked it out. My broccoli was delivered separately, about five minutes after, and without a fork. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get a fork from the server, and by that time the broccoli was cold too. The fish and chips came out fine, with the exception of the server dropping one of the strips off the plate and having to bring another one a few minutes later. 

Overall, this 2 and a half hour dining experience could have been much more enjoyable, espcially considering that many tables around us that were seated after us with larger parties were attended to better and quicker than we were. Will not return.",2014-12-03 00:43:49

If you look to your right upon entering the restaurant, you'll see boards filled with pictures of eminent celebrities, athletes, randoms posing with I guess, Da Emma. Knowing that Angelina Jolie, Diane Kruger, Joshua Jackson, George Clooney (to name a few) had also dined at Da Emma made the experience more memorable.

We were seated right away and brought a plate of bruschetta and the menu. The bruschetta was more like a salty olive oil-ed sponge, not impressed. Our server literally plopped the all-Italian menu in front of us and peaced out with no explanation, no translation (even thought my boyfriend is Italia, he struggled with some of the items). 

We ended up ordering the leg of lamb ($35) and veal ($30?). You have a choice of sides: veggies (pickled potatoes, 2 slices of eggplant, 2 slices of zucchini) or rotini with tomato sauce. The main dishes were enormous. If you are on the fence when it comes to lamb, I suggest you steer away from it at Da Emma. It's way too big- I couldn't manage half of it. The veal was amazing though!

I joined 24 Hour back in October when I was living in Colorado.  The clubs in Denver are pristine, and I had high expectations for the clubs in Scottsdale (after all, it is Scottsdale, right?).  This gym used to be owned by a completely different company (the signs on the locker room doors say ""Attention Club X Members...."") and 24 Hour has done little to improve the quality and selection of the equipment.  

I feel like it's a gym out of the 80s, complete with neon signs guiding one into the locker rooms.  All of the equipment is crammed upstairs, and the machines are frequently broken, squeaky and uncalibrated.  They even lock up the bosu balls in a closet, in fear that someone will break their neck using one, which is understandable, but I hate asking permission to carry on my routine!  The only open space is in one of the studios, which is perpetually humid (and often 10 degrees warmer than the main part of the gym).

It's usually packed around 5 pm and I often find myself waiting for a machine.  When it's raining outside the rain drips through spots in the ceiling, splashing onto the dirty carpet and on the equipment (water + electricity = potential death) . This particular location gives me the impression that the cleaning crew doesn't come by often, so I always disinfect the equipment before I use it.

But, this is my gym and I do like the staff and the trainers; I like coming here.  They aren't pretentious like many of the individuals in Scottsdale; it's refreshing to go to a no-frills club.  No drama, no pressure to join any classes or have personal training.  No ex-coworkers.   I can do my thing without having the annoyance of trophy wives sizing me up.  I know I can't blame the quality and lack of equipment on the staff, and they've told me themselves they wish they could get new items in faster, but it's a matter of budget (and they have no control over that).  I'm praying 24 Hour's headquarters will read this and make the much needed improvements to this location.",2011-02-20 19:07:47

I surprise myself that no matter how many cook books, food magazines, cooking shows, or food demonstrations I manage to cover, I find things I never knew existed let alone know what to do with them. The aisles of specialty stores fascinate me most. 

On my visits to La Plaza I see things that I have rarely seen elsewhere in such variety or quality. Bundles of dried herbs, Mexican green onions, lean spiced meats ready to cook, prepared foods and salsas, frozen arepas, bakery and breads, etc. etc. etc. 

I have been to larger Mexican stores in southern California but their meats were as much fat and gristle as meat. Not here. You do not need to buy extra to make up for the waste. This is a clean and well stocked grocery store. I am not sure what a previous reviewer meant by a Mexican themed store. There is no Disneyesque theme here.

Sources tell me that Monk Kitchen is no more and the Templar Hotel is now void of its own restaurant.  I had taken my sister there last year for her birthday, and we loved Roberto so much that when we found out he is now cooking out of Flor de Sal, where the former Corner House was once located, we decided to go there for my birthday this year.

Cristina da Costa, former CHIN radio host turned restauranteur is the perfect hostess.  She greeted us at the door, checked up on us without being obtrusive and when she found out we were celebrating a birthday offered us a dessert/aperitif on the house.  She definitely knows how to make you feel special.

I'm glad that the dated décor left with the Corner House as the space is minimalist but modern and the patio is extremely inviting.  Naturally, we both decide that's where we want to spend the night.

Dinner starts off with Portuguese corn bread which fails to excite me.  It was all too dense and rather bland.  The only saving grace are the duo of olives from Cheese Boutique.

Wines are pretty pricey though I do like that they have the option of a half-bottle which allows room for both a white and red wine, especially for a smaller party of 2.  My sister found a new favorite in the form of a Santa Rita Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile.  We quickly search the LCBO to find a full 750mL bottle for $13.95 while our half-bottle rang in at around $30.  That's just to give you an idea on the mark-up.

An amuse of Ricotta and Beamster-stuffed shisito arrives at our table on a bed of pine nuts and cherry tomatoes.  We quickly devour it.  The cherry tomatoes are sweet, plump and delicious and the shisito pepper is extremely satisfying.

We start with a bowl of Bulhao Pato, clams cooked in vinho verde with garlic and cilantro.  The serving is quite scant for the $18 price tag and I wonder if Fracchioni is taking Flor de Sal (which is the Portuguese-equivalent of fleur de sel) too seriously.  I'd normally sop up every drop of the cooking liquids with my bread, but...

A palate cleanser dubbed the Sicilian Lemon Bomb arrives at our table infused with Limoncello and sprinkled with pomegranate.

With mains starting at $39, one's expectation is high.  I opt for the Branzino, which comes grilled whole with lemon and rosemary tucked into various pockets of the fish but the kitchen is happy to fillet it for you if you don't want to do the work yourself.  The accompaniment of sorrel, farro and radish is bland and flavorless and is more there for plating than it is for consumption.  I certainly didn't waste any calories on it.


My sister's rack of lamb ($47) however, is fantastic.  Grill marks are not there just for show as you can taste the charred goodness through the mustard and oregano.  The fried artichokes get quickly consumed as my sister and I exchange glances before our forks race to finish the last piece.

It is worthy of noting that when we were originally deciding where to go for dinner that the final 2 considerations were Scaramouche and Flor de Sal.  We eventually opted for Flor de Sal because of our previous experience with Fracchioni at Monk Kitchen and the fact that it was named in Toronto Life's list of ""Top 20 Best Restaurants"" this year.  Suffice it to say that we were extremely disappointed in our decision to go with Flor de Sal (and will think twice before taking a recommendation from Toronto Life again)...we didn't even bother with dessert.  All we could think of was the coconut cream pie we could've had at Scaramouche.

Flor de Sal definitely looks the part, with its elegant interiors, the amuse and palate cleanser and its area code, but for the price tag, better food can be found elsewhere.",2015-07-20 18:17:22

When he showed up he was very polite and professional. Took a look at my furnace and found the problem. He could only temp fix it since he had to order the part. I got a call from AMA on Monday and they had the part and wanted to come out Tuesday. But I couldn't be there so they came out on Wednesday. Randy once again was very polite and professional.

It all started with a desire to find the Mister a good American breakfast joint.  Having grown up in Vietnam, I do really prefer a French first meal (Vietnam was colonized by France and thus most of us are self-admitted Francophiles) and have subjected my loved ones to French breakfasts and brunches galore!  My fiance, however, had a good ol' American upbringing in the Midwest and ate morning carbohydrates like pancakes.

Enter Egg Works: adorable down-to-earth breakfast restaurant, all themed around ...Eggs!  Even the decor is completed with classic paintings with egg-ish slants, all the faces are replaced by eggs (including the Mona Lisa).  

There is a plethora of egg dishes for you to order, my favorite is the egg-crepe, a tasty blend of crepe batter and egg (perfect compromise of French American traditions).  But the various egg benedicts (called Bennys at Egg Works) are also done well, including one that comes with prime rib on top of a buttered croissant - truly a diet sabotage worth your time. 

But like most food love affairs: you come across that one delight so casually and unintentionally, this was how it began for me and the banana nut muffin.  I was not really even a muffin enthusiast, until then.  Adjectives like moist, soft, warm, perfectly sweet cannot deliver the experience of this muffin.

I, however, still wanted to try it out because it's near home and I love hot dogs.  I figured I'd wait a while for the bugs and bad employees to be worked out, as all new restaurants need, before I made my visit.  A Groupon became available so I used that opportunity to try out their food at half price and would be easier to look past any bad customer service that I may encounter.  
The woman working there was very friendly and helpful, so good for them they seemed to have fixed the customer service issues.
I got a hot dog and selected my own toppings rather than choosing one of their topping styles on the menu.  I also ordered onion rings and a fountain drink.  My Groupon was for $10 and I used all but a few cents of it.  I didn't think twice about it since I've been known to drop 8 bucks on a dog at the ballpark, until I got home to eat and realized the dog was smaller than the ones offered by Circle K.  Yikes! 9 dollars for a Little Slugger with cheese and bacon on it??  The onion rings were very delicious.  Worth $5?  Negative.  
The food was good, but overpriced for the amount received.  If the dog was Dback dog sized and I received the same amount of rings as one would at a restaurant as an appetizer, then I think the $10 would be a fair price for the food.  It's been 2 months since my visit and I have yet to return although I have been in that shopping center countless times.  Hopefully the other items are larger than the hot dog.

I kid you not, my wife teared up on the first bite out of sheer joy at the authentic taste. Richard is the owner and operator, and like a lot of New Yorkers is friendly once you break the ice.

We haven't tried any entrées other than the carbonara (with homemade pasta), but have been back several times just for it. On one occasion we had a nice mozzarella spinach antipasto.

I kind of felt like we got what they wanted to get rid of and not what was best.

The dish that came with steak was extremely tough. 

The ravioli were the highlight for sure. They were exceptional. Bread is no longer rolled out between each course and continually updated on variety. Instead you get a bread bowl with a variety for everyone to grab from and a one time visit to view cart while they describe what is there.

Came to The M last night to get some drinks and hang out. Went to the Lobby Bar (will have to review that seperately) for a few drinks and afterwards me and the girlfriend were pretty hungry. We just wanted something quick and easy. Saw the word ""Deli"" and thought thats exactly the kind of ""quick and easy"" we were looking for...

We ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich along with an order of chili cheese fries all to share. First off, the portions are HUGE, 3 people could have easily shared. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was boommb. I dont know if it was the alcohol beforehand or what, but it hit the spot and then some! The chili cheese fries were not too bad either! 

BBQ pulled pork - $5.99
Side of fries - $2.99 (add $1 for chili AND cheese!)


Amazing deal for some pretty damn good food! Will definitely be back to both the Lobby Bar and Vig Deli!",2011-07-09 17:35:10

 I'm so sorry to do this. I wanted this place to be the Gem that I just found at the pho place next door. It was not! Sooooo, let me get to it. First BEWARE the ""yogurt soda"" . This is definately something you would have to spend alot of time with. It is exactly what it says it is. Imagine plain, unsweetened yogurt, you drop in plain, unflavored unsweetened soda water in and then add a tablespoon of salt. Sound good. Fuck no! And it is not.  Next.....!
 Falafel: Meh! The croquettes could have been crispier on the outside and definately need a lot more flovor to these heavenly middle-eastern balls of goodness. The pickle was actually the best part.  The pita is NOT MADE FRESH!! Some reviews say they are but I can tell you the pita's came from a bag.
 Gyro: Meh! The reason for the cone shaped meat loaf of lamb and beef is so the outside cooks quickly buy turning past extremely high heat and the inside stays moist as it is sliced away from the cone. In my Gyro there were no cooke meat ends, in fact it was just inside Gyro meat. I assume this is because they are busy and the outside meat was never given a chance to cook up again.....you see the inside becomes the outsude every slice of the way. I did not have nearly enough tzatziki, no cucumbers, no olive, no red onion. All essential in creating a tasty ass Gyro. I still contend that Jay's Gyros in Tempe are supreme!! 
Lamb Tongue Sandwich: Lettuce, Tomato, Tongue wrapped in a bagged pita!! Boring. Dry. The Lamb Tongue is served in the pita WHOLE. I thought it would be sliced but it was'nt. Two little lamb tongue's boiled with ZERO flavor.
Baba Gahnoush: OK.........
Hummus: OK.......
(Pita Jungle has a much heartier flavor on both items)
Baklavah: We have a winner!!!! Some of the best I have tasted in recent memory. That will be my reason for a follow up.

Going on, I got the vibe that it's French/Italian, mostly because j'ai vu un mur couverte avec un poème or something like it. The menu itself has French names but it was mostly pastas in the entrées so I guessed it was some fusion thing. 

This is definitely a cute date spot. Tables don't hold more than 4 and the dining area is tightly packed and dimly lit but I guess it adds to the romantic ambience. 

I had this prosciutto salad with mixed greens and asiago cheese and it was fantastic. I'm not a salad person but this was a great appetizer. I loved that they didn't drown the salad in their dressing... Which I still can't figure out. It was light green with bits of herb in it. Anyway, they didn't give too much prosciutto but it was delicious. They sprinkled some walnuts in there, which didn't stand out too much but I guess walnuts are just mild. 

My entrée was seafood pasta. It has tiger shrimp, calamari, and a couple of other stuff. When I went yesterday, they didn't give too many toppings. I don't know if it's because we ordered two.. Not that that should matter. However, that rosé sauce was great! 

My dessert was a crème brûlée but an herb they added on there was too gingery. The sugar coating on top is really thick so you really have to your weight into breaking it up. I probably burned more calories eating the crème brûlée then ingesting it because it took so much energy to bite! 

Service was nice and friendly. The ambience is top notch but I think they need to tweak their food a bit. I had some of their peach and ice cream and that was good, though! Taste is all there, but I'd have liked more toppings in my pasta. The pasta was chewy which I liked.",2017-07-10 23:52:49

Main dish was General Tsao tofu. Very sweet, not really my preference. But, I know most Asian restaurants around here have to modify their recipes to meet the typical palates of the locals. So, they turn on the sugar and lower the spices and heat. 
So, if you're from western PA and like other Asian restaurants in this area you'll probably like this one, too. If you're from the south, Asia or New England and you like bold, authentic flavors, you'll be underwhelmed.",2012-08-19 04:28:29

The rice was flavored good and the chicken was so tender and melts in your mouth. I loved it and it's still good when you microwave leftovers.

The maximum speed limit is 35 miles per hour, which is a reasonable speed for handling the s-curves and sharing the road with bicyclists, pedestrians, and the occasional burro. On account of the fact that 13-Mile Scenic Drive travels around the periphery of Red Rock Canyon, the views to the right overlook breathtaking mountain scenery and the views to the left overlook open desert and mountains in the distance. 

 Due to the popularity of Red Rock Canyon, 13-Mile Drive gets crowded. When I have driven it, I have witnessed the same elements of aggressive driving that I commonly see in the city. Here, there is a conflict between drivers that are following the speed limit sightseeing and aggressive drivers in a rush to get to a trailhead or rush toward the exit. On peak days, parking areas are full to capacity. From my experience,  once you reach the Lost Creek parking lot after mile marker 7, it is less of a headache to find a parking spot. To alleviate traffic pressure on 13-Mile Scenic Drive, I strongly believe that Red Rock Canyon National Recreation Area would do a good service for its visitors by providing a shuttle along the route as an option to driving it.

  I must address a couple of things. In Red Rock Canyon, the phone signal is poor. Getting a Yelp check-in is as likely as hitting a real royal flush. And the nearest gas station is at the Charleston at Desert Foothills Chevron. If you drive on the 13-Mile Scenic Drive low on gas, then 13 will be an unlucky number in Red Rock Canyon.

 The 13-Mile Scenic Drive is the only way to reach the popular points of interest in the Red Rock Canyon Fee Area. With that in mind I will most likely return.",2012-12-17 06:33:59

We have tried a few other places around and nothing compares to here. Its always fresh and always delicious. We started off with one of their specials - it was a crab and shrimp cake wrapped in rice paper or something to make it crunchy and flash fried. It was served like a lettuce wrap with some picked daikon and carrot with some cucumber as well. It had a nice spicy sweet sauce as a topper and we both loved this dish and I would have gotten this as my actual meal had I known how big it would be.

I had the basil chicken served with white rice and boyfriend had the drunken dragon noodles. My chicken was nice and tender with a flash fried outside - not like deep fried or gross- I actually felt good eating this. Boyfriends noodles were nice and spicy and the basil was delicious in his dish.

We tried this place about a week ago, being in the area. I really wanted some ramen and had been craving it for awhile. The reviews were off-putting but I did still want to give it a try and see for myself.

We came in and was greeted immediately and sat. That was great. The decor looked awesome from what I could see. It was the middle of the day but the windows were all blocked up and the lighting was very, VERY dim. Please get more light in the place.

I think our server's name was Bryan. She was kind of very laid back and actually didn't say too much. We asked for a few minutes to go over the menu as we had never been before. She said ok and went about her business. It felt like awhile before she actually came back to us. But since I didn't really pay attention to that, I'm not going to hold it against her.

We placed our orders. One tonkotsu ramen and one shoyu ramen, please! Also add one deep fried spicy tuna roll and one california. Awesome!

The orders were brought out by different people, not our server. (the place wasn't really busy). Our server actually walked by us a few times and didn't even garner a 'how you doing?' So idk if she wasn't wanting to be there today or whatever but we did see her take other people's orders the same way. Just monotone. 

Anyway, the deep fried tuna sushi was good. I don't think I ever hide it like that before so it kind of tasted like beef. Still good, though!

Now the ramen... those were really disappointing. The portions were great, just how it usually is in any place... but the broth... the pork broth (I even questioned if it was pork broth) was completely watered down. There was absolutely no flavor in it at all. It was like a bowl of water with noodles in it. Like... what? And the noodles? Way over done. It was like water decided to be solid. You have no idea how much soy sauce I had to sprinkle to give me something I could work with.

At least the pork belly was good.

My wife's shoyu ramen? Same thing! NO FLAVOR and over done noodles. Usually it's a little salty because of the soy sauce based broth but I would've killed for some salt right here. It wasn't great.

Oh btw, Bryan never showed back up until it was time for the check. Other people running around got us water refills and whatnot but Bryan didn't bother with us. It think it was the bussers that actually helped us more. Like dude...

Anyway, I'm sure the owner/s are great people but you have a weak link here. I'm sure the kitchen should taste their broth too.

Maybe I need to come when there's a good cook in the house?

But reality, we probably won't try again. :(",2018-03-18 16:46:50

It was perfect timing since I was in the market to get Minnie some new treats and salmon oil to help with her joints.

Haley was working and was friendly and helpful.  When I asked about salmon oil options, she showed me immediately the two different brands they carry.  She didn't hard sell at all, which I liked.  She also recommended some treats that her dogs like (which Minnie also enjoyed).  

While Pet Planet isn't exactly convenient to where I live, and I may not go out of my way to return, I would not hesitate to stop by when in the area to stock up on stuff for my pup.  

While they currently don't carry the Wellness line of food that I feed Minnie, they do offer quite a variety of other options.

Wifey took us here after her co-workers raved how good their food was.  We decided to stop by one Friday night for a quick dinner.  It was less than what I expected.  Most of her co-workers are Mexican!  No joke.

You enter Taqueria El Buen Pastor and it's just confusing where to go.  You look straight back and there you see the counter where your order is cooked.  But the cashier station is all the way on the left side?  Weird.  Second thing that really bothered me?  The damn pricing!  Is this upscale Mexican food?  I was hoping for more rustic like a good tiny taco shop or even a Roberto's.  But this place charges you an arm & a leg for an entrée.  It's cheaper (and probably just as good) as the eatery in Cardenas Market right across the street!  But I digress.

After looking at the menu, which is basically plastered all over their walls in no good arrangement, we placed our order.  We had:

*Burrito Al Pastor ($8!)
*Carne Asada Nachos ($10.50!)
*Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50!)

I place the '!' as definitely an exclamation.  Prices be rising!  Unfortunately I cannot condone the quality for the prices.

The salsa bar on the opposite side of the cashier was OK, stocked with the usual pickled carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and salsas.  Veggies were a bit limp, the carrots didn't have enough time to pickle properly so they were weak.  And their salsas?  Ugh, they weren't so tasty.  Salt, guys?

Burrito Al Pastor was really lackluster.  It was small first of all, and when I cut it open there was nothing to be excited about.  This burrito was gloomy!  Al pastor, rice, beans, some cheese.  So plain.  No even a little color with some fresh salsa inside.  It tasted kinda plain too.  The al pastor was light on flavor - not much spice on my tongue, or much sweet from pineapple that should be in there.  Pretty disappointing.

Cheese Quesadilla?  For over $5?  Better be damn good!  And it really wasn't.  It was a tortilla.  Filled with bland cheese.  Then put on the grill to brown.  How hard can it be to make this?  And why does this particular one cost so much?  Nothing special.  I could have easily made a quesadilla better than this one for much less.  Hell, Del Taco makes a better cheese quesadilla.  Maybe even Napoleon Dynamite too.

The somewhat saving grace of this place was the Carne Asada Nachos.  Chips were hot & crispy, carne asada was crisp.  There was even color in the form of fresh salsa (with a TON of red onions) & guacamole.  But even this dish wasn't perfect.  Nachos should have cheese!  Lots of cheese!  This one was skimpy on the cheese.  And for damn near $11?  The platter should have been BIGGER!  Could barely feed the 3 of us.  With more cheese and more chips this would have been a winner.

Taqueria El Buen Pastor is not a winner overall in my book.  It was just so underwhelming.  And I was a bit excited too because I saw Tacos de Cabeza (brain) and Tacos de Lengua (tongue) on the menu.  But at like $2 each ($2.50 for lengua) I'm not so sure.

I ordered bbq chicken with a sweet potato and coleslaw, and my bf had the 6 oz sirloin with 1/2 rack of ribs added on. Oddly enough we switched because I was liking the steak more, and he had a taste for the chicken I ordered! The sweet potato with butter and cinnamon was perfect, and very big! Coleslaw ehh not so wonderful. Very bland even after shaking pepper for a few minutes (I will never add salt to anything!) so I didn't eat much of it.

I really enjoyed watching a movie here and plan on going again whenever a movie I'm interested in hits this place.  The only downer about this place is that it's small and only has two screening rooms, but I don't mind that.

The workers there are really nice, and I chatted with one of them at the counter.  She was really nice and informed me that they started serving warm nuts and asked if I wanted a sample.  So if you're a nut lover, keep that in mind.  She also let me know that Regal Manor Twin is the oldest theater in Charlotte.  (I enjoy little fun facts like that!)

While waiting for the movie to start, I walked around the theater and thought it was cool that they hung paintings in the lobby that you can buy.  Great to know that they support local artists!

There are bathrooms located on the main floor, which I think is good for the people who have a hard time taking stairs.  There are bathrooms located upstairs as well, and it is very clean and well kept for an old theater.

The screening room itself is pretty good as well.  It's not stadium seating, but the view is still really good of the movie, not too big, not too small.  If you're a Charlottean and have not been here yet, definitely stop by and check out a movie here.",2013-10-06 02:23:45

Super friendly and efficient service tops the modern industrial decor - big light shades, leather booths, wood and tile are some of the design features. Very tasteful colors and lighting. 

We tried the cheddar cheese and some olives to start and paired nicely with a well made dirty martini. The berry compote was so good and complemented the sharp cheddar very well.

Their menu features steaks, seafood and salads. There were several exciting dishes I'd like to try but was hungry for something light so we built our own Caesar Salad with a delicious medium grilled salmon. It was the most amazing blend of lemon, grilled pepper and asparagus, and bright notes of some kind of parsley or something. It was really good. 

To end the meal, we tried one of the blueberry cheesecake mason jars with a strudel crumble on the top. The blueberry topping was the same compote used in the cheese plate - not a bad thing!

I'll start off by saying the atmosphere is not for everyone. It's a small space where the tables are extremely close to one another it can be noisy. If you are willing to embrace the resulting conversations and meeting new people, then you also get the benefit of trying some of my favorite dishes and cocktails that the city of Charlotte has to offer. 

Again, the space is small and they don't take reservations. Getting large crowds (4+) in is extremely difficult. While the no wait app has been a game changer, this place puts up ridiculous wait times so be prepared to go early. I also recommend trying one of the specialty cocktails here. Several big names in the Charlotte cocktail scene either started here or spent some time here. While I'm not sure who influenced who, I'll certainly enjoy the resulting drink menu they have to offer. 

Regarding food, I've tried many dishes over the last few years and only have had a handful that didn't blow me away. I would treat this place as an experience more than a meal, and have easily spent close to 2 hours in the past ordering dishes (1) or (2) at a time and often putting my experience in the hands of our waiter/waitress as they are better versed in what is good for the night. Some highlights include the pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, and garlic truffle fries.

New to the area and living close to Erin's we have been there more then any other establishment in the Madison area. For dinner we try to get there early to avoid the rush that seems to start after 6 pm. My husband and I usually split two dishes, our go to favorite of fish and chips, and one other to try something new. We have loved everything except for the shepherds pie which we found a little bland. We recommend the Fish and Chips for dinner and the Corn beef sandwich for lunch.

This location is the worst though. I won't be back to this one. We ordered enough food to go for at least 3-4 people. We asked them for extra sauce (at the other location they give you a few of each type) but not here. We got ONE pack of the garlic sauce, ONE pack of ketchup, and ONE pack of the hot sauce.

Oddly, I have never actually had a traditional cow burger from here, but their chicken burgers are a thing of beautiful mystery.  I might be getting carried away, but generally, this place is quick, customizable, and always delicious.  I've never once had a bad time here.  Granted half of the wait staff are disgruntled, leftover-angst-filled kids, but your server will be awesome.  The place itself isn't much, but you're not here for the décor.  It's casual and cool, and what's wrong with that?

You're going to want to do the ""create your own"" option with the little notepads in the center of the table.  Cute, right?  Get one of those tiny pencils and pick anything you could ever want.  Personally, I do the chicken on focaccia with truffle aioli, provolone, arugula, and cucumbers, but that's just me (the pickiest one of them all!).  It gets crazy messy, melty, and for once, there is no amount of (Yelp traditional) hyperbole to explain myself. Most of my dinner partners choose the typical burger or get real crazy with some buffalo or elk.  How do they have buffalo?  I hope that the headcount at South Park hasn't gone down.  I also want to note on the truffle fries; they're greasy, smelly, and SO. GOOD.  It has that awesome truffle gorgonzola aspect of ""this smells like feet, and it's delicious"".

Everyone wants to exclaim about the milkshakes immediately (Prantl's almond torte shake! Booze shakes!), and I know they are incredible, but don't toss your little drink menu aside.  The sangria is more or less a new age hooch of different non-explicit ingredients made in house for which I am typically not brave enough.  The gem is the strawberry shag.  Complete with your strawberry slices and basil, this thing is excessively easy to drink.  It's simple, but always a staple.

The location itself is small, and you cannot make reservations; I have to mention the NoWait app though, as sometimes you can be given up to a two and a half hour wait (I've seen it!). I know it sounds chintzy to get dinner in a strip mall, but this is still my favorite location.  Original is always the best, unless you're creating a burger that is going to be better than anything you can order off any menu.",2015-03-20 18:56:26

In my mind, there are two distinct sections to the BMO center.  There is the section the BMO Center that is in the Southeast section, which is where the trade shows are held.  There is also another newer section in the NorthWest corner, where I have seen a number of larger corporate events held.  I have attended events in both sections over the years.

Older TradeShow Section
==================
In the older sections, where Calgary often enjoys trade shows is a great space for this purpose.  The space is quite industrial and wide open.  Therefore, the space is easily dividable for multiple shows on the same weekend.

There are also food kioks scattered on the South wall, which gives patrons the option to purchase soft drinks and snacks, while exploring the venue, which is a great service in my opinion.  The drinks and food are expensive, but there is a variety, and it is available as an option.

The bathrooms are satisfactory at best.  The ladies washroom was clean, but for the size of the venue, there are not enough toilets.  The lineups are atrocious for an event like the women's show.  I hate to be graphic, but there was a young child that soiled themselves waiting.  If you have a venue that has the capacity for a large number of people, walking into a bathroom with that few stalls will cause problems.  the water pressure also wasn't sufficient, so it took more than one flush before leaving the bathroom stall.

All in all, the venue itself was great for the women's show, but there are a few improvements that could take this from a good space to a fantastic space.",2011-05-02 04:56:01

I visited this restaurant a while back for lunch with my colleagues from work. I have only been here once. This restaurant is a five-minute drive from my workplace.

It was a Friday. It's wasn't all that busy when we came at around noon. However, the phone was pretty busy catering to takeout orders, which fascinated me.

The restaurant has a bunch of lunch specials. I went with the crispy beef special. It came with rice and a spring roll. The beef had sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I enjoyed my food. It was tasty and filling.

My manager thought that the food was okay. I don't recall what he had ordered, though.

I recall how nice the tablecloth was. Service was fast that day.

I had read the reviews so wasn't expecting anything awesome and pretty much that's what we got...just average bar food.

We started off with an order of boneless chicken wings (medium heat). They tasted like they had been heated up from a previously frozen status (like you'd get in the freezer section of your local grocer). Surprisingly enough, I really liked them, although I also really like the freezer ones that I heat up at home too...(Oh shoot that should be my little secret...hehe). Anyway, on to the main meal.

My boyfriend ordered the Whatcha Want Burger  (pick any 3 toppings, he chose cheese and onion straws). He ordered it medium and said that it was cooked right and tasted okay, but believes it was also previously frozen.

I had the Pretzel Club (smoked turkey, ham, bacon, honey dijon and Swiss &
American cheeses on a pretzel bun). Again, not to repeat myself over and over, but I didn't find this sandwich anything to be excited about. It was okay.

The service was the best part of the place. We sat at a booth in the bar area. It wasn't really busy when we were there, and the bartender was also the server. He was quick to attend to us and friendly.

the space is ok - nothing really stood out. Place was EMPTY. 

Believe it or not, the person flipping the bill insisted we go in case Ms. Longoria was there so he can make a move ...yeah...good luck ! 

pre-meal cocktail was a boring glass of sauvignon blanc. I order that whenever i ask the bartender for his /her recommendation of any of their specialty drinks ( w/o looking at the drink menu ) and if they say i make anything, i go with wine - take some pride in your drinks bartender ! You must have a few specialty cocktails - better yet, one you've created ! 

we order Eva's guacamole ( $12 ???) , a crab cake ( $18 ) - three of us eating. 
i go with the skirt steak ( $29 ) and sides of asparagus and mushrooms ( i believe both were either $8 or $9 ) 
finish the meal with pineapple upside down cake ( damn - when freeloading, i don't pay close attention to price ! I think around $10 ) 

my thoughts ? 

Guacamole - BORING ! Worse, i'm sure it was pre-made then placed in a fridge for god only  knows how long - the guac was waaay too cold. 

Crab cake - decent . It ain't $18 decent but decent all the same. 

Skirt steak - i thought the menu said chili-rubbed. It may have been then it was slathered with bbq styled sauce. It actually had good flavor and the meat was tender. This was the cheapest steak on the menu - price didn't really matter to me, but it sounded interesting. 

The asparagus and mushrooms ...BORING ! 

Can't remember the wine - it was a cab - told it cost about $100 - ok but so memorable i don't know the name of it. 

The pineapple upside down ? i liked the concept - they bring out the cake in the mini- pan and serve it table side with a dollop of ice cream. Had nice flavor but my only gripe - MORE PINEAPPLE PLEASE ! 

Would i hit Beso on my dime in the future ? NO

Sashimi combo for 2: 4 stars ($25 for 12 pieces)
Tokyo Ramen: 3 stars ($10)
Tonkotsu Ramen: 3 stars ($11)
Takoyaki: 4 stars ($5 for 6 pieces)

The sashimi was very fresh and was at the level of melt-in-your-mouth quality. I particularly enjoyed the scallop sashimi; they were big pieces and sweet. The sashimi combo included 2 pieces of each of the following: salmon, red tuna, scallop, octopus, red snapper?, and one other fish I am not familiar with but nevertheless, it was GOOD!
As for the two ramens, I thought it could use more toppings but they were still good overall. The Tokyo ramen was soy sauce-based and the tonkotsu ramen was pork bone-based. Both were sufficiently flavourful. I like how it's not too salty but not too bland. There is one big circular piece of pork belly? that came with the ramen; I wasn't a fan of it. Too fatty and not the kind that dissolves in your mouth. The fat was kind of firm...just didn't like it. I just gave it to my boyfriend. The noodles were firm and chewy, which I like. Portions were probably on the smaller end but it is an izakaya, so not fazed by the delicate quantities. 
Takoyakis were soft and gooey, and drizzled with all that yummy creamy mayo. Pretty standard fare for an izakaya and wouldn't say it's spectacular, but still put a smile on my face as I shoved them hurriedly in my mouth =)

Ambiance: 3 stars
Clean and brightly lit interior. It was very busy when I was there on a Friday night. Simple tables and chairs with a nice wooden bar area by the sushi chefs. Wouldn't say the place is cozy or comfy enough to sit and chat for hours but good for a casual date or friendly dinner.

I did not understand why they were blasting music during playoff football but maybe I walked in during halftime and they quickly shut off the music when I asked.  The bar has plenty of gaming machines but what I liked is they had a part of the bar with no gaming.  I hate when a place kicks you off a seat at the bar because you are not playing and want to save it for that ONE LOSER that thinks he is gonna hit it big.  

During football games they have some food specials that are not on the menu.  Price points and servings vary depending on how many people you have in your group but they start at $8 and up.  I went for the Beef Sliders and Tater Tot Nachos.  The sliders were filling and a decent snacking size.  The bun was fresh and of good quality.  I thought the Tater Tot dish was an amazing idea and it was surprisingly good in my opinion.  Great little bar food dish.  

Draft beer choices were not great and seemed to be favored towards the Anheuser Busch family of beers. I had a Sierra Nevada and to be honest it did not taste that great, maybe they needed a line flush or its not a beer served often.

Unfortunately the staff seems to get quite overwhelmed with the lunch rush, doesn't seem like they're very used to it by the looks on their faces and the frantic-ness felt around that time. It was to the point to where they ran out of 2 different sodas and they couldn't send someone to go to the back and take 2 seconds to change out the syrups.

I've been a Hilton Honors member forever. I travel A LOT and I've been very loyal to Hilton.  This hotel and this hotel only is the sole reason I will no longer stay in a Hilton.  Hilton Honors is well aware of their actions as well, but allow me to try in a small way to dissuade people from staying here.  GO MARRIOTT!!!  

I booked a room in JULY for a birthday weekend for a friend in NOvember. Knowing it's high season/conference season , I knew rates would go up.  I locked in a room for a Thurs-Sunday stay.  $139 for Thurs and $179 for Fri/Sat.  My reservation states changes/cancellations can be made up to 48 hours.  Okay.

I cannot go until Friday now, so I go online to alter my reservation for a Friday/Sat stay.  As I go to do this, I receive an alert that because I'm altering my reservation that I will be starting over.  Rates for a dumpy room are now at $359 a night (it's Vegas. It is a HILTON for Christ's sake.. wth)   Oh hell no.  So I call the hotel. Have fun calling.. It took 10 minutes to get to an actual person. I was then on hold for 19:38 minutes. No joke.     He finally gets back on and states that ""due to high demand"" the new hotel rates take place if I cancel Thursday.

Um, say what?  I get that if I were trying to get a different room or add a night, that I am responsible for going rates. However, I ALREADY HAVE A ROOM.  I'VE HAD A ROOM SINCE JULY.  I was specifically told I could change/cancel within 48 hours of my arrival.  yeah, sure you can but your reservation is actually void if you do. So, that's a lie.  When I try to use logic and reasoning with the beyond rude man on the phone he refuses to listen. He simply reads ""hotel policy to me"" and refuses to allow me to speak to a manager.  Flat out refuses.

I hang up and call Hilton Honors. I explain the situation, the woman agrees it's insane and goes to try and cancel my Thursday but not make me 'start over' with the overpriced rates and keep my rate THAT I HAVE HAD SNCE JULY.  Can't do it. So she calls the hotel. They refuse and state, ""she can pay for Thursday if she wants to keep her rates"".  Even the Hilton HOnors woman states how bad their customer service is regarding this matter.   

ARe you f-ing kidding me.    Not okay.  I tell her right then and there that this hotel's actions are the sole reason I will never use Hilton again. She actually agrees and understands and states that she is submitting a report about this as it's cost a loyal customer (let alone 8 other people who are also coming and are joining me over in Marriot land rather than stay at this crappy hotel)

So, due to the piss poor customer service. I have cancelled 3 domestic reservations from now until December.  Oh, hi I am also travelling to Israel and Jordan for weeks in December.. I cancelled those too.  I'm in the process of booking at Marriotts. 

So congrats Elara!!   I'm converting my HIlton points into miles and y'all can shove it.  

and to Jake L/Erica of Elara... don't bother to post your canned reply about ""hotel policy"". It was repeated to me 3 times on the phone by your rude , condescending and worthless employee on the phone.       I'll wave to y'all from my way less overpriced room.     Not allowing me to cancel ONE night?  god that's ridiculous.

Wow, I was so surprised on many levels today when I accidentally came across an Indian place while doing errands.  We have been to hundreds over the years in many countries but not able to find too many in Arizona!  
Ordered to go:
Meat samosa - (accidentally gave us beef instead of chicken but it was better than most and have a great flavor on the outside which was a surprise)
Tandoori wings - tender and so flavorful, better than most we have tried anywhere including the ""wing"" place!
Mater paneer - (peas and cheese) mild, and it really was mild because I can't do spicy which eliminates a lot of places for me.
Chicken tikka masala  (mild again I can't do spicy and it was) ... wow, tender chicken breast and flavored.  Yup, one of the best butter sauces I have ever tasted.  And I love that is was not loaded with veggies because I like to dip my naan in it!
Basmati rice - perfectly cooked and tender.

Certainly the hotel theme could be more interesting.  

I prefer the Wynn's beauty... if I must stay in a hotel with a rich guy's name all over it.  And Wynn isn't a known bigot or person that many consider fascist.  That's a valid concern.

All of our visits have been mediocre until today.  Oh my word, it was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had the displeasure of going through.

I needed help in selecting some nails and screws for a repair.  I asked an employee already in the aisle for assistance and he said that he was already working with another customer but would come back to help me.  Walked away and never came back.

Second employee walks by the aisle and I asked loudly for assistance and kept walking away.  A little bit later, I saw the first employee who said he would come back to help me walk to the break room with co-worker.  I definitely believed he never wanted to help me from the get-go.

At this time, I called a friend to help me over the phone and was able to make my selections.  I picked up a couple more random items and make my way over to the check out.  Now my luck turns from bad to worse.  I ended up waiting behind a customer who was having an issue with the cashier.  There was another cashier in the next lane with no one in that lane but it did not appear open.  A new customer walks up behind me to wait in line and the cashier next over asked for him to come over instead of me, who has been already waiting for 5 minutes.

I'm absolutely fuming at this point and demanded to speak to a manager.  I calmly (as I'm able to do this point) explained the customer service failure from multiple employees and expressed my profound disappointment.  There is no reason for such a complete lack of regard in assisting paying customers, especially repeat customers.  I've never felt so disrespected in a place of business.

I highly recommend you cancel your Winterlicious reservations. Read on...

Just like with Summerlicious, they do bait and switch: they put interesting items on the menu (pesto pasta, salmon, tiger shrimp, etc), but when you actually come there the items are not on the menu. Instead of tiger shrimp you get cheap regular one, and they replaced the fancy salmon dish with a half-ass boiled tilapia. 

I got:
* soup: some generic lentil soup you can get at most shawarma places for $2. It is a good soup, but there is nothing special about it. 
* tilapia with veggies: plain boiled cheap tasteless fish with boiled carrots, a broccoli, and a piece of beets. Just plain boiled stuff, as if it was cooked by a kid, not by a french chef. There was some sauce drizzled around the rim of the plate as an after-thought, to provide at least a little bit of flavour.
* ""Bittersweet Belgian Chocolate Cake Baked with Dark Rum"" (quote from the menu). Tasted like some stale dry generic cake from Metro. no detectable rum in it whatsoever.

To add insult to this, they add mandatory tips for groups of N or bigger. Probably cause it is harder to serve a table of 5 as opposed to 5 tables of 1 patron?

We wanted to try this place cause it is not far from the office, and the menu looked decent.

I'm so happy that ""Agave"" is back in action as the newly revamped Taqueria Junction.

The menu has shrunk - but the food quality has improved a LOT! On this trip we ordered the Chips, Salsa, Queso, and Guacamole as an appetizer (the chips come in a cute little white bag labeled ""munchies"" - we were amused), to eat we ordered a Chicken Quesadilla (chicken, pico, black beans, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream), Carnitas Enchiladas (corn tortillas, carnitas, melted cheese, green mole sauce), and Shredded Beef Enchiladas (corn tortillas, shredded beef, melted cheese, green mole sauce). Everything was delicious.

Taqueria Junction seems to be marketed more as a restaurant than a bar and garners a little bit of an older scene than its Crocker Park predecessor. That isn't a bad thing. The alcohol is still there and my personal fave - the mojitos - are definitely still on the menu. Not to mention the place is technically a TEQUILA bar - there is no shortage of choices when it comes to the Mexican spirit. Plus, there's nothing like starting the night off right with a shot of Patron.

If you were a fan of the old Agave you'll be happy to see familiar faces behind the bar. If you're new to this ""Modern Mexican and Tequila Bar"" - you are likely to fall in love.

As far as the interior goes it's a weird mix of country meets Mexican but comes across as somewhat chic and trendy. There is limited outdoor seating (about six tables maybe) and the inside seats about 73 (or so I was told). Parking is limited (there is a small lot in the back) but we parked by the Drug Mart across the street.

TJ could have gotten a 5 star rating from me - but would-be patrons be warned - their air conditioning is basically nonexistent. They're aware of the problem and fingers crossed it will soon be remedied.

There was plenty of food for the price.
Josh gave me excellent service, most of the time.
There was not a long wait for the food and it was all hot.

Stuff that could use some work:
While Josh directly gave all his customers great service I do not think the whole dining room needed to know about the steak that was served way over done or what mess the closing shift left him, He should be a bit more discreet talking to the rest of the staff rather than shouting.

I know what good Thai tastes like and I can easily judge the worth of a Thai restaurant by the taste of their pad Thai, or their yellow curry.

When I moved to Tempe I was unsure that I would ever even find passable Thai--let alone good Thai food. So after trying three other Thai places (on other people's recommendation) I hesitantly tried Lemongrass. I ordered the Yellow Curry with an extra side of white rice.

It was fantastic--everything was cooked perfectly and the curry sauce tasted exactly like it should--and had the correct thickness (not to thick but not runny at all). 

The only complaint I have is that the potatoes are obviously not cooked in the sauce and they should be (you can tell because outside of the outer layer of the potato pieces the potato isn't yellow). But even though they weren't cooked in the sauce (or even half cooked in the sauce) they were cooked perfectly, so the complaint is fairly minor.

The Vig Uptown would be great but it's only a ten-minute drive from the original, so why bother? There's already too many places like this in Uptown such as Ticoz and Postino, along with a handful of others on Camelback. They should have put this further North/Northwest, maybe along Central near Northern or Dunlap.

Environment:
Located near the Spadina/College intersection, the restaurant is located at a vibrant neighbourhood with many shops, and it is easily accessible by public transit.
The store is quite small however, with only enough tables to sit roughly 10 parties. But they can accomodate large groups for the big tables at the back.

Food: 
They have daily specials available and when I went on a Friday the daily special was one order of free fries, which were normally $2 each. The fries looked and tasted like McDonald fries, which I kinda liked and it was so addicting.
For main, my friend and I shared the cheese ribs between the two of us. We ordered the medium spicy and it was actually too much for me. My eyes were tearing, my nose was runny, and my was aching...it wasn't a peasant sight. So I would suggest that if you're really not good at handling spiciness you should totally get the non-spicy option, because the ribs were actually really good otherwise. 
On the hot plate there were mozzerella cheese which was used to wrap the ribs, some steamed eggs, butter corn, mash popatoes, mashed yam, and a few weiner sausages. The rest of the sides were quite tasty as well, but the best part of the dish was definitely the ribs!

Service:
One thing that makes this place stands out is its personalized table service. The servers would come to your table to cook the ribs for you and help you wrap the cheese. They only work on a few pieces at a time so you can enjoy the ribs while the cheese was still soft and warm. The servers would come back to make a few more once they realized that your current batch was finished.
The servers were super attentive and totally deserved the added tips

Overall, the meal was fantastic. Food was tasty and one order of the cheese ribs was enough for 2 people, which cost roughly $15 per person. The servers were skilled at preparing the cheese ribs and were attentive to our requests. I would totally come back again and try their non-spicy ribs",2017-10-28 01:19:03

We had arrived early to meet with a group of our friends after the WSOP to celebrate him winning. I wish we could have stoped them form coming because the poor attitude wasn't where this stoped. 

For a restaurant in the Aria you would expect the hostess to be a little more professional instead she stood at the desk picking her teeth and playing with her hair leaning against the podium while we stood there waiting (literally, yes). I decided to ask if they had any gluten free options because I have an allergy. She stated they have Spaghetti that's gluten feee but it's a massive plate. Knowing I wasn't super hungry but didn't want to sit there not eating while everyone ate I opted to walk next door to grab food. By the time it was ready, our party had arrived, been seated and ordered. When I tried to walk in (food in bag, not eating it) she said she can't let me in. When I tried to explain I wouldn't eat it, she wouldn't let me in and rolled her eyes at me when I said I have an allergy and didn't want the pasta but I didn't need to eat it now, we just wanted to celebrate with our friends. 

Threw away $25 worth of food to sit in their restaurant to have a pizza place not smell like a burger. Are you really that insecure about your venue that you can't let someone walk in with a bag and not eat?

-I love their selection of pre-made food; discounts on them after 7:30 pm everyday.

-Generally, it's clean and easy to find stuff.
-Open 24/7 and they offer a delivery service.

-No charges on plastic bags. I sometimes forget to bring reusable bags.
-They sell really good high quality rice cookers.

What I dislike about this store:
-I've had one bad experience with their ""special price"" chicken breast. It looked fine wrapped but the moment I opened the wrapping, it was rotten. It had this foul, rotten egg smell that quickly filled my kitchen, and there was nothing I could do but to throw it out. Rather than putting it on ""special price"" and repackaging rotten chicken breast meat, they should have thrown it out. After this experience, I am very hesitant about buying meat from here. $5 wasted. 
-Their soft tofu also got rotten within a week. Unopened and stored in the fridge, soft tofu is usually good for at least a couple of weeks. $2 wasted.
-Pricey-and-not-much-of-selection items: cheese, milk, juice, chips, and bread; they must think you get these from other grocery stores. 
-Pricey items: Chinese sauces and condiments, Korean sauces and condiments, in general, Galleria is more pricey than other Korean grocery stores.",2012-12-07 05:56:12

Meeting my friend in the middle of the night for relationship crisis is not usually how I like spending my Thursdays but you know , since it was at Fran's with their yummy goodness, I braved the rainstorm to lend a ear.

The good.
This is the second Fran's I've seen with Modern decor- I love it. The mosaic art piece of Marilyn Monroe is stunning. Love the colour scheme in the washroom. Love the lighting - really well put together place I'd say. My tummy starts to grumble in happy expectations and my mind is loving the decor- it's going to be a fab eating experience.

The bad.
I had a salad - Greek salad - which seemed more like a house salad. The lack of  onions, olives and Greek dressing really left me disappointed. I was really in the mood for a good, oniony greek salad. 
What made this worse, was that ever so often I felt like I was chewing.. .sand??! it wasn't food but it was definitely too small and I knew it wasn't going to kill me ( I really couldn't interrupt my friend's vent session either) so I chewed on.
The I had banana split - never really was tempted to have it so it was a new thing (yes I'm deprived) and I was in for another disappointment. My friend was kind enough to tell me after I ate it that I should order something like that at Dairy Queen - really not helpful - but I digress.
There was only 2 scoops - chocolate and strawberry - and I'm not a fan of strawberry ice cream. Definitely not enough syrup but it certainly looked alright and I loved the real whipped cream.

I was not disappointed.

When I was looking at the menu while in line out the door I could not decide what to get, everything sounded great. However I chose the BBQ sampler which came with enough BBQ pork to make a big sandwich, two large chicken fingers smothered in BBQ sauce, ribs and coleslaw.

Even with high expectations I was very surprised.  The BBQ pork was very flavorful and juicy, the smothered chicken tenders were still crisp yet smothered in sauce and the chicken was very tender and even the coleslaw was awesome. Small pieces of cabbage and carrot so it's not unwieldy which came in a tasty slightly peppery sauce.  I was stuffed at this point so I took the ribs home. They look great and I look foreword to eating them for lunch today.

I also ordered a pecan caramel shake which is a current special with roasted pecans and homemade caramel sauce, it was top notch as well.  I tried a sip of the chocolate espresso shake which had bits of espresso beans, wow.

This place lives up to the hype and then some.  I love the hand washing station so you can easily wash up before and after as well as the condiment dispensers including what I assume is homemade BBQ sauce. You can also get huge cups of free homemade ranch to go with your meal from the counter.

They have a small hot foods case, and a smaller frozen foods section than some of the other stores. 
Their veg*n frozen foods selection is bare-bones.

Everything was warm/hot and nothing was sitting out for too long. I wish I could tell you everything I ate, but the two things that really stood out for me were the Tikka Masala and the sausage made with lamb (Which should really say a lot coming from someone who is a faux-vegetarian).

Although I still classify it as elitist kinda mall since each level is a step up from the next.  The 3rd level has mostly high end stores and of course has less people walking around, the 2nd floor has the mid end stores and generally the most people milling about and of course the first floor is generally where you find the low end, teeny bopper stores..and well where most of the teens are.

It's huge, pretty much every store you've heard of and them some you haven't are located here.  They recently renovated all the food courts in here, making it more like the Yorkdale food court (thank god cuz both those food courts looked really bad).  It's more high end and in my opinion suitable to tourists as it provides better options than the fast food picks before. 

Easy to get to by subway or driving (paid parking lot) or justby walking depending on where you live.  

The Sears that was there is no longer there, boarded off.  Sad really, but I hear Nordstrom's will be taking it's place so I'm sure that will generate some new interest.  

I do like going at Christmas as well to check out their decorations, they do them well with the huge tree in the centre of the mall, and what would be the Eaton Centre without those iconic birds?  

You definitely cannot beat this place for people watching...just choose your level!",2015-07-06 14:05:43

We arrived around 9pm without a reservation and were quickly seated at a communal table as everything else was fully booked. Having read amazing reviews across the board we ordered the beef tartare and truffled green beans to start and the truffled spaghetti and beef bourguignon as the mains. To our (pleasant) surprise, the hostess remembered that we preferred to have our own table, and came to let us know that a cancellation had just come through which we really appreciated. After we moved to another table, the food started to come out. The appetizers were absolutely delicious, and the mains that shortly followed were equally yummy. Everything was PERFECT. Although it took quite some time for all the food to come out, you could tell that everything was made with love (as cheesy as that sounds) using great ingredients.

The service was excellent and our broths were really good. But it's hard for me to get past that they serve frozen proteins, especially the seafood proteins which obviously brings up questions about the age/freshness and quality of handling.

We were acknowledged immediately and seated right away when we entered on a Wednesday night around 8:30. A very thorough explanation of the menu, options, and where we could obtain the proteins and sauces was given to us. This was very helpful as we don't have the process down pat yet. We really didn't even look at the menu as everything was kind of done and explained to us. We ordered two broths with one being spicy and we were also informed that two skewers of chicken and two skewers of lamb came with our meal.

The selection of proteins, vegetables, and sauces was enormous. We were satisfied with the beef, chicken, and pork. As said before, the broths were flavorful also. But when it came to the seafood, almost everything was frozen when we pulled it out of the cooler. I needed a hammer and chisel to pry the scallops from their shells and the meat in the crab legs was frozen to a shriveled mess inside their shells. And of course when you attempt to cook a frozen protein it turns out to be a tough, dried out meat, which is my favorite.

The frozen seafood would usually be a deal breaker. But the service was excellent and the price was affordable at $26/person so I might give them another shot in the future and avoid the seafood.",2016-07-07 06:58:06

Cons:
Food will not impress you

Pho Vietnamese Delight is your standard Pho joint.  It will get the job done, no more no less.  You get pretty good portions for what you pay.  As long as you temper expectations, you will be fine.

We came in and were greeted very nicely by the staff.  A high chair was brought automatically before we even had to ask for one.  The staff were very friendly throughout our time here.

I ordered a large bowl of pho and my wife got the curry vermicelli.  I also got an order of spring rolls as well.  Food comes out relatively quickly as with most pho restaurants.  The portions here are very good.  They give you a ton of meat in your pho.  The meat to pho noodle ratio here is excellent.  They gave my wife this huge bowl of vermicelli for her curry.  I knew right away she wasn't finishing all those noodles.

Taste wise, you're not going to get the best bowl of pho here.  It's pretty decentand like I said, as long as you know you're not getting the best, you'll be fine.  If you want something more authentic, you're in the wrong part of town for that here.  

My biggest gripe was the size of my HK milk tea.  They charge $4 here and the cup was a bit on the small side.  A little strange given the portion size of everything else here.

All in all, Pho Vietnamese Delight will satisfy you're craving if you're feeling pho.  If you want something more authentic you'll have to go to other parts of town.",2017-12-19 12:46:18

Not wanting to leave a voicemail for the local Meinicke late at night I cited to communicate with them over email through the website. After detailing all that transpired and what was expected I received a phone call from corporate which appears to be in California telling me that they spoke to the local facility and advise them that we were bringing the car back in to have the fluids topped off. My son brought the car in and said I need to have the fluids replenished. The staff didn't understand what that meant. My son had his receipt with them at the time so they asked to see it. I look at the receipt somehow they thought I need to have the water pump replaced the antifreeze flushed and the brake fluid flushed. My son didn't know what that meant flushing of fluids if not replenishing fluid since that's what you asked for May of been similar in mechanics speak. Brent at the mechanics office the local mechanic Meinicke called to tell me that they were going to flush the fluids replaced the water pump I said I know that's not what's needed we just had an oil change we say the fluids topped off that they were checked. Brent advised me no we don't do that sir   I referenced the website stating that it says you top off the fluids on your website within oil change and when I called corporate they said to bring the car back in to have the fluids topped off. He then stated I'm sorry but we don't do that. My reply was OK I'll come pick up the vehicle.

My friend had suggested this place when I told her about my phone.  She takes her boss's phone here and knows that other company phones are brought here as well.  I was super excited when I saw the Yelp deal as well as the exceptional reviews on this place.  For $35, you get a voucher for $55 worth of service.  $35 is a lot better than $199!  
The store is located on the 2nd floor of the office building and it is in a rather sketch looking building, as other people have mentioned, but do not let this deter you from coming here! I was given a wait time of 45 minutes to an hour and was able to wait in the store.  They let you use their Wifi for free so I was able to use my iPad while waiting. I got in at 2:40PM and was done by 3:40! Since my service total was $51 and the voucher was for $55, I was given a free case. I would have been content with just my phone being fixed, but was even more impressed that they offered to give me a free case.
I'm so glad that I was led to this place. My phone looks brand new and I am able to function again :) Thank you so much Desert Wireless!!!",2013-06-04 17:43:22

I asked if mine was coming and the server said it was. 15 minutes later, the rest of our orders came and my baked salmon roll was still missing. So another server came and asked if we would like to order anything else, I then asked about my missing baked salmon roll, she said she would check on it & never returned for the rest of our dining. THEN, my friend ordered 4 rolls and only 2 returned. 

Once we all decided we were finished eating, we STILL had not received our orders. My baked salmon roll never came and neither did her 2 other orders.

Lets be clear, this is a 5 min walk from my office and I come to get my BANGS TRIMMED. Its only five bucks and *hopefully* done better than I can do on my own using my office scissors.

*Hopefully.* I have had an entire cut here, back in university days, but I never went back. They charge more for ""long hair"" even if you want only a trim. It seems to me that crafting a good short-cut would take more energy. Also, the stylist would not stop trying to convince me to colour  or add extensions, when clearly I don't look like the type. 

Regardless, I have had the emergency bang trim a couple times when I have somewhere to go and I cannot see enough to get there. The first time was great, I had an older lady who somehow heard what I wanted over the insanely loud banging hardhouse and gave me a nice, free flowing, properly blended bang. I should have taken her card. 

The next two times were horrible. The last girl cut them so short and blunt, with the uncut long piece overhang, all while proceeding to tell me that my haircut didn't suit me and my round/chubby face needs some poof for balance. She also said I have a really ""unique look"" which I suppose is open for interpretation. 

Honestly, this place must be for people fresh out of haircutting school, or something. Everyone I have ever got can barely hold scissors, and they use the comb for leverage. I expect some finesse from a stylist that claims to be professional.

I wish I could say this is the whole package, but they're missing one thing I love in Mexican restaurants. But, we'll get to that later! 

While you head down the stairs to the basement, you may think, why am I going down a weird stairway to a creepy basement? But then you walk into the doorway downstairs and it's a beautiful restaurant! All dark wood with grand wooden tables. The decorations are everywhere, while borderline tacky, they're fun to look at.

The server was super friendly and attentive and our apps and meal came out in what seemed like five seconds. Granted we were there around 6:30pm when it wasn't too busy, but it sure seemed hoppin' by the time we left around 8ish. 

I was excited to order a margarita, and even more excited when it came in a large shaker. Time to party!! It was good, but it wasn't awesome. I think it was a tad too sweet for me. Maybe a little less triple sec? But for $12, I'd say it was a good size.

There's literally 8 different salsa's to choose from, which can be a bit overwhelming. But if you want spicy or mild, fruit or veggie, it's all there. We tried the verde and the chipotle, and both were very good. I thought the chipotle was way different than I'd ever had, but I really liked it. Plus the chips were fresh and homemade. 

I ordered the enchilada, but switched it up with shrimp instead of chicken with a $2 up-charge.  It came loaded with lettuce, sauce and 3 corn tortilla's. Plus, white rice. I love me some sauce, so it was nice to mix in with the rice. And the enchilada was very tasty. I actually could go for one right now... hmmmmm....

So what was wrong? I was bummed about the gauc. It wasn't good. It wasn't bad. It was just lacking seasoning.

I ordered the special of 5 rolled tacos/drink and was really impressed with the moist chicken in the crunchy tacos and so much guacamole (no extra charge !) really fresh lettuce and grated cheese.

Another Nascar 'nut' had a chicken burrito and it was stuffed with meat, another had a combo plate that looked really good, and the boys had tacos.  They managed to find samples of cinnamon topped chips that had them trotting back and forth while our food was being prepared.

We had taken a chance on this little place and were very happy to be eating great fresh food while we watched the slow traffic pass by !

There was a great selection of salads on the menu and also a ""create your own"" option. The pre-set selections covered pretty much every combination under the sun with kale, lettuce, spinach, mixes, toppings from hear to yon, and dressings coming out of your ears. Almost overwhelming, but in a good way.

I settled on the Santa Fe (no meat!) because I like to sweat a little bit when I eat, and it was listed as a ""First Time Favorite"". I can back up that claim. I love a good romaine crunch in my salads, there was a healthy helping of my favorite food (pepperjack cheese), and the corn, avocado, tomatoes, and fried onions were an awesome combo.

Going to dinner on a Saturday evening at 7:30 as a walk in is a BAD idea, unless you hope to get lucky enough to sit the bar which i did (thank goodness). My approach to the hostess for two seats was greeted with ""earliest seating available would be 9:45""...whoa! Seems this place is getting some serious play from the masses and its keeping their reso book filled, good for them! Sitting the bar you are able to be a bit more interactive with the service staff (which i like), and usually leads to a better experience to me personally. Our bar keep was nice enough, making me a mezcal cocktail from the menu that presented better than it tasted. It wasn't bad, i simply would say that it wasn't balanced. My entree was a no brainer, being the carbonara i starred at on Yelp through photos. My response when the dish was set in front of me was ""McDonald's Hamburger"". This of course means that the food served to you never looks like the photos presented. I dug into my dinner hoping that the flavor would overwhelm me and force my return time after time and it was ""Just ok"". My server/bar keep was nice enough but didn't seem overly friendly or interactive, so i felt like this time was a very ""basic"" dining experience. Was anything particularly bad or negative to justify a bad review? I would not say so, and is the reason for the 3 stars.

 I started with the Monkey Business hard shake....dark rum and banana liqueur all blended up with bananas foster and ice cream, topped with THICK, luscious whipped cream and crunchy banana chips.  Kinda like eating dessert first, but is that a bad thing?  I thought not.  There was plenty left over to take home as you not only get the great big glassful with the great big straw, but you also get the metal shake container with all the goodness that didn't fit into the glass.  

The burger!  The Buffaloed Bison burger struck my fancy....and I was not disappointed.  It isn't easy to find a JUICY bison burger - sometimes they can be dry, but this one oozed juices.  I ordered it medium so it was beautifully pink on the inside and crusted and crunchy on the outside.  Perfectly cooked!  Buffalo cheddar and ranch dressing carressed the top of the burger and down the sides.  No bun because of the gluten issue, but the bun was unnecessary - it was perfect just as it was.  

Had the review been based on the burger alone, there would have been a solid 5 stars.  The sides, however, were lackluster.  I had the slaw - eh, I've had better.  It was too fine, too runny and too oniony.  I wish I could have tried the chips or fries, but they don't have a separate fryer for chips and fries from the breaded items.  That's a gluten-free no no.  Please, Burgatory, dedicate a fryer to non-breaded items.  In fact, my dining companions were unimpressed with the chips...maybe a dedicated fryer would improve those?  

The hubby and another diner both had the Morty's Steakhouse burger and raved about it!  Hubster said the cabernet sauce made the burger.  He ate every single last bite.  The rest of the table shared onion rings to start off the meal - they said they were okay.  No raves there.  Our 4th companion had a basic cheeseburger with tomato and said it was an outstanding burger.

The layout here was strange - a lot of open, empty space that could have been filled with tables - and the actual tables shoved into corners. A little bit weird and awkward. We sat down and waited over 10 minutes without a server in sight. My sister actually walked up to the bar to grab us drinks, but came back immediately. The bar area is dark, dingy, and a little sketchy. The vibe back there was just...weird. She didn't feel quite comfortable so we opted to wait, and a few minutes later our waitress came by. Seemed as if she was the only one in the entire place!

We ordered a couple of drinks and they came out quickly. We also noticed that the table next to us ordered food and it looked and smelled amazing! Once we were finished (we were in a rush), she brought us our bill and lo and behold, they don't take debit! We instead paid with credit. While we were standing at the bar to pay, there were a couple of young guys obviously quite intoxicated harassing us. It was really uncomfortable. While our server was processing our payment, my sister commented on how good the food looked and she explained that they made everything from scratch in house, so it takes a bit longer. Something to think about.

I might be back if I'm in the area, but only if I'm not in a rush (and I'll avoid the back bar area).",2013-05-14 14:27:55

Coming from me that means that out of some 80 restaurants this one ties for first place with Asian fusion cafe in Miami -and neither me nor my wallet are easy to satisfy! This review is long because it sums up several meals. It's easy to slam bad restaurants, not so to give proper credit to the good ones.

I'd like to clear up one important issue; fusion actually means mixing the different influences in one dish. What most restaurants do is offer specialties from different cuisines and the correct term for that is Pan-Asian. Malaya is actually a Pan Asian restaurant.. 

I usually laugh when I see people claiming that the food is ""authentic"" but the first and second time we ate there we had an out of town guest from Singapore who spoke with the owner and ordered Malaysian specialties and who told us they were the real McCoy and I'll take his word for it. The thing about authentic exotic cuisine is that means some things that you and I may not be crazy about because it's not made for ""us"". That's what authentic is. Ok, here we go:

Starters:
-Popiah, Malay spring roll with fresh jicama (radish like) cucumber egg and shrimp. $2,95. I HATE spring rolls but we order this one with every meal. 
-Malay roll with fried tofu skin.  don't know how to describe it. Definitely different, I like it but I'm not sure everyone will.
-Roti Telur, our friend liked it but I couldn't get into it
-Tom Yum w/seafood soup. A Thai specialty, the best rendition of this soup I've had in years, New Zealand should copy the recipe.
-Squid salad. A Japanese dish. Our guest loved it. it tasted good but I wasn't so crazy about it.

Entrees:
-Stir fried Okra and beef w. Belacan sauce. I didn't get into it until I asked for more sauce, then it was delish, Turns out the sauce is hot and like all Asian joints in this town they are leery of serving hot food to the locals, But now the owner knows us and we get served the authentic versions.
-Duck Curry, good but no cigar. Then again I've been spoiled by yellow curry duck with minced pork , don't ask.
--Beef Rendang , pungent, great taste certainly more intense than the Indonesian version but given a choice I'd choose the version that Bali Cafe offers. 
Noodles always a big thing in that part of the world 
-Char Kway Teow, pan fried with eggs, sprouts and carrots. Our guest loved them, I found them good but unexciting 
-- Mee Goreng, same but spicy and with scallions and crushed peanuts, That's more like it, we ordered it twice so far.
-Pho Tom - Vietnamese soup with shrimp, served with fresh basil, sprouts and brown sauce on the side. Absolutely excellent and stupid cheap at $9.95 with a bowl large enough for two and plenty of medium shrim. My companion said it could have this or that .... nonsense! I was happy just sipping the broth -which had absorbed all the flavors and smells of all the ingredients- and ignoring the noodles and stuff, Did I say excellent? It's hard not to order every time but hey. Ok it takes second place to a Duck Pho that comes to mind, but mainly it's only because it doesn't have the luscious slices of duck breast.. never mind, that restaurant is 800 miles away.

The owner is Malay, the help is Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and they do a bang up job, plus other than a couple of dishes all the rest is reasonably prices, in fact dirt cheap considering the quality.",2011-10-03 00:20:49

-Vyvv4wc6te04fBpmkbUAg,eRDWzHCldd6YXypRECvHYg,h36qA5gnNTgByhxWx1aH-Q,3,1,0,1,"I had been curious about Rock Lobster for a very long time, but was very apprehensive about dining at one of their establishments because the reviews were all over the place-most being quite negative. So when I saw that they were participating in Summerlicious, I was shocked, and stoked because I would get to try the food for a good price. For $25 you got to choose one appetizer, one main and one dessert from several options. So I gave them a call and made a reservation for 12 people. They had two sitting times (6pm and 8pm), I went with 6pm. Here is what I ordered:

Lobster taco: Not good. The tortilla was cold and hard, and as a result, one could not appreciate, or taste for that matter, the lobster. Such a shame. Lobster is too delicate to pair with a tortilla, specially a cold and hard one at that! I wish I hard ordered the deviled eggs or beet salad. Those two appetizers looked delicious, and those who ordered them, liked them.

Lobster roll: I really liked the lobster roll. The bread was warm, buttery, and soft. A perfect pairing with the creamy pieces of lobster. The chips I could have done without. They tasted burnt and bitter, and some had too much salt on them (the chips were seasoned after they were plated perhaps?)

Dessert: I ordered the daily future which on that evening was a huge chocolate chip cookie sandwich. And damn, it was SWEET! Too sweet. I was only able to have 2 bites (inside the cookie there was another cookie-a Oreo cookie!). Talk about sugar overload. Though I probably would have finished it if I had a glass of milk. Maybe sell this cookie with a glass of milk? Now that is an idea! In terms of the other desserts, people were put off by the deconstructed feel of them and the taste was nothing to rave about.

The consensus was that if we had to rate our dinner out of 10, we would give it a 6/10. The dishes were a hit or miss, and although we loved some dishes, others completely missed the mark. I am really glad I got to experience dinner at Rock Lobster during Summerlicious because there is no way that I would pay the regular price for any of these items.

WAIT! Now that I think about it, $25 was not much of a deal since the dessert would have been $6, the lobster roll $14 and the lobster taco $5. Argh, I got gypped! Sigh.",2014-09-28 19:16:44

My standards for movies rental places have always been Vidiots in Santa Monica or Old Bank DVD in downtown LA, but this place has etched a new spot on that list. Since moving back to Phoenix, I tend to get movies from the Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library downtown. I know it's a public library, but it actually has an awesome and extensive collection of foreign films and just about a every title from the Criterion Collection you can feast your cineaste eyeballs on. 

Anyway, I was browsing the foreign section and was pretty impressed. It wasn't the usual, pitiful selection most rental places usually have that pretty much is made up of The Seventh Seal, Seven Samurai, maybe a French title, and an overload of pre-Loaded Weapon 4 Jet Li martial arts films. No, sir. While it's not as big as the stock at the downtown library, it's still pretty good and they have alot of recent films.

What sold me was when I was wandering around the store. I came across something that I normally haven't found in any video store: Russ Meyer films. If you have never seen ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"", I suggest you scrap any plans you have tonight, break up with your significant other if necessary, go here, and rent it immediately. Buying a copy of a Russ Meyer films is ludicrous process that is both arduous and expensive, but you can just go in here and rent them.

Along with that, you can find just about any cult film you're looking for and probably find titles you've never heard of or seen, like I did. There's literally a whole wall that's just labeled ""CULT FILMS"". I dropped in here last night for the first time and rented a copy of Russ Meyer's ""Vixen"" and a title that I had seen in Amoeba but never watched called ""A Boy and His Dog"". It's a film about Don Johnson (yes, of Miami Vice) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world with his telepathic dog and fighting off a cult of underground humans led by Jason Robards in clown, drag make-up. Need I say more?

If you're looking for a hard-to-find title, or even a popular one, drop in here and keep this place alive. When you have an itch for a film right away that can't wait for Netflix, as I do on regular occasions, this spot will be sure to please.

If you have any taste in film, I repeat.... GO HERE TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!",2009-03-11 23:29:10

We saw this restaurant featured in Toronto Life so my friends and I knew this would be the next spot we would try as well as celebrating our BFF's Birthday. We arrived around 6:30pm and the patio and inside were pretty full. Luckily some people were leaving so we were able to grab a spot.  The style is you order ahead, and take a number and they bring the food to you hence there are no reservations, first come first serve type of place. 

We thought they had a BBQ platter based on all the pics we've seen on Yelp, but really it's people ordering a bunch of stuff and they placed it on one platter. We wanted to try it all so we pretty much ordered everything on the menu lol. What I will recommend is Brisket - melt in your mouth and so good. Took some leftovers to work the next day and folks were coming to my desk to see what I had. It came with onions, jalapeños and 2 slices of white bread. I wish they could up their bread game with a bun or something but white bread was still fine. If you like some chicken, it was so juicy and flavourful. We also ordered a full rack of ribs but they aren't fall off the bone kind of ribs. But again, packed with flavour and really good. The Cherry Mac burger was absolutely amazing. Seriously one of the best burgers I've had. Everything is pretty much a hit on their menu. For the sides we tried Mac and cheese, beans - to die for, this is a must get side, potato salad, coleslaw and home fries. I liked all the sides minus the coleslaw. It's a vinegar type coleslaw, it's good but it wasn't memorable for me. 

For drinks we tried the root beer float (forgot the official name). Really good. Lots of beers and good selection of drinks. Service was amazing. People came by to grab our empty trays, owners came by to check up on us. There are also 2 bars - one on the patio and one inside so that is super convenient!

Special shout out to their DJ. He played the best tunes during dinner. Kind of a throwback for a few of us. 

We'll definitely be back. Sad to say I want this gem to be hidden so it's not packed every time I go, but the lines are starting to go out the door during their peak times so come early!

When we stood by the counter, a cashier (girl with green-painted fingernails) just stood behind her register, as if waiting for us to approach. When I approached the counter, she slid a broken table sign across the counter. No ""Hello"". No ""Can I help you?"" None of that. Just a face that said, ""Give me your damn order d***wad!"" So ... that's what I did. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't clear on the sandwich bread order and daringly asked her to repeat them. She asked, ""Got that?"" I said, ""No."" Now I was just testing her because she was irritable. Eventually, our order was filled. 

The good news is that my turkey sandwich on baguette was lukewarm and tasted good (could have been warmer) yet not very large. The sugar cookie was awesome as usual.

The menu is identical to other Chatime locations. 
Let's start off with all the positives: 
  - super friendly staff 
  - excellent location
  - spacious sitting areas
  - not as busy/crowded as the one near Dundas/Yonge
  - consistent menu as other locations 

The store has been here for a little while, however it seems like they still haven't ""settled"" in. A few negative things with today visit:
- drink of the month (wintermelon mousse) wasn't available as they don't have mousse, but they couldn't substitute it another drink. But there's big signs advertising for drink of the month everywhere.

- vicinity card system still doesn't work; cashier scanned it a few times and still didn't work. Cashier told me it ""worked"" but I knew the point wasnt added.

- they still don't have any napkins seriously. Napkins are kinda like the essential for a restaurant business IMO. The cashier was apologetic and quickly ran to get us some brown paper towel to use instead.

- they are understaffed. It was fairly busy today but there were only two staff working which meant the wait was longer. I honestly feel bad for those two as they worked non stop. 

Overall, I would have given it 1-2 stars if it wasn't for the friendly staff that served us today. I am a fan of Chatime and have been to different locations many times and it had always been pleasant experiences in the past.
I hope  Chatime management at this location will look into addressing these issues. I will give this location another try when I am in the area the next time. Hoepfully by then everything will be smooth.",2015-09-26 23:24:35

I used to hate coming here because the equipment was old and the facilities were a bit on the tired side.  Then they closed it for a bit and what reemerged is one of the nicest 24 Hour clubs you'll find.  Its like dating a girl who has packed on a couple lbs over the years and then she decides to lose the weight and when you see the results you remember why you first fell for her.  

Im such a sucker for small and relatively inconsequential things but I LOVE that they now provide towels.  Not only does that save me having to remember mine, but it makes the whole facility that much more hygienic.  The new locker rooms are comfortable, spacious and well appointed.   I also am a big fan of the layout upstairs with the free weights, machine circuit and cardio equipment.  There are a lot of new machines here which makes a HUGE difference.  I mean you can tell when working out on a 8 year old elliptical just like you can tell the difference between a brand new BMW and 1989 Oldsmobile.  The pool facilities are more than sufficient and like another Yelper commented, the Jacuzzi tub is huge so you don't feel like people are sitting right on your lap.  A huge plus for these types of communal gym spas.  

The classes are always crowded from the looks of it although I have yet to participate in any of them. Staff is friendly and unobtrusive which I like.  The basketball court is a bit confining which is a small drawback but other than that, for the price, this club has got it going on.

I am a typical guy (read:slob) and yet I have some ridiculous idiosyncracies.  Like books.  I love new books.  When I read them I barely open them so that the spine doesn't get all cracked.  I don't write in the book.  I actually use a bookmark.

But since indigence has shunted me down a few rungs on the socioeconomic ladder to the caste of the untouchables, I find myself open to new things.  By new things, I mean old things.  Like ratty books.

So my wife and I have a ridiculous amount of books at home, because I want you to come into my home and think I'm smart.  Plus, we were both humanities majors, so we have a really strange assortment of books about totalitarianism, eastern european feminist writings, italian-immigration stories, you name it.

So we brought in six grocery bags of books.  Here's what we learned.
-don't look for cash.  they'll offer it to you but it's roughly 15% or less of what they'll offer in trade.
-they pretty much don't take hardbacks.
-they look for weird books, which surprised me.  super-popular books are usually overstocked there.
-they want plays
-they want books they've never heard of
-if you let one person look through your books, sometimes another buyer there will buy a few of the other buyer's rejects.
-the books that are there for purchase have little prices written in pencil on the first page.

And while the prospect of in-store credit may make you cringe, they have a ton of possibilities.  dvds, cds, even records!  and lots of books.  old magazines.  you can definitely spend money there.

it is, admittedly, a bit ghetto.  but we're in a recession, right?  and on your dying bed, will you really care if the book you bought had already been read?",2009-08-19 22:58:48

It was busy for brunch at noon and it's always feels good that the local family business is making it.  The owner Melanie was present as always to over see the quality & service.  Her husband is the chef.

Our order:

Newfoundland Eggs Bene,
**two perfectly cooked poached eggs sitting a top Cod Fish Cakes in lieu of english muffins with very lemony hollaindaise.  fresh berries and fried potatoes.  the fish cakes don't have enough fish taste on them (some people may like that) .  I would recommend this dish to anyone.  Very satisfying.

Bistro Burger with soup of the day (Potato Leek)
**the burger was  too salty and the garlic was  overwhelming but the soup was piping hot and would have a big bowl anytime.

One thing about Melanie's that is a bit depressing is the decor.  It's not  hip or modern it's upscale cafeteria.   Although it was busy the ambiance was lacking.  That's not going to keep us away but it's worth noting.

The service  is excellent!!!

I also loaded up on the shrimp tempura which was excellent. The only nitpick I have and I think its a valid one is the fact that the food isn't labeled. For example theirs a row of California rolls. But no label or name in front of it to signify that. I love sushi but I'm not a sushiologist so a lot of times I was just grabbing stuff hoping it tasted good based on it's appearance.

Came here to dine on a Saturday evening and found the restaurant to be less busy than anticipated, surprising for an upscale restaurant in Toronto. 

They interior was beautiful - dimly let and plenty of space between tables and our service was great. Our server was funny, attentive and knowledgeable with the menu. 

Highlights form some of the dishes we tried: 
- Tuna pizza: one of our favourites from the night; thinly sliced tuna on a cracker with truffle oil (yum!)
-  Wagyu tacos: although tasty, I found the presentation a bit odd. The wagyu was grounded making it difficult to assess the quality of the beef. If it was real Japanese wagyu, it seems a bit silly to dice such a high quality meat
- Protein roll: a different spin on a maki, this roll had no rice
- Uni & scallop sushi: this will be the reason I come back. The uni and scallop are amongst the largest and highest quality i've had in Toronto
- Seared scallops: we found the scallops to be a bit overcooked, you could skip this one

The meat quality is alright. I ordered the Korean Prime Kalbi, Prime Kalbi, and Harami Miso which looked amazing, but it was the ultimate blue ball. They were well marbled which I loved, but it was surprisingly tough... what a disappointment. The beef looked to be on par with that of Magal Korean BBQ, but when you bite into it, you can tell that there is a huge difference in quality. The banchan here was surprisingly good, but the bibim nangmyun was not quite where I wanted it to be. They need to put less chilled broth in it because it was almost indistinguishable from mul nangmyun. 

The only redeeming quality of this place is the price. I ordered 3 plates of beef and an order of Bibim Nangmyun and it came out to roughly $50 with tax and tip. If I were to order the same stuff at Magal, it would be roughly $80 to $90.

All in all, this is a so-so korean bbq spot that made me reminiscent of home, but it was nothing spectacular. The service is good, but the beef quality is forgettable.

Friday 4:00pm-11:00pm
Saturday and Sunday 6:00am-5:00pm

By noon my skin was melting and we got there at 10am.  If you have kids, there's an area for children to play in with rides and snacks.  And parents, you'll probably find beers stands in that area as well.  If you're not in the mood to dig and hunt, go and have lunch and listen to the live music.  Food is pretty decent and there's different vendors serving up a storm.  There's a huge lot for parking and this place fills up pretty fast.  However, people are leaving as they are coming so there shouldn't be too long of a wait for parking.",2017-03-16 23:36:53

What, you say you smell another Susan D. concert review?  Your olfactory senses are quite correct my Yelp music friends!  

If you're like me you basically know the Tom Tom Club on the strength of their biggest (only) hit single, ""Genius of Love"".  You're also aware that the two main members of this group, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth are husband and wife and they were key members of Talking Heads.  In my case, my initial exposure to Tom Tom Club and Talking Heads came from the movie ""Stop Making Sense"".  (Tom Tom Club would take the stage in order to allow David Byrne to do a costume change).  I remember watching it with my brother and my dad and in fact Tina Weymouth was my inspiration.  I looked at her play that bass and I thought ""Hey, I could do that!""  I've still got that beat-up, dog-eared ol' VHS copy and yes it still plays well.

They waited until the middle of their set to play ""Genius of Love"", instead jamming on some of their more obscure material.  No matter, the audience appeared to be enjoying it.  I know Lisa and I were.  Of course when they did play ""Genius"" (which they dedicated to Andy Warhol), EVERYBODY got up and danced, inlcuding me and Lisa.  Oh and they gave us a few funky cover tunes too including ""You Sexy Thing"" (gotta dance to that one too), the Al Green version of ""Take Me to the River"", and ""Psycho Killer""!

Tom Tom Club always has been a funk/groove band and that they honed their chops well in Talking Heads really served them well.  I've got to admit that Tina Weymouth still looks great at age 60(?) and Chris Frantz always looked like a friendly Irish cop.  

But it's so refreshing to see a band like this that at least acts like they want to be here instead of those who are still slogging along (ahem, Beach Boys--what's left of them) or those doing it strictly for the money even though they despise one another (double ahem, The Police).",2011-06-06 15:23:24
enWiYe5Mesd3ee4wXG9k6g,xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,3,0,0,0,"Went here yesterday for lunch. Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge. 

I overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.  If I am going to get a hamburger and it's not high end then I am an In-N-Out girl because, hey, that's what a hamburger's all about... but I digress. 

I went to MTO once before, about six months ago, and remember getting the salmon wrap. Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting. 

As a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of ""cheap"" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR? Anyway, long story short - okay to try but don't get the salmon burger unless you are in the mood for a patty that has the moisture of the Sahara desert and expect to pay a premium for pretty much anything.",2014-02-28 17:41:43

The communal tables are large enough that you can get cozy with and not have to fight for elbow room with strangers. Large windows give a really nice view of King Street if you'd like to people watch but you can just as easily shimmy to the southern end of the restaurant and stare at the kitchen.

I enjoyed the presentation of the beer taps at the bar. Someone has placed little kid style fridge magnet letters to indicate which brew is which because all of the taps are mounted on a sheet metal wall behind the bar. It's a neat design feature. Their list of beers is good but I think they could stand to lose one or two things. Church key and Hacker Pschorr are great but I was less than excited about seeing a $7 MGD and $10 for a litre of PBR but hey who am I to under estimate the poor drinking choices of others.

Our food was great. I had the bison, duck and fowl with an order of the duck frites. Delicious. All of it. My one concern was the sauces and I can't remember which ones I had unfortunately, but I didn't like any of them. There are three types of mustard and a ketchup at each table that were quite good if you're not interested in the sauces on the menu.

I would contest the idea that this is a ""hipster"" establishment for the simple reason that there was a wide variety of people there. A group of dentists were celebrating the launch of their website while a film shoot wrap party happened three tables over. Parents and children wearing baseball uniforms were scattered around after a Jays game and three stereotypical I.T. nerds sat at the table beside me. I only mention this because so many people seem to cringe at the suggestion that they've ended up in a hipster bar/restaurant/store/whatever and I would really like to see this place do well.

My only critisism would be the location, it is rather run down in appearance and extremely small offering next to no seating minus the few parking benches scattered in front. There is ample parking but sitting in a drab parking lot eating these scrumptious delights doesn't sit entirely right with me.
They also only accept cash but offer an ATM located at the side of the building which I personally found a little strange for some reason and added to the ""run down"" feel of the place

The interior is beautiful as well.I ended up getting the Avocado and Tomato Torta, which was excellent. My only complaint about it (& others complained about this with their burgers) was that the thing was just too big to pick up and take a bite out of. Trying to cut it and eat it was kind of difficult too. They also had some really awesome sweet potato fries. Visiting the website I found this:
 ""On the third Wednesday of each month, Kaya presents a seasonal vegetarian prix fixe dinner. The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible. Menu items are also available a la carte.""

We dined in for lunch, and were one of the first of the day. I didn't have any expectations of this place, except that I hoped for $25 it would be decent. They completely surpassed my expectations. Sushi is one of my favorite things to eat, but living the midwest I am limited in the places that have good quality fish, I am usually paying $25 for 2 great rolls at a legit place. So to pay $25 for all you can eat (affectionately dubbed ACYE), I was pretty much in Heaven.

We mainly stuck with Nigiri, and only did a few rolls and apps. I think we ate 15 orders of 2pc Nigiri each!!! The selection of fish is outstanding, and they will even let you order some of the more expensive cuts (toro etc) at least 2 times per person. I consider that pretty generous. Their ""signature"" sauce here was a garlic ponzu, and while it was mighty tasty on the first few orders, it got old really fast. You can ask for the fish and the rice plain for any of the nigiri, which we started doing after a couple of orders. The fish are a nice cut, and thick too. They aren't skimping on you here. They also have hand roll, maki, and baked rolls but we wanted to keep it simple that day.

Definitely recommended as an excursion off the strip if you love sushi and basic Japanese apps (agadashi tofu, kaarage etc). Also it was conveniently located next to a Target if you need to load up on anything while on your trip.

it was a large bowl of watery brown tasteless mushroom laden gravy with floating noodles, and just cooked medium rare sirloin piled on top. 

What happened to the sour cream, seasonings and cooking the beef in the gravy? Honestly I think the chef was so busy with the fried chicken, that a non chef cooked my meal.  I like medium rare steak but not in my stroganoff. I did not complain, I simply packed it up and will doctor it up to my taste,for dinner here at home  I hate to waste good ingredients. 

Yes we will go back as they have great hamburgers, great fried chicken,great fish and chips and fried green tomatoes.

We both agreed that our pasta course was the best one. The handmade noodles were a standout with the meat sauce. While we waited for our appetizers, we were given bread with a olive oil/olive tapenade that was tasty. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the service was a tad bit on the slow side.

And no real apology for it.  2.5 hours for dinner at a casual joint is just tooooooo lonnnnnggg.   Especially with a kid in tow. 

I'd heard good things about Otro, and with the family asking for Mexican near their resort, this sounded like a good spot to try.  It was Saturday night, 730pm and I was met with a 45 minute wait for a 4-top table... wow.  Okay.  Probably similar to the rest of town.  We were sat right about at the 45 minute mark. Great! So we sit with our menus discussing how yummy everything looks... and discussing, and discussing, and looking at the drink menu, and discussing.... Maybe 10-12 minutes goes by and a server finally makes her way over.  She takes our drink order and we also order the child's meal and drink (best to feed kids stat).  We go back to the menu and chatting.  Server comes back a good 7-8 minutes later with drinks ready to take our order. Forgot the kid's milk, so we reminded her.  We skip appetizers due to having already waited an hour, and just get right to ordering the entrees.  Ordering goes off without a hitch and the server goes to place the order .... Or so we thought? Approx 30 minutes goes by and the server appears with food ... Not our food though. She doesn't drop it, she instead goes to the correct table after staring at it quite puzzled. Another 15 minutes... Still no food.  She comes by and says it should be right out.  The manager comes over and says ""the kitchen got backed up"" ... This was just not true.  We watched 2 other tables and people who came in after us at the bar get their food before we did.  Finally one dish comes out and they bring 2 of our rice sides (probably just to put some food in front of us). Couple mins later the last 2 entrees appear ... About few more minutes later the last 2 sides of beans arrive.  I forgot I was even waiting on beans.  It was 930 by now and we were all pretty tired.  Its too bad they got all screwed up, because the food was good.  But all we could wonder was what really happened with our order?  You would think they'd offer us a dessert or round of drinks, but it was pretty unapologetic. Front of the house blamed the back of the house, and that's pretty crappy.  Questionable whether I'd return or recommend Otro.

Livermore was famed for making and losing multi-million dollar fortunes and short selling during the stock market crashes in 1907 and 1929.

One highlight is the delicious Crostini that come in 5 different varieties.  The drinks are made using old school techniques, they don't use any shortcuts, and they are all high quality.

The extreme saltiness overpowers the flavor of the chicken. Also, as one of the reviewers mentioned, it's as if they never had a piece of chicken a day in their lives.....let alone know how to cook it.   The chicken was not the nice golden brown color that we expect nor was it crispy.

Today I ordered the 3-egg breakfast. I'm trying to make lifestyle changes so ordered it with a side of brown toast (no butter) and tomatoes. I wish I was young again so I could enjoy it like how I used to (eggs, peameal, home fries and gravy). 

The eggs were tasty and fresh. Bright yolks proved that point. In all honestly, the eggs were a tiny bit over cooked, but I'd still call them over medium as ordered. 

Tomatoes were served raw. I garnished them with some pepper. They were fresh and ripe. 

The toast was just the run of the mill bagged bread. Nothing to write home about. 

All in all a good breakfast, however, for this healthy version, I think it's a bit over priced. The standard breakfast comes with meat so when you substitute tomatoes for bacon/sausage, there needs to be a break for the customer. 

Also, a lot of diner such as this will still include home fires when you don't order meat and substitute tomatoes. This place does not do that. 

It would be a nice touch to add a 'light' breakfast at a discounted rate. I know it may not be their bread and butter but economically, it makes sense for both the consumer and operator.",2017-04-09 05:55:13

My lovely sister and I came here to be pampered-- she treated us both to a mani/pedi.  She kept telling me to get flowers on my big toes.  I balked at the extra fee ($5 per toe?  Perhaps it was just an extra $5.)  Had I known that these were going to look so cute, I'd have let her spring for the extra cost!  

Thought I'd include a pic of her lovely doggies!  After such an enjoyable 90 minutes of pampering at My Bella, ours certainly weren't barking!

First off the Restrooms in here are delightful. There are 2, they are large, and nice and clean.
The parking is a little tricky if you don't know the neighborhood. Best parking is around the back. You have to turn down a side street to get to it. Follow the parking for George and Dragon, that makes it easier.

I met a friend here for lunch. While I had parked around the back, she does not know the area that well and ended up parking far away.  But, we came after the lunch crowd, I think it was around 2 so it was not very busy.
However ,we did wait a long time for our check and such. Anyway, when I first arrived there was a delightful young man who was so helpful and friendly. I told him I had never been before. So he was kind enough to explain everything to me. About ordering ,where did I want to sit, the food, etc.
However, he was through with his shift so we had a different waiter. Still good though.
Lunch is a reasonable price. However, I do not recommend if you are in a hurry. Such as your lunch break. It takes a long time to get your food.
For lunch all you can get is Noodle bowls. Though you have many noodles types to choose from , as well as different meats or Shrimp. As well as you may add vegetables to it as well as your own type of broth.
It was very good, and everything tasted extremely fresh!

We told him that it was our first visit, so he gave us a menu to look over, and he left for several more minutes. He had told us to blink our headlights when we were ready to order, so we did. He came running back. We ordered the Hamburg with Everything, the Galley Boy double cheeseburg with sauces, onion rings, potato puffs (tater tots), and milkshakes. The food tasted a bit better than McDonald's food, but it was still ordinary and cost twice as much. I did get a kick out of sitting in my car and watching the servers run around.

Upon arrival and seeing it was an empty, clean, hole in the wall with food hidden in containers instead of displayed, I was a bit hesitant and was disappointed the chicken's not made fresh per order.  The sides looked as if it might be bland.

I ordered the 1/2 chicken combo with oven Parisian potatoes, broccoli/rapini, and rice.  Luckily, before I left I asked if there was peri peri sauce or I would have been unamused since I didn't know it was not in the bag.  The young girl was friendly and patient too.

I microwaved half the portion at home and to my pleasant surprise, the food was really tasty!  Even the simple looking potatoes were yummy!  My only complaints are that I had to ask for the peri peri sauce and that I wasn't prepared for it to be firey hot although tolerable because after the spice hits it dissipates.  The food is enough for 2 meals (I'm a big eater!)!

BTW, this place wins!  My regular place that's currently shutdown due to road construction cooks chicken fresh per each order and they even charcoal grill Parisian potatoes instead of oven bake and their peri peri sauce comes in mild or spicy.  Although the portion's decent, it's not as huge as here (their vegetable sides are disappointing).  Both places are tasty in slightly different ways.  However, service is way friendlier at Alex Rei Dos Leitoes, you get way more food here, and I love their healthy greens so this place wins!

Absolutely delicious thai food. Just about everything on the menu could be substituted with tofu or made without eggs. 

Appetizers: Vegetable spring rolls and tofu spinach potstickers. 
Spring rolls were heavenly. I didn't enjoy the potstickers as much; they were too bland for my taste.

Main Course: Jalapeno fried rice (substituted sausage for fried tofu), pad thai with fried tofu, and bombay curry with fried tofu.
I'm not a fried rice person but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. Pad thai was just as delicious, and the Bombay curry had a very unique flavor. It was almost like a panang curry but better. I ordered everything at medium spicy, and it was perfect for me. I have a low-medium spice tolerance. They bring you a thai hot sauce if you need the extra kick!

I really liked that they had small and large portions. I ordered everything large portioned, and it was more than enough food for 4 people to share. Pretty sure I have leftovers for the next three days.

Kung Pao Chicken: did have some good flavors, we requested a 8/10 in the spice level but it was probably less. It was still good but not worth coming back for in my opinion.

Sizzling Shrimp Plate: All of it tasted like it was probably steamed for a few seconds then maybe sautéed after in a very flavorless sauce. It was undercooked and almost raw, lacked flavor, and the faux shrimp had an odd texture.

The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm.

We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.  

GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to.

BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day.

Food quality is above a Denny's, Coco's,Blueberry Hill, IHOP,  and most eateries in this category. The portions are very generous, and the quality of the ingredients is very good. 

However, as the saying goes, ""You Get What You Pay For"", and in this case, they are bit pricey.

Other than ""sides"", or just having something like Coffee, you can't order almost anything on the Menu, less than $10. That includes a basic breakfast, or a meal quality sandwich. 

The servers are good, and aim to please. 

Bottom line; skip Blueberry Hill and find one of these Diners. You might spend a dollar or two more on your meal, but the portions, quality, and service, are worth the extra money. Only real drawback, is they close at 10 PM, so that excludes them from late night and early morning meals.

While portions are still large, the quality has gone down.  The beef was not as good quality and it was cut improperly (with the grain instead of against and too thick) so it was very tough and hard to bite through and chew.  It still tasted good, although they were very stingy with the lettuce, but because of the tough meat it was not as enjoyable.  Also the service was terribly slow for a fast food place.  We ordered at 1:14 and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant plus an employee on lunch break, and it took 20 minutes to finally get our food. They seem to be struggling a bit if the lack of customers during lunch rush on a Monday and the lower quality of ingredients was any indication.",2016-02-01 19:27:09

Ordered a gateau basque (custard was OK, but not that much the crust), a lemon tart, and an orange blondie to go. I did not like the lemon layer, too acidic and gelly; the crust was not so bad in itself, but was on the frozen side and made up 2/3rds of the thickness of the square.

So,  where to begin... I had called ahead to make an appt and get pricing. When I arrived the front desk person was less than personable. They had me pick out my polish I decided to upgrade to the gel polish. Which over the phone I was told was a $10 difference. So a full set I was told would be $35 plus $10 for gel polish. I was told $5 for nail art on 2 fingers and only $10 for all 10 nails....which I was then charged diff plus $30 for pedicure. I paid over $100 when all.was said an done. They would not add a tip to my card. I had no cash and was leaving out of town the next morning. Their ATM fee for my bank was over $10!
 well the basic pedicure was ok  Nothing amazing... the place I usually go uses hot stones and removes calluses for less cost. 
I disscussed via phone then again in person that I needed specific nail art for a themed wedding I was attending. I was assured it would be taken care of. Needless to say the art.was subpar.  She could not do what I asked...the polish itself looked nothing like either of the pictures I showed her. It was very amateur. The lady was nice but the job done was not the best. 
Also nails have already begun falling off...it will have been 2wks tomorrow!! Usually I can get 3.5-4weeks out of a good set. The nails are not uniform or as coffin shaped as requested.

It's located not too far from my house so I'm slowly making my way through their menu, but can honestly say that the chicken karaage sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The chicken is crispy and moist, and the sauce (basically a spicy/sriracha mayo) is heaven. I've also tried the beef and kimchi sandwich which was also great, but I still prefer the karaage.

For milkshakes (three of the best milkshakes I've ever had), I tried the Oreo, tiramisu, and chocolate brownie. I think the tiramisu has been my favourite, with the Oreo coming a close second.

Gcckqd0ZQfOrvyoOZaDoXQ,MylxjEKiTeaWb-GAaPA-zA,kbUAnpn0QoDWRqFOA_oWMA,5,5,1,5,"TO Food Fest happened again this summer and finally, my summer travel plans didn't conflict with this wonderful gem; and despite our horrific summer this year, boy, I was glad I was in Toronto that day!  

TO Food Fest is still relatively new and so there aren't a lot of vendors and I personally feel that the Taste of Danforth stole their thunder just a little bit that weekend.  However, it is cute, small, and while there is a constant flow of visitors, you don't feel like you're going to be squished by other sweaty humans and subsequently die.  

Most importantly, this event is for a wonderful cause and your $2 admission fee/non-perishable item goes towards Second Harvest.  

Here are some of my most favourite and notable places: 

1) Gushi Japanaese Street Food - Fried chicken on a skewer with DELICIOUS sauce.  You have a choice between spicy mayo, sweet chili, or tetsuya sauce (a citrus-y, vinaigrett-y sauce).  FANTASTIC.  I loved loved LOVED their chicken.  Despite the chicken being dipped into that vinegar-y sauce, it didn't become soggy.  I can definitely see why there was a huge long line for this!

2) Mamak Satay - We had pork, beef, and chicken skewers.  The peanut sauce was good but I think the meat actually even tasted quite good without the sauce too!  

3) Grilled Squid - Unfortunately, I have no idea and have completely forgotten the name of this great squid place.  If you like grilled squid, this was definitely a place that perfected it.  As a ""not-so-big"" squid fan (my friend wanted it), I did thoroughly enjoy it and that's saying a lot.  The seasoning they use is pleasantly spicy.  

4) Marathon HK Milk Tea - Now they sell their milk tea in jugs!  It wasn't too busy when I went in and there was a deal going on where you got 2 iced-milk teas for $5.  I love their milk tea for the creaminess and the fact that despite how strong milk tea is, the cream masks the tannins.  But you don't get that gross after-taste you get from drinking coffee with too much cream.  Overall - excellent!  This gem is located in Scarborough on Finch & Midland. 

And last but certainly not least...

5) Babi&Co ***MY FAVOURITE*** - I don't even know where to start with this one except for the fact that there are 3 simple words to describe this place...BRILLIANT, DELICIOUS, ADDICTING!  I really wish they didn't just show up in food fairs as it would be so lovely for them to actually have a food truck or a restaurant.  As a matter of fact, I'd venture to them as often as I could if they did!  Their pork satays were so delicious and tender and the pickled cucumbers on the side really complimented the satays well.  I also had the opportunity to try the ""Babi on a Bun"".  OH MY GOSH - for a good 10 seconds of enjoying this bun, I thought I was in heaven.  This is a MUST TRY for any of you who ever encounter Babi&Co.  This was definitely my most favourite vendor in all of TO Food Fest.  The family who ran this place were friendly as can be and their food was delicious.  If they were the only place that existed at TO Food Fest, I'd still go!",2014-08-13 13:01:19

The Mediterranean and avocado, egg white & spinach breakfast sandwiches are tasty and super filling. Boxed lunch combos are also delicious and very filling, doubling up as leftovers. Coffee is good too.

One thing that really surprised me was the price of everything. Sucks when you're a penny pinching college student who's hungry as hell. Regardless i asked for a chicken tandoori. The cook was handling my order and recommended i get the day's special instead which was only 13.95. Being hungry i didn't care and the faster i can pay results in the faster my food arrived.

Chicken...Special (13.95)
I'd never thought i'd be using this word to describe Indian food but here it goes, This dish was a bit bland at first. Not bland as in lacking flavor, it had plenty of that. A few heavy pinches of kosher salt fixed it right up. No clue what it was called but it was hardy with a rich flavorful sauce, large cuts of tomatoes, onions, and the deboned chicken. 

Garlic Nan
Very strong garlic presence. nice and coarse hunks of garlic on top of the nan. Could have been crispier. It was a bit soggy but could have been from the to go bag.

Overall this place is pretty good and with it's close location it can easily become a regular for me. From 11am - 2pm is their lunch specials and dishes are advertised at or around 6 dollars.",2008-05-21 07:25:08

I only got my car after I asked how much longer it would be. The windows were so streaky and every single door handle had smudges on it. There is a giant greasy handprint on one of my seats. When I brought this all to their attention, the excuse was that they *would've* taken care of all that, but I seemed to be in a hurry. The guy gave my windshield the once-over with a dirty rag and asked me, ""is that good enough for you now?"" NO, actually. The manager told me to come back later, and they would make it right. When I went back, they sent two kids over to my car with spray bottles and they kind-of wiped down the streaks.

I have been here a few times. Check the check-ins. Flag it anyway because we all know you're a flagging troll.

Each and every time I have patronised or tried to patronise this establishment I have had problems. Each and every time. Each and every time. 

Frankly, I am tired of it. 

After the first couple of times, I figured that I would just give up. I am no quitter; however, this Foxtail Pool Club (FPC) is a true, bonafide, monumental failure. Therefore, it could be argued that the patron is not the one giving up ... it's FPC which is not even worthy of one's effort in parking and walking to its doors. 

Just Say No to FPC. 

When Matt & Kim announced their Las Vegas stop, it was unfortunate that the FPC would play host for it. I knew there would be problems. I just knew it. 

On that date, it was windy. It was very windy. So, FPC cancelled the show. They cancelled it after M&K fans had waited for hours outside. Hours. They cancelled it and did not announce it to anyone. Let me repeat that: They cancelled it and left paying patrons -- some of which had travelled from other U.S. states -- outside with no update on anything. Social media platforms were the first to alert those queuing outside and it was not until FPC or SLS staff were confronted that they even informed anyone. 

In the meantime, several miles away on the same World Famous Las Vegas Strip -- and also coincidentally a pool show -- a concert went on as scheduled. I know because I called to see if it was still taking place ""rain or shine"" like outdoor shows are supposed to (they said yes) and I also attended it. It was a great show and the wind was not a problem (there was no rain). 

For the kickoff Grills & Guitars event (also LIB), they outdid themselves with their preposterous nightclub tactics and queue antics of not letting anyone in at the time doors were scheduled for, then allowing a mere trickle in order to manufacture a monumental, unnecessary queue that stretched and swung around the SLS floor and stairs, unto more floor and nearly reaching the east garage door. Why? Who knows. They're a one-star establishment, that is why.

       - Service Buttons - I love places with the service buttons. This one has 3 (Bill, Water, Service), so you don't have to try to flag someone down when you need help. They come to you.
       - Decor - Granite table tops, glass dividers, new and fancy grills. This is a way better date place.
       - Price - They are a lot pricier than other places for Dinner ($17.99 Tofu Hut) and their Lunch cuts out a lot of the good meats. With that said, it does seem the quality of meat is higher here.
       - Quality - The quality of meat is a lot higher than many of the other places. With the exception of how the beef brisket was marbled, the marbling on the other meats were really great.
       - Grill - They use the circular grill like at Honey Pig. I think I prefer it over the rectangular ones since it lets the fatty meats you put on there first coat the grill. easier.
       - Presentation of Meat - I like how they place all the meats on one plate for you instead of giving you multiple plates. It saves on the space and looks really nice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/woonam-jung-las-vegas?select=mOHA27w4OjYu9GKKR_UejQ#mOHA27w4OjYu9GKKR_UejQ).
       - Service - We came for lunch, but got the dinner AYCE. They put the meat on the grill for you when they bring the plate of meat and change the grill out for us without us asking when the marinated meats charred the grill.
       - Tofu Hut Comparison - Tofu Hut is a lot cheaper, but it also looks worse and the marbling on the meat fluctuates between very good and terrible even on the same visit. I'd say it's a toss up between that place and this depending on how much you want to spend.
**Price**
       - $17.99 Lunch
       - $27.99 Dinner
**Ordered**
       - Marinated Beef Short Ribs - They sere the beef with the bone still on the end. 
       - Rib Eye Beef - It came out as just as slab of unmarinated steak. Cooking it on the grill, it gets tough/dry quick and didn't have flavor. Maybe I'm not adding some sauce to it I should of.
       - Beef Brisket - Not really marbled well, just had a lot of parts with fat. The parts without fat were a little dry.
       - Beef Tongue - This was marbled perfectly. We got 3 helpings of this.

Ordered one of the novel ""super"" beef burritos, tamales, quesadilla, and rice/beans.  

The super burro lives up to its name for sure.  My memory is that it was filled with shredded beef, beans, lettuce, and green sauce.  My error was expecting ground beef - my mistake.  It was large enough for two people and worth the added $2.00, even if you just want the novel experience.

Wife enjoyed the tamales in spite of the tamales being covered in enchilada sauce.  Have you ever had tamales swimming in enchilada sauce?

Beans were awesome!  Rice was bland - not bad - just too simple.

Quesadilla was ok.   However, I reheated it at home which, as you know, makes it taste different.

Spent $25 for ""to go"" food and did not receive chips/salsa.  Bunk.  Cmon people in PHX, stop charging for chips and salsa when the meal exceeds $5.00. Why are restaurants playing poor when it comes to chips & salsa? The rice and bean sides are $1.99 for (what I feel) was 4 ounces.  So they sell beans @ $8.00 per lb.  Clearly, your margins are high on these orders - bone up some chips already and stop playing poor.

BTW, $8.00 per lb. is more than the cost of Carne Asada at most local carnicerias.

Food-Antipasta missed the mark. Shredded lettuce and very thinly cut meat, which lacked solid flavor. We tried three pizzas. The Italian was okay but not as good as I thought it would be. The Tuscan was also just okay. I was so excited to see this pizza on the menu given it had ricotta but it just average. Our third and best pizza was the five cheese.

NEgzOlyawIsQE3RbMLADuA,VLXs-wsFTNclmMPCm3A6EA,jr3xGVYQx21JRTrlRbi9_g,1,0,0,0,"My family and I first went into sprint because we decided to leave T-Mobile. After 11 years of doing business with them the quality of customer service changed and we felt it was time to move on if the company values didn't match our own. 

 After some friends and family recommended Sprint we went to the Mesa AZ location on Alma School Rd and Southern. We were greeted by the store manager He was nice and explained how his store had won some national contest for best customer service. I sincerely hope that was a lie because I cannot imagine how bad the rest of the country must be if this is the best. When we left we thought we got a killer deal. He had given us some free goodies and we were so excited and we felt like he worked really hard to get us set up that day. He even told us that we could get cases and screen protectors for all 4 phones for $20 all together. I promised I would be back to take him up on that deal the following Tuesday when we had everyone with us to choose their cases. We thanked him and went on our way. 

Free goodies don't equate to good service. We unfortunately found out later that it was all a really great act that he had seemingly perfected over the years of getting people to sign up for things they don't need. He talked us into a bigger plan and getting more phones than we should have because it was ""the best deal with everything we wanted"". He created our password and pin for us without telling us what they were so when my first pets name was ""dog"" I was unable to guess the password (pin is still unknown) and couldn't gain access to my account either online or through customer service. 

While we were in there we gave him 3 T-Mobile phones for which he said we would get prepaid visa cards in the mail of a few hundred dollars a piece which have yet to show up. Of course I couldn't call customer service about this issue because I didn't have the pin or password. He was also supposed to add me as an authorized user because although the account is in my mother's name she doesn't want to deal with the troubles that come with accounts so I take care of it all (he knew this). After being told they could not access my account on the phone or online I was told to go into a store to show my ID. I went into a different store on my way home from work yesterday just to accomplish nothing. The employee told me I was not an authorized user and would have to bring my disabled mother in to take care of it. I was livid. 

I picked up my mother and we drove back to the same store we signed up in. The manager who previously ""helped"" us ignored us even though he was well within earshot as we described our terrible experience to the other employee. The employee told us the reason we had not gotten money for the phones is because we had to turn in a T-Mobile statement showing our termination fees. That was NEVER explained to us or I would have taken it in that day! He was also the one who discovered that our account password was ""dog"" and said we could change the pin and authorized users online now that we know the password. 

On top of all of it after dragging the whole family back in to pick out our cases for $20 on that Tuesday after we signed up he wouldn't honor the deal he offered. I saw him run in the back room when we got there. A nice girl greeted us and I explained that the manager had offered to sell us all cases for $20 and she went back to talk to him. She came back out to let us know that he wouldn't do it and he said it was ""a same day only promotion"" when he and I had specifically talked about doing it on Tuesday. I was so mad already that I just walked out. I didn't want to argue anymore. 

 I have had the worst time getting anyone in customer service to help me. I waited over an hour to speak to a supervisor once only to be told she was unable to help me due to system limitations. I am just so disappointed that we decided to go with sprint. Oh, and T mobile's data runs like the speed of light compared to sprint. With sprint I am constantly stuck on 3G and can't watch a video without it buffering every 30 seconds and I can't talk on the phone and use data at the same time?! What's up with that?! Get with the times Sprint and get it together. It is pretty sad when someone who left T-Mobile because they were unhappy is even more unhappy with you.",2016-11-23 19:01:52

The staff has always been friendly, but when it comes to taste, texture and ""health"" I think there is room for improvement.

Most of the salads I have tried, whether potato, pasta or legume based, have been grossly overdressed. The adjective that comes to mind is ""gloppy."" The chana masala chickpeas had a pool of oil sitting in the middle and the batch was overly salted. The thai peanut vegetables were overly coated with a viscous dressing, though the flavor was decent. Each time I see a beautiful creation and order it, my lips feel coated chapstick after a few bites. The wraps have good flavor, but I don't see the point of stuffing them with rice. Carbs and carbs don't feel healthy to me when coated in a coconut sauce. To be fair, the chili I had last week was fantastic. Earlier this week however, when it was 60-some degrees outside, they had no soup. Seems like an odd special to be missing when the season finally turns.

I think there is terrific potential and I hope Desert Roots fares well. Local food that is fresh made, open and honest, is what I live to support.

Just got my car tinted here regardless of all the bad Yelp reviews. The reason I didn't take any of these bad reviews to heart is because my boyfriend came here to get a front window replaced and he's happy with their work.

Super great deal because everywhere I called I was quoted a range from $179.99 - $140. I had an appointment at another tint place on 7/14 for a tint at $140 but the owners never showed up to open the business. Now I'm glad the other place blew me off because I got a way better deal here.

Time: they told me it would take about 45 minutes to an hour and they definitely finished on time. Especially I was on a time crunch because I was on my lunch break but they finished within the time limit they said it would be done.

Tint: so far so good, I don't see any bubbles but there are white streaks but they said that should fade away through sun evaporation if not to return and they'll fix it. The tint came with a life time warranty even if the business closes down I could call the tint manufacturer and find another location that distributes the same tint and get it re-done there. So I'm writing this review as a DAY 1 because this small business is definitely a hole in the wall. Its not the great spot for the eyes but still a good small business, people there are really nice. So as of now I can't roll down my window for 3-5 days.",2012-07-18 21:43:55

I hardly ever do this so y'all better check this place out because it is LEGIT! This is basically a Mediterranean style Chipotle where you can pick various ingredients in either a bowl or pita form. You get to pick things like the hummus flavor, the greens, the grains, the protein, a various assortment of toppings (like tomatoes, cilantro, pomegranate seeds, feta cheese, and etc.), and you finish it off with the sauce.

I ended up ordering a bowl with the spicy hummus which is apparently their most popular flavor and it isn't even spicy hehe along with the beef. Although the appearance leaves a lot to be desired, there is just so much flavor packed into each bite! After the first bite I knew that I just had to write this review because of how good the food is and how I want y'all to check this place out ASAP. The portion is a good deal too! I'm actually surprised I got such a big bowl with a bunch of ingredients for less than $10 and we all know how pricy Mediterranean food can be!  

The workers here are super helpful and nice as well. The guy who helped me was very enthusiastic and had a bunch of recommendations since I was a bit overwhelmed and indecisive lol. He even offered to put more ingredients that he thought would complement my choices which meant a lot to me because most places just want to get you in and out. 

Overall I would definitely come back here again despite it being a bit far for me. The location is a bit hard to find at first so make sure to have your GPS on. Apparently all their ingredients are fresh and wholesome as well. I really can't think of anything negative because my whole experience was just so positive.",2017-11-21 03:30:59

1.) Waited almost 30 minutes after our reservation time, as did most people there. Which is fine, I see that reservations for them are more like call aheads. 

2.) TAYLOR our waitress was extremely rude and condescending. She also has a very in your face personality and is unprofessional at times. SHE IS THE REASON WE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT GIVE THIS PLACE A 2ND CHANCE!!!

3.) Waited very long to be greeted, have our order taken, to be checked on after we received our food, and for our check. 

4.) no explanation of how the menu worked so we started ordering and then were told no that's not how it is and then still gave us a careless, hurried explanation of how the process is. 

5.) there was a misunderstanding with the check that the waitress admitted that it was her fault, but still spoke to us with disdain in her voice as if we were inconveniencing her. 

Food was okay. Prime rib was above average. Mash potatoes, creamed spinach, mushrooms all average. Lobster & bread were delicious. 

Service to me is just as important as the food. After this I don't think I could ever go back and if I do I will definitely make sure Taylor is not our waitress.",2016-08-28 05:25:04

If I was looking for the everyday wardrobe, I am sure that I would find it here.
  This Ross, located in the shadow of the Riviera, is a fairly large one-story clothing store. Ross sells a large selection of clothes at discount pricing. A plus is that there are plenty of dressing rooms, which leaves less time to wait to try on  clothes.

The inside is clean and moden,  lots of natural wood grain and clean lines.   The workers are very friendly, and they are quick at producing your order without sacrificing quality. 

I personally tride their oolong late which has a sea salt cream,  and they have 4 levels of sweetness 4 being the most.   I chose a 3 and it was perfect for me.  At most places I usually need to do half sugar so they aren't as heavily sweetened at least in their tea lates.   The girl taking my order said sweetness could very with what type of drink you order.  The tea had wonderful flavor,  I chose the smokey oolong over the green tea oolong.   No harsh after taste,  nice and smooth,  and the sea salt cream added a nice contrast.  The boba are a great consistency,  and are sweetened with honey.

Atmosphere is nice and pleasant, however the open floor plan makes it a bit noisy. Food seemed reasonably priced and portions were sufficient. Service was excellent. 

Food: For starters we had the soup, which had a good consistency but lacking. It was too sweet and not enough earthy flavors. The shrimp was decent but nothing special.

For entrees we had the shepherd's pie, which was was not thick enough,  bland, and not even as good as the one you can get at Costco. The crispy whitefish over dirty rice was tasty but lacking a nice sauce to help the overall dry consistency of the dish. Someone else at the table had the pulled pork and said it was good but not great.

CVpqtwtaREMbuoFtzCcE5Q,cCke3VtFLtqgzkgYSrSE2g,c0yPNU-BqS65u0vIKP7P0w,5,6,3,7,"My friend and I have been trying new restaurants when we get together for girl's night and selected Avenue B for dinner on Thursday night. I mentioned my dinner plans to a coworker and became even more excited about my dinner that evening when she immediately began to give rave reviews!

I found street parking across from the nearby Giant Eagle and walked half a block to the restaurant. I previously had no idea where the restaurant was located - thanks for guiding me, car navigation - and was not surprised that the location was pretty random. As I walked from my car, I passed Giant Eagle, apartments, and a funeral home before getting to the restaurant. The entrance of the restaurant is very tiny, and I was happy to be the only one waiting to be helped. The front entrance could probably fit only six slender - or four heavier - people. 

After waiting at the entrance for a few minutes, a waiter came and asked if I needed to be helped and seated me right away at the second table from the entrance. Because of my seating location, I didn't get a great look at the rest of the restaurant. If the total dining space only includes the open room where we were seated, I believe total seating capacity may only be around 40 people. The space was decorated in a traditional, formal style including candles, tablecloths, and cloth napkins.

Now, let's get to the food... Our waiter delivered a little basket filled with five small slices of white and wheat bread to the table with a delicious butter spread. The basket quickly disappeared, and we then began with an appetizer of PEI mussels served with the ""chef's preparation"" broth and grilled bread. I approve of the chef's preparation! SO yummy! I'm guessing the broth was some sort of mixture of tomatoes, cream, and wine but am not quite sure. Whatever it was, when the second bread basket arrived, the two of us proceeded to quickly consume it, dipping our pieces into the mussel's left over deliciousness.

As soon as I read Wagyu Beef Meatloaf on the seasonal menu, none of the eye-catching offerings on the chalkboard menu could change my selection. I am so happy I stuck with my initial selection. The beef's texture and flavor was tender, rich, and savory. The meatloaf was placed over a pile of creamy and fluffy goat cheese chive potatoes and under a tall pile of crispy fried onion rings. All of this - paired with a sweet and savory tomato jam - was incredibly flavorful and innovative while still feeling classic and simple.

As soon as I got out of my comfy booth seat at the end of the meal, I regretted ordering - not one but two - desserts, but at the time, it seemed like a good idea. The chalkboard menu dessert was a blueberry, lemon, and vanilla ice cream mixture served in a little dish. Unfortunately, it was just too sweet. My friend and I determined that it could've used some acid and salt.

The only negative component of our experience at Avenue B was the amount of time it took to receive our food. I had arrived a few minutes before our reservation at 7pm, and my friend right on time. We don't get dinner together nearly as often as we should and didn't mind the wait that it took to receive our entrees, especially considering how tasty our appetizer and bread was. However, I began to look at my watch around dessert time. We realized that we didn't receive dessert until after 9pm, even though we had probably ordered a half hour earlier. With total dining time around 2 hours and 15 minutes, I think that this is much longer than average. I'm not sure if our experience was the norm, but I'll make sure to allow plenty of time to dine next time I eat here.",2015-08-10 02:23:07

The first I went, I got the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup. It was decently good. Better than what I make myself at home, but still not that special. I probably think it tasted better than it really did because I believe the two together came to like $6.50 or something ridiculously cheap.

The next time I came, I had the French toast. It was pretty bad. It was one of the few times I would have wanted to send it back but our waitress never came to check on us so I couldn't. All the syrup in the world couldn't have fixed the dryness that was this meal.

I went there again two nights ago. It was late, I needed cheap food. I really wanted something sweet and since the French toast was so bad last time, I decided to go with pancakes instead. Again, they were bad. Literally worse than the pre-made pancake mix at the store. Like last time, I would have sent it back, but the waitress never checked on us. 

Aside from the food, this restaurant really caters to specific people. If you want to have a quiet conversation over dinner, don't go here. If you want to talk very loudly over top of other people talking very loudly, go here. If you want to be able to see your food before you eat it, don't go here. If you want to eat in darkness, go here (just kidding, but it is really dark here). The waiters are friendly, but they never check on you. So if you want a refill, good luck. Also, the bathrooms are disgusting. 

I would really only go back here if it was super late at night, the nearby Chinese places weren't open, and/or I had very little money on me. 

As per the alcohol, I don't drink, but my boyfriend said his beer was pretty good and he had the vermicelli noodles which he also said were 'OK'. The beer was pretty cheap. I think it was $2.75 for 1/2 pint, $4.50 for a pint, and I forget how much for a pitcher.

In summary: cheap, bad-slightly better than average food, friendly but not good waiters, decent beer, gross washrooms, open late, loud, dark. You can do better. DO NOT take a first date here. Just don't. I forgot to menton this earlier, but they also have a pretty wide-ranging menu. Noodles, sandwiches, brunch, asian, indian, etc. But no pizza which is kind of weird.",2013-02-03 21:27:37

Anyway, while the prices are Vegas Strip premium here, a lot of their dishes were on point.

Roasted Bone Marrow - This dish was fantastic.  The bone marrow was cooked to perfection as well as the carmelized onions.  I kid you not though, the place that sets this place apart was the bread.  Something about that buttery garlicy-ness sets it off.  

French Onion soup dumplings - While the cheese they used was really good, I didn't care too much for this dish.  I was expecting soupy dumplings...like a french onion soup xiaLongBao.  All you get is a dumpling filled with carmelized onions.  

Grilled cheese , bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - This was more my style.  There was actual soup this this.  Too bad they don't serve this by the bowl.

Thai style deep fried shrimp - Great dish.  The shrimp was good quality and the slaw was perfect.

Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta - Ordered this by somehow it came with a bunch of pepperoni and meat.  I wonder if this was intentional?  This dish was okay.  Never thought I'd say this but there was actually too much meat too the point where it made the pizza too salty.

Brussel Sprouts - They could have done a better job carmelizing the outside of the brussel sprouts but this dish was solid.  It was a bit soggy because it soaked up too much oil.

Short rib mac and cheese - I liked how the short rib flavor got into the guts of the cheese flavor.  

Basil Pesto ravioli with Rock shrimp - I wasn't a fan of this dish as it was bland.  It had the least impact in terms of flavor.  

Jerk Spiced chicken - While the flavor was good, the chicken came out a bit dry.  Tear.

Scallops - Good quality scallops.  Can't go wrong here.

Devils food layer cake - Imagine the richest and sweetest chocolate cake of all time. It was nice that the did have the milk ice cream to ""lighten"" the load.  If they eased up on the sugar, I would have enjoyed this dessert much more.

Drinks: I had the Electric Avenue which is pretty much their own version of a manhattan.  While it isn't cheap at $17, it was really good.  Compare this to the Chandelier bar outside the restaurant that serves a sh*tty old fashioned for $17.  It's expensive, but you get more value here.  They also have pitchers of Sangria, but that'll set you back $80.  Did I mention this place isn't cheap?

Service was good and for the most part, the food was tasty.  If you have a large party, this place is great because you can order it ""tapas"" style.  For example, you can add one scallop to the scallop dish.  The waiter/waitress will help you along the way.

Pass:  tri-tip dinner, paprikash dinner, meat loaf, swiss steak.

I went to redeem the freebie I had.  Actually, I had two:  one for my birthday and one for accumulating stars.  The barista was very helpful, and told me to use the birthday one, because the other one would have a much longer expiration date.  I chose a breakfast sandwich, and told her I'd be having it the next day.  She made a point of telling me she was giving me a fully wrapped one, so it would stay fresh.

The atmosphere at this Starbucks is very pleasant, and the sandwich - a panini with sausage, egg, and jalapeño jack cheese - was delicious.",2016-10-17 07:18:39

Mildred's not only reminded me of that, it slapped me in the face with it and set that standard ten times beyond anything I would have expected.

I had one of the most delicious corned beef sandwiches I have ever eaten at Mildred's. And I ate it on a charming little back porch that felt like my own backyard. They added some kind of addictive mayonnaise/mustard to that sandwich that added a perfect amount of tanginess to my sandwich, and the vegetables were crisp and flavorful. The potato salad was cheap and excellent, and the warm beef pita tasted kind of like a tasty hot pocket (minus the feeling of irreparable damage to your digestive system).

Sure, the ""cash only"" policy is a major annoyance. But Med Cafe has a line out the door every day and I don't see those people bitching about it.

A couple of things I love about this place. 
1) Head to Tail chicken (and some pork and beef) including fun things like knee cartilage, gizzard, and tail (aka butt) 
2) Service was excellent. Seems like they have improved based on reviews from when they first opened.  Each order came at a really good pace just as we finished the previous one, Deep Fried things took a little longer
3) can make reservations! For both the tables or bar. 
4) somehow with all the bbqing in such a small space the ventilation was amazing. Couldn't smell a thing unlike some places I walk in and it's a wonderful charcoal smell but get stuffy and hot. 

Prices are good. At around $1-2 about skewer it wasn't heartbreaking to just order more whenever we wanted. Best is one skewer per type for every two people. More sharing makes the experience not very fun. 

All the skewers we got were just with salt,  although good the charcoal flavour didn't really come through (supposed to?). Nonetheless, all really good. 

We also got the Karaage. It was wonderfully juicy chicken piece doused in the perfect amount of batter. We actually got it twice because she mixed up my nonkotsu karaage with this one. We didn't resolve it because it was quite good. 

They also have specials with larger plated $5-8. Got a grilled whole squid. Highly recommended. They also had my favourite fried kimchi udon from Guu.  Yum. 

For dessert there is a roasted green tea brulee $5 which was everything you would imagine it would be. And ice cream including a sake vanilla (get this!), beer sorbet (tastes like beer slushie) , black sesame. (also favourite)  and match green tea. Ice cream come in two scoops. It was my friends birthday and they gave us a great dessert platter for $12 which had the creme brulee and one scoop of each flavour. 

It quiet (compared to guu) in here but lively enough to have a nice vibe. For our meal 4 people we spent about 20-30 per person and was full up.",2014-04-25 12:41:32

They were definitely sharing notes on each table--our waiter made a point of mentioning something that we'd only shared with the host.

The food was excellent, though the bannock basket was overkill--I wouldn't recommend it, given the generous portions (I took half my mac and cheese home with me) and the excellent desserts.  Seriously, save room for dessert.  It's so worth it.  Their dessert menu is a bit silly with the Canadiana (really, a baba au rum made with ice wine?), but the s'mores pie tops anything I've had lately.

It is a corner dive bar just up the street from St. James.  Old tables, run down décor, torn up seats, with a bar keep that fits the the mood and style impeccable well.  Sarcasm is not the intent here.  Everything just works and fits together really really well.

When we arrived a few patrons had been scattered around.  Carrying on amongst themselves and having a good time of it by the looks of it.  We just found a little wobbly table to call our own and settled into some easy fun over a few drinks.  The bar staff came by and gave us a few pointers on the area.  Sitting down and chatting with us for a little bit.  Styling and hip without being pretentious.  We thought she was great.  

But the bar keep is the main personality here.  Off in his little bar area he just looks out and waits for a sign.  Jumping to immediate action when his services are called upon.  He seems to have one of those personalities that is very easy and natural to engage to get a good conversation going. But then just naturally fades away into the background without even trying.  Before you know it hours have gone by and your wondering where the time went between you and your friends.  

Not sure of his cocktail making abilities.  But we found him to be unique and fun to interact with.  A genuinely nice guy.  

One of the Calgary bums wandered in briefly and head to the bar.  Our main man cooly and with all the charm of Batman's butler sent this fellow on his way without so much as comment from the guy.  It was really well done.  Several patrons commented on it.  Apparently it is pretty common for many of the bars in the area to have contend with some of these types.

It should not have taken a visit from some out-of-towners to get me here but there you have it.  I met up with some friends who wanted a place we could visit, eat and grab a beer.  I was surprised when I walked in, in a good way, with the appearance and size of Miller's.  It is a big restaurant with kind of a small pub feel (think dark wood and brass rails). At the same time, I am reminded of a steak and seafood restaurant not unlike the Sizzler's I grew up at.  It is a welcome addition to my restaurant familiarity.

The three of us were seated immediately and our server was at the table before we even had a chance to pick up the menues.  A quick order of beer, a mojito and an iced tea and we commenced to talking.  Our poor server kept trying to take our order but we were too busy gabbing to know what we wanted.  We ended up with wings, steak and crab legs and a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich (fully loaded).  It took a little while for the food to come out.  Perhaps longer than I think it should have but it gave us time to chat so it wasn't really an issue.

As I did not try the wings, steak or crab legs, I will discuss now the cheese steak only.  As mentioned before, I ordered my sandwich fully loaded.  There was a ton of thin sliced beef, a couple slices of melted provolone and sauteed vegetables (green pepper, onion and mushrooms).  This was a good Philly.  I am always on the lookout for a nice sandwich like this.  I will file this away in my memory for quick access in the future.  On the side I went with regular fries.  They were fine.  Thick cut and all.  That said, I wish I had ordered another side.  These fries were heavily seasoned with salt and pepper.  I dislike black pepper and only enjoy limited salt.  This was a little much.

My final impressions of Miller's Ale House, favorable.  I can see this being a good place to come for a cold beer and some good food.  Service was on point and pricing is reasonable ($9 and change for a sandwich and fries).

I admit that I'm one of those people that are more likely to only take the time when writing a bad review. I think it's just as important to write good reviews to let people and owners know what goes on and this one seemed deserving.

It was only a simple gesture but it was very indicative of the type of employee she was which is why I'm recognizing it.

After picking up my order, which was very quick I might add, I was gathering napkins and utensils. I saw a collection of bottled sauces. These were not for to go but seeing them made me think about bringing some with my order. I noticed an employee who was not on shift but she was the first one I noticed after looking around for something to take a sauce home with. I was in a bit of a rush so, without thinking that she wasn't even in shift, I asked her for a to go cup. 

It was at this moment that I realized she was not on shift but I had already asked her. 

Most employees that aren't on shift would look for a way to not answer or to avoid my question. Not only did she answer but she stopped what she was doing to offer a solution. Part of me felt guilty for interrupting her after realizing that she was not even in shift and part of me was shocked at the speed of the selflessness. She didn't even hesitate and offered me cups to put the sauces in. 

This is what it's all about and I guarantee this young lady will be extremely successful in life. That kind of dedication and work ethic is what's lacking in society. Too often does society get on kids for being ungrateful or lazy but if this young lady is even a glimpse of the generation that is coming up then I think we will be just fine.

We sat upstairs, the place was packed even though our reservation wasn't till 8:30pm. Weekends are busy.

- Ultra dry-aged porterhouse steak ($96.00) - we decided to go all out and share the porterhouse steak. 32 oz is a pretty decent deal, especially when you share it between 5 people. We asked for it rare and it came out perfect. Worked out that everyone got about 4 slices each. My friends were in heaven; shouts of ""best steak ever"" and eyes were rolling back in beef ecstasy. Two buds loved it so much they made sure nothing was left; eaten bare to the bone.
- Kale salad ($13.00) - now this kale I can get downnnnn with. The pickled chilies gave the salad a twist of heat while the gouda provide a light, cooling contrast.
- Fried brussels sprouts ($12.00) - the brussel sprouts were excellent! Even the brussel sprouts skeptics at the table loved it. The chopped almonds were nicely roasted.
- Parilla beef fat fries ($8.00) - I've had these beef fat fries before and they're as good as the first time I had it.

Started off with a white peach bellini ($5 special) - tasted good and was sweet in flavour but I consider these very expensive slushies. Comes with a gummy frog candy. I have no idea why they put those on but it was there.

Mosaic dip $13.75 - I think this was the best item we had throughout the whole meal. It was basically flatbread with a side of warm goat cheese with diced tomatoes. Sounds simple but tasted good.

Beef Dip $14.75 +$1 to substitute fries with broccoli cream soup. I think the soup was good and tasted even better than the beef dip itself. The bread of the beef dip had sprinkles of salt but it seemed like someone dropped like a spoonful of salt on the bread. This just ruined the whole sandwich. The dip was nothing special and neither was the meat. I would recommend avoiding this sandwich because it really didn't taste good at all.

Lobster and shrimp linguini $23.75 - came with three large shrimps and half a baby lobster tail. I think one shrimp had the same amount of meat as the half lobster tail. Came with a buttered bread. Not worth the money they charge and I would also recommend avoiding this dish, not because it tasted bad but because its just not worth $23.75.

To end off the meal of course I had to try dessert. Got the tasting trio for $11 which comes with mini versions of the white chocolate brownie, sticky toffee pudding and salted caramel pecan cheesecake + a scoop of ice cream. Best one was the cheese cake in my opinion. Nothing special with the other two desserts. Once again I would have to recommend avoiding this dessert and probably just get the cheese cake by itself.

Hobak can get fairly busy so prepare to wait. In comparison to Magal, Hobak charges for rice & has a less variety of food selection. My party had the beef combo for 4, pork combo for 2, green tea/Nutella dessert, mango/plum dessert, corn cheese, peach soju, Asahi draft, & cold unfiltered sake. No regrets for any of the orders. We didn't have to cook at all & I say it's worth the wait. Service is quick. Free slushy & water bottles while you wait & mouthwash & toothbrushes in the restrooms. 

Cons- I personally think the corn cheese is overpriced. They should explain each side especially since we had first timers at Korean food .

Both drinks were solid! The flavours were intense and tasty. If you're choosing flavoured syringes for a fresh tea drink, definitely skip the sugar since the syrup is already sweetened.

However, the downside is that there didn't seem to be a lot of toppings in each ""petri dish"" (I know that sounds weird but when you go, you'll know what I mean by that, haha).

This time however, I went with a work group and it was recommended by someone in the group. For once I was thoroughly satisfied. 

I would suggest that you beat the lunch rush and arrive a little before noon. As place was packed- We did however have a reservation and the table's were set based on our needs at point of arrival (group of 10). 

I can honestly say the service was unusual- maybe not the most customer service based. However, very honest and straight to the point. I ordered the fried rice with chicken and shrimp and requested to have the chicken and shrimp in the lemongrass flavouring. The lady helping us said very convincingly, 'It's no good, flavour don't match"". I took her word for it and just kept it the way it was served on menu. Was great!

Beautiful presentation, thin slicked chicken strips forming a circle above my fried rice with the shrimp in the middle. Everything was really tasty, and the portion was very nice. I was eyeing other items that people had ordered in my group; and they all looked of high quality; The PHO bowls were mammoth. 

Really enjoyed my experience; and spent less then $15. I finally found a good place as the last week has been very disappointing in my culinary hunt adventures.

Given all their creative combinations, it might be a hit or miss - don't be shy to ask for a sample!

jGzEWcqf3KjZncgRc-EigQ,uMIUdTLNL5Y-ZGDd2ZLmCA,7aSOA5TfyIH3KHdSqRoTaA,4,1,0,0,"I had a strange hankering for either Japanese or Italian food for our anniversary dinner tonight, but neither cuisines were appealing to me by themselves, then along came Carino in my search. 

Carino is one of those places that I always drive by but have never gone into. I remember long ago when there used to be an adult video store located in the same area (so I always assumed the strip was shady). Nevertheless, it has been many years since that time, and I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. 

As I had been looking all day, and it was crunch time (715pm to be exact) I was easily able to make a reservation on opentable for the restaurant. Street parking is available in the area (be weary of areas where permits are required). 

The restaurant is so cute and small. It offered a perfect environment for our occasion. 

Service was slow at best, but the server was very polite and was great with recommendations.  As a one man team running the front of house, I applaud him! He was the bar tender as well, so I asked him to make me a sweet cocktail. He brought to me a strange concoction that had cherry blossoms, yuzu and sake. Quite tasty. I loved swirling the flowers around in the glass during my whole meal. 

I am in love with their calamari fritter! The batter was light, and had a great spice blend to it. Each piece remained tender and crispy the whole time we were enjoying it. In love with the spicy aioli as well, it was good enough to want to lick the bowl clean. The portion size was great for the price we paid ($12).

We were worried that the entrée portions were going to be small, but the portion sizes were perfect and the dishes were beautifully plated. 

I got the Mentaiko Cream Pasta ($23) with spicy pollock roe, baby scallops, calamari, prawns, shiso leaves, edamame and toasted seaweed. The seafood was tender and there was just the slightest kick of spicy to sauce. Not sure where the shiso leaves and edamame came into play, but it was delicious never the less. 

The bf got the teriyaki wagyu beef burger ($18) with Kinpira, mixed mushroom & wasabi mayo with rice bun, fries, Cheese ($1.5) and Crispy Pork Belly ($6).  The beef was cooked to medium rare, moist and fall apart tender. The rice bun was unique, and was a great change from a regular bun. Hard to eat with your hands; delicious to the end when mixed with the wasabi mayo. The pork belly wasn't all that crispy, but it was a good complement to the burger; could have done without it though. 

The fries were delicious on their own, unsure of what type of spices were on them though. They were crispy and hot when they arrived. Glad to know they were made fresh. 

The washroom here is in front of the entrance, and very tiny and dark. Not good for anyone wanting to touch up their makeup. Make sure not to wear any makeup that will melt during your date. 

Will be coming back here to try out their brunch menu. I kept hearing good things about it during the meal from other tables. Love their concept here and looking forward to my next visit. P.S. The server was very enthusiastic in telling tables about their second location as well! May go check them out there as well.",2015-05-28 22:10:04

Aesthetically, the Uptown Vig is just lovely.  The renovation of the space was done with class, and the differing textures on every wall/surface/decor really made things pop.  I'm loving the re-purposing trend in central Phoenix... what great use of an old, seemingly useless space. 

On my first visit to the Uptown Vig, I came with the girlfriends for Happy Hour.  We love to check out all of the greatest happy hours around town, and were particularly excited for half-priced appetizers.  We had the traditional hot ""vings"", guac and chips, trifecta (mini-burgers) and the flatbread pizza with tandori chicken.  All of the items were relatively good, however nothing really stood out or surprised us.  We were disappointed at our server's attitude.  She seemed immediately put off when we ordered only waters and 2 cokes (table of 4) with our food.  Come on - ""real"" drinks aren't required, are they?  It was a school night!  Plus, I had to manage to drive myself home, and I totally can't manage that with even one drink.  I understand that we were reaping the benefits of the happy-hour pricing without shelling out for alcohol, but there is no need to be put off by our choice.  We ALWAYS tip enough to make up for their trouble... Anyways... I digress...  I also ordered the Good Korma curry dish to take home to the husband, after conferring with the waitress about good gluten-free options.  Unfortunately, when I arrived at home, I discovered that they had stuck a great, big piece of naan on top of the curry.  Gluten, gluten everywhere :(

Our second visit was a great turnaround.  We had decided to go to Chelsea's Kitchen for Mother's Day Brunch.  Chelsea's turned out to be so packed that we couldn't even find a space to park.  Using our incredible genius, we decided that the fairly new Vig would probably have less of a crowd.  Boy, were we right!  We were seated right away, and there were many tables to spare.  I ordered the Achiote Salmon - oh my.  It was an incredible dish.  Such complexity of flavor in the spices and poblano sauce, and the accompanying chorizo-stuffed corn cake was delish.  Definitely something to return for.  The husband ordered chilequiles, and thought they were good, but not nearly as great as Gallo Blanco's version.  Both of our mothers ordered the Persian Kebabs, and both seemed pleased, but not completely bowled over.   The child ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which was entirely too much bread and not quite enough cheese.  I did enjoy stealing his French fries, however - yum!

Since the new Vig is just around the corner from my house, has a super happy hour, and the amazing salmon dish, I'm sure I will be back.  Hopefully the service loses the slightly I'm-better-than-you attitude, and adopts a truly friendly vibe.  Looking forward to that!",2010-05-31 04:49:11

On the last night got together decided wanted just eat at The Orleans make it easy. It been while since dine at the coffee shop or can I still it the coffee shop for the hotel?? Anyway living in Vegas for long time remember this spot always being the coffee shop or 24/7 cafe. It gone through changes with the menu and just recently or not that long ago changed the whole look for the dining room. It one big open area rather then couple different areas. It lot more lighted with the open area and overall like the look much better then any of the previous layouts.

My friend was telling me that section in the menu that serves local food ""808"" style. I don't ever recall that being on the menu. He telling me it the same for the most part at The California Hotel. The four items are Oxtail Soup. Local Moco, Breakfast Plate, and Plate Lunch (Kalibi or Chicken Katsu). I ordered the Local Moco and my friend ordered the Oxtail Soup. The Loco Moco honest was horrible. First off if going call something Loco Moco it should all be on top of one another. Each item from hamburger, eggs, and rice all separated. The gravy was ok. The other thing that made me dislike it more is looking at the Oxtail Soup. NOW that was winnah!!! It looked good. I tried the broth that was on point!! It had three nice big pieces of Oxtail. My boy telling me taste just like eating it at the California Hotel. Lesson learned next time going for Oxtail soup. I also ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo. Thank you Yelp and Yelpers for the awesome photos. It was the only reason decided order it. It tasted as good as the pics!! It was nice big bowl. Nice hearty with pieces of chicken and sausage. Not saying it the best gumbo in Vegas. The value and taste good. I could have two or three bowls of gumbo be completely satisfied. 

The rest of the menu is pretty much straight forward coffee shop menu. The prices are very reasonable.",2017-07-11 05:29:26

Forgot to mention that I took part of my meat home.)   The dish was topped with spinach -- I am assumed steamed and lightly seasoned -- and maybe polenta??   It was sort of a cornmeal dish.   I would have preferred mashed potatoes, but the polenta -- if that's what it is -- was good.   Perfecto accompaniments.   He said his reuben was good.

I loved the atmosphere - very classy.  All of the food we got was delicious.  And most importantly,  our server was extremely patient with my dad, who can't speak english well but wanted to order two entrees instead of just one.  Much appreciated! 

For meals, I got the Butcher Cut with Bleu Cheese Mornay.  It was amazing.  I think what made the meal was the bleu cheese honestly.  It won me over from the first bite, and I don't even like blue cheese!  It was a little salty, but because it was on the side (I can't remember if it came like that or if I asked for it this way), I could adjust to my own tastes.  Still, the meat was tender and juicy at medium rare, and it was pre-cut. PRE-CUT.  

And I thought I had a two thumbs up meal until I tasted my boyfriends' dish - the NC Mountain Trout Amandine.  This was definitely what made the night memorable.  Even though I had just one bite, it was enough to make me want to go back for more.  It was so soft and didn't have a lot of the 'fishy' taste to it. It was like love on a plate.  If you have a chance to try this dish, DEFINITELY get it.  I'm not too big of a fish person, but this one totally had me hooked (Ha. Lame pun). 

My dad had the Pasta Forrestierre with a NY Strip cut on top of it (his special order that took 20 minutes to explain), and my mom had the Pan Seared Scallops.  I didn't try either but they both said they were delicious!  I'll take their word for it. 

Also, try the creme brulee for desert!  It's not too sweet but not lacking in that area either.",2014-01-20 19:21:26

This place is great and it must have been built between the time I moved and now. It's amazing all of the new restaurants and businesses popping up in Pittsburgh. We had a wine tasting they have two options 6, 1oz tastings on the list for $10 or all of the list including the reserve wines for $15. We ended up getting the 6. I liked how he explained each one and how they are made. I chose the red Zinfandel and I did not even know they made red Zinfandel. I like all of the Reds the whites were too bitter tasting for my palette but the Reds were dry and smoother. It was a slower time period so there wasn't many people there. It seemed like they show you how to make wine there and they allow you to have parties there. Although there is no food served there you can bring your own and provide your own entertainment. I love the atmosphere and the vibe. They said they have live bands Friday and Saturday nights so they miss out on opportunities for rehearsal dinners and parties. Otherwise any other night is fine. I wish they had like a cheese plate to pair with the wine like a wine and cheese tasting. That would go nicely with their presentation. Overall i will come back to visit this place when I am in town.

I had the scallops Benny, which were extremely tasty. The ricotta gnocchi which is definitely all about the rib is very tasty as well, I could eat a couple orders of this just for the delicious flavor. The octopus ceviche was good, it was light and refreshing, but I can't say that it is a must have. The angus mini burgers were good, but again not anything totally special, I love blue cheese so I think I liked them a little better than most people because they had a strong blue cheese flavor. 
The service was fine. It seemed like the main server is spread a little thin, but she did a good job. It was kind of weird that a younger woman came to our table and introduced herself as the co server, and then I saw her just kind of hanging out by the bar talking with coworkers the whole night while her ""partner"" took every order, and dealt with all of the clients. Maybe she wasn't really a co server and just said she was to greet/buy the main server some time.

Bread isn't baked on-site, so there's no ""bakery"" smell.  Pastries/breads are going to be mediocre.

MENU
I wished there was a Combo Price for the Pick 2.  Instead, based on how the menu is set-up, you hafta do math!  There's a Pick 2 price for each category (soup, sandwich, salad) and you hafta add the 2 items together.  Too much for me, so I think it would be easier if they just provided a blanket price for a combo of different items.

FOOD
I had a 1/2 Cobb Salad - $8, other than having half a hardboiled egg and barely any bacon pieces, it tasted good.  The crust of accompanying baguette was hard AF, I had to tear it with my hands like a cavewoman.  Knife was not cutting it!

I haven't been to Panera in YEARS, so I cannot say whether or not portion sizes have been dwindling, but that's what my friend said...who goes regularly.  Full portion of salad looked HUGE to me though!

SERVICE
There were people coming around to clean up the dirty plates.

Cashier was fine.

ATMOSPHERE

Back to the wings...They come in a variety of flavours: barbecue, honey-garlic, plain, mild, medium, hot, and then five alarm wings.

Upon arrival we were seated immediately by a slightly dirty guy (his hygiene did need some work). The place seemed very empty for a Friday night. The decor here is pretty run down and dingy. It seemed like they had a nicer section that was blocked off by curtains. Maybe they should use this as the main dining room. The lighting was VERY bright at our table. A little dimmer lighting would be much better.

Our family usually receives very good customer service, but today's ""service"" in the deli dept was so abysmal, I felt compelled to not only complain to the manager (Eric) but also write this review.

We waited for our number to be called and when it was called, we were served by a lady named Lori. No ""hi, how are you, what can I get for you?"" Nothing. No biggie. My husband and I tell her we'd like 1/2 lb of roast beef. No acknowledgement from her, she just starts cutting. She didn't even ask how thin we'd like it. OK, I think, whatever. While we were perusing the other selections, we saw some ham we'd like to buy. She then hands us the beef. We then say we'd like 1/2 lb ham. Again, not a word from her, she leaves then cuts it. But this time when she handed us the meat, she says to us in a snotty, dismissive tone ""Have a nice day."" I said ""But we're not done."" She then has the audacity to say to us ""Well, hurry up!"" I'm flabbergasted! I said ""Did you just tell us to 'hurry up'? We're spending money here."" She then said "" I was just kidding."" Clearly she was not. I decided I didn't want to be in her presence anymore, we didn't buy anymore deli selections.

We relayed this interaction with Eric the manager, who agreed that this was uncalled for. I told him it's not like I was asking for free sample upon free samples. We were customers spending hard earned $$.

It's a tiny tiny little place with simple and clean decor. It's the perfect size for the number of people that work here. He had one assistant that answers the phone and shampoos and helps apply and curl the hair. Another assistant started an hour into my appointment and he also helped out with little things like taking out my rods while my stylist cut another client's hair. 

He explained every step he was doing and made sure to show me pictures of what to expect. He speaks English quite well although not perfect but I understood him very well. He is very meticulous when it comes to sectioning and cutting. He trimmed my bangs nicely and sectioned my hair for application carefully. As a former hairstylist I really like to see that. I go to some salons only to find them half-assing everything just to get you in and out of their chair. 

I really enjoyed my experience here. I was never ever rushed. My digital perm turned out better than I ever wanted. Just expect to wait 1.5 - 2 weeks for an appointment if you're going to get a major service done. It was worth the wait.

We walked in. You are first greeted with private mailboxes on either side of you. We got to the wall on the right with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap. She got a medium box and a roll of bubble wrap.

Jeni's has been the top ice cream spot in my heart since I first went 4 years ago for this reason, but this place gave it a real run for the money, and in one or two more visits it just might overtake it.  

If you haven't been to either, this kind of shop doesn't do sundae's or throw a bunch of topping's on your ice cream. Your options basically consist of which flavors to pair, how much you want, and whether you want to eat out of a cone or a bowl (I go bowl most of the time, guess I am just that snobby over the purity of the cream!).  What they lack in interesting toppings they make up for ten fold by actually crafting their ice cream in unique, creative, and even artistic ways with an awesome creamy texture and attention to every detail.  

And the best part is that they are happy to let you try many flavors before making a final decision!  At Churned my taste buds were delighted by the red velvet cake, the blood orange sorbet, and the Mexican hot chocolate, but I had to make a decision and went with the Garden Mint Stracciatella and the Campfire.  

While the Garden Mint hosted the same flavor components as a typical mint chocolate chip, it was one of the most unique ice creams I have tried!  It was an herbal garden of flavors where fresh mint showed through the brightest but was far from the only herbal note to the cream, and the quality and texture of the chocolate was unlike anything you'll find in the freezer isle.  

The Campfire was a smokey chocolaty sensation with wonderful texture added by the graham crackers, and together the two took me to the center of garden bizarre  where I was making marshmallows over a bonfire and under the shade of mint terraces.  It was awesome.

I was really struggling last Friday on where to go for a pregame drink / appetizer so I just chose Greenhouse because I though it would give us a good vibe to start off the night....and it did just that.  We walked in, no reservations, and received a decent table in the main floor area, past the bar.  This was about 6pm, place was just starting to fill up, but still quiet enough for everyone to converse.  

I decided to just go with the house red which turned out to be a very good choice.  My mind wasn't made up regarding dinner, but I was a little under the weather and thought that a nice red would jump start me without turning my stomach....good call JT.  The other two in my group just ordered a beer and water, respectively.  They do have a lot of different types of beers and a nice wine list but if you are going for a bud light, you might have to go else where.

As for food, we were heading out to dollar dog night at the Q so we decided to just get some snacks to share.  We went with the wings, clams,  frites, fromage blanc, and crudites.  I really enjoyed each and think it was a perfect grouping of snacks for a night out on the town.  I ate most of the Foie Gras infused clams but the wife ate most of the broth, it was a nice twist to the standard.  Clams were huge.  The Wings Confit were delicious as usual (my 2nd time getting them).  Make sure that you get all the cut up veggies on every bite, it really brings out a flavor explosion on your taste buds.  Although, I still like my sauce slathered wings, but not in a joint like this.  The other items were good but nothing I can really comment on.  I can only say that you can't go wrong with anything on this menu.  I really want to head back for dinner.

My only con for this place, which is probably because they were just starting dinner service, was that we had 3-4 different people asking us if we wanted our plates cleared when we were obviously still snacking.  This little annoyance can be ignored because I understand completely why it happened.",2010-11-29 19:29:32

Many an afternoon was spent perusing a massive Meijer near my college apartment and even though I was dirt poor at the time, I occasionally sprang for a corn dog from the deli. I scrimped and saved by buying groceries on the cheap and I even still have a tie that I once bought on super discount. 

So, whenever I'm back in the Midwest, I try to stop by a Meijer to relive the magic. Of course, it's just a grocery store and the magic of yesteryear has somewhat abandoned me, but they still put together a fine assortment of goods. The produce section, for example, is above average. Some of the other sections are hit or miss--you might find some great housewares and you'll probably find some that feel a little less dependable. 

Overall, though, I still think Meijer stacks up nicely to any other chain across the country. I'll happily choose them over most when given the chance.",2016-10-04 05:50:35

We had tired several of their competitors prior to contacting MaidPro and I can attest that the value of their service is unparalleled. We had both less and more expensive services, and none were as thorough as MaidPro's.

We understand that the job the crews are tasked with is a difficult one, areas of the home that may be of importance to some may be inconsequential to others, so pleasing everyone has to be a difficult task. One way they mitigate this issue is with a 49 point checklist, all 49 items on the list are addressed with every service. This removes any ambiguity as to what should or shouldn't have been done. 

The checklist has also made it easy to address the few instances in which we weren't completely satisfied with our service. In those instances all it required to resolve the matter was to provide feedback to the office staff. Our concerns have always been met with a prompt and professional response, and they've always immediately corrected any concerns we've brought to their attention.

We came on a Friday night and were seated right away - yay for that!   Our server came by quickly to take a drink order, but then took a pretty long time to come back with it.   We ordered the Paulie's pie (half sweet and half hot pepper's) and the rib appetizer.  The ribs were really good - tender and flavorful - fall off the bone.  

The pizza was a mixed bag.  I really enjoyed my sweet pepper half, except for the crust, which was much too charred (black and crumbly)for my taste.  Bummer, cause I like to eat the crust.  The boyfriend suffered though.  The server should have issued a warning on those hot peppers because my orders-spice-level-8/10-at-a-Thai-place boyfriend thought they were too spicy to eat.   He picked them off the last slice, but by then, the damage was done.  

Which brings me back to the overall service.   Our server was very friendly, but clearly a little frazzled.  The first round of drinks was slow, so we ordered round 2 when he dropped them.  The ribs were served without plates, silver, or napkins (the manager rectified that).   Round 2 of drinks also took forever, but he did pick it up with Round 3.  About halfway through, we did notice that he had a big family with a ton of kids in the adjoining room that was very high-maintenance and monopolizing his time.  I kind of felt back for him after that.  The pizza was dropped by a runner, who didn't tell us how to distinguish between the sweet and hot side.  Fortunately, we guessed right, as those hot peppers would have ruined my day.  

At the end of the day, it's a chain and it feels like a chain.   I can give then a pass on the service since I saw the reason that happened and I saw the manager trying to help out.   But the blackened crust isn't my favorite and I was longing for a few more appetizer choices.",2018-04-28 21:40:40

The parking lot is huge, but badly arranged.  Even the handicapped spots were a long walk for one of my friends

The plaza is anchored by sports/concert venues.  When there are no sports events or concerts to bring in the traffic, there is a large movie theater.  They have also taken a lot of care to make several large public areas with fountains and other attractive focal points.  It is pretty, but an ineffective use of space that fails miserably in its attempt to provide services to concert goers and sports fans.  There were not even enough places available for several coworkers and i to enjoy having lunch there.

The rest of the plaza is supposed to be bustling with entertainment and activity to support the events at the main venues.  It is not.   I thought it was because a lot of places had not opened, but i think the problem is deeper than that. There are several chain restaurants with bars.  Try going to one of those restaurants before your concert for dinner.  They look at you like you have lost your mind.  The problem is, there are so few places, and they are all packed and understaffed.   The ones i tried acted as if they were insulted that i didn't want to wait til after my concert had started to sit down. This wouldn't be bothersome if they were using their entire seating space and had a full staff of waiters, but it looked like there were sections of the places that were not being used at all.  Perhaps they are waiting for the Superbowl to open those remaining 8 tables.

It tasted like flour and grease stirred up with some salt and pepper. The home fries have a weird spice flavor I didn't care for. I tasted them all day.  Nothing was hot. Tepid would be a good word.

The bill came faster than the flatware did, with a hefty total. Sausage  gravy w/ eggs and home fries and ice tea , egg whites and home fries and muffin and hot tea, and a juice. $28+.

The service was the only low point of the night (not terrible, but not up to par) Very slow to refill drinks and clear plates, and tough to flag down. We had to keep asking other staff to send our server over. 

They have a decent selection of salads and cold items at the buffet (I didn't try any of the hot buffet items) and the breads they have are fantastic. There was a cranberry orange loaf that was still warm, and so delicious. I could've easily filled up on that. 

The servers bring around freshly made corn bread, fried bananas and fries to the tables. The bananas have WAY too much sugar for my taste, but I love the corn bread. 

The main event, of course, is that they bring around a wonderful selection of spit-roasted meats to slice at the tables. They can be a bit salty for some (perfect for me) but the quality is fantastic. Probably the best chicken I've ever had in a restaurant (you could just cut it with your fork!) and the other meats are so tender and flavourful.

I wouldn't have mentioned this in my review but I did because the very next couple that came in she allowed them to have the table I wanted. I'm not removing stars for that but that is what happened.

We ordered egg rolls that came out fast and were good.

I ordered the Pad Gra Pow. I liked that they added a nice selection of fresh vegetables to it and the sliced white meat chicken was cooked nice and wasn't dry. This dish tasted good but lacked enough Basil and that is the point to this dish.  Also this dish is traditionally made with hand chopped chicken that has more surface and gets more infused with flavor than sliced chicken so that would have been better. I liked that they offer brown rice so I ordered brown rice however the up charge was $2.00.

My husband ordered the Hot and spicy noodles with beef. The dish was fresh and interesting but the beef was a little tough and chewy and not too developed with flavor. 

I was here before and had one of the curry dishes and liked that much more than the dishes we just had and would have given a higher rating if we ordered different dishes.

Thai food and everything at once, sweet salty spicy sour hot cold crispy bitter so on and so forth... all in varying combinations. Here we have some semblance of sour, or salt or crispy but it always ends with sweet. It's very one note.

The Fish Store has been around for a while and they serve quality fish dishes with fresh ingredients (you can actually see the raw fish on ice).

They have a variety of different kinds of fish including some really fancy ones like black cod. For any fish, they grill it fresh to order and you can have it as a sandwich, salad, burrito, or over rice. They don't overseason it, so you can really taste the flavour of the fish. I had the haddock salad ($9.99) and it came over a huge portion of mixed romaine and baby spinach with lots of veggies. In addition to fish, they have soups and cold drinks. Be sure to check out the daily special too!

The wings came out next, they were super hot and smothered in spicy buffalo sauce. They were cooked to perfection, nice and crispy even with the sauce all over it. I would recommend checking this place out for sure, they had a good menu variety with sandwiches, calzones and Italian dishes so there is something for everybody.

ReM9K6_8EvoWMFHv_8GFdA,TSxpgqzG0u38CGyyLfSAAg,2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,4,3,0,2,"I discovered the delights of Haji-Baba when I was in grad school at ASU (gulp) 10 years ago.  I decided to take the BF for dinner recently when we were in the Tempe area.  I was pleased that Haji-Baba has stood the test of time.

The decor was exactly as I remembered it.  The market side was still chock-full of Middle Eastern staples.  The bakery case was filled to the brim with homemade baklava.  The dining area even had the same murals on the walls.  Very little has changed indeed at Haji-Baba in the last 10 years.

Haji-Baba offers great value-for-your-dollar.  You get a large quantity of tasty food for a very wallet-friendly price.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest Middle Eastern food served in the US, but it's very solid.  There's a reason Haji-Baba has been a staple with ASU students over the years.  

The hummus was tasty and so were the olives.  The Gyro Plate had so much meat on it that I had to take half to go for lunch the next day.  The gyro meat is very good here, but it's not the best I have ever tasted.  That was at Jimmy's Gyros in Mykonos, Greece.  But I can certainly make do with Haji-Baba.",2008-05-29 22:06:37

 This Family owned Mexican Restaurant has been serving some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix since 1981. Run by five sisters and one brother, they have passed down recipes from their families generations, and serve them up with large portions. Unlike the standard Sonaran style restaurants in the Phoenix area, they have brought flavors from Mexico that will thrill your taste buds. Not too hot but flavorful extraordinaire.

If your in the south east side of Phoenix, you have to try this place, be ready for the wait though, I had a 25 min wait for food, but it is 100% worth it...

The place can be hard to find so the best thing to do is ask someone when you walk into the Venetian how to get here.  It's actually in the Venezia tower.  The employees in the Venetian are all really helpful and will get you there.

The place had a long lineup when we arrived and the hostess added us to the waiting list and told us it'd be about 30 minutes.  She showed us a sitting area where we could wait and there was some pastries that they had for people to snack on.

I tried the pastries and honestly I could have ate all of them and skipped brunch because they were that damn delicious!  

Thankfully I had some self control...trust me this isn't often and held off to try brunch.

The hostess got us early and quickly sat us at a booth.  The place is pretty nice inside.  Our waitress came over and brought us some water, our menus and some bread. 

I LOVED the bread they brought.  It's some of the best bread I've had since being in France.  The butter was great and the homemade jam was fabulous.

We ended up ordering some lobster, I ordered an omelet of the day (I don't even remember what was in it!) and my friend ordered a salmon benedict. 

The lobster was really damn good.  The older table beside us commented on how they liked our style.  They were super friendly and we had some great conversation with them.

Our omelet and salmon came.  My omelet also came with sausages and toast.  I took a bite of the toast and wasn't impressed but I just had some fantastic bread and lobster.  I left it but started putting some serious work into my omelet and sausages.  The omelet was honestly the best omelet I've had...I don't recall all the things that were in it but it was cooked perfectly.  The eggs were extremely fluffy like scrambled eggs but was in an omelet form.  I struggled to finish it and it took me a long time.

My friend loved her salmon and told me it was the best one she's had. 

I will definitely drop by the next time I'm in Vegas which will probably be next year to try something new.

The waitress got our drink order then after we decided on our lunch choices, we waited to order and waited and waited...
She clearly is playing the ""I'm busy"" game. Yes, she is by herself in the dining area, but with 3 other tables occupied it's not New years eve in there. She is busing tables and ignoring us
Priority is to take our order and as we are waiting she can bus a table, but no we didn't exist. 
I finally got up and asked her to attend to us. She acted surprised like 'oh you want to eat?""
I guess the food was ok, the crab dip was oily and no good. Everything else was average, but the waitresses attitude spoiled the lunch. Left a basic tip because of her poor service.

Luckily for me, I was selected to judge this year's event and got back on the street to check out if it was the same, or if things changed. And, in my mind, they have.
I arrived at 12:00 on Friday, right after opening at 11:00, and the streets were already packed, vendors were ready to go, and I was ready to eat.

The streets are blocked off with vendor booths, kids activities, demonstrations, wine tastings and so much more.
There were over 20 restaurant booths from yes, the chains, like McCormick & Schmick's, to the locals, like CC's Pies. There was a good variety of tastings, some of my favorites included the Shrimp Kisses from McCormick & Schmick's, the Ginger Chicken Strips from Mai Tai in Concord. 

Overall I was happy with what I saw, yes there are still vendors trying to sell me carpet cleaning, but the food and drink options have improved, including more local options, and the amount of food you get is well worth checking it out.

I don't understand how this place as a 5 star rating based off the food & service I ate/received. Service was horribly slow & there was only about 5 other people in the large dining room. They kept saying it will be slow because ""everything is made to order."" Well we would all hope that most restaurants we visit make our food to order rather than from a box. Fast food we expect from a box not food at a sit down restaurant. Tried the snails & they were covered in some heavy creamy white sauce (which I realize the menu stated) & could not taste nothing but creamy white sauce. Also tried the chicken Livers & chicken Gizzards. Liver was so so. It should have been soaked in milk longer to remove the liver taste. Gizzard just tasted like beef stew. I used to work in a venue that cooked the chicken lives, gizzards & hearts & I actually liked them - didn't have the gross taste that most places do as they were prepared correctly & seasoned just perfectly. Tried a chicken appetizer & it was just plain. Tried the chorizo & honestly tasted like stuff I've grilled before. Wasn't worth the $6.50 for it. Ordered the pork kabob & pork was so over cooked & dry. Only parts that were any decent were the parts that had a bit of fat on it so it gave it a bit of moisture. Honestly I make better pork at home. There was not even any Portuguese seasoning on the pork. Plate had steamed green peppers, onions & carrots with it that were over cooked & mushy instead of tender crisp. I do have to say at least the seasoning on the veggies made them edible even if they were mushy. French fries or plain white rice came with the dish as well. Opted for the french fries as plain white rice is not appealing to me. Fries tasted like they were from the freezer section at the local grocery store. Their saving grace was they were hot from the fryer so the salt stuck to them when I salted them. Music was much too loud we had to shout at each other. Sadly I really don't have much good to say about this place & unfortunately based on my dining experience I would never return.",2014-04-23 23:07:31

With a menu slightly more interesting than the average casino based small plates concept it was on the invitation of a friend that I sat down for a public relations sponsored meal at MGM's Crush and with the kitchen clearly catering to the head of the table as Chef DeMarco sent out several plates intended to impress the results were largely passable, a few hits amidst several 'safe' presentations that had us all discussing the sweetbreads comments from the film ""Chef.""  Obviously intended to wow the millennial crowd with a large menu of cocktails and 'tapas' to be shared, the restaurant itself is of the loud variety and with high ceilings paired to minimal décor the long room echoes with the sounds of I Heart Radio as a youthful staff proves exceedingly efficient with excellent knowledge of the menu and recommendations thankfully far more useful than the typical ""everything is good.""  Low in lighting aside from the lounge in back it was with an exceedingly refreshing cocktail that the meal began and although not entirely inventive both the soup and salad that followed were impressive in their own right, the woodsy vinaigrette particularly memorable in its ability to upgrade an ingredient offered on almost every menu in town.

Moving next to several items selected by the table before progressing to those sent out by the chef both the risotto and the scallops proved competent, if underwhelming, while the lamb meatballs were clumsy and off-balanced without a bit of funk - the lone standout of the group a stunning ceviche with heat and acid surrounding supple cephalopod paired to crisp chips with slight sweetness making all the flavors pop.

Impressed by buttery flatbread beneath bright sauce that melded spiced meatballs to briny cheese it was actually the creamy crushed fingerlings that proved the best plate of the next round while overcooked salmon and steak both proved par for the course, the oft-raved gnocchi rounding out the savories with exceptional tenderness amidst hearty short ribs and au jus that entirely unfortunately overwhelmed any semblance of nuance that might have been added from pureed peas.

Always happy to over-order desserts it was with a trio of sweets that the meal wrapped up and while the $12 ""Sweet Elvis"" lived up to its name without any discernible savory notes added by the bacon both the 'signature' Squeeze and unfortunately named ""Makeout"" faired far better - the former surprisingly subtle with no lack of textures and temperatures in play while the later was decidedly dessert-like, a not-quite molten center avoiding tired nomenclature and instead eating like sticky toffee pudding with slight salinity keeping richness in check.

Backed by The N9NE Group and clearly gunning for the cocktail crowd without taking too many risks with the cuisine Crush serves its purpose and fills the small-plates niche for the MGM Grand admirably, its best utility likely as a place for drinks before KA for those unwilling to shell out the cash for L'Atelier and seeking an environment more trendy than what is offered at TAP; a lot of style, a bit of substance, and a bill befitting its location.",2014-11-03 05:02:33

The quality of the ingredients and the extra care they put into each sandwich is what sets it apart. The lettuce is thinly sliced and never contains lettuce cores. The tomatoes are always red and rarely do I see a green one. The meat is freshly sliced. The bread is never hard or broken, it is baked perfectly. They also have hot subs and I am not talking about microwaved subs. The sub sizes are spot on. I've been to places where their smallest sub could easily feed a whole family. When they apply the condiments they don't over do it, except for maybe oil and vinegar. You can get a mini sub, chips, and a drink for about $7-$8 so it is definitely is lunch doable.

Everybody there is friendly and asks how my day is going. I used to work at Subway years ago and make sandwiches and know a good sandwich artist when I see one and all these people do an excellent job.

I don't know what is wrong with people and what would make them say Subway is better. Subway is like the McDonalds of sub shops. They don't care if you get broken bread, or if your sandwich is caked with mayo, or if the sandwich is so full of condiments that it can't be closed let alone fit in your mouth. Also Subway smells and don't be surprised if you smell like it after you leave.

When this place first opened they gave out free cookies a few times. I don't know if they still do, but it is always nice to see a place that appreciates it's customers.

I'm not an American breakfast lover so my review can be viewed as skewed.

I ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet with a side of potatoes. I didn't like my dish because the egg was overcooked and somewhat rubbery. Also, the omelet was really thick and it had way too much bland cheese on top of it and also inside of it. And the red salsa on top was so ambigous; it didn't taste like tomato, it wasn't spicy, what was it? It was convenient that the potatoes were cubed into small bite sizes but it was definitely overseasoned; my husband didn't like the ratio of surface area:seasoning and I completely agree with him. I tried the banana nut muffin but it wasn't worth the calories so I only ate the spillage of the muffin top and ignored the rest. The coffee was swallowable but it had the typical diner taste. On a positive note, it helped me ""go"" after breakfast so it was somewhat useful. 

On the other hand, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and simply put ""did her job well.""

PrEdof2mrXPHOrnJZ-lZSQ,1BjI1-O1gxSt8TRO0yD8Gg,GLEBemX4huHQTbmRAR2evA,4,1,2,3,"So I am definitely not rich enough to be regular member of Gainey Village...or any Village for that matter. However, for a special treat, my husband booked us a couple's massage at the Gainey Village Spa recently. 

So my review is a little biased because up until this point I was a professional massage virgin. Yep, that's right, I had never before had a professional massage. Pretty crazy, huh? I have to admit that I was surprisingly nervous about going in for my first massage. I didn't really know what to expect, but had heard that it was a romantic experience that sometimes ended in a warm bath together. That initially sounded a little weird to me, but decided it might be kind of fun. I was a little disappointed when the couple's massage turned out to be just that: a couple's massage. We both laid in a room together and had a simultaneous massage. So that was a little disappointing, but I have to say that the massage itself was so relaxing that it didn't matter what my expectations had been. 

I really wish that I could remember the name of my masseuse because she was great. Upon telling her that it was my first massage she immediately went out of her way to make me feel comfortable. She was warm, friendly, and checked on me regularly to make sure I was relaxed and enjoying myself. Plus, she was quite talented with her hands (yes, I'm aware that sound dirty, but I'm okay with it). I couldn't have asked for someone better. 

The spa locker room is also something that deserves comment. It's pretty damn awesome. There's a lovely sitting room with plenty of complimentary beverages, magazines, and comfy chairs. I wanted to try out the steam room, but went with what I knew...the sauna. The showers were clean and heavenly and they had every toiletry I could have needed. I could have spent all afternoon just lounging in that locker room. 

So, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my first spa experience. I hope to have many more!",2012-04-06 20:06:01

We had a short layover at the airport and Caplansky's was next to our gate. The smell of it as we walked by was enough to get our attention and get us in the door. There is a seating area and a takeaway/ordering area, but I think both sections are still self serve. You order your sandwich and pay, then are given a number which is called out when your order is ready. We chose to split a turkey sandwich, the meat on these babies is generous and splitting it was probably the smart way to go to avoid subsequent meatmares on the last leg of our journey. After ordering, the waiting area for orders is a bit chaotic and there seemed to be some confusion to customers as to where to find their order numbers on their receipts or some not even having their receipt anymore. Pro tip: keep your receipt until you have your food. 

All in all, the food came out fast, it was a generous portion and the bread was toasted just right - not to much to cut up your mouth. If the lines not to long, this is a good choice to grab and go.",2015-01-07 18:29:06

That was the sound coming from my husband and I once we got our food at Beckett's Table. Not much conversation after that.

We decided to give BT a try for restaurant week. There weren't too many creative veggie options with the other restaurants and I was intrigued with their dish titled ""veggie noshing board"". And I knew my husband would have plenty of meaty choices.

First of all, the service was impeccable. Upscale but still warm and friendly. And that is how I could describe every aspect of BT. The environment, the food, the concept. Extremely high quality yet you can still wear jeans. I love the vibe. And all their entrees are under $20.

I started out with the potato/leek soup. It was good. Simple but good. The garnish of pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and roasted cauliflower really made it pop. My husband's starter was a shrimp and black bean dish which he really enjoyed.

My mysterious veggie noshing board ended up being a beet cake with a carrot puree and a medley of veggies with a tomato sauce. I was worried at first. I don't usually like beets and the veggies with tomato sauce looked boring. But the beet cake turned out to be one of the tastiest things I have ever tasted. So delicious. And the flavors of the veggie medley were very good. Clean and tasty. The potatoes in the medley were a little undercooked for my liking, but still very good. 

My husband had the pork dish which he was blown away by. He said it was absolutely delicious. The portion size was very generous too. As if he couldn't get enough pork, he also loved the cheddar bacon biscuit it came with.

I had the coconut cake for dessert and my husband had the bacon s'more. Of course, the bacon s'more was a hit with my husband. The coconut cake was good, not too sweet. But I had a hint of a weird aftertaste in the chocolate sauce it comes with. Then I put one and one together when I looked at my husband's chocolate covered bacon. Did they dip the bacon in the same chocolate they used for the coconut cake? Maybe I'm just imagining it but the slightest molecule of bacon can throw a vegetarian off. If they do use the same chocolate I hope they look into changing this... they were so vegetarian friendly in every other way.

They had many other enticing menu items that both my husband and I could enjoy. It was such a pleasant and delicious experience, that we will be back.",2012-09-16 22:07:07

With an intimate setting, seating is limited to bleachers or standing room, but please don't be tempted to sit on the bottom bleacher, you won't be able to see the stage over the crowd standing in front of you.

Crescent ballroom is hands down, one of my favorite music venues in town. They get well known touring musicians as well as unknown local bands playing on this stage and there seems to be something exciting every night of the week. I've seen Macy Gray play here, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Judith Hill, and CeeLo Green to name a few. I highly suggest finding them on Facebook and following their feed. It's the most effective way to keep up with the shows coming across their stage. 

Drinks are available at two bars in this venue during most shows and the bathrooms behind the bar in the concert hall is usually much shorter of a wait than the one in the dining hall. I've not had the food here, but that's usually because I've already eaten, but I hear it's pretty good!

di3uLNQukOfxhr85ekoUBA,R_wlZO-jKFGEVJnSfWISqQ,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,5,12,3,14,"I'm often asked by friends and fellow yelpers, ""what's a place I should try?"" Or, ""what's your favorite restaurant?""  The answer I always unflinchingly give is Soul Gastrolounge. With that, here's everything you need to know Soul...

1. LOONG WAIT. The wait to get a table can be long. Very long.  I mean its pretty simple, do NOT go to Soul on Thursday or Friday night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs.  Therefore, I only go to Soul on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  Oh, and they don't accept reservations.

2.  NO LUNCH.  That's right, Soul doesn't open until 5pm.  I usually try to get there a little later in the evening; usually after the main dinner rush, around 9pm or so.  

3.  DJs & Tunes! I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they have a DJ on hand Thursday - Saturday nights starting around 9pm.  The DJ's are always on point with the music and really add to Soul's trendy vibe and reputation it has around Charlotte.  

4. NO PARKING.  There's no parking lot, or area exclusively for Soul's patrons.  Your best bet is to park in the lot across the street near CVS (sometimes its $5), or anywhere else around the heart of Plaza Midwood (near Thomas Street Tavern/Whiskey Warehouse) and walking over. 

5. The FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!  Although I've tried many items on the menu from the pork belly sliders, to the steak and eggs which both make my mouth water, my favorite item is the Sakana Roll.  Its a tuna, salmon, avocado, sushi roll lightly fried - simply the best sushi in Charlotte!  If sushi's not your thing, don't worry there's plenty of great menu items as I said the steak and eggs or any of the skewers are great.  The humus of the day and guac stack are both great tasting, lighter options.  The french fries w/truffle oil are out of this world yummy!! 

6. HIP. COOL. VIBE.  I like Soul's ambiance so much because its the perfect representation of the people and culture of Plaza-Midwood and Charlotte as a whole.  Its young, hip, chill, and different.  Everything from the walk up the black steps, to the dark interior, to the tight bar, to the blue peacock hanging behind that same bar; create a happening, mellow vibe thats unmistakeable.  

Soul perfectly in-captures everything I value in a dining experience. From the amazing and unique food, to the trendy ambiance, to the phenomenal service - everything pops at Soul.  Soul, what a great name for an establishment that truly represents the heart and soul of the Queen City.",2015-09-27 01:13:10
ZFaBnEgnbY7s5h7LvO-g9Q,3KK7L2Q6NMfJA1Ky4Ntmdg,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,3,8,1,2,"A couple of friends who were celebrating their birthdays in Vegas over the weekend wanted to try Raising Cane's for lunch. There are multiple locations around Vegas, but this one was the closest to us and off-strip.

I had no idea Raising Cane's was fast food and didn't know what to expect. The place was packed around 1:30 pm and we got into line, which moved quickly. They specialize in chicken fingers, so there aren't many options. I decided on The Box Combo, which included four chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries their famous Cane's sauce, and a regular drink for $7. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't finish the fries or slaw. The chicken tenders came in huge pieces and were super filling, although a bit dry on the inside but the yummy Cane's sauce helped with that.

Service was awful. The cashier who rang me up was clueless, distracted, and rude. I asked her what was in the coleslaw and she straight up giggled and said, ""I don't know."" I just looked at her, thinking she'd ask a manager or provide some other response, but nope; all I got back was a blank stare. Okay... After that lovely exchange, she seemed completely disinterested in me and kept making googly eyes at this guy behind me, who I assume she personally knew, and basically had a side conversation with him while I was trying to order.

Overall, Raising Cane's reminds me of another chain, Chicken Now, as they're pretty much on the same playing field. To be honest, I'd rather go to McDonald's (guilty pleasure) than come here again, but I wouldn't be opposed if friends wanted to come back. But before then, I'd like to try Strip 'N Dip Chicken Strips next time since I've had that bookmarked for awhile.",2014-10-29 22:00:33

I swear that the tainted pet food crisis of last year made vets even more likely to push unnecessary and expensive ""recommended"" tests, treatments, and pills on pet owners. What happened to vets that just love animals? Anyway, I selected this vet because my husband and I adopted two 2-month old kittens from the AZ Humane Society's Campus for Compassion on Friday and VCA is the selected provider of the free (within 5 days) appointment that you get after adopting from a shelter. Having adopted four previous shelter cats, my husband and I have been to a few of these free appointments. Usually, the vets seem upset that they have to give services free even though these appointments give them an opportunity to secure future clientele, and they try to convince you to add a bunch of bloodwork or fecal exams to the bill. This vet did not. 

Furthermore, they cover up to $500 of necessary medical services for specified respiratory, digestive, and other conditions for each pet that is adopted from the Humane Society (this is in addition to the free first appointment and free goodies!). The Office Manager and front desk staff were super friendly when I was checking in. They offered me free kitten food and printed cat ownership information. The technician was gentle and patient, and the vet himself was really kind and seemed to genuinely be interested in the kittens and their well-being. I'm sorry that this hospital is so far from our house because otherwise, we would return to them in a second for our two new feline babies and our two existing cats.",2008-06-10 17:45:41

The dinner menu was three courses, and thanks to my fellow Yelper dining companions, Neli T and Cathey K, I was able to try all of the dishes. The lunch menu also looked pretty promising, but the dinner-exclusive dessert made this the best choice for me.

SALT AND PEPPER CALAMARI: Started with an app off the regular menu, which was lightly breaded and perfectly fried but not particularly salty or peppery. 
SUSHI COMBO: Porcelain bento-style plate featured five bites of fresh fish for this course. The seaweed salad was creatively served in a hollowed-out lime half, and the tuna with caviar was super fresh. The fried tofu, however, was a bit soggy.
THAI BEEF SALAD: Beautiful presentation! Marinated rib eye was very flavorful, dressing was light, portion was fairly large.
ROASTED BONE OUT BRANZINO: The fish was perfectly cooked but could have used a touch more seasoning. The sweet Vierge sauce didn't quite work for me but I really liked the fregola and corn pasta with walnuts, grilled haloumi, and mint, which had a lot of textural contrast.
MURGH MAKHANI: A course of four Indian dishes served in a wooden bento style box. The chicken curry was a bit sweeter than I prefer, while the lentils were a touch salty. The naan was super fresh, though.
LA FRAISE YUZU: Almost too pretty to eat! But we did, and it tasted even better than it looked. A Greek yogurt topped with a summer strawberry sauce and gelato, with yuzu foam and almond streusel. Another dish with fun textures, but this was a nice bit of sweetness without being too sweet, either. The yuzu flavors could have been more pronounced but this was wonderful as is. 

I'll be keeping MOzen in mind- the incredible dining room views and exclusive location make this a good special occasion spot. The RW lunch menu also looks like a great value, and allows diners to try several dishes bento-style to get a feel for the restaurant's quality and diversity.",2016-06-14 07:04:17

While it's a little pricier compared to the all-you-can-eat salad bar I can get across the street at Jason's Deli, Chopt offers a unique concept.  You pick the salad you want from their menu (or build your own) and then you're taken to one of the chopping stations with your designated chopper.  You watch in amazement as the chopper pulls out a machete-looking tool and goes to work on your salad.  You can have them chop it as much or as little as you want.  I stopped somewhere in between with my Cobb Salad.  I then opted for the healthier Greek yogurt tzatziki dressing instead of my normal blue cheese one, which turned out to be delicious, and I didn't even notice the difference.  

It was pretty crowded inside and out, but we found a nice table right along the window, so we got to enjoy the sunshine.  The salads were sized ""just right"" for me, and it was fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back, but I wish their salads were priced a little bit lower for me to return more often.",2015-12-07 17:00:48

Yes it is that bad I know the menu by number. And if you aren't adventurous to try the Asian sandwiches, they have an American menu of ham and cheese, and whatever else I don't pick up that you can get at Subway.

Tips:

- Free for U of T students! (safe bet if you pick up your ticket at the campus)
- Free on Wednesday nights!
- Even better if you buy a ticket because the Gallery definitely deserves our support.

I get pretty frustrated with tasting menus that have the fancy hype about it, focused on the plating and giving you the bare minimum of hardly any bite fulls to fully taste it and also fancy prices with out the fancy taste. 
But Doma did not disappoint!
It can be a bit hefty for the tasting menu but I am glad I did it - got to taste the whole entire menu and as I mentioned worth it. Amazing. 
My favorite was the Tuigim and the Ushun Mandoo. Quite flavorful and every bite was a new experience. Good size portions to get the full taste. I was pretty content with it all and left fully satisfied. 
I would and have recommended it to friends as well. I would go back and I now know which I would order. Hopefully when I do go back that the consistency will be there, because I have given some places great reviews because I was blown away, only to come back, order the same and have it taste not as good as the first time. 
I've read that this place is korean - french but this yelp section says Korean Canadian.

My family has been going here since before I was born - and the store's traditions date back to the early 1900s. Even though we moved away from the area about 14 years ago, once in a while, we still make the trek to grab some bagels, pastries, and mini pizzas from Gryfe's. 

 There is nothing like a Gryfe's bagel - especially when you eat them fresh in the early morning. While they ship them to some Toronto grocers such as Pusateri's, Bruno's, and the Kitchen Table, they're still the best eaten right out of Gryfe's bagel shop on Bathurst. 
Gryfe's has a long history in this neighbourhood and, through the years, their quality has stayed the same. It's a classic Toronto stop for many - from police officers to old-time fans and it's even been mentioned in fictional books where the story takes place in Toronto. 

They're the perfect bagels and with the combination of chewy, light, fluffy, and soft, and classic options such as poppy seed, flax seed, sesame, and multigrain (to name a few), you can't go wrong with one - or a dozen ($7.20/dozen).

When we got near the entrance we noticed a man sitting on a stool, taking to another man in a nice dress shirt. Their conversation wasn't too appropriate but I could get past it since it was late.

Any way, we were asked to show our IDs, something we never had to do here. While we were showing our IDs we could hear loud music from inside, almost like we were entering a nightclub. Strange, thought we were going to a restaurant.

When we did get in, the sign said to seat yourself which was fine since there was a DJ playing loud/awful music, while dancing like an idiot. After we found a seat in the dinning area, which was 75% full already, a waitress came over and RUDELY said ""this section is closed!"" and walked away.

How was this possible when the dinning area was nearly full and the sign said to seat yourself? The bar area was full too. Both my wife and I were furious and walked out. The man whom was dressed nice, assuming the manager, just looked at us while we left and said nothing. NOBODY CARED!!!!

I ate around them as best I could, but that proved difficult. I stopped after eating 2.5 people-servings of rice. Seriously, they give you a lot.

But when Kent P. messaged me afterwards to let me know that the ENTIRE menu was vegetarian, my brain exploded. It's like the entire meal was an M. Night Shyamalan movie. I literally could have ordered anything off the menu and it would have been meat-free. I'm docking a star because I wish this had been made more obvious to me, the dumb customer.

Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after ""Buffalo Bill"", the cowboy showman...but ""Bills"" is an acronym for ""Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls"").
I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:)
Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask? 
Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know.
Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year.
So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:)
It's our good fortune, really. 
I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs.
And yet, they're just hot dogs. 
Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs.
The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me).
They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc. 
And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs!
And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs!
It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's. 
In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:

     o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat
     o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!

* Ordering
     o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down (""sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)
     o Bianco's - ""You want what on that pizza?!?! Chris will not make ""his"" pizza that way""! ""Did you get my wine and cheese order Mr. Shaved Head-non-responsive bartender at Bar Bianco...hello...hello""? ""Yes, I know I told you check with me every hour during the wait, but now that's annoying me""

* Price
     o Ted's - 2 foot longs and diet coke for $11? That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)
     o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)

For the local ""Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division"", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:)
Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!",2009-06-06 21:05:41

Still a decent meal if you do the combo, where I chose the soup, salad and a dessert at the end for about $35. Not bad for Montreal.

I was more letdown by the ordering service. I don't know if it was a Yelp issue or a restaurant issue.

Overall the food was fine, though all three dishes tasted fairly similar. I'm limited to the vegetable options so I basically just had vegetables wrapped up three different ways.
Pan fried vegetable roll: this was my least favorite. The outside was a strong taste of overcooked eggs. 
Vegetable Dumplings: these were very tasty. Filling was great and the dumplings were light and fluffy
Vegetable crepe: this was my favorite. I've had vegetable crepes before but this one was much more flavorful. 
Puffy egg custard tart: not my jam. The custard was very eggy and I just didn't care much for the flavor. From what I understand about this dish, it was pretty spot on for flavor and this was more of a personal preference.

I appreciate that so much. My parents only live about 10 minutes from the airport, so travel here is a breeze. Also, cause it is such a small airport, you can arrive about an hour before your flight and be totally fine. If you are an experienced traveller or don't have a lot of stuff or big group, that is. It is ok to park in front of the airport for a short period of time. There is also longer term parking available. The airport also has bus, shuttle, taxi, and rental car service. 

American Airlines is the only airline that flies here. That does suck. I remember the days when we had like 3 options. Flying to Champaign will frequently cost you more than flying to Bloomington - another airport close by (about 45 minutes away). Lately, I have been lucky and Champaign has been cheaper. Staff at the aiport are frequently performing multiple jobs. Secruity is quick once they are actually set up to go. No long walks to your gate at our small airport. All the gates are in one big open sitting area. Get through security and you're there. I also can blow my parents a kiss as they can see my through the secuity door (it's our tradition). 

As others have mentioned, this is a no frills airport. There used to be a little diner, but I never used it anyway. I get there right before I go. I have never experienced significant delays though have been asked to give up my seat before. No problemo to fly later since my parents live so close. Though you do run the risk of having issues with later flights. The biggest issues with flights appear to be from Chicago to Champaign at night. I think my brother, dad, and I have all had at least one cancelled flight.

I waited a long time before the server to come back. When I told her the issue, she said nothing, walked away, and then came back with a plate with a slice of swiss cheese and a side of mayo. No apology or anything, and by this time my burger was not even warm and the cheese didn't get to melt like I would have liked. The burger was a good size and looked good, but there was no flavor at all. About 3 bites in the bun completely fell apart and I just gave up eating it and finished the fries, which were good.

I asked if she would let them know in the kitchen, but she said those are the buns they use, that's it.

The stylists in this Japanese salon really take the time to listen to the style you're after and will painstakingly arrange your hair so there isn't a curl out of place.  When you call to book an appointment, you'll be asked if there's any particular stylist you'd like to book.  Rest assured, in Japan an apprenticeship lasts for 7 years so you won't be getting a rando student going Edward Scissorhands at your head. 

While the shop itself isn't the most luxurious, it helps you walk away with ya hair did and your pocketbook happy - $30 will buy you a cut, and the treatments and digital perms at basement-bargain deals of about $100 for long hair.

We were the only ones in there! Perhaps, its the inconspicuous location that is leading to lower levels of traffic? Or maybe it was simply because everything was closing down by the time we arrived. Well it didn't matter at this point; we were definitely hungry so we ordered a few things off the menu. At first, I wasn't sure if it would be enough food, but I was definitely wrong. I was so full! 

First I tried the duck confit bao ($4.99) - The confit itself was a little bit dry and not as succulent as you would expect from a confit. It was also- from what I can remember a little but unseasoned. It didn't taste like there was enough salt. What really made this bao sub-par was the dry bun. It just made everything even worse. 

The Japanese fried chicken bao ($4.69) was much better. Maybe its in my head, but I feel like anything fried Japanese style tastes so good! Karaage and tempura are two must have for me at every sushi outing. It was nice to have it in the bao form. The meat was juicy and well seasoned. Unlike the duck confit bao, this one was much better which means that, yes, they can serve a moist bao. 

Their Beef bulgogi banh mi ($6.89) was actually good. To be honest, my only other experience with banh mi is from foody mart, so I really have no solid baseline to compare this with. But I think if someone were hungry and they were to eat this sandwich with a bao, they would be full. What I can say about this is that it needs a more sauciness going on. Bulgogi sauce is so good so more of it in the sandwich would make it much better. 

Pork belly taco ($4.69) was probably my least favourite item. The tortilla was hard, as if it was microwaved. Needless to say, it could have been better in a well steamed bao. The pork belly itself is not the usual melt-in-your- mouth pork belly as it was quite hard. The fat needs to be cooked longer in order to get that desired state. 

Bulgogi kimchi fries ($6). These fries were delicious. As an added bonus, all of your concerns about satiation will be wiped out with a few bites. Even split between two people, these fries are really filling. They are saucy (which I love if you cant tell already) and the kimchi is buried beneath layer of meat.

Apparently it's a challenge to replace these bulbs, more so than with most cars (according to my regular auto place), so I was told to go to a dealership. Enter Larry Miller Nissan. 

When we arrived at the service center there were a couple cars ahead of us. We walked into the office and waited a few minutes before anyone addressed us. After I told them what I needed, they said it might be as long as an hour and a half because they were slammed. The guys in there weren't super friendly, but if they were really that busy I understand...I thought it was weird that it could take 90 minutes to replace a bulb, but whatever, it's better than getting a ticket. I was also quoted a price of about $80 for parts and labor...The bulb price was $30, so that's $50 in labor. I know it's supposed to be a tougher install process than most, but $50 for labor? If I hadn't already been in the office and knew that they had the part and could do it same day, I may have left. I just kept telling myself that it's better than getting a ticket...

After giving them the keys, we walked over to the showroom and (of course) were approached immediately by a member of their sales staff. The guy seemed friendly enough, and asked us what kind of car we had currently. After I told him, he said ""oh you know, we've got the Nissan Versa here...It's really popular and it's only $11,900"". I don't know why, but this rubbed me the wrong way (probably because I just heard the price and time estimate for the headlight). This guy has no idea what we're shopping for, and no idea what our budget is, so why recommend their cheapest option? I was expecting him to ask what we were look for or what our budget is and go from there...Again, probably me overreacting, but it bugged me.

We left and got some food and came back around an hour and a half later. When we checked in, they said ""it's still going to be a few minutes. We're still slammed"". I ended up in the waiting room for another 35-40 minutes until the car was done. In the end, it was 2+ hours and $86 to get a headlight replaced.

2 stars because the guy was apologetic at the end about the wait and because the repair included a car wash...I think I'll try somewhere else though if my car ever needs something else dealer specific.",2011-11-06 00:04:21

This place is okay. It is probably very much on par with Don Tortaco, but a little pricier for some reason. 

We each ordered our favorites. 

- breakfast burrito, just cheese, potatoes, and eggs

- carne asada nachos

The portion sizes were healthy, as expected. However, the scrambled eggs in the breakfast burrito were a bit runny. It was also pretty greasy. I know this may sound like a rediculous complaint given the nature of what I'm talking about, but CVE manages to do it without all the grease. This definitely took away from the overall taste, in my opinion.

The carne asada nachos was also pretty freakin' massive! The meat was cooked well and tasty. 

All that said, it still wasn't as good as Chili Verde, which is now the measuring stick for these type of places, as far as I'm concerned.

It wasn't bad. It was okay. But at the prices they charge, I can grab Don Tortaco for about the same quality and less money. If I had my choice though, I would just stick with Chili Verde Express as the best of the bunch!

Probably a one and done for me...but its alright...

You get your burger and fries (included) on a wooden plank and have ample places to choose to sit. The booths are super comfy and there is room for large groups at the tables. They have three TVs all unfortunately located on one wall so only half the restaurant can view them.

First thing you notice when walking into this tiny shop is that this place needs a reno, stat.  You know when hipsters purposely find a hole-in-the-wall place and carry mismatched, vintage plates across well-worn, old-skool wooden or laminate floors?  Yeah, this ain't that.  This is genuine article, just plain old.
No A/C, floors look sticky, wall paint is peeling.  
Don't ever use the bathroom if you're of delicate sensibilities.

The eggs benedicts are very so-so. The kitchen is cordoned off by a high divider, so I can't say this for sure, but I'm pretty sure the hollandaise is not house-made.  It tastes like hollandaise made of margarine.  On the plus side, they are very generous and will add extra on top if you ask for it.  On the down side, you will soon realize you really don't want it.  Eggs are poached OK.  Solid but not rubbery whites, runny yolk on the inside.  I'm not a fan of peameal bacon, and this one had a very strong porky smell - I guess great if you like peameal, not so great if you don't.

Also ordered a stack of 3 chocolate chip pancakes.  
Not bad, just regular ol' pancakes that taste like they're made from a box mix...

I really struggled about posting this because I wish success for the kindly owners.  It would be great to have a locally owned breakfast spot in Markham.  As a customer, here are the changes I'd hope for:
- Renovation!  The run-down look is not only uncomfortable, it's hard to keep clean.  A large ant ran across my table at one point.  It was just an ant, so I kept it to myself and discretely smushed it.  The sticky floors, walls, tables (pretty much sticky everything); the unfinished bathroom; the thick/hot, humid air...
- Source another hollandaise made of actual butter.  Best would be house-made hollandaise.  It takes a lot of egg yolks, but if you invest in the eggs you can use the egg whites for...
- House-made pancakes, if they're not already, are super easy and inexpensive to make.  The pancakes I had were a little dense on texture.  There are a few techniques to make pancakes fluffy, including whipping the egg whites for the batter.

B&T varies from the ever popular T&T line of grocery stores (of which I find carrys more Chinese and Taiwanese selections). This isn't  independent shop though, it's part of a chain. B&T Ben Thanh has other locations in Hamilton and Kitchener.

There's some quirkiness to an smaller store operation like this. For example ; the weird signage abound, ""slow door"" sign by the sliding exit doors,  there's a microwave by the baked good section with a sign on it ""to all valued customers
microwave is for b&t personal and employees only. Sorry!

As the previous reviewer mary l. mentioned, things like sour sop fruit are available here. Not found at T&T.

Appears they have a contract with FV foods because I saw a lot of their sweets baked goods here. On the shelves, I saw the individual jars of ingredients to make your favorite Vietnamese dessert drink or Filipino halo halo. Everything was reasonably priced too.

In the back there is a meat and seafood counter - which is the large contributor to the awful odor. There is no bakery. However they do bring small selection of baked goods from various local suppliers.

My checkout experience was painfully slow. I lined up behind a lady who was touting I thought at the time 1 grocery cart (oh goody! :) ), but it turned out to 2 grocery carts (burn on me). There were only 2 cashiers open. Be aware they charge a fee if debit transactions are less than $10.

When we arrived, we got water promptly and I ordered my Miami ice beverage- the drink is non-alcoholic. It was made with mango puree, ice tea and fresh mint. I liked it for a non-alcoholic drink as it was something out of the ordinary, not just simple juice or flavored soda. I also really like mojitos so this would be the closest thing I could get.

It was time to order our food. I really didn't know what to get so I opted for pasta. My usual pasta dish that I would order is a seafood fettuccine, they had a cajun seafood fettuccine. I asked if there was another option other than Cajun since I can't take spicy food and the server said they could just do tomato. I was really looking forward to the pasta as I was hungry since the food was taking a little long. 
*please do take note that even though we were a big group, they split our groups up so essentially my group was 7 people.

Once I had I got my pasta I thought something was a little off and eventually I found this pasta burning my mouth. I barely touched the noodles and tried to finish the seafood. Even my bf who takes spicy food thought this was hot. 
I know they were busy as my other friends in the group were waiting for their food and I don't even think i got a refill of water as i remember finishing my drink and water and feeling thirsty especially after the spicy food.

I'm a fan of light, fluffy cheesecakes, and this one was dense and thick.. but not disgusting, just not my style of cheesecake. 

It tasted more like that cheap Richtree Market cheesecake I ate that had modified cream cheese and so on.

Can't say I'll go back for this cheesecake. Carole's Cheesecake in Yorkville is much, MUCH better in my opinion.

Tried the Lemon Bar which tasted very sweet and very lemon-y. A bit too sweet.

I felt like I was eating dishwashing detergent, but then again, lemon as the only flavour in a tart or a cake is very hard to pull off without reminding me of dish soap.

For $2, it was not worth it for me (personally).

The whole cakes seem like a better deal. For $8 you get a big loaf of cake, and it was all right but nothing to write home about.

I would have preferred that the cakes do NOT have this thick coat of sugary white icing (they are sweet enough as is)...

If you think that a (cup)cake is about the cake, YOU ARE WRONG.  Do not pass Go.  Return to sender.  And so, having chosen the losing side in the battle, you can pleasantly skip Main Street Cupcakes. 

If, however, you are on the side of rightness and goodness and warm soft puppies and you believe in the power of icing, then Main Street Cupcakes is the thin needle through which wondrous sucrose heroin flows.  

Because their cupcakes are lopsided affairs, the icing sagging to one side like an old Baltimore lady with a stiff bouffant, and almost all the flavor is in the icing.  The icing is delicious. It is flavorful, not that crappy cream cheese frosting that evil folk like, but the kind of rich frosting you can leave visible thumbprints in.

...and it has cake underneath.  

People get pissy because OMG I CAME HERE AND I DIDN'T GET CUPCAKES, but that's part of the charm.  They open up in the morning with a set supply of cupcakes, and when they're sold out - which they always do - they close the doors.  Not only does that set up a lovely racing situation where it makes the cupcakes more special, but come on!  Who doesn't wanna live that kind of life? You get up at 6:00 to make your cupcakes, and when the day's done you go home.  Don't be a hata.  

Also, you know, it means when you GET the cupcakes, they're fresh.  I'm sure you could make a case that HEY, THEY SHOULD BE COOL FOR MY CONVENIENCE AND BAKE INFINITE CUPCAKES THAT STAY ON THE SHELF UNTIL THEY'RE CRUSTY AND OLD, but the truth is when you get a Main Street Cupcake, the clock is ticking.  It lasts about thirty-six hours before it dries out and you're done.  These are natural cupcakes.  

Plus, the cupcakes come in a variety of flavors, they're always experimenting.  That's great.  

So it's five stars if you're on the side of the angels and their delectable frosting, Main Street Cupcakes is for you.  If you're on the side of, you know, cake, then I guess you can go somewhere else.  They probably cater to your kind.  Not that I'd sit next to you.",2011-01-17 00:12:39

Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper. 

All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!

When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.

For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.

On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.

On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer. Most of the steaks were great and the dessert was only fair.

Complimentary valet parking is nice, as there is not much street parking nearby.

Sullivan's is a higher-end steak joint and works hard to earn that high dollar menu.",2014-12-22 19:12:07

They don't have much to offer to outsiders and tourists but they do food very well.   If for some reason you do find yourself in Ohio, make a trip up to Cleveland and visit the West Side Market.

This place is an eye sore from the outside, but a jewel on the inside.  It is amazing all the foods you can consume, and I tried a little of everything from pastry's, cookies, pies, desserts, and super deep fried perogies, to olives, cheeses, bratwurst,  pulled pork and crepes.  

I walked the entire market, buying everything I could that looked tasty or looked unique.  Everything was excellent, but I saved the best for last...Steve's Gyros.

The line for this place was ridiculous, I actually started waiting in line outside the market in the truck drop-off area, and was in line for at least an hr...probably more like an hour and a half but want to look at the positive.  

Impatient, in a rush to get back to Columbus, and starving, I am getting anxious and psyche myself out thinking that these gyros will not be anything too special.

I order two gyros that are made with their special blend of lamb, beef and spices that constantly spins on a spic and cooks itself into this amazing, crispy, juicy meat and put into pita bread with Steve's own special Tzatziki, made with garlic, olive oil, cucumbers, and lemon.  

Gyro comes super fat, with the biggest size only running you $8 which sounds like alot at first but is totally worth your money, and the taste of the gyro will tell you why.  I have always been a gyro fan but had no idea they could be this damn good.  
The line was something that would make me consider never going back there but they are too freaking good!!
Cleveland ROCKS!!!
After receiving your gyro, take a seat on a table or sidewalk outside the market and dig in.  You will not be disappointed.",2012-03-07 08:53:05

I've eaten at several of the KFH's in so cal and i feel it's the best casual seafood place around.  Most of the fish prices ( comes with 2 side dishes - about 12 different sides to choose from )  are in the $15-$25 range.  Of course, if you hit them for king crab legs or lobster you are gonna pay !

The KFH is on par with my past experiences at the other location,   we started with some sashimi.  i gotta admit, i feel that they shouldn't have sushi at KFH but given my diet, it's a perfect starter. sashimi - yellowtail and salmon.  both were decent, not stellar but hit the spot.  

I had the charbroiled ono, spinach and cole slaw - all good ! Sis had the ahi tuna - seared, red potatoes and veggies.  The kids had salmon and shark ( i was surprised they went with the non-kids menu items ) They loved it.

Part of the Amelie's appeal is the unique ambiance, but at this location it feels as though they've tried making an exact replica; right down to the stainless steel kitchen utensil chandelier and striped walls.

Resting in the heart of Uptown, the vibe isn't as chill.  Parking, as you can imagine, is a challenge, and the line situation is out of control.  I'm sure this location is more alluring to those that work Uptown, but for a relaxing coffee and pastry pitstop, it just doesn't work.

Serving as the master pastry kitchen for all of their locations, this one is much larger.  At certain times you can see the chefs working their magic behind the glass.  There is an area upstairs that is closed off for private events only.  Seating is still limited, simply due to the undying popularity.  Be careful if you sit at the back bar by the window facing MLK.  You have a view of legs shuffling by and you are positioned right beneath the main blower vents for the HVAC system.  

Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the quality of the pastries, sandwiches, and service are less than those in the NoDa location.  Will I continue to visit the Uptown location from time to time?  Sure, but only based on the convenience factor.  If I had my choice I'd always opt for the original.  If it ain't broke...",2016-05-22 19:05:50

This was a great assortment of charcuterie, cheeses, bread and olives. We ordered a Margherita and a Gotham pizza. The pizza was a good thin crust wood oven pizza with a New York meets gourmet twist. Pizza was very flavorful and the crust had a good chew, except for the center of both pies. When we looked closer at the slices we did notice they were stretched a little too thin in the center making the point of the slices a little droopier than normal.

The concept is like a food truck or fast food restaurant with tables inside as well as more in the patio. You approach the counter and order your meal from a menu posted on a big sheet of poster sized paper. All prices listed include tax and they will cross off the items that are sold out each day.

Once you order, they give you a number display and you find a table anywhere on the premises. They also have a full bar to order beer on tap or rail drinks. I order their recommend double stack burger which was amazing. My friends wanted to try to brisket and philly steak sandwich.  Next time, I will definitely order the brisket and ribs when I have a bigger appetite.

The patio is larger than the inside so I am unsure whether they will operate during the winter due to size and location. They need to maximize the summer season by encouraging more people to come with great music from a live DJ. There is plenty of street parking as well as a few lots including a supermarket nearby. 

I called them to ask about reservations which they told me that it's first come first serve. However, I believe if you are a regular, they will make an exception as i saw the reservation signs whipped out when we left.

I was visiting the charming Old Town Scottsdale area because I wanted to hit up some local coffee bars and after a less than stellar stop at the nearby Cartel Coffee, I found Berdena's. It's tucked away and a bit tricky to find, but I'm so happy I decided to stop in. 

The unassuming little coffeehouse is small with just a few tables. There aren't any sofas or fluffy chairs with that ""please hang out for hours"" vibe, yet I noticed several locals hanging out and working on laptops or listening to music. In fact, the locals were super friendly while I was an obvious visitor, they even chatted me up.

The super cute and friendly barista welcomed me in and offered to help me with the small menu. He made several suggestions and told me all of their specialties (including hot tea and avocado toast), but when I settled on a boring cappuccino, he gave me the warmest smile and said ""it's always a great choice to go with the classics."" Swoon! 

He also talked me into the special baked good of the day, a tahini chocolate chip and sea salt cookie for $2. This cookie -- oh my god, it was full of salty, buttery goodness. Not too sweet either, and the chocolate chips were incredibly delicious. I loved this cookie (although it didn't really look as tasty as it actually was). 

When I got my coffee, I was shocked at how unbelievably gorgeous it was. No, really. Look at my photo: there's no filter. This was taken my me, an average photographer at best, with my iPhone's camera. The picture looks like a professional shot it because the cappuccino was so stunning and Insta-worthy. I almost hated to drink it because LOOK AT THAT BEAUTY!

The cappuccino tasted as great as it looked and was worth every penny of its $3.50 price tag. I love an establishment that takes great pride in its product, and this was one of the most beautiful coffees I have ever been served anywhere on the planet. 

There are a couple of minor negatives: they only have real sugar and no artificial sweetener (I know fake sugar is blasphemous in the world of artisan / Third Wave coffee, but some of us have health issues that mean we must use Splenda or Equal), and as others have reported, service is very slow. Although I was the only person ordering, it took nearly 15 minutes for me to get my cappuccino. Great coffee art takes time and I appreciate that, but make note that this probably isn't the best place to come if you're in a rush.

I do like my curry spicy, but getting the sauce right is crucial for a good curry dish! Back to the test kitchen for this one.

I can agree with most on the valet; the guys are really nice but there's tons of other spots to park at if you aren't super lazy and wanna cross the street (or head next door).

The first visit (months ago) was doomed from the beginning. My girlfriend and I were looking for an alternate to Chinese and found Noodles Ranch. We were impressed by the decor and how busy they were. We waited patiently for a table to open up. In the meanwhile, we were never acknowledged or told how long the wait was. It's not that often that I walk out of a restaurant for any reason. Being ignored is one of my pet-peeves.

This past week offered redemption for Noodles Ranch. One of my co-worker foodies suggested Vietnamese. I'm glad he did because I've enjoyed this cuisine before, just not at Noodles Ranch... 

The service was better this visit. It wasn't perfect, but that's probably due to the lunch crowd. We were greeted and seated very promptly. The lunch special featured a pot sticker, miso soup (or salad) and a few entree options. The plum and lemon-grass chicken was delicious. Everything was nice and hot and the portion was perfect. Clearly, our meal was cooked to order, so I can forgive the time we waited for the food to arrive. And kudos for providing only chop sticks in the place settings. I am sure they have forks, but those should be by request only.

Seeing how Noodle Ranch redeemed itself, I will be more than happy to visit again for another healthy, delicious meal.",2016-08-15 08:21:27

My friend and I were in town for a WWE event at the US Airways Arena, and decided to stop in here for food and drinks beforehand. We took a spot at the bar and was pleased to see a great selection of Happy Hour specials - both food and drink.

We ordered the house soft pretzels with cheese dip ($5) and the Antipasti plate ($8) to share, and each ordered one of their toasts ($4) - my friend went with the roasted peppers and boursin cheese, and I opted for the chicken liver pate. The soft pretzel order was HUGE - I've seen portions half the size for much more at brewpubs - and were DELICIOUS. The toasts were a nice surprise - ample portions, and great quality ingredients. The chicken liver pate was divine - so smooth and creamy. The Antipasti plate provided an ample portion of meats and cheeses, all great quality. At $11/person, we were happily stuffed with bar munchies of the highest caliber.

Beer selection here is limited, but they do offer some decent options. Guinness, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, an IPA from Deschutes, and their local selection was the famous Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, that seemed to be everywhere I went in Phoenix. (They also had a Hefeweizen, but I don't remember where from.) At $3 for the local brew and $4 for the others, this is a great Happy Hour option.

The menu had a lot of variety with an extensive list of drinks (non-alcoholic, beers, wines, soju) and dishes. Dishes here are typically small plates meant for sharing. There are also set course menus offered where a 10/15 course meal is presented for a set price. This ends up being cheaper than ordering each dish individually, especially when dining with a large crowd. There is a minimum order required on the set course menus of 2 orders. The dishes seem to be priced decently but when they arrived, they were smaller than expected. In the end, because of the small size of dishes, the bills ended up being quite high. I still think it was worth it because of how much fun the ambience of the restaurant is. 

There's yelling, there's sake bombs, there's clapping, there's table pounding, it's all present at this Izakaya. Every time someone orders a Sake Bomb, the whole restaurant knows about it and cheers for them as they chug. The layout is what is typical of a Japanese Izakaya i've heard, with low wooden tables and cushions to sit on. This one in particular had a long line of smaller tables by the windows, a long bar and then bigger booths at the back. Quite a small restaurant, but the space was used well. The booths are unique where you have to take your shoes off when you're seated :)

My introduction to the night-time scene of Plaza Midwood happened here many years ago. When you roll up in one of those 10-person bar-cycles to a tiny hole-in the wall like this you know you're in for an experience. Motorcycles and leather-gilded bearded blokes line the outside of a building in a yellowish color that only appears from years of wear and dis-concern. Valspar doesn't make this color of paint.

The muddy crush-and-run lot is appropriate. The sign seems to perpetually hang precariously over the door. When will those letters fall? Perhaps the opener always re-hangs it when they start the day. Every day. Inside you'll find a cacophony of furniture slapped together to accurately match the litany of strange wall-hangings. Who cares about a theme? The theme? No theme, just stuff.

The bar is always full - usually with the riders and their honeys. Reach through and toss a few bucks on the counter for a PBR. Make it a tall-boy. Carry it to some open space - the tables will be full but chairs a-plenty in a variety of sizes and disrepair. Slap some change in the jukebox. Play something your father used to roll with in his 80s S10 pickup. Or what your mom liked to jive to on the record player. Even better when they cram a country-grunge band in here. It gets loud. The good loud. Visit the restrooms to get an idea for what move you might pull in the bedroom next time (with permission). Drop a stack of quarters on the edge of a pool table and kick back for a chat with one of the many regulars. I've met many a drunkard (no offense intended) that thought I was their best friend here.

My buddy and I arrive at 9 pm and get seated in the ""casual business"" room. Yes... Its the room to the far right of the main dining room. We both were sporting dark jeans and a nice button up shirt, but he was wearing tennis shoes since we came straight from picking him up at the airport. Either way, casual dressed room is fine with me... =)

The overly pleasing waiter hands us our menu and retreats to grab some bread. We give the menu a once over and decide on the biggest cut... The Beef Bowl Cut. Advertised as ""A double sized cut with the rib bone, as served to the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl teams""... How can we go wrong?

The waiter comes back and takes our drink orders. We tell him that we are ready to order and he tells us to wait. What? Wait?! He proceeds to tell us that the cut and sides order is taken after the appetizers and salad when the cool Hindenburg looking cart magically appears.

He returns and brings the salad. They spin and toss it the same way HOPR does it in San Francisco, but we didn't want to ruin his show so we played along... Ooooo.... ahhhh.... Fancy! The salad is refreshing and a must to stay regular in the morning after so much meat! Haha.

We make haste on the salad with the main course on our minds. Finally... The moment we've all been waiting for... The silver blimp mobile cart! The waiter introduces the master carver, Insert Name Here (really, because his name isnt that important and he isnt going to slice you a bigger piece no matter what clever witty line you throw at him), and proceeds to ask us what cut we would like. ""Beef Bowl Cut. medium rare please"", and yes we say please because we are polite! Haha.

Some differences... HOPR comes with a choice of mashed or baked potato with the works. Lawry's only comes with mashed.  HOPR comes with a choice of creamed corned or creamed spinach. Lawry's has those too.... But for a price. I think it was like $6 or something for a scoop of the creamy spinach. Either way, I had to get it just to taste comparison...

The 25oz bone in medium rare prime rib was humongous. Was I going to eat the whole thing? You better believe it! Or die trying...! We dig in. The meat was tender and flavorful. The au jus sauce was a wonderful supporting character to the show. The raw horseradish was the perfect ""you complete me"" condiment and boy did it ever...!

Needless to say, we both made it pretty damn close to finishing it. All that was left was the meat near the bone, which I took home with my unfinished mashed potato and creamed spinach. Yes, it was still pretty good the next morning too!

And after every show there is the..... encore! Yes! HOPR always offers you a complimentary second slice, which is a thin cut, but a nice touch... Lawry's? Nope... Would I have eaten it if they offered it? Probably not... But its the thought that counts!

All in all I would like to say that HOPR still reins supreme in my heart but Lawry's does make a suitable substitute in Las Vegas... Well that is until I try another prime rib joint... And no... The prime ribs they serve in the buffets are nowhere close to the real deal.

This was exceptionally exciting because he is a tour guide, leading people around Las Vegas, Boulder City, and various parts of California. So, when they offered to take me out I knew that I had done the research and it would be a delicious surprise. But I had no idea that it would be this delicious!

Evan's Old Town Grille, situated in the quaint and quirky town of Boulder City, brings a unique Greek feeling to the place. It is a small restaurant, perfect for long conversations, multiple glasses of wine, and that feeling of being one large family. At the end of our visit the owner even made the rounds by all of the tables greeting customers as if they were old and dear friends.

If that is not enough to make you want to visit, then surely the food will! The greek salad has tremendous flavors, filled with olives, feta and fresh tomato. I tried one of the specials for the evening, the Tilapia with dill, and with each bite my tastebuds were singing. The vegetables were roasted to perfection--a hard feat for zucchinis and squashes somedays--and the greek style potato was like a baked potato I had never had before with seasonings roasted into it. There were a few points in the dinner where we were speechless because the food was that good. My culinary companions tried the Lamb Chop special and the Shrimp Scampi. Both said that their meals were delicious, and from the look of how large the shrimp were, I could see why.

For desert we tried a little bit of everything. The chocolate mouse, the limoncello, cheesecake with berries, and (of course) baklava.

Dragon Pearl's been in Inglewood for ages. Seriously! Word is Ian's pushing 30 years in the neighbours. If you've walked passed it in the past, stop in for a bite next time your in the 'hood instead of going on by.

The interior is modestly decorated, dark red-ish walls and paintings to match, two large circular tables, and then perhaps a dozen more smaller settings. The tables are each set with a bowl, plate and chopsticks. No cutlery here right off the bat, although my server asked me if chopsticks were fine or if I'd prefer to have a fork.

I came in for a late lunch and was greeted and immediately seated (as tends to happen with late lunches). My server was as friendly as genuine as they come. Dragon Pearl's got a variety of lunch combinations, all are served with rice and your choice of won ton soup or a spring roll for $9.50. I ordered the chicken cashew dish with a spring roll and a pot of jasmine tea. I love that my whole pot of tea was only $1!

My rice came in its own rice thermos, and the chicken cashew dish was big enough that two people could've easily shared it. The spring roll was fresh with a nice crunch to it when I bit in.

However after I got my order, there were people lined up almost out the door for this place.  So, you'll want to get here either way before the lunch rush, or way after it.

When I came here, I thought ""should I believe the hype around this place?""  Could  I trust Adam Richman and Food Network?  Well, the gyro lived up to the hype.

Costs:  $8 for regular, $10 for jumbo, $2 for soda.

I was hungry, so I thought I might order the jumbo gyro.  Then I saw the staff assemble the regular sized one, and it was so huge, I knew I'd never finish it, let alone a jumbo.

I ordered a regular, no tomato, no onions.  It was AWESOME.  Tons and tons of perfectly seasoned lamb/beef mix, an overly generous helping of Tzatziki, and not too much lettuce.  The meat was tender and juicy and not greasy in the least.

Be advised - as delicious as this gyro is...the taste will remain with you for the rest of the day!   (burp...'scuse me.)

The staff, despite some comments on this page, were very friendly.  The only complaint I have...and this isn't Steve's Gyros' fault.....is there's nowhere to sit and enjoy this awesome gyro.  There's a small upstairs section w/ a few benches to the WSM, but being a noob here, I didn't know how to get up there.  There are also benches in between the two buildings and a small park across the street, but all the benches today were in the shade and it was a bit too chilly to sit there.

So, I ate it in my car.  There was so much toppings on the gyro that much of it fell off onto my shirt and jeans as I was eating it.

Still worth it though.  Best gyros I've had, ever, so far.

Did not know any sushi places so I asked my Nav system to find one for me....and it did find Akai Hana Sushi & Grill. Inari is a very simple sushi, it is a fried tofu pocket, or could be a cone, filled with rice and topped with sesame seeds, soy sauce and a bit of wasabi. Simple but good and I have had them all over the world. Usually they come in a small tray, what has 5 or 4 if they are big inari, some pickled vegetables, a dollop of wasabi and cost between $4-5 bucks. Just pour on some soy, brush some wasabi, put some pickled stuff on top and chomp away...delicious. While the inari at Akai Hana were fine, it was the price for what I got that was a bit out of line. I got 4 regular size inari, in a large take out box and it was almost $6.....or about $1.50 each, whereas in most every other place they are just shy of $1 each. Maybe I am just cheap, but as well as taste, atmosphere and personal, I judge the ""away from home"" eating experience with an equal emphasis on cost.

Double props for the vegetarian and gluten free menus for those that have dietary restrictions. And, final props go to the delish fried plantains, which took me back to the MIA and its fabulous Cuban fare. I only wish that more than 3 were served as part of the side of my fish tacos. 

The bad and the ugly: Our server... who looked at two admittedly dressed-down chicks, and pretty much ignored us for most of the meal. After waiting for close to an hour after placing our order (which included a break at about 35 minutes when the server came back to confirm our order and said she may have placed our order incorrectly), our food was served super cold. To the manager's credit, our plates went back to the kitchen, and hot food was brought to our table with a quickness. 

Considering this place was pretty much deserted while we were dining and Tommy's overall priceyness ($15 for 3 small-ish fish tacos; $5 for a blue moon; and $20 mushroom tart), I left wishing that I had tried one of the many other fabulous restos in Town Square.

Jellyfish Salad - Probably one of my favorite things here. Like the garlicy taste but again really expensive. Don't think the small plate is worth $8.

Five spiced Eggplant - Also liked this one. Sauce is kind of ketchupy and vinegary.

Braised Beef Noodle Soup - Beef is really delicious, tender, and flavorful. Soup is kind of flavorless. Doesn't have the ""Beef Noodle Soup"" taste like ones in Taiwan. Had this twice. The first time the noodles were overcooked. Second time they were better and were more QQ.

Braised Minced Pork over Rice - Tastes like how I make it except has no ginger or shallot flavor, so pretty good.

Dandan noodles - This did not taste good. Was not spicy and tasted like peanut butter and vinegar??

I ordered the butter chicken which at the time honestly did taste more like an italian, rose style sauce with chicken so because this place was supposed to specialize in Indian Cuisine I was a little confused. Also the dishes are not served with rice, this offers more of a selection I suppose but it is also a little silly when every meal *requires* you purchase rice seperately. 
The portions I do feel are large but the food I found was delicious, even if it wasn't the most authentic I did enjoy the meal very much. 

Service wise I was not impressed though, besides that warm and lovely greeting from the host or possible owner, the waitress was not attentive and left us waiting for long periods of time. Another downside to almsot anywhere in Toronto it seems now is parking, the street parking only goes to 8:30 or 9pm I believe so while we were waiting for our server parking enforcment could have shown up at anytime which would have forced us to run over and intervine. Not something you want to be worrying about when your trying to enjoy your dining experience.

Large enough patio was fairly comfortable but there weren't many people when I was there so I wonder how comfortable it would be packed.

BF and I got  

Basil Scallops - for $12, they are generous with the scallops and the flavor of the basil was great on this with fresh, properly cooked scallops. Loved this. 

Tofu Pad See You (their spelling, which is cute) - this was good as far as noodles go. Slightly sweeter than usual places and more heavy on the egg. I didn't mind it only because no matter what I always put a little bit of chili vinegar on mine to be tangy sweet but it may be a bit saccharine for some.

 No karaoke that night being done, but had music playing that sounded almost like a recording of karaoke which was funny and odd. 

It left a good enough impression that the BF wanted to get scallops there again so we went back a week later. 

This time we got scallops with ginger which was good, but bit too gingery for the BF and he preferred the basil style instead. 

We also got tofu garlic pepper which was in a garlicky gravy like sauce. The garnish was generous with lettuce which I thought was kinda odd, but somehow worked well into being part of the dish when it was slightly wilted. 

This time there was a guy with a guitar singing which was alright since the level wasn't too loud in there. It seems a lot of the complaints is because of the provided entertainment. I don't get it, I don't prefer it, but if I have to I won't mind so long as I can still have a conversation and be able to tune it out to background noise.

I read the other reviews and it seems like the proceeding days were worst than the day I went. From a distant the tent looks like Baymax laying on the floor. Haha. Surprisingly, parking on the dirt road was $10 (luckily we had cash on hand). 

We tried to register our wrist bands which was a waste of time because the machines kept messing up due to the sunlight. As I scanned my band to participate in the activities, another person's information appeared instead of my own. Fail. 

The most exciting part of the experience was the ""training"" area. Since we went the first day, the lines weren't as long and all of the machines were functioning. They didn't function very well (Iron Man and Hulk training activity), but they still worked. The laser maze and rock wall were the best training activities, but I felt like I could have done the rock wall at a real rock climbing gym. 

Our mortal bodies grew weak. We needed sustenance! And everything was overpriced (as expected) and tasted worst than Subway. 

The second part of the training dealt with learning about several villains such as Red Skull and Madame Hydra. It was kind of... Dumb. We couldn't really hear the interactive screens that gave brief infos about each villains because of the loud music and chattering going on around us. 

As we proceeded into the 3D dome area, we pretty much strained our necks as we had to look up the whole time while the show was projected onto the ceiling. This made me pretty dizzy and caused a headache.

HbSYkMTQGbotQ9RKxJlkyA,eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA,YYWkJwfO1HApuHiW-8eq7Q,4,2,2,2,"This pizza joint is a youngling still that replaced the only pizza parlour in Vistancia that closed about half a year ago. At first, my husband and I instantly thought that this place just changed its name and still had the same menu, but it's a different pizza entirely, and I love it that much more. 

Papa John's and Barros are very convenient and they deliver to the Vistancia community, but I love this New York pizza so much more than the so called ""Chicago style"" Barros pizza (which it's really not), that I don't mind driving here to get it instead of having other pizzas delivered. 

Instead of serving soggy large slices, the slices have a texture similar to Peter Piper. I know that sounds bad, but despite the thinness, the slices actually have substance, which is a really good thing. But you know how Peter Piper has the stigma that people are afraid to admit that they like it, well, Stevie's Pizza actually has the real  taste to back it up. You can tell the ingredients are fresh, and even the staff is proud to serve it. (It seemed like the previous pizza place that this one replaced, the staff hated being there, but I noticed the staff at this new one actually cares about being there).  There's something to be said about service and food quality going hand in hand and that's the reason we keep returning here. 

I'd say even for people who don't live in the Vistancia community, it is worth the drive out here to try this New York style pizza. It's a refreshing change compared to the hundreds of pizza chains out there.",2014-01-01 03:22:30

If I thought lunch here was already outstanding, dinner kicked it up a couple of notches higher!  Aside from more menu items being available during dinner, the mood and ambiance of this restaurant is way nicer.  The place was nearly full of people, the sushi chefs were having fun, and there's just this atmosphere perfect for unwinding after a long work week.

Being my second time here, I can say that the food quality and presentation has improved.  I don't know if food is just deliberately more elaborately prepared during dinner service or if it was a planned improvement altogether.  We sampled most of the dinner-only items and the stand outs to me are the sashimi salad, screaming-o, sashimi roll, and the towering poke.  Heck, everything we ordered was fantastic!

One thing I should mention is that while service did seem to lag a bit during Sakana's peak occupancy while we were there, I can tell that it's definitely not due to lack of effort or enthusiasm of the kitchen and wait staff.  Our servers had a great attitude even when things were frantic.  Overall, our food was delivered just as fast as we can eat them and our glasses not empty for very long.

It is the second incarnation of the Orlean's cafe. At the beginning of 2017, the Orlean's spent approximately $2 million dollars transforming the Courtyard Cafe into the more contemporary Copper Whisk Cafe. 

This past October when we stayed at the Orlean's for a week, we had a dinner and a few breakfasts here. Right off the bat, I noticed significant differences from the former Courtyard Cafe that we had been to a few times in the past. The ambiance has improved at the same time that the selection and value has taken a dip. 

On the first night of the vacation, when my dad had spent a day travelling from New York, we decided to hang out in the Orlean's and have dinner in their cafe. I decided on a dinner special. However, there were far fewer here that in the former cafe. I decided on Chicken Alfredo Primavera. It went for $14.99 and included a soup or salad. I ordered a soup. Despite the price increases, I appreciated the cafe tradition of including soup or salad with the entree. Likewise, I appreciated the large serving of Rigatoni pasta, Julienne sliced grilled chicken, creamy Alfredo sauce, and fresh vegetables. It tasted 3 stars as in A-ok. I added slightly more flavor by pouring a small bowl of grated cheese on it. I'd pass over the Garlic Ciabatta bread on the top and right portions of the plate.

During our stay in this faux New Orleans in Vegas, this was our breakfast of choice. The Orlean's Friday's is closed for breakfast and for the price of the Java Detour coffee, we'd be paying 45% towards a breakfast in this sit down restaurant. Disparate from the Java place the lines to the cafe were relatively short. I did observe that there were empty tables and a failure to get people off the line in a timely manner to them. The majority of the time I ordered the American Breakfast either with or without bacon. Being that the days of value are gone, it is $7.99 without bacon and $9.99 with bacon or sausage. That is before the bottomless coffee that is around $3.50. My attitude on the noticeable price increases was that I  live once and I was on vacation. With that said, my American Breakfast included two scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, an English muffin, a slice of cantelope, and sometimes bacon. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite American Breakfast item. There was one morning that I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. At $10.99 this included 2 stacks of pancakes from the following flavors: buttermilk, blueberry, banana, and chocolate chip. Much to my disappointment that I rate 3 stars, they did not blanket the 2  pancakes with blueberry flavored topping and syrup that a restaurant like IHOP would have. The pancakes themselves were blueberry. I'd have no choice but to cover them up with Maple syrup. With every breakfast,the $3.50 cup of coffee was on the par of the Starbuck's served in Java Detour.

   What I really appreciate about this place is that they improved upon the New Orlean's theme. I enjoyed the sights of a more contemporary New Orleans theme. The highlight of the upscale interior are the trumpet lights hanging from the white dome in the center of the room. This drew me into the theme. Adding to the interior  that drew me into a contemporary New Orleans were the brick walls holding iron rails and copper pans. From my observation, the Copper Whisk is more closed in than the Courtyard Cafe was. In this closed in restaurant we'd always sit in the one of two rooms closer to the entrance just a toss away from the sports book. I also observed that the red seats were very comfortable. 

The service was satisfactory. Whether it was dinner or breakfast, we never encountered rude employees, 

Regardless that the former Courtyard Cafe was a star better, I appreciate that the Orlean's has retained their 24 hour cafe unlike some casinos including Bally's, the Rio, and Mirage. As a local, I would not go out of my way to dine here. However, as a local that became a tourist for a week staying at the Orlean's, the Copper Whisk Cafe was our choice for breakfasts and the first vacation dinner.",2018-01-26 03:16:33

(See Picture) I had to come here now. Well, wife and I was at the movie theater seeing the 25th anniversary of Phantom of the Opera! (had to mentioned the play) So we had dinner before the 7:30 showing. Since we were there on a Wednesday, place was empty. We were seated near the center by the stage, Don't know why they wouldn't have seated us at a better location. Any who, John was our server. He asked for our drink order, I ordered a diet coke, arnold palmer, and a strawberry margarita. You can't really go wrong on drinks, but the wife wasn't that impressed with the margarita? We started off with the Volcano Nachos, now when John came back with the drinks. We then proceeded to order our dinner. Now if you see the picture I posted of the nachos, you will realize how stupid it was for us to order our dinner. We did not know how large their nachos were! And would have been nice if John would have told us! I guess he assumed since wife and I have some love handles, that we could have taken care of the nachos and dinner. First! The nachos were very good, had black beans, chicken, green onions, some kind of enchilada sauce! But this beast could have feed at least five people!! Now we asked John to put our dinner in a to go box instead and ended up eating it the next day! We had their fried chicken, with mashed potatoes, green beans. It was very good reheated. Just wondered how good it would have been from the grill? Overall we really liked this place, and would have had a four-star rating. But JOHN! put a smile on your face!

The owner was friendly enough, but was telling the same tired stories to each table about cooking for Jackie Onassis 40 years ago.

Food was uneven--Moussaka itself was reasonably good but the sides were not. Was not impressed with the Baba, Hummus, or Tabbouli and did not find the pita to be edible. The owner was pushing his ""famous"" lemon potatoes which were, unsurprisingly, boiled potatoes with a squirt of lemon juice and a sprinkle of oregano and quite ordinary.

What saves Christos from being banished in the abyss of a two star rating is the prices--at $10-13 per entree in the cultural district. But you always get what pay for and Christos is no exception.

They offer you up to 2 different broths if you ask for it. And they also offer you as many veggies or meat as you can eat any extra not eaten is extra charge. Last time I've been there the service was actually decent. The man sat us down right away and we served pretty quickly but this was pretty near closing so I mean we were pretty much the only customers besides some other people that were already eating. The old man that took our order was very sweet he gave us all the sauces and he taught us how to use them with what meat and etc. he even told us don't drink too much of the soup since it's not homemade soup, and that there's msg in it obviously. I really liked this old man he was a very good server, I felt bad because they stayed like maybe 20 mins past closing just for us to eat. 24.95 for all you can eat hot pot is pretty well worth it in my opinion especially when they allow you to order two soup broths at the SAME TIME. Like they have pots that split in the middle so you can put up to two broths (one really spicy and one healthy broth) and I always like to choose that option bc now there's variety!!

I felt, since my picky brother enjoyed his strange meal that I should at least give it 2 stars. If we are to base it solely on my dish and that of my friends- a one star would more than suffice. That being said, I have to wonder if I should have eaten something other than crepes. I see my fellow trusted yelpers enjoyed their meals- but none of them eat the crepes!

Even if I never had a crepe before, let alone the AMAZING light as a cloud crepes from Paris 66 I would still know the crepes served here are largely inedible. But I am getting ahead of myself.

The place was largely empty when we arrived on a late weekend morning. Only about 3 other tables besides our party of 4. Yet we waited for over an hour for 2 orders of crepes, french toast, and a sandwich. Really? 

Our waitress was not much for conversation. My friend, who is notoriously more picky than my brother requested whipped cream instead of something else in her crepe. At first, the waitress tried to convince her not to change the menu as it would annoy the cooks. After a few minutes of talking she finally accepted my friends request. She wanted to add whipped cream not lobster I don't see what the fuss was about to begin with- bygones.

I ordered a fruit crepe. Which the exception of the cooking outcome resembling a burnt-ish flaming campfire marshmallow, folded up like an egg roll, the taste was boring, burnt, and listless. I eat two bites and put down my napkin. I had no idea one could defile a crepe in such a way until that day. 

My friend that requested the whipped cream. If I thought my crepe saw a rough afternoon her looked like it was literally dropped on the floor a few times then thrown on the plate. Guess they showed her for ordering that whipped cream? I can see now why the waitress warned us not to change the menu. May I suggest that their employees partake in some local anger management meetings?

My brother ordered the savory french toast. Italian made with ham, capicola, salami, pepperoni, and marinara Sauce. He loved it. Then again he also loves McD's and Taco Bell. I did not try his meal, I took his word for it.

My husband ordered a sandwich The Club- he said it was good. Not bad, not great but good.

Like:

- the crowd. I get tired of yuppies, hipsters and the general asshatery that goes with them. Mostly blue collar working folk while I was here, but surely that gets more mixed at times.

- good prices every day of the week

- good beer and full liter mugs... awesome

Don't like:

- service was bad, with one of the staff being the exception. I don't need someone hovering over me but it is nice if they don't disappear either.

- food was only ok

- location blows. i am not one to shy away from run down areas, but a friend lived right down the street from this place many years ago and I had a few situations arise while visiting. 

All in all I like the place and will most likely try again.",2014-08-13 14:42:49

We went to have something on the regular menu. The restaurant is huge. It was busy the entire time we were there. Many of the patrons were Asian which in my opinion is always a very good sign when dinning in an oriental restaurant. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I think we had 5 different people serving us. 

I went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise. Some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp. One of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here. So I had to try it out. Well it was ok, the walnuts were odd almost praline. The shrimp seemed on the verge of being undercooked and a couple of the shrimp were not cleaned well. That just stopped me in my tracks and I couldn't finish. I guess I have been spoiled by my beloved Gina (Big Wong) her walnut shrimp with mayonnaise was incredible! 

We also tried the fried rice and was not impressed here either it was very bland no flavor at all. They served a mountain of it but it just didn't have any taste to it. The egg rolls were crisp yet greasy, they were small and the inside was mush almost liquefied. My friend experienced the same problem with her dish under seasoned. 

It was a little like dinning in an Asian old folk's home; you know no salt everything bland, edible just not appetizing. : ) I really wanted to like this place. I will not be back.",2009-08-17 13:40:50

You just can't beat the PRICE.  This was truly my first ""chinese massage"" and boy let me tell you it was an experience. AND NOOOO NOT A HAPPY ENDING PLACE.  just sayin. That's the daymn first thing everybody asks me. SINCE THEY CLOSE AT 2AM *wink wink*

TIPS:

I read another review where the client felt like she was getting indian burns.  I can understand that happening.  I wearing a 3/4 fitted long sleeve so she was putting pressure and rubbed over my top.  If I didn't have the sleeves I'm not sure how it would be like.  I had on loose cotton work out pants (thinking they're gonna have to lift it to my knees to soak my feet in water).

My boyfriend had LING.  She was recommended by my friend.  The BF said she was good and stronggggggggggg.  He felt that she was real good.

I had TINA.  Not too strong, but good sorta deep pressure.  

I would recommend making an appt to have the private rooms with 2 massage chairs in the room. I would also request the massage chairs with the breathing holes!  I've read there's some chairs there that don't.  I cannot imagine when being flipped over and face flat on the chair.  I would suffocate. 

WHAT GOES DOWN:

They get a bucket with a plastic  of HOT water with I have no idea what was in it. Once your feet is in they wrap it (i'm guessing) to keep that heat in.

You lay back in your comfy lazy boy and reclines all the way down. 


They do use a lotion that smelled herbal in an asian way (hard for me to explain or compare to).  Note:  they do use a bath towel to aid in the massage.  They have it on top of where they will massage and massage over it.


They Massage your head and face.  Then they do this sorta scratching of your scalp.  It was okay. I would rather have a scalp massage.  I don't understand the scratching.  It hurt a little.

Then they stand and massage your shoulder and top back, to your hands.

They take your feet out of the bucket and do the feet massage.  It was a little drafty and cold.

My bf and I bought a 30 min BACK massage.  So they help turn you over.  They did ask if you want to take your shift off.  

THE PART THAT TRIPPED ME OUT! :  they get on your back litterally.  They use their body weight and do this technique in using their knees and arms in massaging you.  I would peak and look over to my BF and eyes widened to see this little chinese lady on his back.  Some may like it some don't, but you can really feel the ""good"" pressure on your back.  I honestly can imagine i being damaging if they don't know what their doing.

At the end they serve you hot tea and crackers.  Me and my bf felt they worked hard massaging us.  Way harder then the usual casino spas we go to.

We surely left a good tip and will be back again.",2011-01-15 21:00:26

It seems that people just can't get enough of it - I love brunch too, so my friends and I were brave enough to line up at Eggspectation last weekend. We were lucky to arrive right before the bulk of the crowd showed up, so we got seats after about 20 minutes. It's not my first time at this restaurant (more like the third). I used to like it. The fruits were fresh and sweet, and the presentation beautiful. This time, everything seemed to be a rushed, cheaper version of itself (check my photos for a comparison of before and now). I understand that the plates were prepared in the heat of the rush hour, but it shouldn't be an excuse to serve sub-par food. It felt like eating at a cafeteria. 

Two of my friends had lukewarm benedict eggs, another found eggshells in her food. The bread was regular supermarket bread. The fruits were unripe and tasted like they were prepared the night before. The café au lait was mostly milk. The service was fast and good, but the food lacked in so many aspects that the overall experience was very average. At least my friend got her coffee for free in apology for the eggshells.

As we left, I stared in disbelief at the line of hungry customers that kept growing past the door and onto the sidewalk. Not worth the wait, really.

The food was extremely oily and the service wasn't that great. The waiters kept on trying to force food on us even though we kept on saying no.

Their pork dumplings were very greasy and a bit overcooked. Their fried squid was not crispy or hot at all. Their mango pudding was ok, but a bit too sweet. Their sesame ball sticky rice dessert was mediocre. Their selection was decent and the waiters were quick with bringing their carts over. It was very cheap for dimsum. It's cheaper to pay in cash.

We were told that we would have to wait about 15 minutes, which actually came to only 10 minutes, which was great. Our waitress was friendly, but would forget a few things that we needed, such as utensils and coffee.

I had asked if the sausage I ordered was indeed turkey and she took it back and had it remade without telling me that that was going to happen. 

So I had to wait for my breakfast to come back and then when I placed an additional order of turkey sausage for my husband, we waited 20 minutes for that to appear.

In all honesty this breakfast just took way to long to be served and the miscommunication was the problem.

Even on Vday, we were able to get a table for two before my lobster tail Caesar hit my lips, which is a good thing because that drink required you to be sitting down to drink it eloquently. The lobster was incredible, poutine covered in bisque and curds and layered on a bed of fries. Being a bluenoser I feel the right to judge the lobster I eat in Toronto, and I judge this as the best I have had. The lobster roll was stuffed in an understated, white, hotdog style bun, as it should be. The seafood tower was more than enough food for two hungry romantics who had already overdosed on lobster, but we left nothing but a crab leg go to waste. Fresh oysters, peel shrimp and crab legs were cooked to perfection, not overdone as I find they often are.

We were taken care of as soon as we walked in this place, I almost felt like I was back home eating at a fire hall lobster supper.

I have been in Time Square a few times, Ruelo never seems to open when I was there! There are no sign of business hours displayed so I don't know when they are open.

Finally my patience paid off. After having a quick lunch around 12:30 pm and I walked by the dark looking store, a girl just came out and unknocked the door. I was jumping for joy.. I think I freaked her out.. how can someone be so hyper and excited even before eating all these sweets!

There are fortunately or unfortunately only have 5 favours of their famous macarons in the displayed case. I decide to pick up 4 of the favours expresso, chocolate, raspberry and lychee each. The girl behind the counter was a little confused about which favour is which and she was looking at the chart...... hmmm

BTW, they are not cheap! $2.25/$2.50 each depends on the favour. The taste is so rich! A little too sweet for my taste, but it will go well with coffee without sugar or dark tea!

I have to say I enjoy the Lychee favour the best! Maybe it is not as sweet and heavy as the chocolate one! 

I will definitely be back to pick up more macarons and try out other favours (wasabi??)! And not to think about calories!

At first, the math didn't add up. I was charged $9.33 when I should have been charged $8.21. I didn't make a fuss because I wanted to try the food first because sometimes being overcharged doesn't matter if you get a good value.

I ordered the international half pound burger with fries and a coke. The burger was absolutely perfectly cooked, and the sauce was just right - not too much and not too little. The fries tasted unsalted, which is probably a good thing, and doesn't matter too much to me because I basically use fries as edible ketchup spoons.

All together the food was absolutely perfect and the customer service was excellent. They are super friendly. I even got to chatting with them about how I've driven by this place dozens of times and would have never came in if it wasn't for Yelp.

I would have given 5 stars, but I don't think I got $9.33 in value.

With that said, try this place! I can see myself coming here too often.",2015-07-30 21:27:02

I started off with a glass of pearfect martini - very strong. It's suppose to be kettle one vodka with pear puree, but it tasted more like either pear goose or some sort of citron vodka! NOT chilled... :(

My boyfriend and I noticed their menu has changed since we've last been here! No more spaghettti!? por que!?

Any way, Appetizer were sorta kinda the same, but a tad bit different.
We started off with Prosciutto San Daniele, Burrata di Bufala e Pepe Nero (San Daniele Prosciutto, Burrata Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Black Pepper) This dish is exactly the same since our last visit, the mozzarella was light and poofy, it wasn't heavy at all. My boyfriend doesn't like cheese, but for some reason, he really enjoys this dish. 

Bruschetta alla Griglia, Purea di Fagioli, Pomodori, Prezzemolo e Mortadella(Grilled Bruschetta, Bean Puree, Tomatoes, Parsley, Mortadella) EKKKK THE best bruschetta i've ever had, however, they skimped us on the tomatos :(

As for entrees, we ordered :
Linguine alla Vongole, Aglio, Peperoncino, Prezzemolo e Olio Extra Vergine di Oliva(Manila Clams, Chili, Parsley, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) The pasta was very el dente, we kinda like ours a little more softer. As for the clams, they were very flavorful, however, I found this dish a little too salty!

Lastly, I ordered the Mezzo Pollo Arrosto con Scarola, Aglio, Peperoncino, Limone e Vino Bianco
(Pan Roasted Organic Half Chicken, Escarole, Garlic, Chili, Lemon, White Wine) Thinking it's the same roasted chicken from wolfgang puck in san francisco! TOTALLY fooled! Nothing like it, chicken was a little dry, but i really enjoyed the veggies that came with the chicken!

Our busser was awesome, very attentive and very sweet! He's a great busser!",2010-07-12 04:35:47

Each time they've earned their stars. The service has been friendly and the staff is always willing to offer food and drink recommendations. 

The food also stands the test. My favorites are the pomme frites served with aioli and the fall-off-the-bone chicken wings with scallions and lemon. Last time there, I tried the ""Properly butchered rib steak,"" served with dauphenoise potatoes. It was large and very rich, but delicious. I almost always end with the maple walnut brittle ice cream. It's made by Columbus-based Jeni's Ice Cream and made exclusively for Greenhouse.

A friend and I went in here based on the Yelp reviews she read and, never having ethiopian cuisine before, we were excited for the experience. 

The flavors could have been good, but the food was gritty, hot food was cool, cool food was warm. We're not texture freaks usually, and we knew that it was a new cuisine for both of us... but this couldn't be right. The bread didn't scare us, the idea of no silverware was fine, and the various textures/preparations on the meat dishes were a welcome change (and, we hoped, an exciting new experience). 

We talked to the waitress who explained some of the preparation process. The idea of the mortar and pestle are cool - I love people who still use those - but grit in the food? Not so much.

We tried a combination platter and a few other things to make sure we were getting a broad spectrum of flavors and techniques. Overall, we liked the idea behind it and found some stuff we liked (the spice and flavor profiles were new to us and we enjoyed them!), but the grit really overshadowed what could have been a decent meal.

Adding to the ""meh"" is that the place just seemed dirty. Not old and well used, but dingy and in need of a good wipe down. 

Two pluses, which helped push this to a 2 star review... (A) Coffee and teas. I don't know what it was or how it was done, but it was all strong, flavorful, and hit the spot. (B) Price. We ordered enough food to feed two tables and the tab was barely $20.

Going back is on the table, so to speak; we have considered another go to see if it will be different/improved. After finding Blue Nile, however, I would be hard pressed to go back to Merkato if I didn't have to.",2011-07-06 21:08:08

Today I had the California club sandwich with chips, fruit cup, lemonade and macaroons. Other visits I have had breakfast items and their ""famous"" Nutella latte. Everything I have had has been bland and over hyped. I asked for no cucumber and an extra side of aioli on my sandwich today and brought it home to hopefully enjoy. Well to my disappointment there was extra cucumber and almost no aioli. I had to put mayo on it so it wasn't horribly dry. There was a lot of meat which was surprising. There was almost no cheese or tomato. The chips were delicious but too thick. 

I moved onto the lemonade and which I was looking forward to because how can you mess up lemonade. Well it was not fresh squeezed or fresh anything. It was clearly some kid of powder and not good at all. The macaroons were the only thing that could have saved my lunch. They looked exactly how macaroons should so I was excited. One bite into it and I was not thrilled. I had lime and raspberry and they both tasted like chemicals. You couldn't tell the two apart! The last time I was here and had the Nutella latte I was disappointed because it didn't taste like anything! Very bland food and artificial tasting drinks and sweets. 

The service wasn't good either. The guy putting the order in was rushing everyone and obviously didn't put the orders in well. Everything took over 15 minutes to come out. I have already given this place too many chances and won't be back again.",2014-04-24 21:44:09

just start at the beginning. 

First, the name.  What's up with the name?  Hop is of course a beer reference. The sissy"" thing is...odd.  Made up. 
I know 50's slang, and ""doddy"" is NOT one I've EVER heard.  Could be, but I don't think so. I thought they just made it up.  I've heard, ""daddy"" and ""daddy-o"", but never ""doddy"".  Server didn't know, either.  So they've go that going for them.

Oh wait. It's on the menu, it turns out It's the name of someone's pet cow. 
I SWEAR TO GOD. 
So now, I'm eating someone's pet cow?!?!!

Which is hardly a good name for a restaurant. And a stupid stretch. What's really funny is, the server, an employee of this restaurant did not know. But what's up with this?  Who thought this through originally?  Answer: no one. 

Second, I hate it when you enter a restaurant and they ask you if you've been there before. Because why?  Why would it matter?  Loyalty points?  Not here.  It's not as bad as loudly asking a single diner, ""jUST ONE?""  But it's close.

Well, here they ask you that because, even though they do have servers, you STILL have to go to the counter to place your order.  The server then will bring you your order.  Why ""half-a-server""?  Doesn't improve service, doesn't do anything, near as I can tell.  And it's confusing.  And the server still wants to be tipped like a whole server.  Half-strange.  Somebody with too much time thought that one up and believe me, it's not going to catch on.

Third, the food.  The burger was bland.  Very bland.  Dry, too.  Not juicy at all.  Beef is too lean. Look, ""juicy is greasy, greasy is juicy"", and this was neither.  In spades.  VERY BLAND.  Not well-seasoned either.  More an effort to eat than enjoyable.

But worse and odder stil(!) was the onion.  My ""classic"" burger was lettuce. tomato, onion, I added bacon and cheese and ""sassy sauce"" on the side.  When the burger arrived, the onion was perfectly spilling out of the side of the burger.  Except it wasn't.  

It wasn't a slice of onion at all: it was a SINGLE RING of and onion, (truth be told, it was 3/4 of a ring of the onion),  placed along the outside of the burger.  Which would have been great if we were TAKING PHOTOS of the burger, but this burger was to EAT!  I don't get it.  I believe that onion as a topping on the burger, in this country, means a SLICE OF ONION.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And unlike the name of the establishment or the 1/2 style of service they offer, a single onion ring isn't choice or cute.  It's amateurish, unprofessional, cheap or all the above.

Oh, wait: it's Instagram!  ""We'll design a burger MADE TO PHOTOGRAPHED!  Taste-schmaste!!  Just make it look good!  But what i wanted is flavor. Just flavor. 

I even commented to the snooty waiter, before the Instagram connection had been made in my head, ""this would all be perfect, the onion spilling out, would be perfect IF WE WERE PHOTOGRAPHING THE DAMN THING!  BUT I CAME HERE TO EAT!"" 

The truffle fries were good, not great, NOT a huge portion and $7/copy, if I were coming back, I'd forgo the fries.  Too pricey.

And that's the point.  I'm not getting the fries on my next visit because there will be no next visit, I'm NOT coming back.  Half a restaurant.  Half a flavor.  Half the service.  Less than half an onion.  Twice the price.

We've been to this one a hundred times, but this time our service was less than stellar. Actually it was less than standard. Our waitress must have been new... When it was time to ask us if we wanted dessert, we told her it was our daughter's birthday and she said something about that and ran off. Ummmm...don't you normally ask the other 5 people at the table if they want something? Or were we all supposed to share the birthday sundae???

I guess we shouldn't complain. At least RR gives a bday sundae. Food this trip was good, as usual. I love the California chicken sandwich, but for the life of me, can't ever get through the whole thing without it falling all over the place. It is deceivingly well-wrapped when it arrives, but then goes to hell after the first few bites! 

Has anyone noticed the amount of fries you get (in the unlimited baskets) averages like 6-8? Inevitably, we ask for at least another 2 baskets while waiting for our food to be cooked.

When you walk into Sinbad's it doesn't take a Middle-Easterner to realize that this is an authentic, family-run joint.  It smells good and they are making fresh bread even in the midst of lunch time.  

I ordered the special: two Gyro's for $5.  Trust me, I know Gyro's are Greek (typically referred to as Shawarma's in Arabic and made with Arabic pita's instead of Greek ones), but that's how they advertised and made them.  However, they had plenty of options available in Arabic jargon and fresh pitas for sale too.  The interior is very basic, with simple tables next to an open kitchen and Arabic televison playing in the background.  

The Gyro itself was pretty good.  It tasted fresh and came with plenty of fixings, but it was missing a bit more meat.  The service was a bit slow (but I lend that to the authenticity) and very cordial.

I loved the modern decor but agree with other reviewers that it is a bit cookie-cutter. I think the location on the top floor is a lot cooler than the actual decor--nothing feels more urban than to know that you are enjoying drinks in the loft of a building that has other uses and to see the street lights through the industrial-looking windows. I also appreciate that the owners chose to set up shop in an area that is still developing. Anyone who's hung out on the avenue side of Phoenix knows that it is still lacking some of the cool neighborhood watering holes that characterize the central corridor and street side. 

Unlike other reviewers, I actually didn't mind the smell of Pei Wei. In fact, I'm ashamed to admit that I was so tantalized by the smell that my husband and I ended heading straight there for a bite to eat after we left happy hour! If SideBar actually collaborates with Pei Wei to allow bar patrons to order food from downstairs, it will be a highly mutually beneficial arrangement. But if you don't like the smell of Chinese (or don't want to be tempted like we were), you may want to stay away....

The main reason I'm docking SideBar two stars is because the wine my husband and I had was really bad. They were featuring a $5 red wine for happy hour but ran out of the kind they advertised. Our server offered me a different kind (I believe it was a cabernet), and it was atrocious: bitter and way worse than 2 Buck Chuck. If you're going to pick one wine for a happy hour special, you shouldn't punish people for choosing it! 

If that wasn't bad enough, the Cabernet my husband independently chose to enjoy was also really bad. Our server certainly didn't help in his decisionmaking process; in fact, when he asked what she would suggest between a given Merlot and Cabernet, she essentially said that they were both ""equal"" and that it came down to what he liked. Not too helpful! 

It wasn't until our third try that we found a red wine that didn't taste awful. Who knows if the problem was that the wine had been opened too long or if their selections are just poor ones, but either way, we were very disappointed. Our friend's rum and cokes were mixed well, though, and he said they were discounted a lot for happy hour. 

I like this spot, and I especially like that it's closer to my side of town, but they definitely need to improve in the wine department. Have the wines in stock that you advertise as specials and for Pete's sake, make sure they taste good! Oh, and give your servers some basic wine training so they can help customers make decisions between different options.",2008-12-21 23:48:32

We have never been disappointed with the food, sometimes the service, but that seems to have been handled as of lately.  Vietnamese restaurants get a bad wrap for being dirty or unkempt, Rice Paper breaks that mold and provides a clean, sleek and modern feel.

I would definitely recommend the wings with the fish sauce reduction, a different taste and probably some of the most flavorful nontraditional wings I've tasted.  You will not be disappointed with any of the Banh Mi's, and the Pho's are very tasty as well.  What they are famous for is in their name, spring rolls rolled in rice paper.  I enjoy the Spicy Asian and the Spider, but try them all, or a couple at a time.  The fried pork spring rolls are our favorite as well as the fire cracker shrimp.

It tasted awesome, and I could probably have eaten 5 of them. No, seriously, I was hungry like 5 min after leaving. It would have been an awesome prelude to the corn beef, but ""se la vie.""

So I did, got there at 5 pm with my friend and all the customers standing in front of the host without a proper lineup, waiting to be seated. Since there is no lineup, people came after me got registered before me （I am unhappy about this). At the time I got registered, they told me it is going to be 20 min wait, which it is ok. 5 minutes after, they came back and said the wait time will be longer and they will try to get me a table at 6 pm (This is a joke! You said 20 min and now 1 hour wait time? We paid for the parking already!). We decided to wait because their Honey Toast is well known in Taiwan. Fine, we will see how good is the honey toast?

We ordered Honey french toast with vanilla ice cream - $13.99, Poached egg and fried chicken waffle with cheese - $12.99, Roasted chicken leg spaghetti with basil pesto sauce - $15.99, Rose lychee soda- $7.5 and Dazzling pearl- $7.5. 
This visit costs total $60 ~ $70 for 2 girls (2 drinks, 2 main courses, and 1 toast).

Overall the drinks just mix of syrup in different flavors, and extremely sweet. However, the drinks look nice in the photo.

Honey toast with vanilla ice cream is overpriced $13.99. The toast is slightly more texture than regular white toast from a supermarket.

While I lament the loss of local gourmet restaurants in exchange for somewhat corporate ""celebrity chef"" ones, I was very pleased by the other two, J&G at the Phoenician and Bourbon Steak at the Fairmont (although my experience there was limited to dessert). We decided to give BLT Steak a try, while they're running their $50 blackboard menu 3-course special (it's actually 3.5 courses--app, entree, side, and dessert).

Things started nicely with a chicken liver amuse, on toasted baguette. Then they bring out their famous popovers--which are spectacular-- and you're almost ready to call it a night! We shared the crabcake app from the regular menu, the white asparagus app, dover sole entree, and broccolini side from the blackboard menu, and the potatoes au gratin side from the regular menu. Nothing was tremendously impressive. Don't get me wrong--everything was very good--but nothing made us say, ""WOW!"" And at prices like these, I need a few ""WOW!"" moments. They were out of the peach melba cake for dessert so they brought us the other two off the blackboard menu, which was very nice. Unfortunately, neither one impressed. In fact, I found the apricot phyllo tart with mint creme to be a terrible mix of flavors.

Service was wonderful, and the dining room is contemporary and casually stylish...definitely your Gen X / Gen Y steakhouse. But the prices are just too high for food that's merely ""very good."" It might not be fair to judge a steakhouse without trying the steaks, but Seftel seemed to suggest that they aren't the star here, compared to other Valley steakhouses. If that's true, it's even more reason to head to J&G, Bourbon Steak, or Mastro's instead of BLT Steak. We left saying, ""Better than BLT Burger, in Las Vegas.""

It is very dark, could definitely use a remodel with a professional decorator. My group of 3 was the youngest group dining late on a Thursday night. There is a large sign suggesting a dress code and a pretty conservative crowd. Another sign asks customers to refrain from using their cell phones.

We started out with cocktails, split of champagne for my girlfriend, I had the apple martini and other friend did the long island iced tea. All the drinks were fine, nothing special. 

We only did one appetizer, the chicken skewers. This way a great start to our meal. The meat was tasty, tender and grilled to perfection. Something I would definitely recommend. So yummy, my girlfriend placed another order for her entree. Along with the tomato and mozzarella salad, she said she was satisfied with the food and pricing. She did eat all her food, which rarely happens with her.

I had the filet (8 oz) cooked medium and I did upgrade ($3) for the demi glaze sauce. The sauce reminded me of a thin BBQ sauce, which I wasn't expecting. All in all, it was a nicely seared and seasoned (cooked perfectly) and the sauce was good. Not sure if the sauce was necessary, but it wasn't bad at all. This comes with a twice baked potato (just OK) and brussell sprouts and carrots (veggie of the day). I do like brussel sprouts, I didn't necessarily like these particular brussel sprouts but I ate them none the less. 

My other friend did the strip steak with the same sides. His steak was yummy, cooked well but perhaps a little under seasoned (for his taste). He hates brussel sprouts, and the twice baked potato got some attention (not too much though). I think he was the least pleased with his experience out of the three of us.

The service was 5 stars. Our server did a wonderful job and was very friendly and insightful. The view was great and I loved finding out about the history (open since 1928 and used to be a speakeasy). 

One thing I will add, we were the loudest table and a little buzzed as well. The staff was very gracious and didn't seem to be bothered by our liveliness.

Eating these flavorless 'things' will only dredge up bad memories of when you were in college, eating ramen like it was your job.
Now you're curious. 
This whole thing is too weird..it has to be a setup...a camera crew about to come running out of the kitchen to inform you how you've just been punk'd.

But sadly, there's no producer...or crew. 
Just your fish-buttoned waiter, the orange hostess, and your date, who's incessantly jabbering about how cool this place is. 
What does she know? 
She ordered the rice cakes and green tea. 

If you do get suckered into this place by the Chinese guy in the window hand stretching the noodles, you're in for a good sized check and a disappointed palette. 
On your way out, stop and check-out the goldfish tank for any tits-up floaters. 
The orange hostess will look at you like your crazy.
Screw her. 
She's the one dressed in orange.",2012-03-02 23:45:50

The buss up shut (Paratha Roti) was so delicious, I ordered more! The plantains were cooked to perfect, soft (but not mushy) and sweet. I have already sent messages to my West Indian friends letting them know Mango's is worth a try and of course I've volunteered to join them :) Check them out you won't be disappointed!

We were seated in the back with dim lighting that they eventually brightened for us after we requested a non romantic atmosphere.  Our table of 12 were all craving drinks and tons of food after our intense cardio activity.  We let our server know ahead of time that we wanted seperate bills and she easily accommodated us with no hassles or excuses which is always nice.

I ordered a cocktail, vodka sprite, and the Lobster Poutine.  I can tell you that I was skeptical about how good the Lobster Poutine would actually be...however when it hit my table I was pleasantly surprised with the Lobster to Poutine ratio.  For $15 for a poutine it is WORTH it because my poutine was at least 40% lobster which is a huge plus in my books!  The Mac and cheese was fresh and delicious as well along with the fish tacos.

The room did not have a coffee machine, and the bathroom sink ran hot, hotter, hottest, rarely ever cool. But those were the down sides to the stay.

They also do not have everything listed on their menu on a given day- so unless you are extremely familiar with Indian fare - I recommend going in and talking to the lady rather than calling the order in. She was friendly and helpful. 

Despite the above warnings, the food itself is really beyond delicious and earns the four stars solidly. My co-worker said it reminded her of meals cooked in her in-laws kitchen.

I ordered the paneer tikka masala (Which was killer) make sure you get the roti that goes with it. I also had the Pani Puri (which isnt on their menu online). If you have never tried Pani Puri - get it now! So delicious..make sure you ask how to eat it though or you'll be lost. I had quite a bit of food for $9- the menu is super affordable. 

Keep in mind everything is vegan and/or vegetarian.

Parking is generally a madhouse. I've gone when there are nothing but hand baskets available. I've heard a clerk tell a customer that he was sorry but it was so busy that they would just have to do without a cart. If a store has times where it is that busy, it would be prudent to invest in more carts.

While I like Smith's, be aware that brand coupons for items can not be used for items with a yellow ""manager's special"" coupon. For example, on the Smith's App there was special running which included a $1 off coupon for x brand organic, grass-fed beef, per package, no limit. I found 22 packages of that same brand in the manager's clearance section. I grabbed them all thinking I could use my unlimited coupon and save $22. When I got up to the register, my digital coupon was entered and a total of $0 was taken off. I asked why. Apparently, markdowns with the manager's special coupon are entered into the system as a generic item at X price rather than X brand at a cheaper price. Therefore, the computer system does not match the coupon to the marked down item because it can't match a specific brand to a generic listed product. Not cool.

If you bring in your own bag you get 5 gas points a bag. Also, there are tons of markdowns on preprepared deli foods, but they tend to be bland, gross or both. I've had the worst fried chicken of my life here.

The one area I wish this store would improve on is their layout. Some horizontal aisles blocking vertical aisles does not make for a quick, conducive shopping experience.",2014-09-14 21:54:55

Our favorites of everything were the pork potstickers, which were very flavorful - but eat them when they are hot - the flavor is definitely not as good as they cool down.  Interestingly, mushroom and bamboo soup had a very flavorful broth - deeper flavored than the braised beef.  The bamboo was a purplish color that tasted like it was marinated or pickled in something - very tasty.

Also, the glass container on the table that looks like soy sauce is actually soy sauce mixed with vinegar, and a little sugar, I believe.  Most likely made more as a dipping sauce for the dumplings and potstickers.  That was tasty.

So we got crab rangoons,  chicken fried rice,  normal fried rice,  orange chicken,  and the Singapore noodle. 

Crab Rangoon was OK, only thing that was not awful. However,  the dipping sauce had the weirdest after taste.  It was like concentrated tap water.   Also no spicy mustard sauce in the bag we got just lots of soy sauce,  which makes no sense with the items we had.   

Fried rice was obviously loaded with msg.  It had that heavy salt and almost chemical flavor.   The onions were still to raw and took over.   

Orange chicken dry just like the other reviewer had stated,  and the flavor was one note.   It just looked congealed and sad.

When finally served, I had to repeat my order three times... third time being as the staff went to get my bakery items..she forgot one of the two things I ordered.

The food here is decent.. but the prices are above average. The coffee prices are about the same as Starbucks but you can get refills here (self serve).. they brew a fresh batch quite often. The hazelnut coffee is my favourite. There is a large variety of fresh scones, pastries, muffins, bagels, bread.

Make sure to sign up for the Panera rewards.. as upon registering you get a free surprise loaded onto your card..and once in a while you get free coffee and treats.

I got 4 tips 4 a good time 4 you.

TIP 1. Contact Vivian (Manager) first! I didn't contact Vivian first and the language barrier between me and the other workers was difficult which caused Vivian to have to leave her client to come and talk to me. 

TIP 2. Rocking those skinny jeans? or NO SHORTS? NO PROBLEM! They have shorts for you to change into, but if you aren't comfortable with wearing shorts someone else wore.. then come in shorts or short pants. 

TIP 3. I assume it would be optimal to not have any make up on because during the massage they run your face. You don't want your foundation all messed up righttt?

TIP 4. Neon lights! When I arrived there was still day light out, but during the massage the moon took over the sky and the neon lights for their sign outside turned on. The lights illuminated my room through the slight opening not covered by the curtains. If this bothers you then come earlier or see if there is a room without lights.",2011-06-01 20:25:16

Virgin is one of the few airlines that has a ton of 4+ Stars.  After flying the friendly skies with them, I agree. Virgin Airlines is breath of fresh air compared to my usual Southwest Airlines.  There's more leg room, plenty of space for luggage, seats & your toys, comfortable seating, and the highlight for me...TV.  It's not DIRECTV, but it's free and you can watch the news, football, ESPN, or get caught up on your soaps while heading to your next destination. If there's an issue that I have with Virgin, it's that bags don't fly free like Southwest. 

PS:  Upon landing, I love how they inform the passengers which baggage claim to go to.  Southwest doesn't do this.

I saw some of my friends uploading pictures from this place and decided to give this a try.

Once I was in, I loved the decoration.  Very modern style (fits the name perfectly), with lots of natural sunlight from the big windows.  The table design really impressed me as well, it was made out of wood, but they are shaped differently and not your typical rectangular tables.

My friend and I ordered the Grilled Squid, Oknomiyaki, Aburi Nigiri and the Pirate Roll to share.  We wrapped it off with the Tiramisu crepe cake.  The Grilled Squid was good, the sauce they used complemented the squid nicely, although I do prefer a more buttery flavour which this one lacks.  Aburi Nigiri was nicely displayed and they tasted very good!  Pirates Roll was also something I enjoyed and found interesting, something you can't really find elsewhere.  Tiramisu crepe cake was also well made, not too sweet and had a good texture.  I think the most unimpressed dish was properly the Oknomiyaki, although it had a lot of ingredients, but it lacked the taste which made this dish kind of plain.

Overall my friend and I had a great time catching up and we enjoyed the meal.  The prices are at the high end, but the decorations they put into making this place and the quality of the food they offer makes it reasonable.  If only they also serve alcohol (I think they are working on it), it would of been perfect!",2015-07-07 23:50:12

We had just finished with an epic weekend of rock climbing and wanted to head home, but we looked at the traffic and it seems like our friends were right, the maps on our iPhones were lit up with red. 

To pass the time we decided to catch a flick. The movie ""Interstellar"" was on our must watch list, as I'm a huge Christopher Nolan fan and we are both science nerds and appreciate scientific accuracy in combination with art and entertainment. 

The movie theatre is located in the Orleans casino. You can park anywhere and there will be signs to direct you to the theatre, which is located on the second floor. Just outside of the theatre is a cool game room where families can play for carnival type tickets and prizes. Very enticing for families and young ones to stop and spend a few bucks here before or after the movie. 

The seats in the theatre were nice and comfy, the place was clean; and I appreciated the fact that after the movie was over, the attendants waited until we left before coming in to tidy up. I especially appreciated the fact because I was immobile in my seats covered in tears and still in awe of the movie. I'm grateful they let me have my moment before I gathered my things and headed out in the other direction of the employees because I was kinda embarrassed to be in such a state.

Big Jim's in the Run is essentially right in the middle of a residential zone.  It doesn't really feel like you are walking into a business at first because of the area you drove through to get there.  You will most likely end up parking on the street in front of somebody's home nearby.

This place has what I call quintessential ""American Italian"".  What that means is that it's not necessarily Italian but rather Americanized Italian food which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's just not the same.  

The first thing you will notice is that the decor is very simple.  This place is the last ""D"" in the title of the show, ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"".  This place is a dive and it's part of the charm of the place.  They are not trying to be anything outside of what they are besides themselves which is what makes this place genuine.  

The servings at this place are really large in that one dish can maybe feed 2 people.  If each of your party orders a dish you will most likely not finish your meal.  The salads are huge, the bread comes to the table at first the entrees will fill you up big time.  The food at the same time is good as well.  

The lasagna has A LOT of ricotta in it... almost too much.  The veal sandwich I ordered was almost the size of the plate!  

All that being said it's not a lot of money for a lot of food.  While it's not the greatest Italian food I've had it's one of the better American Italian food places I've eaten at and I can't say you leave hungry because the portions are beyond generous to the point of being family sized.

The service was very welcoming and friendly.",2014-07-18 18:07:43

I booked it for the night of Friday October 10- we were granted a spacious deluxe room with king bed. The exterior and lobby of the hotel are by no means impressive but the newly renovated rooms are well decorated, modern and bright. We stayed in room 655 which had huge windows overlooking St Mathieu street and corner of Sherbooke.

PROS:  centrally located, lots of space, free functional wifi, clean room, great toiletries (shampoo/conditionner/lotion/showergel/soap bar). I was particularly impressed with the conditionner, having very long hair, I was able to comb through and detangle in a breeze. Plus their products have a light citrusy, exotic smell. My bf said it reminded him of pina colada, so even though we were just on a staycation, I could picture myself somewhere tropical.
LOVE the cotton bathrobe, super comfy and made me feel like a VIP.
Bedsheets and towels were soft and smelled like crisp clean detergent.

CONS: AC automatically turns itself on and off after reaching a certain temperature- we couldn't keep the room as cool as we would have liked.
Bathroom is tiny, there's space for just one person to stand at the sink.
Flat screen tv is not HD, most channels appear blurry.
Despite the renovated room, there were cracks in the ceiling and wall (see my attached photos)
And this is the worse - If you're a fan of firm mattresses, this bed will be a real nightmare. Much too soft, you sink in, almost impossible to sit upright and watch tv or read a book. Pillows were also mush.
Best description would be like sleeping on a huge marshmallow- sounds like fun at first, but it was a restless night as we were constantly tossing and turning. I sleep flat on my back and I kid you not, morning come, my body was bent into a V shape from sinking so deep.

In all, my personal preference for firm mattresses affected the quality of my stay but I would still recommend it for the location - steps from Guy Concordia metro, but not in the busy arteries, away from bars and clubs so it's a quiet area if you're looking for something relaxing.",2014-10-15 00:50:55

Also ordered kimchi fried rice and egg soup. I'd say skip the original and try the green onion, they are basically the same chicken but one has onion toppings.  I like the sweet and sour the most, the spicy one is good too! You can definitely feel the flame but its not umbearable. Also the KFCs are not as oily as the actual KFC chicken.  However the kimchi fried rice is on the oily side.  Egg soup is average.

My smoked salmon bannock was very filling. But I honestly, can not say I have an opinion of bannock. I understood it was flat bread, but I have no distinct flavour or opinion of it.

The relaxation room was decent except that there was a leak in the ceiling that was in the process of being fixed. There were ample amounts of water (bottled), juices, tea, and coffee.

They sell a variety of treats like milkshakes, sundaes, soft serve ice cream with different dip flavours, smoothies, froyo, waffles and funnel cake. While they have a good selection, they also keep the flavours simple which is a good thing!

I've tried the funnel cake here and their soft serve dip cones. Both are great for what they are and make delicious spring/summer treats! Portions are a good size. I'm honestly full off a junior dip cone (sounds small but actually a good amount of ice cream!) and the funnel cake is perfect for sharing (or not)!

It's also hard to beat the value of their desserts too since it's all under $10 - remember it's cash only here! 

Line ups aren't too bad when the weather is nice and it moves quickly. Staff are nice enough at the register but people don't come here for first class service.

_jaMYsmGFhdC-CYRK9dLgg,M4yYtAXehUzaHB1ghl6EXg,I6Xa5eF9Jv9VM6ms_dkY8A,3,1,0,0,"When I saw they offer grilled octopus, it was a done deal. I made RSVP for dinner on Friday (to beat the romantic V-Day crowd) at 7:45pm. As most have already mentioned, it is well decorated with a nice ambiance, making it a good date spot in the SouthPark area that won't 100% break your bank. I do think that some of their 2-tops are quite closely put to one another - it was quite easy to be distracted by the neighboring conversation (and also the lack of space to put personal items such as bulky winter jackets).

We arrived slightly behind schedule, the hostess actually phoned me as we were 5 mins away. I appreciate the fact that they didn't just give our reservation away. Our waitress was quick to greet me while BF was still parking, yet she did not re-greet us for awhile once he arrived (and I could see her not occupied by other tables). Overall I think the service had room for improvement. 

I ordered the grilled octopus ($13) as my appetizer and it was absolutely divine. It came sliced, and it was a good amount to be shared (or in my case, I ate it all myself!). Perfectly cooked, every piece was tender and tasty. I highly recommend the octopus (and it's a much healthier alternative to the fried calamari)! 

For dinner, BF went with the Margharita pizza, which for $9 was a very big portion. Definitely enough to be an entree. I opt for the full size Capellini ($20) once I confirmed that the sea scallops are served whole (they offer half size option for most pasta dishes - but for $4 more I figured I could save half for a 2nd meal). The scallops turned out to be quite sizable - 4 of them, sitting on the pasta. I don't think this dish could ever be ""pretty"" but I care most about the taste. Thus imagine my disappointment when I was overcome by the blandness of everything. The pasta tasted like nothing, even the scallops were bland. How on earth something with so much butter, garlic and pancetta tasted so blah was beyond me! I even asked for shaved parm (since we were never offered any) to see if that would help with the taste - but the 100% lack of sodium wasn't something easily fixable. 

I was this close to surrender, I thought I would just pack my entire dinner home so I could redo it myself at home. My BF hates to complain in restaurants and was scared to death by the possibility
 that I would make a scene (men... I swear). But I ended up speaking up when waitress came by to check on us. She insisted for it to be recooked. Manager Jodi followed up as well, and promised the dish will be tasty. 

Take 2 was definitely a great improvement. I hope the kitchen could agree that I wasn't being crazy but I think someone forgot to put salt in the 1st one. I enjoyed my dish and thought it was of decent value. I do, however, wish my waitress remembered to bring me cheese (if I asked for cheese the first time, I thought it's reasonable for her to bring cheese the 2nd time, or at least ask if I still wanted any cheese). 

In the end I think it was a solid dinner - the food ended up being great. The service was average, they could be more mindful about the little things like offering fresh pepper/cheese (and we never had bread... I read that bread was offered in other reviews). I will revisit, if anything just to have the octopus again.",2016-02-15 18:26:07

I really had my heart on staying at the Encore, however, it would have made for a pretty long walk at 8AM every morning, and I figured he could enjoy his time a little bit more given he could literally roll out of bed and go downstairs to his class (I know, I'm a great wife ; ).  Also, it would have been about a grand to stay at the Encore and the Flamingo was paid by the govt...so this put us over the edge to just suck it up and stay at the Flamingo.

We stayed on a upper floor in a go room, which wasn't too bad!  I will give the room 3 stars for view (overlooking pool), cleanliness, and it seemed relatively quiet.  The shower is also pretty nice!  But they sure did waste a lot of space putting in a tiny tub that no one would use.  

I give the Flamingo as a whole 2 stars because it just wasn't our scene, especially in the evenings!  We typically enjoy going out and then coming back to our hotel and having the option to gamble before crashing for the night, and we just didn't do that here.  Also, their restaurant choices are not too great, and is it too much to ask for a Starbucks???

On the other hand, the pool is really nice and it is funny to watch the line start up at about 8AM every morning (I even waited in line one morning in fear that I wouldn't get a chair, haha)!   Just an FYI, for all those that have questions/concerns about their pool....YES, it does get very crowded!  They advertise that they don't open till 9AM, but I saw them letting people in as early as 8AM.  If there is just a couple of you, you will have no problem getting a decent chair as long as you are there before about 11AM M-TH.  However, if you go Fri.-Sat. you will probably need to be there by about 10AM to ensure you get chairs together, because it really does get crowded.  And if you aren't an early morning person, then I would wait till about 12-1 to go because by then people start leaving and you can usually snatch their chairs as they are leaving.

Flamingo makes for an okay stay...it just didn't do it for me (maybe I was asking for too much).  If I could do it all over again I think we would have chosen to pay for another casino because it would have made for a better overall stay...but that's just me!",2010-07-19 11:58:09

This was the office that my daughter recommended because she had used them in the past so I entered this location as my choice  The website said that they had free pick up and drop off so I called them up and asked for a ride over there, which is only about a mile north. They said they would have to call me back when someone was going to head over.  I had an appointment an hour and a half later which was plenty of time.  

I NEVER heard back from them. I finally called another location about a mile south of me, explained the situation which at this point I only had maybe half an hour to get to my appointment. The location on Baseline was very understanding and very efficient. They sent someone over within 15 minutes, zooming me down to the office, had me fill out the paperwork quickly and I was on my way in a Dodge Avenger to my appointment which fortunately wasn't very far.

So if you need a rental car with a pickup, call the one on Baseline near the railroad tracks.

We went when it first opened, and I resisted the urge to review them then, as I wanted to give them time to straighten out the kinks. They have done that to a certain extent...they've fixed the ventilation system, and the buckwheat crepes, which used to have a grainy, sandy texture to them, are much better. The fillings, however, are uninspired and not handled with care. I got the Dijon mustard chicken crepe, and the chicken was bone dry. The filling was not enough for the size of the crepe, and they also need to sauce them more. I prefer crepe fillings that are either more stew-like or have a sauce to finish them, and these are just a pile of ingredients on top of a crepe. The soup of the day was watermelon gazpacho, which would have been excellent had they not dumped in so much cayenne, which made it overly spicy and strangely one note. 

We were sat near the open kitchen when we first went in, and the clanking of pots, pans and plates was just too much for me, so I asked if they could move us. They did, and it was a little better, but this is a noisy restaurant, due to its petite size and tile floors.",2012-07-03 17:21:28

This is a small taco shop which lets you make burrito bowls, burritos and customized tacos. Since I got ice cream, or wanted it, I thought ""let's be healthy and go with the bowl"".

When scooping the rice I noticed it sticking to the pan- not good. I ordered the bowl with veggies, chicken and the rest of their toppings.

The bowl was terrible. I hate saying that word when it's about food or a business but it was. As suspected, the rice was crunchy. The chicken was old and dry. The one tasty part was the salsa but after maybe three bites I was done.

The ice cream with churros really couldn't even save this. I had to wait because the machine wasn't working. When I got my ice cream it was already sort of melted. The flavor was great, but poorly executed.

To be honest, the concept wasn't revolutionary and it's something I could totally make at home, if, you know, I'd turned my stove on once in the past three months, purchased actual groceries and had any sort of produce that wasn't seriously succumbing to mold. 

The breakfast sandwich ($8) is this: scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato and bacon (optional). I worried about the girth of this awesome combination of ingredients - like, how was I going to fit this sandwich in my freakin' mouth? But thankfully it came on the perfect vehicle: an English muffin. I also couldn't resist ordering a fresh glass of lemonade that went perfectly with my little bundle of breakfast joy. I love that the sandwich came in a bowl, because some of the cheesy eggs slipped out and it would have made for a quite a mess on a small plate. Capped off the meal with a fresh, homemade blueberry scone that our group wanted to split - our server even thought to pre-cut the scone into four individual pieces for us to enjoy. How thoughtful.

My husband had gone there a week earlier to make the reservation, to be sure of getting a table by the lake.  The reservation was for 7:30, but I was running late, as usual.  He called and asked if we could change it for 8:00.  ""Sure, just don't be late.""

We were five minutes early.  The hostess informed us that it would be ""just a few minutes.""  So we waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  After about 20 minutes, and being told it would be ""very soon,"" we were offered a really crummy table. We declined. Jeff, the owner - who's now famous after being on Pawn Stars as the ""wine expert"" -  helped us choose what turned out to be the perfect bottle of Riesling, and it sat on a table inside, waiting along with us, getting as warm as we were getting hot under the collar.

Wendy, Jeff's wife, was very friendly and solicitous.  She said she had the perfect table picked out for us, but the foursome, who had long finished eating, drinking, and paying their bill, just wouldn't leave.  She didn't want to be rude and incur their wrath and ask them to leave.  Wendy did offer us a glass of champagne while we waited, but we turned it down, since we'd be drinking that bottle of wine.  And so we continued to wait.  After very nearly an hour, and after I'd told Wendy that my patience was wearing thin and that my birthday celebration was being ruined, she got the brilliant idea to offer THEM a glass of champagne at the bar if they'd relinquish their table.  They got up immediately, and I never did find out if they had that drink.

The table was great - spacious, since we were two at a table for four - and right next to the lake.  This was the dimmer part of the patio, which suited us fine - we thought the upper part was too brightly lit.  But of course I couldn't see the ducks very well.  Oh well, I wasn't planning to have duck, anyway.

Our server, Jason (I think), was perfectly competent, though not overly friendly.  We ordered the warm spinach salad, and he had the kitchen split it for us.  It was super, but turned out not really big enough to share.

I had the trout, and it ranked up there with some of the best I've ever had.  Sometimes filet of trout has bones, and this baby had not a single one.  It was topped with a balsamic drizzle, some crabmeat, and a few leaves of fresh spinach.  It was a good-sized portion, and the half I took home tasted as delicious the next night.

My husband had the petite filet mignon.  He liked it, but when I tasted it I thought it could have been more tender.  I also found the pomme frites perfectly ordinary, just a notch above Mickey D's.

What really irked me was that after our long, long wait, I thought we should have been comped a dessert, only because Wendy knew it was my birthday and that it was close to being ruined.  That little touch would have left me with a much better feeling about Marche Bacchus.  I'm still giving it four stars - and wouldn't have raised it to five just for a free dessert - but the taste in my mouth would have been so much sweeter.",2010-10-13 08:04:28

Overall the appetizers out-shined the main courses and I was particularly disappointed by the granular texture of the red curry.  This is my litmus test for all Thai restaurants and this did not measure up.

Oreganos used to have the best wings in town. 14 huge all drumsticks with great sauces to dip them in.  I recently put in a couple orders and to my surprise and shock they no longer were all drums, I only got 10, and the size of them shrank significantly.  

I am not sure if they switched purveyors or if the manager ran out of wings and had to run to Frys across the street but if this is a permanent switch then I will have to take my business elsewhere.

They also no longer serve their red cream soda I loved but that's not nearly as big of deal breakers as the downgrade in wing quantity and quality is.  

I really hope this was just a fluke and not a business decision.  Who thought it would be a great idea to take away 4 wings, make them smaller, and switch it from all drums???  If this is seriously the new direction of this operation then my rating will probably go down to two stars and I will have to find another place for wings.  

Please don't ruin a good thing Oreganos.  Expanding is cool as long as quality does not suffer.  Shrinking your serving sizes and lessening food quality is very bad for business.

Edited on 5/7/15: Per Oreganos some customers wanted flappers and Dr Pepper and that is why they switched from all drums to mixed and got rid of their red cream soda.  I guess some customers overrule the customers that have built this business since the beginning.  Time to find a new wing spot.",2015-04-20 19:28:09

My romance with Yoga has been on again off again, but after my visit to Iam Yoga today I think I'm ready to go steady.

Jennifer was minding the front desk and was very nice to me, introducing me to the owner as well as my instructor for the day, Alyssa.  Jen gave me a quick tour of the place and was easy to talk to.  She seemed genuinely interested in me and excited about working there.  

Everyone was incredibly friendly and outgoing, which I think contributed to my positive experience.

While I'm not new to Yoga, this was my first hot yoga experience so I was naturally a little apprehensive.  

As an instructor Alyssa seemed very knowledgeable and I never felt awkward or out of place during her session.  As a beginner, the F1 CC class was seriously challenging, but I made it through till the end.

I'm going back tomorrow to sign up for their $20 all-you-can sweat for a week.

Highly recommended for beginners.

EDIT:  Went twice today, I think I found my groove with this place.  If you are new, make sure you go to a class with a 1 in hit, such as F1 (Flow) or H1 (Hatha).  Also make sure to bring a towel (I bring two towels, one for the mat and another for all the crazy sweat!), at least 1/2 litre of water and a yoga mat (duh).  My first time I forgot a towel and they dinged me $2 bucks.

TIP: Sit next to the north windows. Usually they open them about 10-15 minutes before the end of class. I find that it helps me keep going.

This is definitely due to poor management/decisions but I'm not suprised with this decision as I remember the first time I came here I was excited and hoping to find brand items at low prices. It turned out that the prices are higher than Walmart, specifically household items and groceries. Being a regular customer at Walmart and used to their ""everyday low prices, I expected the same from Target. I even checked out their Liquidation sale today and was pretty disappointed as they were offering ""up to 30% off"" depending on the item for example cosmetics/stationery is 30% off, clothing is 20% off and everything else including electronics is ONLY 10% off. You'll also find that there's not much inventory on the shelves. You'd expect more of a deal especially if they are closing down and trying to clear out their store. Not to mention the fact that everything is already overpriced compared to its competitor so you're actually not saving much!

The only good thing about the Target stores is that they are kept clean and organized but maybe thats because they don't have many customers so it's easier to maintain...haha! Another good thing that I did like about Target is the brand clothing and graphic tees they sell that are sold at a reasonable price.

Ill eat half when i first get it and the other half cold the next morning. And its still just as yum yum the next day, if you're into cold food and stuff. Which i am because I'm lazy. 

But anyhoo, I've never actually ordered anything else from here so i cant speak to the other food. But obsessed is an understatement for my relationship with big johns and his donairs.",2016-09-08 21:54:32

I walked in around lunchtime on a weekday and the place was almost empty. I took a quick look at the menu board and though I walked in expecting to order a beef patty, I was intrigued by something called a ""festival.""

A cook from the back came out and asked what I wanted, to which I replied that I was wondering what the aforementioned ""festival"" was. This surly, unpleasant man took a few steps backwards and pointed to something that looked like dinner rolls with his metal tongs. Well, okay then.

So instead I asked for a beef patty. I attempted to hand the cashier a $20 bill, since they don't take credit cards, and he asked if I had anything smaller. I said I didn't and tried to give him my debit card, to which he responded that there's a minimum cost for using debit. Okay, I said, so I guess I'll just leave? He muttered something under his breath and took my cash and said that next time I should come armed with small change. Next time! Ha!

But how was the patty itself, you're surely asking. Aside from the fact that I was inwardly fuming the entire time I was eating it, this is a sad, pathetic little Jamaican patty. The pastry surrounding it is nice and flaky, admittedly, but the filling is nothing short of a trainwreck.

It's not even remotely spicy is the main problem here. A Jamaican patty without spice is about as useful as a bowl of nachos without melty cheese. It's also shockingly flavorless, so it's like you're eating a plain pastry with a warm, bland filling.

This entire joint is a travesty and a joke. I will, it goes without saying, never return.",2017-06-20 20:39:29

True to his French root, however, JMC takes off for a month long vacation in the middle of the summer. Where else should a girl turn to to satisfy her insatiable need of patisseries? A friend suggested that I try to fill the void with La Gourmandine (""it's not cheating on JMC if it's closed.""). 

I had previously passed on La Gourmandine, penalizing it (perhaps unfairly) for its hipper Lawrenceville address and its posher decor. But one fine Saturday morning, my croissant addiction got to me, so I finally caved and went in. 

Here is how I feel the two bakery stacked up against each other:
* plain croissants -- JMC's are consistently better. At G's, one week's croissants were kind of doughy, but the next week's were nice and flaky
* almond croissants -- I actually slightly prefers G's. JMC's almond croissants don't taste particularly almond-y, more like a vanilla pastry with some almond garnishes.
* fruit pastries (apple turnovers, etc.) -- a tie. I think G's are sweeter and more dessert-like while JMC's are more like breakfast pastries.
* dessert tarts -- JMC's hands down. More varied, fresher tasting.
* opera cake -- here, I have to give the nod to G's. It is less dense and not as over-poweringly sweet as JMC's.

Some other points I appreciated about La Gourmandine:
* On Saturdays, G opens later than JMC. So whereas JMC's most popular items are sold out by 10am, I can saunter into G's as late as 11:30am and still get a wide selection.
* It is easier to get to G's by public transportation than JMC's.
* G offers sandwiches and other savory items. I've not tried them yet, but they do look delicious
* The coffee at G's is better than the coffee at JMC's.

Aspects that favor JMC:
* Overall La Gourmandine is maybe 20% more expensive.
* Although the servers are cheerful and friendly, my purchasing experiences at La Gourmandine somehow feel less warm, more impersonal. 
* Sometimes, there are free samples at JMC's.
* JMC has macarones

So what do I conclude from these comparisons? Well, Pittsburghers are pretty lucky to have a choice of decent patisseries!  Now that JMC is back from their vacation (and as La Gourmandine is gearing up for theirs), I'm back to my weekly routine of trekking out to Millvale.",2012-08-25 23:39:47

Great burgers, and dare I say, even better shakes! The service has typically been really good, and the quality has maintained it's consistency despite their slow, but steady openings of new locations.

Ling and Louie's is a nice retreat from all the madness one might expect from an Indian Casino and its trailer-trash, octogenarian patrons.

First I have to say I LOVE THE VIG!!! You should too. I am just not a super huge fan of this location. 

Reasons: 
1. It is further away from my house than the original Vig. *not anyone elses problem other than mine* 
2. The patio is less than mediocer. 
3. The place is made out of solid concrete, making everything echo and if there are more than 5 people in the building it is too loud to hear yourself even think, let alone talk to the people at your table. 
4. I know most of the staff at the 40th street one, and I don't like change. 
5. OH and Elvis Before Noon doesn't play here on Sundays. 

Again, I LOVE THE VIG! The food is great the service is always good and a good time is usually had by all. But I have to say I am partial to the original. This is not to say you shouldn't go to the Vig Uptown, if you do it will be less crowded at the old one for me ;-)

6v5Q2t6eg4382gN-ALzvbg,RSAHZjr2yPZHZ-HhrgCrXQ,bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,4,5,0,6,"irashaimase!

The sushi void in Cleveland has been filled with Dante Boccuzzi's new venture, a very warm welcome to you indeed!  For what seems like months now we had been asking when Ginko would be opening every time we visited Dante....and sometimes randomly asking the valet boys on the street while doing a slow drive-by.  The long-awaited and much-anticipated arrival did not fail to disappoint on our first visit.

Opening night was last Thursday and we decided to arrive for an early dinner on Friday.  Wandered down the steps and took the door on the left (this will hopefully be signed soon) and were immediately greeted with a warm irashaimase by the entire staff, busy chefs included.  The atmosphere is very inviting...but not in the ""mood lighting, get comfortable and stay for a few hours"" kind of way....more like in the ""bright lights and cool swagger of Tokyo, sip your sake, eat your sushi, enjoy it, watch some Transformers in the background and be on your way to have fun for the rest of your night"" kind of way.

It's a small space, one horseshoe-shaped bar with space for 20 people or so, behind which the able sushi chefs prepare your dinner from beautiful cuts of fish that lay right in front of you.  If you want, you can just point to something and chef will make it for you.  The walls are brightly tiled with mosaic, a TV hangs unobtrusively from one wall (playing Transformers while we were there) and the videogame classic Millipede is tucked in a corner...I'll need to remember to bring quarters the next time I come.  Two high-top tables for two sit to the right of the entrance and there are two booths that can accomodate up to 6 people placed to the left.

We unfortunately did not make reservations...it was 5 PM and we thought we would be able to sneak in an early dinner before the evening rush.  We were seated at the last 3 non-reserved seats at the bar...unfortunately behind a very large pillar so I was unable to see the sushi chef action going on (I wanted my other diners to be able to see it for themselves so I took the ""seat of shame"").  Now, while the rest of this review will be glowing, this is my one big issue with Ginko.  I understand that it's opening weekend and you want to ensure a big turn-out and that's why practically every seat in the house was reserved, but we got there at 5 and were out by 6:15 at the latest and still none of the bar seat reservations had shown up.  There were 9 of us total in the restaurant and every other bar seat had ""reserved"" on it.  I'm fine with having the tables available for large group reservations, but to be able to reserve seats at a bar?  This was a little strange, and like I said, I don't know what time these reservations were for, but we were out of there before any of them had even shown up.  I can't imagine how many people they might haved turned away just because they said they were full.  There will be high turnover at the bar, just make it first-come-first-served Dante, please!!!  end rant.

Oshibori (steamed towels) for the hands prior to being served...very traditional and a nice touch.  For dinner, my companions started out with sake and they enjoyed it, my green tea was done in the traditional way and was very tasty.  Edamame, came out piping hot with big chunks of salt over them, delicious!

I ordered a smattering of nigiri and rolls for the table....

Spicy tuna roll - my absolute favorite, I order it everywhere I go and it is almost the standard by which I judge every sushi restaurant.  The combination of flavors in this version were perfect, simple and to the point, excellent.

Una Kyu - Eel and cucumber....lots of people think ""gross"" when they think of eel, but it is very pleasant to eat and pairs very well with the crunchy cucumber.

The Zeppelin - their specialty of the house....I didn't get a chance to ask chef what was in it, but it was fantastic, probably the best roll of the night.

Duck/foie - this was interesting, a little tough to eat in one bite (I couldn't get through the duck), but we wanted to try something a little different that Dante probably threw in the menu to spice it up!  Very nice flavor and texture combo...

Nigiri sushi - Toro (fatty tuna) was just melt-in-your-mouth perfect!!  You can tell the high quality of the fish Dante brings in by this cut alone...some of the best toro I've ever tasted.  Tarabagani (King Crab) was excellent as well...it's only a bit more than the Snow Crab, give it a try...

Doumo to the chefs, Taishi and Koji (who was so sweet, apologizing almost every 5 minutes for me being behind the pillar and constantly asking us if we needed anything else).  I can't wait to come again with a reservation for a table so I can try the Shabu Shabu...you can only order it at the tables since there isn't enough room at the bar for the production!

You basically get half the amount of food at twice the price of average Japanese restaurants.  Quality definitely trumps quantity, but with that said, the taste at this outwardly pleasant establishment is seriously lacking.

The food is very artistically crafted and pleasing to the eyes.  The waitress even serves your appetizers/entrees with an illustrative story behind each piece and demonstrates how the chef artfully creates a masterpiece.

And then with high expectations, I bite into an extremely mediocre piece of fish with rice and then some even more average tasting pieces of tempura.  I felt like I paid for a Cezanne, received a package of what looked like a Van Gogh, and opened up to see construction paper glued together by a 4 year-old.

No, you can't just decorate a plate, put colorful pieces of food together, slap on a story, charge more money and try and trick people into thinking it's good-tasting food.  I actually have real taste buds that can't be fooled.  This is not what good Japanese food tastes like.",2014-01-01 23:34:21

I usually do not use that function because I have a baby and a special needs 3-year-old so just to go out to eat at all is a pretty big undertaking.  Instead, I typically do my reviews afterwards from my desktop computer at home.  This time, our older child was not with us so I thought I'd try ""checking in"" for a change.  Much to my surprise, a 10% off offer just for checking in appeared on my phone!  CooL! When I showed it to the server,  I asked if I needed to let him know about it before ordering or at the conclusion of our meal he stated,  ""We can do it now. No problem.""  

He was very attentive, brought our drinks promptly, and even brought refills before our drinks were half empty. The food was served pretty quickly and was good. 

When the bill came, the 10% had not been taken off.  Another gentleman came to accept payment.   Therefore, I had to explain the. Whole Yelp thing over again to him which was kind of annoying. Also took a very long time for someone to come take my payment.  We had been ready to leave for a while and needed to go pick up our other son.

Nevertheless, I came here with 3 friends one evening. They have a nice selection of items to choose from, so even for carnivores like myself, there's something that should appeal to everyone. 

I had a stir-fried noodle dish with tofu and mixed veggies. It tasted good and was filling enough, although it was a bit on the greasy/salty side. ( I just assume to make vegan food taste good you need to go heavy on the oil/salt!) My friends enjoyed their meals as well, although no one left raving about the food.

Started off with the recommended salumi board.  This is in-house cured salumi from my understanding, and came with a selection of pickled vegetables and cheese.  Also, you can add warm olives and bread knots on the size.  A great sharing app for a party.  The salumi is excellent - you get three types, and generous cuts of cheese.  The bread knots are ridiculously addictive - crisp on the outside and drenched in olive oil and italian herbs.

For my main I had the bigoli with duck ragu.  Pasta was cooked nicely - al dente.  The duck ragu was delicious and not too saucy or salty.  They also have a gluten free option for any of their pastas.  My colleague had the burrata pomodoro pizza.  This was easily the star of our entrees.  The burrata was decadent and runny and the crust was cooked to perfection - perfectly crisp.  I have been to a fair share of pizza spots and was very impressed considering the other options on their menu.

Cocktails were meh.  I had the manhattan siciliano... which tasted pretty much like an average manhattan but boozer.  Service was OK and decor is kind of neat.

She got all my cups, put together a really nice milk/cream/sugar/stirrers package, put napkins and knives in the bagel box, everything that I would need to make sure the breakfast went off without a hitch. Even nicer, she was the one who took my order initially, and she saw everything through from beginning to end instead of just handing it off to another person.

First, the atmosphere/ambiance at this restaurant is totally different from most other places in the area. Summerlin is a planned community and as such it follows the same pattern as every other suburb on the planet- every 6 blocks there is a strip mall with a Best Buy and a Chilis. Most restaurants are chains and look exactly the same as every other restaurant in the country. Not so Marche Bacchus- it is an incredible place with an awesome view of the lake. It is an excellent place to take your special lady friend or anyone else you want to impress with your faux sophistication (second best place- Buffalo Wild Wings). 

Second, I have always found the service to be exceptional. The staff strike the perfect middle ground between ignoring you and being overly needy/explaining a million things you didn't ask about. 

Notes on specific dishes

French Onion Soup- not exactly rocket science to prepare, but that doesn't stop the Outbacks of the world from ruining a classic. This is great- very rich and no unnecessary flavors

Steak tartare- something you can pretty much get anywhere now a days but few are as good

Creamy Polenta- I love polenta so this is something I get frequently. The mushrooms make it less of a one note side dish and more of an appetizer. 

Veal- my absolute favorite. It always comes so tender and perfectly seasoned.

Beef Tenderloin- the red wine sauce on this is amazing. I'm not usually a beef tenderloin person but I love this.",2014-04-22 20:19:02

The Tiger Shrimp Wrap was decent, the shrimp was more on the undercooked side, but I hate overcooked shrimp even more.  The side of Sweet Potato Fries were great, and their dipping sauce made it more special.

The Mini Fried PB&J Sandwiches were good, it is served with two dipping sauces. I preferred my fried sweets dipped in their strawberry sauce.  The Dark Chocolate Sauce was alright, but nothing to write home or anywhere about.

There are even beautifully designed props you can take pictures with! 

Ferrero Rocher Candy Shake Shake ~$4.95S $5.95L- the best chocolate ever in an easy-to-drink format. So tempting to overdose on it. It's like diabetes in a cup, but it's so worth it. You have to try it at least once!

Sweet & Sour Detox Zhumei ~$4.85S $5.50L - It's a little too sweet to be considered a detox drink for me but it's comforting to see grape skin in the drink. Both flavours work well together and you can taste both the grape and lemon.

Rosey Latte (Rose, Honey, Latte) ~$4.5S $4.9L - It's what you'd expect with a sweet rose perfume smelling syrup. Has the bitterness of a latte yet it tastes like rose candy has been melted into it. It's only good if you are a fan of coffee. Once in awhile, re-mix the syrup in with the rose petals and foam.

NEVER have I had that anywhere in the US, Europe, Asia or on the God's creation with a bottle service. Wow. A bottle service doesn't usually have any cover attached. My boyfriend who was paying for said bottle service and 'negotiated' $10 for the guys; I was ready to can this place and move on. I personally like The W. You get a bottle ahead of time and they let you in. No cover; no questions; and let's just be honest, if you are gonna be picky with the velvet rope there, Mr. Velvet Rope Boy, you and your co-horts should at least dress the part. None of them matched. In fact, on a given night they would probably not be let into the finest dive bars in S Phoenix. IF they can be that picky, so can I. :-) Yes. This review is about to get Yelp responsible.  Seriously. Take your class and save it. Go somewhere with class and your hard earned bodies and nice clothing and money and spend it in a place that is worth it. There are so many clubs in Scottsdale, where you will be appreciated and treated well, whether you spring for the VIP bottle service or not. I may even create a DB list on my page and this place will top it. To continue..

That was squashed fast. Of course, the waitress wanted his signature and he laughed and told her , 'nah, I don't think so... NOT until I take a call from my bank about the fraud alert I just received!', to which she rolled her eyes. ( Yeah most of us caught that... too bad her tip is rolled into that bottle service). At that point, it was decided once he figured and worked out the bank issue and let Maya people know, that no second or third bottles would be purchased. We opted to leave and go elsewhere and purchase from the bars on the side. Issues with the bottle service. The waitress left the cap OFF the bottle of Ciroc after initially serving us. There was no security to our VIP area; people not in our group were all over our table area. Is that safe? NO! NOT with a bottle that is uncapped and glasses of drinks poured! Are you kidding me????

I don't mean 5 minutes early, I mean 45 minutes early. The lines can be pretty long at the main entrance and at the main elevators. Here is another good tip: check the department listing on the first floor and be sure to verify the floor you are looking at is for the courtroom you are looking for (i.e. Justice or District) There is no directory on the floor that you may select by inadvertently going to the District Court level when you wanted Justice Court. Most people that you share the elevator with do not have the departments memorized, so you will more than likely end up taking a trip back down to the main floor to find what floor you really needed... remember, I advised 45 minutes early. Although the elevators are usually over capacity, the stairwell is not.

I cringed that such a small salad cost about $7. The cashier was pleasant and quite apologetic that they were out of forks, but that wasn't a problem for me, as I had some plastic utensils back in my hotel room. He also offered me a cup of water to go, which I didn't need, but I appreciated the thoughtfulness.

I figured the salad would be okay. I was surprised it turned out to be quite delicious--the flavors and textures came together in a wonderful way. My only big complaint is that it's so SMALL.

Indeed, the flight paths into Cleveland are relatively limited.  Atlanta had direct from Shanghai... Cleveland, I'm having a hard time flying many places directly.

So, that said:

Decor outside suggests a shi-shi, upscale venue.  Interior uses a moderately neutral blue.  The shade is a tiny bit glum, and that's emphasized by the lighting.  Decor is south east asian -- could be burmese, but I can't be certain without direct inquiry.  There are buddhist motifs in some of the pictures.  There's no picture of the King of Thailand, so I don't think they're Thai.  Actually, I just checked their menu online... I can say rather confidently that they are Malaysian, probably malaysian-chinese given the presence of Hainanese Chicken.

Anyway, moving on...  

I sampled: Saba, hirame, maguro, sake, tai, shiromi and their spider roll.  A 22 oz Sapporo was ordered to complement my ginger palatte cleanser.  In all honesty, I should have spent more time assessing their sake list... Overall, it looked like there were somewhere between 10-12 available... but I didn't check to see what grades and brands were present (dumb).

The Spider roll was huge, stuffed with avacado and soft shell crab.  It was sprinkled with flying fish roe, and decent.  The consistency was a tiny bit soggy.  Flavourful, without any overwhelming sauces.

Wasabi was good quality as well as the soy sauce.  No complaints -- would prefer hand shaven Wasabi, but let's be realistic here...

The real issue at any Sushi restaurant is the quality of the fish.  I ordered one piece each of many types to sample, not wanting to commit to a large order, only to be unhappy with all of it.  The Spider roll was relatively safe ... but the test was the nigiri-sushi.

Alas, it's not a pretty picture.  The vinegared rice flavour was okay, but the consistency was off.  Several of the pieces of fish did not stay attached to the rice when lifted.  The rice itself did not stick to itself, and there was a little to much salt within the rice mixture.  The amount of seasoning between the rice and the fish was good -- more than I expected, but the effect wasn't bad --

I do think that they attempt to increase those flavourings to mask the relative age of the fish.  The fish are definitely fresh enough for consumption, but are also definitely not as fresh as I'd like... by a long margin.  

In Atlanta, Hong Kong, New York, DC, SF, LA I'd give this a 2.

In Tokyo, I'd drop to a 1.

If this is the best CLE has in Sushi, I'd better get used to it.  :)",2008-09-12 14:27:23

And I get that Kaya isn't a Mexican restaurant, but I think that means if you're going to put guacamole on your appetizer list, it better be on point.  It did have a lot of tropical ingredients mixed in, but it didn't have enough salt or acidity, and the chips were rather bland as well.

It is bigger than I anticipated and the bar is big, their menu is more than enough and of course they have several pool tables inside. But I wasn't here to play pool.

They have pretty good beer selection, where the local (Arizona) ones are cheap for happy hour. So are several of their dishes like sliders for $4, totally worth it and comes with sweet tater tots. This to me that's weird, but it's a great deal for someone to eat something while sucking down some awesome beers or margaritas. 

I consider this place a dive, but then again I do enjoy a good dive bar. Every day they have a different happy hour special, and some days it looks to be a fantastic deal. Since I have a hard time turning down a good deal - I know I will be back here.

They have some music going, and I have no idea where it comes from but it played everything from early Kiss to Beastie Boys. Nothing to brag about, but the music is totally appropriate for the venue. Service was good - we had a new waitress waiting on us, and as she might not be the strongest person to recommend stuff, she didn't get one order wrong... and really that's what matters.

They offer 3 different levels of AYCE on a 90 minute timeline, but everyone at the table has to order the same level - what if only one person wants the extra items on the higher level? I understand they want to make sure people are only eating what they pay for, but that seems a little unfair to the people/person who just wants the minimum priced choices. Seeing as we don't do AYCE Korean outside of SURA, it really wasn't an issue - but it's one more reason for me to NOT use this option. I also feel like if you're going to put a time limit on the meal, you should be quick with food. We sat next to a table who always seemed to be waiting for their meats to come out, which is not fair to the patron. 

Anyway, my mom and I ordered - I had Kalbi, she had Bibim Bap with Ojingo (squid) in it and also the beanpaste soup. I didn't really care for either of her dishes and she event commented that they both tasted different than the last time she ordered them there - and not different in an improved way. 

The Kalbi was good, it was a good and clean cut of meat. It wasn't as sweet/savory as I generally like it, but it did have good flavor. 

I can't bring myself to give more than an average rating as the place seems to have the one challenge that a majority of restaurants have in Las Vegas - poor service. 

I got refills of water quite regularly, but aside from that - there was no service. My mom had to flag down someone multiple times and when they didn't see her, she tried getting their attention in Korean, which she also had to do multiple times before they noticed. I could imagine, also, that if you don't speak Korean (like the table next to us who had some complications ordering their meat) that it could be a frustrating experience. 

Also, if you have more than 2 people doing AYCE, be prepared for a VERY overfilled and cramped table. There is not much room outside of the grill.",2017-06-08 09:31:23

Each piece looks like a little box of rice, with fish and sauces both inside and on top. It's made fresh and is brought out quick. Also the torching gives it a completely different flavor compared to regular sushi rolls. It was my first time having it and was pretty impressed.

It might be a little more expensive than some other sushi places (particularly for the pressed sushi), but the restaurant is in a convenient location, is high quality and the service is good.

All the way from the beginning, when the hostess sat us down for a table of 4 when we were a party of 5 (but said, we can put a chair at the end ....plus the restaurant was empty) to our horrible waiter, Mario.  It took us 15 min to get drinks, and it wasn't even Mario getting us drinks, it was someone else because they felt bad that we've been sitting there for 15 min with no one even looking at us.  

The food was ok...however, for the prices...it was a joke.  $4 for pepsi?!?  I get it...prices on the strip... so I won't state the obvious anymore re: prices.

Hostess was unbelievably rude when we asked to get an actual table that would fit 5.  She gave us a table top that only fit 4 and insisted we just add a chair to the end of a 4 person table top!  When I asked to get a table that would fit us, I got the annoyed, pissed off look.  

I felt like I had to apologize to our waiter Mario for actually making him work - that's how he made us feel.  I asked him if we can order.  He didn't tell us anything about the menu.  For example the size of the pizza, where it's only 4 slices.  He told that after we only order a few and also gave us the annoyed looked as though he knew it would not be enough or we should've have known!  He did follow up with ""I guess you've never been here, huh?!?""   It was funny though, 20 min later when a couple sat beside us...he provided them with all the information in the world!  I also had to request for a refill after my glass was completely empty for 10 min.  Again, it was as though we were bothering him.  

Complete BS.  

I would understand if this place was busy and the staff was running around...however this was not the case tonight.

If you're from the Phoenix area, or have visited a few times, you've probably run into a similar chopped salad at other restaurants, but Cowboy Ciao was actually the inventor of this yummy treat! So you should definitely try it here first if you want the true AZ Stetson experience.

I hate salmon. With a passion. In fact, I hate most seafood. But the smoked salmon in this salad is seriously delicious! It doesn;t even taste like salmon; it's sweet, slightly smoky, and the texture is similar to a ripe tomato. I know that sounds gross but I swear it's not.

I got my salad to-go before having a girls' night in with some friends, and I ordered it about 5 minutes before I headed out the door to grab it. To my shock and wonderment the salad was ready for me before I walked through the door, even though the hostess told me it would 15-20 minutes! Awesome. The guys behind the bar were efficient with getting me my food, eating utensils, and taking care of my bill. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes.

The salad isn't as good when you're eating it from a box, but it was still delectable. The dressing... to die for. It's a pretty pricey restaurant (I think my salad was around $20 total after taxes and a $2 tip) but I was craving it so what could I do?

My favorite order is just regular salmon (sake) sashimi. A huge plate of it. Their Ultimate Salmon rolls and Ultimate Hamachi rolls are very good too. The salmon, everytime I've been here, is beautifully colored with healthy lines of fat and has that wonderful taste and texture that you expect from excellent raw salmon.

Service has always been very good for me as well.

Upon returning for our appointments, they were still running behind which is understandable, so we waited another 10 min. However there were tons of people coming in and getting mad that they were being asked to come back in the afternoon because it was so busy.

1. Unfriendly Staff: compared to other Dollarama locations, this one seems severely understaffed and grumpy. I don't blame them though, because of reasons 2 & 3.

2. Small and Extremely Poor Layout: I won't even go into the fluorescent lighting because I understand this is a dollar store, but the store is so suffocating because of its cheap product fumes and the minuscule store size. The aisles are as narrow as they can get and peeps are as inconsiderate as they can get = not a good mix. The cashier station needs to be rotated 90 degrees so that the whole front of the store won't be congested like whoa. Seriously, just a tiny spatial optimization would do them a whole lot of good - I would almost volunteer to do it myself for minimal wages...

3. Has More Than Its Fair Share of Crazies: If you know me in person, you know that I am very kind to strangers. BUT what I cannot stand is people who are RUDE to the people around them when they are clearly able to understand the basic concepts of respect and logic. I have been harassed/witnessed harassment at this store too many times while waiting in line to pay for my regular fix of $1 Hickory Sticks.

Pittsburgh is the city of bridges with its over 400, but this one is special to me because I had spent so much time on it.

The bridge connects downtown Pittsburgh with Station Square and surrounding areas. It usually marked with graffiti from taggers and it is four lanes in total. It's the second oldest steel bridge in the United States for you history buffs. 

I can remember being in my car or even walking and any time a large truck would go by on the bridge would it would just shake. Like the Earth is moving shake. Initially it's terrifying but you get used to it, like most things in the 412. I'm guessing the suspension? One of the many quirks that Pittsburgh has.

A lot of people may not know where J-Town is, but there is a big yellow sign by the road that indicates where it is. You have to drive deeper to the plaza and Shiso Tree is right behind the buildings, in the middle of a terrace. 

I've been to Shiso Tree many times and in fact I have been there in many special occasions - i.e. Birthday, Christmas etc. It's a nice little cafe that may seat around 50 customers. One of the seats feature a zashiki style eating where customers are required to take off their shoes and sit around the low tables. (Look up what Zashiki style eating means in Google)

Shiso Tree is a fushion of Japanese and Italian style cuisine. This is definitely one of the few places that I think a fusion style cuisine is executed well. The portions are large. If you plan on coming to Shiso Tree, please come in an empty stomach. 

Starting with the appetizers, I would recommend Nori fries, which are fries with seaweed on top. The fries are also presented in a cone-shaped tower container. However, the fries are very salty so I would recommend drink a lot of water before you delve into the main dish.

I've had many different main dishes offered by Shiso Tree and I recommend 1) Okonomiyaki shrimp pasta, 2) Shoyu Pasta (mushroom) and 3) Carbonara. The Okonmiyaki pasta contains Japanese mayo. Carbonara pasta is also well done and rarely do I see Toronto carbonara pasta been made just as well as those in Italy.

I finally spoke to Sherise, who basically took over and said there was ""back up orders."" She asked me to come back in to verify my Rx with the Dr. 
Was it really necessary to make me drive all the way from across town just to get another trial? 
Because when I went back to ""see the doctor,"" they ended up prescribing me with the same lower intensity in the monthly Toric bifinity which I had already knew I needed and I had already previously explained that that Rx was fine. 
Sherise called about a week later to come pick up an additional trial. Again, drove all the way from Henderson to Summerlin.
She told me to follow up and let them know how they fell.  I called her up a few days later. Told her to order them. She explained I would be paying about $30.00 more for the astigmatism, which is fine, I guess, but The first tech never explained this to me to begin with.
So now, here we are, 2 weeks later, checking to see if they were finally ready, and guess what, the order was never actually placed.
She said she was ""Still waiting on me to tell her if the trial worked out."" 
Unbelievable. My original visit was on February 26th!! 3 months later and I still don't have my contact?!? I seriously would not recommend this place to anyone. Never going back. If my contacts are not ready by Wednesday which is when she said they'd be ready. They better believe I will ask for a bloody refund.",2016-06-03 21:55:15

Or maybe even the entire center. Chef Sawyer's Belgian style ""frites"" will forever change your relationship with fried potatoes. And that is just the start. The Greenhouse Tavern is the Cleve's first ""Gen Y"" restaurant. This is a sharp space built with vision. The use of reclaimed materials is symbiotic with the chefs vision for the menu. It is a clever use of the ""old"" to create something ""new"", while still retaining respect for and giving props to it's origin. 
Four visits to the GHT now, so, the food: The food is pretty ballsy for the opening menu. It pushes the envelope right off the bat, and it looks like Chef Sawyer is just getting started. I just had to have the Steak Tartar every time so far. Not something you see on too many menus, anywhere. (example #1 of pushing the envelope) Always fresh, dark and delicious. Locally grown roasted pencil thin asparagus with sauce Bernaise was crunchy in texture, rich, lemony and buttery in flavor. 
""Cardoons"", sauteed in a Chablis vinegar were another vegetarian hit. Cant say I've ever had, or heard of, a ""Cardoon"" before. (another example of a forward thinking menu). The sweet pea fritters were amazing. Light and airy, not at all oily.  OMG!  Fresh radishes with butter and salt!!! I have not had these since my mom made them as a ""healthy snack"", so for me, it was out of the park good. Tremendous chicken wings, braise I believe, w jalapenos, garlic.... I can honestly say that so far, everything on the menu that I have tried is really, really good. I look very forward to the evolution of the menu. This is a tremendous addition to the already powerful Cleveland food scene. We are lucky to have places like this in the cleve. Medical Mart? Screw that. Make this city a ""Food Mecca"". People with this type of vision and passion could make it happen a lot faster than some fat ass blowhard politicians who cant see past yesterday. 
Bravo Greenhouse. Cant wait for the next meal!

Aunt: (to bartender) Can I get a beer please?

Server: (walking up) Can I help you with something?
A: I'm getting a beer from the bar, since you left our table a few times.

S: That is just not true. I was out there and NONE OF YOU WERE READY.

You see the cutest little baby octopus no bigger than a gumball.  He swims around in front of you for a little while, and you put your hand out and he lands gently on your hand.  He seems to look up at you for a second before darting back behind the coral.

Now take that feeling and multiply it by TEN and that's what it feels like to eat one of these delicious little baby octopusses hot off the grill.  I have had a lot of Korean BBQ but never had baby octopus marinated in spicy bean paste.  Those little guys alone made this dining experience worth it.

Went for dinner and I've definitely had better meat, but eating anything hot off the grill while it's still sizzling is always a bit forgiving.  Bulgogi is ok, marinade a little mild.  Kalbi marinade even milder.  The porkbelly was solid.  Some other yelpers question the freshness but when we went it was so crowded that they were constantly bringing out new meat.  

Banchan selection is limited as others pointed out, but one nice thing is you serve yourself.  So everytime you want more doenjang, garlic, or jalapenos, you can help yourself instead of waiting around for the server like at other Korean BBQ joints.  I also like to mix salt/pepper, garlic, jalapenos, with sesame oil for dipping - especially for the non-marinated meats.

Be forewarned that you have to cook everything yourself and also that you're gonna stink like Korean BBQ all night - I was asked 4 times, ""Did you eat Chinese food or something?""

For the most part this place is 2 stars, but the baby octopusses and the $16 price made it 3 stars for me.",2009-03-14 15:37:06

We hadn't had the house serviced since we had it treated for termites when it was built (over 13 years ago).  Anyhoo - I jumped on YELP to see if I could find a termite company to compare to our current pest control servicer (we have the house and yard sprayed for bugs every 6 months or so).  HDE had some great reviews.  I wanted to use a local company to keep more of our tax dollars in our state.  
I called them up and David came out at a time convenient for us.  We already had a first quote from another termite company, so we had something to base it off of.  David provided us a quote on the spot.  He was comparable in price, but did a whole lot more explaining of what the process was and how the chemicals worked.  I worked in a termite inspection company in Calif - so I was familiar with alot - and he still wowed me with how he explained it in terms both me and my husband understood.  We gave David the head nod that we would use his service.  His office emailed the docs over for signature and away we went.

This one is the closest one to my house, and I decided to come here for lunch.  I saw an advertisement for a green chile burger, and also that they had fried pickles as a side.  Sign me up!  Drove down to the drive thru and placed my order of a green chile burger combo with fried pickles as my side and a Mountain Dew to drink.  Here is how everything was...........

Green Chile Burger-  Freddy's uses the ""smush"" technique for their burgers.  They squash them down really flat with the spatula so the edges get nice and crispy and hang over the edge of the bun.  My burger came with two 2oz patties, some nice grilled onions, some mustard, cheese and a fair amount of green chiles.  The taste was very good.  The cheese was melted perfectly, the onions and green chiles were nice and pliable/soft and the patties tasted fine.  Maybe not the best green chile burger I have ever had, but for a fast food type place, it was pretty solid.

Fried Pickles-  These things were great!  They were little pickle chips, breaded and deep fried.  They had a great crunchy batter on them and were delicious!  I would definitely get them again!

Service in the drive thru was great!  The lady who took my order was extremely chipper and happy, and the guy that handed me my food was all smiles and thanked me for coming in (it was sincere, too...I can spot a bullshit reaction from miles away).

I stopped by with 2 friends in-between attending 2 social Events in the immediate vicinity and although I had pinpointed the location on Google Maps, I wasn't aware that they were just off of a long roadway which curved south of Queen St.  Saulter Street has a fairly nondescript appearance and entrance area when seen from the outside and the Brewery is fairly small, which is not really surprising given its location.

One friend and I shared a beer which was quite flavourful while my other friend ordered a beer for himself.  Our server was quite helpful in providing us with water to drink when needed and the Bartender helpful in answering questions about their beers before we ordered.  I believe the Brewery only had 2 beers on offer when we were there which was kind of nice for a change in that we were able to choose quickly.

I'm pleased I went in order to discover its exact location and overall appearance inside.  As there are several other Breweries in the immediate area, I expect a return visit in the not too distant future, perhaps as part of a Bar and/or Brewery Crawl.",2018-04-05 22:27:14

I went to the Bethany Home / 16th Street location. Beware: the store very easy to miss near the bustling intersection.  The ice cream store is set off  the street and has a very non-assumming storefront.
The owner, Jan, profoundly passionate about the ice cream, offered me samples and explained the natural pure ingredients that goes into her product.  Everything is picked out with care and made by staff.  The vanilla beans and nuts are roasted, real mint leaves used, highest quality cream, etc. 
I had a pint hand packed then Jan offered me a home made marshmallow.  She lightly torched it for me. You might ask, ""what difference does home made  matter?""   To which I respond ""Oh MAN!  Golly Gee!! Miss Molly!!""  The taste was totally surprising and Sensational!!
Our ice cream of brown butter pecan and salted caramel was everything Kylie said it would be--- creamy, fluffy, delicate in flavor, refreshing with very distinctive flavors.  It felt healthy -- if that makes any sense .

This place rocks for take out/casual Greek food.
Ordered a regular chicken souvlaki plate, a fried calamari and an order of Greek fries. 
My feedback.
The chicken was good and there was a lot but I think the size of the pieces being on the smaller side made them a touch dry, however still delicious. The rice and salad were good, the potatoes need some work. If they are going to do the tomato/lemon style Greek potato they should peel them, use larger pieces and get that tomato flavour infused in each piece. 
Fried Calamari was a 10, perfectly cooked and very tasty with the tzatziki sauce.
The Greek fries were thin and crispy with plenty of feta but they needed more sauce.
Overall excellent, WAY better than Astoria or Mr.Greek and from what I can tell these guys are actually Greek which believe it or not isn't that easy to find these days (Greek owned Greek restaurants).

They have a small bar space and a nice booth and table area. The place is clean and welcoming. We were able to seat anywhere since there weren't a lot of people in there. I started off with a Vietnamese beer and spring egg rolls for appetizer. The beer was delicious and paired nicely with the spring rolls. The spring rolls are much smaller than typical egg rolls but it was delicious. It comes with dipping sauce that went well with it . For dinner I got shrimp and chicken vermicelli, Banh Mi ,and stir fry vegetable and rice. The Banh Mi for the price and the amount of meat and flavor was very delicious . It is listed as an appetizer but you could definitely eat it as a meal. The shrimp and chicken vermicelli was my favorite. It comes in a big bowl with their sauce in the side which you have to mix in. The flavor of the rice noodles, shrimp, chicken and the all vegetables went well together and refreshing. The only thing is I wish they would give is a little more meat. The stir fry vegetable and rice was okay dish for me.

They have the ingredients to be great,  but the prep was just off the mark.  A big plus for me was that the food was not salty as most restaurant food is, but that may explain some of the prior reviews of bland.  What some call ""bland""  i call clean pure flavors, but that requires proper cooking to be great. 

Lets back up to the Oysters though.  I LOVE Kumamoto oysters on the half shell.  Usually they are small and plump and sweet.  We almost didn't order them because the price was more than $2 each for the dozen.  What a waste.  These were SUPER small,  less than half the size of my pinky and thin and slimy and grey, not plump and white.  They tasted just OK, but not great.  We had just had a dozen Kumamotos at TIDES across the street at GVR the week before and they were EXCELLENT.  It was like the chef at Kings ordered a different ""grade"" of oysters, the cheapest ones on the market and then charges more than anyone in town.   When we mentioned to the waiter they did not compare to across the street,  soon the manager brought us a free half dozen of Mermaid oysters.  Nice gesture, but not great either. The good ones are out there, just order the right grade chef.  

Now the entrees,  I had Lemon, Nut Crusted Sea Bass. Grilled zucchini and sweet corn.  The flavor on the fish was excellent, BUT it was overcooked.  Without the lemon sauce it would have been dry.  2 minutes less on the grill would have been flaky and perfect.  the zucchini was BURNED, only some pieces were edible. Again if not burned, flavor would have been good.  corn was good, but not sweet and not buttery as the waiter described. Sliced off the cobb is yummy, but toast it a little more with butter and it could be great like skite corn from texas. 

My husband had Sword fish picatta, corn and Mac n' cheese.  His fish was good.  His Mac n' cheese had good flavor, but again OVERCOOKED to dry and pasty.

Like I said, had the potential to be EXCELLENT if the cooking was correct.  At pretty steep prices, I won't be back.until I hear they have a new chef.   I'll head across the street to TIDES at GVR where the fish is cooked perfect and the oysters are da bomb.

The green tea shaved ice is wonderful and only cost a dollar more. They do not skimp on the fruits either. Half a banana, watermelon, kiwis, strawberries, mango. I am drooling as I relive this experience. A small is good enough to feed two people. We had just finished with dim sum so take that into account.

The small size is $5.75 and large is $7.90.  There was something else too, it is called frozen breath$3.75 or $2.25 combo with icecream.

Sweetie Fry (love that name!) opened exactly one week from the day we moved out of Cleveland Heights. Thank God. Living within walking distance from this place would have been bad for my health. 

I've been to SF twice now and had good experiences both times. Love the tiny little free scoop of ice cream they put on top of the scoop you order. Gives you a chance to try a bite of one of their more creative flavors without committing to the whole scoop. 

The fries are where it is really at, though. OMG you have to try the waffle fries. Seriously the best f'ing waffle fries I have ever had. There are many sauce choices to choose from (extra charge)- my favorite: Indian Masala. So crazy good - just right with the salty fries. 

The only complaint I have is that the extra special sauces are $0.80 each and just for a regular condiment cup amount - which is enough if you get more than one but not enough if you just get one sauce for a large fry order. A bit pricey but they are creative, different and made in house so hey whatever. Also, they do tend to run out of waffle fries, and the regular ones are good but just not on the saintly level of the almighty waffle. Damn are they good! Get you some!

First impressions.  When we walked in, about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied.  The restaurant was VERY clean.  Lots of tables, no kitsch decor, and an order/pick up at the counter type set up.   

The lady at the counter was friendly and took our order w/ no problems.  We asked about ordering chips (they are listed on the on-line menu), and the lady said they were included, and gave us a couple of bowls of chips along w/ our drink cups.

They have a salsa bar with several different salsas available.  Medium smooth (hot sauce), medium chunky, hot, fire roasted, and pico de gallo.

The fire roasted salsa and the medium smooth were good, but nothing special.  The chips however, were well past their prime (stale).

We ordered a #2 combo plate (2 hard beef tacos), #6 combo plate (red chile burrito), and a bean and cheese burrito.

The food came fast and hot.  That's about the only good things I can say.  The red chile burro had a lot of meat and grease, but no flavor.  The red chile it self was very thin and watery.  The rice was bland.  The beans had the flavor of being fresh out of a can.  The tacos were also packed w/ meat, once again without flavor.  The same bland rice and beans accompanied the tacos.

My son ate about 1/2 of the bean and cheese burrito, and didn't want to take the rest home, and I didn't blame him.  He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a bean and cheese burritos, and he didn't like the beans either.

Maybe if we would have had one of their margaritas or cheap beer that many people rave about we would have liked it more.

I would rate almost any of ""berto"" places above Caramba when it comes the the flavor of the food.  I would rather have traveled down Bell Road to Mixteca.

My advice, if you want fresh, tasty, fast Mexican food.  Go to the nearest Carolinas.

I'm giving 2 stars, the restaurant was spotless, and the iced tea was fresh and very good.",2014-06-30 19:28:01

In VA I worked at a wine and beer bar, where we served and I tasted some of the best beers in the world.  And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  

Also, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.

Let me start by complimenting the service at Hanks.  From the hostess to the server and the serving team, the service is great!  I was really impressed with everyone.  The team was super friendly, very professional, and didn't try to push us towards expensive dishes or sides.

That said, we go to restaurants for food.  While the food is very good, the price point is ridiculous.  This is my third time to Hanks, but the first time back in about seven years.  I've been to T-Bones several times, and always thought of the two places as the same restaurant (with a slight nod to T-Bones for being a bit better although I think they are about the same now).  My wife and I shared a Steakhouse Salad, which was excellent.  The restaurant split it without an upcharge, which is always nice.  The salad itself was great and I would order it again.

For dinner, I had the Wagyu 10 ounce filet ($86) and my wife had the 22 ounce rib eye ($68).  My first comment to my wife was the price.  I've eaten at Michael's, Gordon Ramsey Steak, Craftsteak, Carnevino (meh - pass on this place), Del Frisco's, Michael Mina, etc., so I think it's fair to say that I've tasted a fair amount of the steakhouses on the strip to local places (Golden Steer).  We have even eaten at Guy Savoy and Robuchon.  This was the first time I was shocked at the prices for a semi-local steakhouse.  I mean, you can get a rib eye cap from Craftsteak for $64 (or even the Wagyu skirt steak as a better deal than the Hank filet) or $66 from Gordon Ramsay steak, so seeing a simple rib eye for $68 was a shocker to me.  I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to eat at a celebrity restaurant, but I will not pay that much for a local place.  From what I remembered, the price point at T-Bones was much more reasonable and in line of an off-strip restaurant.  

As for the food, it was quite excellent.  My Wagyu filet was amazing.  For a filet, it had a fair amount of marbling and tasted phenomenal.  If I was ever going back to Hank's, which I'm not, I would order it again.  However, the rib eye kind of sucked.  It had a super umami flavor from being wet / dry aged, so you need to like that type of earthy flavor.  Michael's also ages its meats, but they are simply just better.  Anyway, the rib eye really lacked the fatty taste that makes a rib eye a rib eye.  If you put this rib eye against Old Homestead's rib eye, there is no comparison, Old Homestead is just better.  If you put it up against a rib eye cap, which really isn't a fair comparison, then you're better off just going to Gordon Ramsay steak and ordering it there so you can also order the sticky toffee pudding since you'll get a better steak for a better price at a fancy restaurant with an amazing dessert.  

The food is really good at Hank's, but it isn't worth the prices they are charging.  You can spend the same amount of money at a strip restaurant or spend significantly less money and just go to the Silverado Steakhouse at the South Point and get the same quality service and same quality food (albeit with much better tasting rib eye).",2018-01-23 21:23:07

Yesterday afternoon, at 3:30, I called in for a takeout order. I asked for two orders of pork rib soup. The person who took my order said they will be ready in 30 minutes and I told them I will be there within the next hour. After one hour and ten minutes, at 4:40, I was there only to hear my orders are not ready yet. They told me to wait for 15 more minites so I did. While I was waiting, I paid for my food but no one offered me a water or anything. After ten minutes of waiting, a guy comes out and says they would refund my money because they can't work on my orders right now. I was given two extra dollars for calling one hour ahead and waiting for an hour and thirty minutes and going home with nothing. My friend who ordered the same food with me was so upset she had to call them to ask what happened. The person who picked up the phone says their refrigerator broke down the day before and all their meat and raw items have gone bad so they couldnt make my orders(?????!!!???!?!?WTH??!). My friend said if they had known they wouldnt be able to complete our orders they should have informed us when we called. My friend couldn't be more upset because of the waitress's attitude. She was giggling the whole time (im guessing because she was talking to someone else?) and when my friend asked her what is so funny in this situation she said ""so what do you want me to do about it? (WORD FOR WORD)"" Needless to say, we didn't have anything to eat and we are NEVER coming back to this place.

The thing that I really liked about the studio is that you can choose whether you want to be touched by an instructor or not, to readjust your position when doing a pose. If you'd like to be readjusted, you just pick up a coin in the lobby before you head into the room and place it next to your mat. Coin means, okay for the teacher to touch and readjust, no coin means they can't touch you. 

The studio has separate changing areas for men and women. They have both cubbies and lockers to secure your items. The changing area is very clean and has showers if you'd prefer not to wait to shower until you get home. 

The name doesn't really give it away but this is hot yoga, I had never tried it before, it was interesting.

Twice now I've sat in the bar area of a Red Robin (most recently this one) and each time it's taken forever for my order to be taken. The first time this happened the recent renovations to the restaurant had just been finished so I thought it was just growing pains that it took almost an hour for our food to be delivered to my table that time. This time there's no excuse. There's no excuse as to why the hostess wanted to make us wait for seats when there was no less than TEN open booths (most of which were two seaters; perfect for the grand total of two people in my party). There's no excuse as to why our waitress walked past our table several times without taking our order (it got to be so apparent she was ignoring us that the man running the actual bar took pity on us and took our order himself). There's no excuse for our waitress practically shooing us out the door minutes after we'd received our food (more than half the tables in the bar area were empty, she had no reason to be so eager for us to leave other than the nasty attitude I got from her). And to top it all off, the Pig Out Tavern Double I ordered (which was just supposed to amount to a smaller version of their regular bacon cheeseburger) arrived with just one solitary piece (not strip) of bacon. 

Like I said, this is the second time I've received this kind of service in the bar area. So my advice is to skip sitting in the bar if you plan on ordering something more than a beer (even if there's a wait time for a table elsewhere). You'll get better service that way.",2015-07-18 19:39:10

I figured a Monday would be a safe day to avoid lineups and enjoy a quieter morning meal.

When I got there, there were only a couple of people  waiting ahead of me. We were both in the back waiting room (yes, there's a back waiting room!). They even gave me coffee while I waited. How nice is that?

Once we were seated, our server was prompt with more bevvies and menus. I've been hearing wonderful things about the eggs benny, so that's what I got! So did one of my breakfast mates. I'm not sorry I did. They were delish! I got them with avocado and roasted red pepper. The portion was filling, and ran about $12.75 for the dish.

We've had our share of late night slices at the downtown location, so knew to expect a NY style pizza, that you can't find anywhere else on this side of town. 

We ordered a 20"" Presto to go (yeah, there is only two of us. Don't judge.): Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Basil and garlic. When we got there, they had no record of our order, so that was pretty annoying. On the plus side, this allowed us to try four different kinds (by the slice), and they only charged us for two slices to make up for it. It worked. 

They had quite a variety of slices to choose from, so besides the Presto, we got a buffalo chicken, a sausage/pepperoni, and a Caprese (fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, red onions, basil and green olives). They popped them in the oven to warm them up and get the nice crispy NY crust. Since we got them to go, we ran the risk of a soggy crust, which unfortunately did occur to a couple of them because of the Caprese juicy tomatoes. That one had a few too many ingredients- better to keep it simple so you can make the perfect NY fold of the slice. The other three were classic NY, and really executed well. 

The place was pretty empty for a Friday night, so I hope the work gets out about this place! There are lots of tables, so next time we will stay there to eat to maintain the crispy crust.

It's a lot like Guu/Kinka, but without the yelling. The decor is cool with the brightly-lit games on the walls, otherwise dimly-lit space, and dark wood furniture.

-- Sashimi shooter
-- Duck tataki 
-- Karaage (fried chicken)
-- Omurice (omelette)
-- Pork Ramen
-- Cheesecake and mango sorbet

My favourite is a toss up between the ramen or the omurice, with a close runner-up of the sashimi shooter. 

The shooter had an interesting gooey texture that I think might put some people off, and to be honest while I enjoyed it, it wasn't exceptional. It's not something I'd say is a must-try. but the presentation was really special. 

The ramen and omurice were both good. The karaage was made perfectly, although I prefer Guu/Kinka's; I feel like Kingyo's isn't as crunchy-fried and has an interesting herby/spice flavour that deviates too much from the pure fried chicken taste I like. 

I would pass on the cheesecake and sorbet. The portion was puny and while it was good, it wasn't a satisfying portion-to-price ratio. 

I prefer the laid-back atmosphere to the boisterous Guu/Kinka and I feel like there are so many things on the menu to choose from that you're bound to find something. Based on how everything we ordered was good without a bum note, I wouldn't think twice about coming back.",2017-01-31 20:24:43

Both items consist of a plate of cold Soba noodles topped with seaweed and matcha powder, and a bowl of warm soup in the flavour you ordered for dipping. I would suggest the Tonkotsu Soy Milk if you like more flavourful soup. We also ordered the matcha soufflé pancakes to share. The texture of the pancakes were soft and light, which lives up to it being a 'souffle' pancake. You can taste the matcha flavour in the pancakes if you don't use the syrup...the syrup will pretty much cover all the matcha taste so we didn't use much of it. Pancakes are not that sweet so it's good that it comes with some ice cream on the side. I think tsujiri can up the pancakes with offering their famous soft serve ice cream on the side instead of the ball of regular ice cream though.

I really like their jerk chicken. From what I've heard, it's pretty authentic, especially the part where they literally butcher chop the chicken into random pieces. If you order their Jerk Chicken, you can get a leg, or maybe a wing, or maybe a cut of something and something else, or... who knows, it's a surprise. I've never tried ordering a specific part of the chicken, but I bet they would just look at me funny if I did.

But yes, their service is extremely slow. So slow that you would think there is only one person in the back doing the work of 4 people, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's just the culture of the business they run. Go prepared to stay there longer than your typical hour or so because you will be waiting. Expect to repeat things multiple times to the server, who is usually very sweet but also forgetful and unattentive. If you want something, ask for it specifically. 

I literally sat there for 2.5 hours one time. I had decent company, so it wasn't that bad, but I was STARVING. I was craving their jerk sauce, so I had just to wait. If you really like a good kick, ask for their homemade hot sauce. I can take some pretty spicy things, and this one is enough to make me cringe. Because it's homemade, ithe hotness does differ from time to time. 

I haven't tried anything else there, but if I am waiting an 45-60 mins on average for food, I want to make sure it's the best thing on the menu.",2008-09-13 18:22:49

Hey I must tell you......!
I sense something tasty in my mouth
Situation is serious......!
Let's try it cause we're running out of time
It's oh so delicious.....!
Bo Bites reviews they seem from the start
It's all so lyrical......!
When food is ready from the start

It's driving me out of my mind!
That's why it's not hard for me to try
Can't get it out of my mouth
Miss it, taste it, love it
That place is GOGI......!

Solid! Solid as a rock!  

GOGI delivers to me in my book...and palate!  Located in the heart of what I call the Phoenix Asian mecca, GOGI's location is perfect to showcase to the Asian community.  GOGI's is modern and subtle like a model home display.  Not my cup of tea I guess.  Service was spot on though and very attentive and helpful when my buddy and I needed some suggestions.  

We started with the Seafood Pancakes, which came with a ponzu-like sauce in a bowl full of jalapeno peppers.  Overall a nice start, the pancakes were nice and soft in the middle and crunchy at the edges with small cuts of calamari giving it some extra texture.  For our entree with shot for the Spicy Pork Belly and the Bulgogi Beef Hot Stone Bowl.  Boy did we hit the jackpot!  The Spicy Pork Belly was somewhat fatty, but overall the taste was music to my palates.  Tender with a hint of chewiness, the flavors was sweet and spicy; I could eat this all day with some rice!  Our Bulgogi beef hot bowl came with of course Bulgogi beef, bean sprouts, slivered carrots, spinach, cucumbers, and crusty rice....yeahhhh!  I love it when the rice at the bottom of the bowl  hardens giving this entree a crunchy punch.  They give you a sweet red sauce to liven up the dish since you can definitely smell and taste the strong sesame sauce oil they use to cook it.  

Overall my kind of place to come to!  Seems like a family owned spot with some care and love to the craft.  In the end, it's an A in my books! - Enjoy!",2015-02-17 17:47:38

calamari - unbelievable!  Delicious, tender perfectly cooked and seasoned calamari with a great accompaniment of shallots, asian noodles, carrots, scallions, cashews, and red chiles in a lovely sauce.

halibut cheeks benedict with lobster and Hollandaise - delicious.  perfectly cooked biscuits (says the Southern girl who knows my biscuits), the hollandaise was well-done - not too stiff, not too heavy, and perfectly cooked eggs.  The little side salad with it was just ok.

lobster bisque - delicious.  Not too creamy, lots of lobster flavor goodness, pleasing texture.

asparagus with hollandaise - tender, fresh baby asparagus 

corn - amazingly fresh and flavorful.  It was hard to stop eating it.

bananas foster butter cakes - a bit too sweet for my taste but everyone else loved it.  The butter pecan ice cream was divine.

godiva chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream - Oh.My.Goodness.  Were licking the plate not frowned upon (in some places,) I would have.

Whitehaven Sauvignon Blanc - lovely, light, fresh bouquet.  Kim Crawford lovers will enjoy it.

Right at the beginning of Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is literally right outside. 

VALET: 
Attendant quick to assist you as you drive up. Unfortunately, extremely long wait when it's time to get your car from the valet. Also, the valet guy actually gave us the wrong car... After that, we decided to park the car ourselves in the free self parking garage.

CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT: 
Average wait time. Sadly, the hotel did not have the in-room TV check out option, so you either have to a) wait in line or b) fill out one of those express cards and drop it in the box downstairs.

ROOM IN NORTH TOWER:
Very spacious room. Flat screen television w/Direct TV. The bathroom is rather small in comparison to the rest of the room. There's a wall mounted hair dryer for use. The hotel provides those conditioning shampoo combos, along with lotion and a small bar of soap. The bathroom area is also where the wall safe and iron/ironing board are located.

However, the room lacked:
-coffee machine/tea
-closet
-desk
-comforter for the beds
-thermostat

HOUSEKEEPING:
Towels were delivered in under 5 minutes of request.

OVERALL:
The Plaza looks great now that it has been renovated. The lobby area, casino floor, and the rooms finally received the long overdue facelift. However, upon a closer look, you can still see some of its imperfections. Nevertheless, it's still a great rate you're getting for a clean and newly renovated room in comparison to some of the other older casino rooms in downtown Vegas.",2012-02-10 08:06:38

So, I was not surprised when I heard that a second location in Scottsdale would be opening up. Although the Yelp lists the restaurant as ""Naked BBQ,"" it's actually called NakedQ.

If you're familiar with the original location on Bell, you'll find an identical menu and similar setup - sans the writing on the walls. 

I ordered a meat platter of both chopped and sliced brisket, while my girlfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich. I opted for a side of mac and cheese and decided to forgo my second side option for extra cornbread muffins. 

Now, as I've stated in my review of their other location, Naked, on a good day, can deliver BBQ that's right up there with some of the best that we've found in our search. Although unfortunately, not every day is a ""good"" day. The quality of the meats were decent, as they usually are, but everything was a bit too cold for some reason. The brisket was good, although not quite as smoky as I remember. The pulled pork was fine, but also not quite as warm as what's considered to be the norm. I'm not sure what all this was about, but it's always a risk when you decide to branch out.

As I rant about in almost every BBQ review I write, it's usually not the meat that's the problem, it's the quality of the sides. Naked's mac and cheese is just okay, while their cornbread muffins are the kind that incorporate actual corn itself and traces of jalapeno. It gives it more of that ""soufflé"" type of taste, that isn't really my thing.

Overall, despite my minor complaints, I still think this is one of the better BBQ joints that we've found in our search. It's nice to see that their success has enabled them to open a second location, although I think in the future, I'll stick to the original.

In recent years, it sure seems their customer service is slipping.
Men's Rail never has been a department I've recognized for their customer service. It was never bad service by any means, It just wasn't Nordstrom quality service. I've felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase, thought friendly, they never seemed to care much. It's the department I do the majority of my Nordstrom shopping, but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip (no matter how recent), I've never been sent a thank-you card, and though I have asked numerous times, I've never been called about sales or new items.
I will describe my last couple visits to the Rail.
Earlier this year I was rummaging through a sale rack. I was completely ignored, while the three associates there helped customers who were perusing the regular priced racks. Not only that, but two female associates were talking about one of the sale shirts (that i was holding in my hand). One girl said she wasn't sure if she liked it, she'd have to see it on her boyfriend, but it might be ""too ugly"" for her to let him wear. The other girl replied ""Yeah, the color is a little gay."" Now, they weren't talking about it because it was in my hand, and I don't feel they were homophobi
My last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store.
I had another pair of jeans I brought in for a repair. I was again offered an exchange but I was insistant on the rapair because I really loved them and they didn't have them anymore. I was wanting a small tear repaired and was originally planning on shipping them out to New York to have them rewoven. I instead opted to try Nordstrom, hoping to save a few bucks (atleast the cost of shipping to and from NYC). Well I was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as ""Customer's own goods, no charge"". I told her the jeans are a couple years old, it's just from wear and tear, not a defect. I was told not to worry about it and needless to say I was very excited. I was planning on spending about $20-25 for the repair. I asked how the repair would be done and they said they would be rewoven. Even better! So I clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched. I was told yes, that was correct.
So they took them in and gave me the date of 6/4 that I could come in and pick them up. Well that date came and went. I was so busy I didn't get a chance to go get them. No big deal, I wasn't in a rush. On 6/12, the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if I had wanted them shortened. I said no, just the repair that I brought them in for. He didn't know what repair and I described what I wanted. He told me he just found the original slip, the pants had not been touched yet, but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge. He said I should get them by Saturday or Monday.
Well that didn't happen. I called this past Thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation. He said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day.
That didn't happen either. I called back the next day. He tells me ""I'm sorry, you must not have gotten my message."" Well of course I didn't get your message! You didn't call me so you obviously didn't leave me a message either!
Well that is what I wanted to say. But I was nice. He said the jeans were going out that day. That DID happen and I got them the following day!!
Thankfully they had not been shortened, but they also were not rewoven. They were patched and then stitched over the patch. I'm annoyed, but the thread they used is a perfect match and they did do a good job. The work is very subtle and hardly noticeable.
This is just not the level of service I would expect from this store, regardless of what department I am in. I know I probably shouldn't complain about a free service, but I didn't expect or ask for it to be free...",2013-06-26 21:46:00

Furnishing was a mish mash of eclectic styles of new and old furniture.  Walls were adorned with lovely photos and there was one plant at the corner which gave the place some liveliness. Also the floor to ceiling windows provided lots of sunshine with a great view of people passing by.

Service was friendly and warm, place was comforting and not busy like most coffee places.  Definitely a hidden gem off the beaten path.",2015-05-29 15:35:27

My husband the chicken wings and he said they were tasty and I ordered the pastrami which was lean but very dry and just okay and not something I'd order again. Their homemade potato chips didn't even seem like they were homemade. They have a decent amount of craft beers but they didn't have as big of a selection as we thought they would.

I am a graduate student and POOR so the membership price is fine for me. However, I don't think it's worth what they want to charge you if you make any kind of money. 

They have an outdoor pool and ""water park"" area during the summer, an outdoor track, an indoor pool, a gymnasium, an indoor track, a fitness class studio/room, and a gym with machines and weights. The fitness machines are nice and they do a very good job of taking care of any issues that arise pretty quickly. I am often in the gym and see a maintenance/contractor coming in to fix a machine that has an issue. 

The fitness instructors that run the classes are nice - though sometimes I question their training/knowledge/expertise. Although most in the classes are doing it mostly for recreation.

When we first entered this place, I thought it was a pretty cool ambience. We entered on a Saturday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Waitresses greeted you with cute kumonos (sp?) on and cool Japanese music was playing in the background.

The first thing I noticed is that there is no AYCE here?! What the heck is up with that? And to top it off, one specialty sushi roll is average about $16.00 PER ROLL! A spicy ahi
Hand roll was $6.25 per roll? You have got to be kidding me. Better be sprinkled with gold or something!

So quickly, my boyfriend and I decide on a lunch entree instead. Mind you, my boyfriend and Just came from the gym and expo so we are starving! We order 3 entrees for 2 of us and while we are ordering the third entree the waitress says something along the lines of ""oi! More food?"" I thought it was rude and then hilarious!

I did not get the waitresses name but she was probably the heaviest one there (just so that you can spot her, and not experience her rudeness.) Anyway, she delivers our 2 entrees and once she places my plate down she says ""no more entree for you okay?"" I had to kind of piece it together that she meant it was after 3 so no lunch special. She does not say anything about our third entree after like 10 minutes of not delivering it. So I proceed on asking her where it could possibly be and she rudely cuts me off and says ""it's on the way!!""

After we are finished eating and she is cleaning our table she sees that I could not finish the tempura (2 onion tempura) and proceeds to tell me that I can request no onion next time! I cut her off and explain that I was full!

Another case of an unfocused restaurant trying to please everyone.  The decor is cool, retro chic.  They offer retro sodas, drinks, and even ""adult"" milkshakes.  Great.  The problem, nothing makes these gourmet burgers and fries taste as good as wine.  The food is so wine centric, playing off the natural acidity and refreshing, clean fruit finish  that drinking anything else doesn't work.  If you are a wine lover, this place elevates the humble burger and fries to a new level of enjoyment.

For beef lovers, the double helix stuffed burger is excellent.  A traditional burger stuffed with very flavorful braised short ribs and finished with horseradish.  Juicy, beefy goodness.  For veggie lovers, the quinoa and mushroom burger with charred tomatoes watercress cheddar cheese and an explosively flavorful rosemary aioli is a must try.  Even this hard core carnivore loved it.

The fries, while not the crispiest or fluffiest, come with toppings and dips that make them good eats.  Parmesan with truffle aioli. 

Small selection of fresh but simple salads (the salad of poached pear, fresh mozzarella and candies walnuts on a bed of arugula with the vanilla infused champagne vinaigrette is outstanding; creamy, peppery, tart, sweet and a nice play of textures).

Note:  If you are not enjoying some wine or other calorie laden drink, you will find the portions small.

The local service (as opposed to the [insert adjective] service of the Strip) is quick and friendly.

Very good selection of well priced half bottles.

This place is a spa, with the focus on hot and cold baths, saunas and steams. They also provide registered massages, so you can pay for a massage and go to the baths before and/or after, or you can just come to use the baths.
Upon entering, you are given a robe, two towels, slippers and a wristband for your locker, and directed to the locker room. Once there, put on your bathing suit, load up your locker and away you go!
They strongly suggest showering before going into the pools, and I like knowing that the other clientele showered before sharing the water with me. 
There is a beautiful large hot bath with waterfalls, and frosted glass on the walls. The water was so loud and the glass frosted enough that it took me a while before I realized this bath was facing the street! The water is warm but not too warm, and there are jets everywhere. Next to it was a small freezing cold pool. The idea is you are supposed to heat up, then plunge into the cold, and then heat up again, doing a circuit through the baths and saunas. I could not bring myself to PLUNGE into that cold water! I went to my knees. It was frigid.
The saunas were great - hot and pore-opening. There is also a lounge area where you can rest after bathing and also wait for your massage. They had a juice bar and snacks for pay too. i didn't pay much attention to that, however.
My massage was soothing and the RMT was very professional and polite. I know it's a good massage when I am dazed and drooling throughout, so two thumbs up!!
This is a nice place to go with your friends and chill out, although they are very strict about the silence policy and we got shushed several times for talking in quieter than normal voices. I wish their ""PDA"" policy was a little stricter, as there was a couple making out hardcore in the lounge area, and they also locked people out of one of the saunas while they were ""getting down"" too. Tacky! Bring it home or get a room.
Aside from one crude young couple, this place was perfect. I would definitely return when I get a bonus or something, although if your company does insurance refunds for massages, you can add some of your own money to it and it's worth it!",2009-10-26 17:43:51

Location isn't great...and it would be easy to miss...that said it is one of the only good spots in that pocket so those in the Annex should support them.  We wandered in...sat at the bar.  There were tables...its a french bistro, meets British gastro pub vibe.  The bartender was a bit all over the place...a 'mixologist' for sure.  Took his organge zest very seriously.  He makes a good cocktail, but didn't gristle at pulling a pint either.

Menu is tricky - do you go for the small plates or a meal...we mixed and shared.  The Mexican chips with cheese & chillies...really big...yummie, but we couldn't finish...the folks beside us had the tuna cones and the lobster roles...we were envious!

I am a believer in basics so tried the Steak Frite (really well executed) and the Cesar salad - tasty, but huge...all in all a top quality meal in a chill atmosphere.

I'm sure there will be a few to many tourists, given its location and already I saw at least one extremely annoying regular distracting the vibe at the bar...so time will tell if it will be a cool spot.

Anyways, been here twice. It is cafeteria style like all the other reviews mentioned and has a fun loungey but modern vibe. They, supposedly, and rather publicly, make their own pasta and grow all their herbs. Funny how they always seem to be pressing pasta and rolling herbs in the cart during lunch rush...speaking of lunch rush tables are hard to come by if you come right at noon. You are able to reserve them, though!

The portions are good but it is a little on the expensive side for the quality. I do enjoy the bread (served hot!) and love that they have oil and vinegar on the table for dipping. 

I've gotten the caprese pizza and the turkey club panini and have been let me down both times. They just seem to skimp on the toppings and ""extras"" (see picture of turkey club with tiny bit of prosciutto). Lunch mate had maybe 4 olive slices on the whole damn pizza.

They only have a few panini options and no bread choices. The pasta and pizza menus are pretty size able, though. The side salad, which come with the paninis, is iceberg lettuce and they will not ask your dressing option. 

Overall, like I said, this would never be somewhere I would choose to go given all the other many wonderful options in the area, but it's quick and they put on a pretty good show.",2014-04-24 22:15:27

When the doorman asked where I was going so he could tell my driver and I said Fairmount Bagels, he smiled and teased me, ""Are you going to bring some back with you? You'll have a lot of friends!""

Even when I walked in the door of the little storefront, I wasn't sure if I was in the right place. The vestibule was stacked high with bagged bagels and all I could see were people in various stages of bagel-making. For a moment I thought I'd walked into the wrong part, because I didn't see a retail counter anywhere. But when I asked the first worker I saw, she pointed me around the tower of packages to the counter.

While contemplating what to order and then waiting for my smoked salmon and cream cheese on a plain bagel, I was able to witness the process: one man sliced bits from a huge ball of dough and formed the bagels. At the other table another man lined up uncooked bagels on a 6-foot-plus narrow wooden paddle and placed the bagels into the roaring wood-fired oven. It was quite a spectacle, especially when the bagels were extracted from the oven on the long paddle and tossed into a waiting receptacle.

I ate my bagel as I walked back toward my hotel, down St.-Laurent. At first glance, it was definitely smaller than its U.S. cousins. At first bite, it was harder, more pretzel-like than doughy, and slighty sweet. But as with all bagels, it was delicious with the cream cheese and smoked salmon. The trip to Fairmount was certainly worth it, but I still prefer American bagels.",2009-06-09 13:47:06

Live music doesn't count in my book unless theres a stage. Being in a band I will never ever play on the floor. Im not quite sure if the live music was a comedy act. The guy seemed to have a parody to every song he sang on got lame really quick, too bad too, he had a great voice. He had his own little following of 20 people that found him amusing. 

Being a live music lover here's my advice.  Pull the trigger and build a stage and get a sound system. You have a great bar, and we are all tired of O'Kellys. I will come to Scullys ANYTIME over them if you make it look like a LIVE MUSIC VENUE.

This place has lots of cool things going for them.  They have a make your own pizza, sandwich and salad menu.  Very cool.  Reminds me of Burgatory, except they have great burgers!  I picked my own veggie sandwich and loaded it with roasted peppers, portobello mushrooms, artichoke and spinach.  You're even able to pick if you want it hot or cold.  Mine came warmish, that was not the option I wanted.  It was okay, but not great.  I think if it came hot it may have tasted a little better, but oh well.  

The other cool thing is the word ""brew"" in their name.  I think when I go to these places I expect the servers to be schooled in what kind of beer selection they have.  Our server was slightly schooled, but nothing close to explaining the beers in a way I'd want to purchase one.  I got lazy and just ordered a Yeungling...I know, I'm lame!  I also looked up at the huge blackboard that said ""craft beers"" and it was completely blank.  I guess I just expected it to be more about what specialty brews they offered.

After dinner at Archi's, I had noticed this store around the corner. I had bookmarked it and just had to have a visit since it was literally walking distance. 

Since this is a store that places its focus mostly on cakes, I wasn't really expecting there to be a large selevtion on cupcakes or macaroons. When I had entered though, the inside decor was really cute and there was actually several flavors I could choose from the cupcakes and macaroons. You also get a free one with a yelp check in yall!!

When I had gotten my salted caramel macaroon, yes, it was crunchy but nonetheless it was still good. Since it IS a bakery kind of, I would expect the stuff in the morning to be the freshest and softest anyways. I had gotten there around closing time. So obviously, I really didn't care for the crunchiness. It was still really good.

Decent food, decent fries, nothing out of the ordinary. The classic gyro is good and they have a special between 11p and 3:30p for a $5 gyro pita and fries combo.

Oliveo is good for a snack or a quick meal as it is a very casually run restaurant employed by mostly frat guys and sorority chicks. Due to this, service is pretty hit or miss with the high employee turnover but I'm usually just carrying out so it's whatever. One time, I ordered delivery and the driver was spouting off about how far we were from the restaurant and how much of a pain it was to get there--I was living down the street 1 mile on University at the time...

Biggest thing that is holding me back from a better review is Oliveo charging so much for Tzatziki sauce. That is just bullshit, I understand that it costs money but you have to take a hit on some items at your restaurant like SAUCE (raise the price of your drinks from 1.85 to like 2.50 or something to make for up).

Again we waited and waited no chips no app no drinks.  I ordered a ""premium"" Mexican wine to enjoy with my tacos. Waitress comes back, I checked on our app as it still wasn't there and she forgot to put it in!  She disappears for a bit again, eventually returns with a poor quality guacamole.

My husband said we aren't eating if you can't eat so we told them never mind give us the check and we will try another time.  The manager or owner said, "" well what do you want to do with the other food."" What really?  I don't care.  No apologies no nothing.

The Portuguese wine list was very expansive - and took a suggestion from our waiter on which to try (the same on Daniel Craig had when he was in the week before [apparently]).

It was one of the mid-priced wines on the menu (Esporao Reserva 2008 -- 80$) and probably one of the best I've ever had. Like drinking a bottle of red silk. 

The waiter was charming and entertaining while still as professional as you'd expect at a spot like this. Upon being quizzed about the famous people who've eaten there he was happy to oblige - Natalie Portman, Kevin Spacey, and the list went on. Eventually the names started to wane (Daniel Stern...you know, one of the Sticky Bandits). 

The courses I had included roasted quail with piri-piri sauce, a corn chowder, and black cod for the main.

They bring over the daily fish on a tray to show you what's fresh and you can see what you'll be getting. My cod was served with white asparagus, mashed potatoes, and roasted beets. The serving was massive. I was stuffed. Now I must go back and work 80 hours to pay for my next meal there.

Apparently, each one of their Dazzling Cafe locations is decorated in a different theme.  For this one, it was a pink and gold theme and I saw some Hello Kitty plushies on the counter of their bar too.  As well, the backs of the chairs had rabbit ears on it which was really cute.  There was also a white merry-go-around horse near the entrance of the cafe.

I chose the Rose Lychee Soda which turned out to be not only pretty in its looks but taste as well.  It was a sweet soda that tasted flowery and also refreshing.

The Bacon and Poached Egg Spaghetti was a beautifully assembled dish where the pasta strands were twisted so perfectly with a poached egg on top of it.  It smelled so good too.  After poking the yolk, the egg contents unleashed upon the pasta.  I really enjoyed the texture and firmness of the spaghetti.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with how good the spaghetti tasted!

The Mentaiko Fries were a very unique item where crunchy and crispy French fries were topped with mentaiao, or pollock roe.  It smelled amazing and this was the first time that I had mentaiko with fries like this.  Everyone at the table loved it.

The Fried Caramel Chicken Wings piqued my interest when I saw these on the menu.  These were nicely fried chicken wings covered with caramel sauce although I didn't think that the caramel taste was too obvious.  These were also a hit though and we got a second order of these.

The Roasted Chicken Leg Spaghetti with Basil Pesto Sauce had the same spaghetti as the first pasta dish.  The basil pesto sauce smelled amazing and was pretty good.  The roasted chicken leg was firm and reminded me of the ones at Hong Kong style cafes.  It was decent though and not too firm or rough.

I really loved the Truffle Mushroom Pizza.  This was full of cheese that tasted so, so good.  The crust of the pizza wasn't thick at all and very thin.  It went so well with the gooey cheese.  

The Jalapeño Chicken Pizza was definitely spicy as the menu said.  It was quite good though and the spice packed a lot of (surprise) heat.

This Hazelnut Chocolate Honey Toast was so delicately and carefully crafted.  It was layers of brick toast with strawberries on the side of it in a diagonal fashion.  There was whipped cream on top of it with swirls of chocolate too.  After we took photos of it, the server actually helped us cut it open and divide it.  Apparently, there was a special way to do it!  After she took apart the top, inside of the honey toast, there were smaller cubes of toast already cut up and dosed with butter.  She dunked each cube into the whipped cream with strawberry before serving each person with it with the tongs that were provided.  This was so precious!  Tt was like the dessert had a mini treasure chest.

After we ate the little cubes of toast, we were then welcome to cut up the rest of the honey toast too to eat.  It was so good and I was very impressed that the honey toast stayed crunchy and dry throughout.

The Matcha Red Bean Waffle unique from the regular waffle dessert because each cup area of the waffle held a dollop of whipped cream with the large scoop of matcha ice cream in the middle of the waffle ""flower"" and some red bean on top too.  It was just beautiful.  Whoever thought of this dessert deserves an award.  

I'm actually not a huge waffle fan but when I taste good waffles, I acknowledge it right away.  With that said, I was so, so impressed with the quality of this waffle dessert!  The waffle petal that I had was so moist, well done, and it must be attributed to the batter because I think a lot of waffles out there might be too dry.

The Honey Toast Cups was a similar dessert to the Honey Toast except that this one was in take-out form.  The cubed honey toasts were fit artfully into a plastic cup and layered with whipped cream, and the flavours or fruits of the cup that you chose.  We got to try the Mango Honey Toast Cup and Strawberry Lower Honey Toast Cup.

Everyone loves mango (I'm sure) and the Mango Honey Toast Cup definitely didn't disappoint.  The mango was so smooth and sweet.  Again, the most surprising thing was that even though the cubed toasts were put into this cup squished with whipped cream and fruits, they remained so crispy and dry.  The toasts were the best part of this dessert for sure.

The Strawberry Lover Honey Toast Cup was just as good if you like strawberries.",2018-01-22 19:11:03

I ordered a variety of stuff to get a general feel of what this place has to offer (no, I didn't eat it all---I have lots of leftovers to enjoy later). I ordered the chicken adobo, pancit palabok, and 3 types rolls--guava with cheese, ube, and plain cheese fillings.

I agree that the food has a home-cooked feel, so do not expect some fancy or gastro-pub meal. The adobo tasted great, just like how my mom makes it. There were sides of pancit and rice; both tasted fresh. I wasn't particularly fond of the pancit palabok; there was too much egg in it, but I'm real picky when it comes to preparing the dish.

I ate a third of the roll with the guava and cheese filling. It was delicious! There is a sweet cheese and guava jelly that melts together well with the flaky crust. I imagine if I had this when it was freshly baked or even heated up, I would have enjoyed it more. I have yet to try the other two, but I think I will like them too. 

The two people who took my order and packaged everything up were really nice. Then there was the one remark 99.9% Filipinos say to me, ""But you're so tall!"" One of them told me to come to karaoke on Fridays to make friends; haha, cute. The restaurant looks like a Filipino home that happens to have a couple of bakery displays. So again, nothing fancy but I'm OK with that.",2014-01-21 21:57:45

We had a pre fixe menu for Mother's Day which included a complimentary glass of champagne which was a nice touch! We had the smoked salmon, rib eye medallions, and the creme brûlée with bread pudding. Our orders came out fast and were made to perfection.

Anyway, we popped in here at like midnight after a show at the Ovens Auditorium. A few tables outside were still open as were some inside. And seats at the bar.

A nice two-top table with a view of the door was available, so we nearly settled into that except the table was soaking wet as was one of the seats. No worries, they were both wiped down with the same cloth (the table first, not like it matters). Okay, this is off to a good start.

Drinks were ordered and then we got into food. I chose the simple single burger with cheese. Note that it doesn't come with fries. A nice sized patty with all the usual toppings, it was tasty and filling. Good.

The locale is artsy, the interior is sparsely decorated with geometrically abnormal tables at weird heights, wood and steel stuff and an exposed wood ceiling. If you're into wood and steel, Cartel has it. They were bumping dubstepLite from the overhead speakers, which was an unexpected change from the guitar + hi high and bass drum + croaking off-key vocals that hipsters seem to love. The dudes at the counter were wearing a sufficient quantity of second-hand clothing to make me certain that they weren't employees of a corporate chain, but that they were actually fulfilling their destinies as bearded Ferrymen helping the uninitiated cross the Single Origin river into the Alterlife. Among other customers there was a distinct lack of true artistic souls, which is disappointing, but really out of the control of Cartel. No one had a typewriter, or was knitting, and only one guy had the messy dreadlocks of someone who hasn't sold out. SOMEthing needs to be done before Cartel gets a reputation of being a scene for sellouts and generics.

Enough about the scene, on to the coffee. I had a black single-origin Chemex from somewhere in the global South, and the wife had the coldbrew. The Chemex is 20 oz., which is cool, but $8~. I guess if you think of it as two coffees it makes sense, but $8~? That's almost 50 cents/ounce. ""Well, you were dumb enough to buy it,"" you might argue. Don't use your laissez-faire logic on me, I expect my independent coffee to be fair trade, not free trade. Still, the flavor was mild and spicy, and the mouthfeel...whatever, it tasted like good coffee. The wife's coldbrew was good, but also a little overpriced. Cream is kept under the tight control of the bearded Ferrymen, probably to keep it fresh, and is served infused with non-verbal judgement over your poor choice of diluting the integrity of your carefully crafted beans. This bit of judgementalism restored my faith a little in Cartel. Maybe they have what it takes to be an elite hipster joint after all. Then on our way out the door I overheard one of the Ferrymen describing to Dreadlocks how one of the blends as ""totally cleanses your system,"" and reassurance washed over me. Cartel isn't just selling coffee after all. It's curing people of their ailments and helping them towards a healthier, less skeptical lifestyle.

Sat 8 Dec 2012 9P

The food is better than you think it would be. 

Originally, we discovered Sagos thanks to Groupon.  This was sometime in the summer of last year, and the reason why I chose to get vouchers for it was because of the reviews from patrons exclaiming that it was among the best bar food (and even surpassed with its menu what one would consider bar food). Hopefully my review can serve as the same for others. 

The reason for the last visit was that after leaving a school production of 'Cheaper by the Dozen', there was a lack of places to get a bite to eat in this part of town. Really glad I remembered Sago since it was just a few minutes south on the Beltway from Faith Luthern. 

I have never eaten in the actual dining area and last night would be no different. There was some birthday party being celebrated so we sat in the bar area. UFC on Fox 5 (Henderson/Diaz) was being shown on some of the televisions, among the other spectator sports on a Saturday night, so there was plenty of activity at the bar. 

We were not noticed (it's to be expected with all the activity) so I walked up to an overly personable bartender  and asked for a food menu. She sent over a nice waitress and everything went better after that. 

I try something different every time we go to Sagos. It took last night to get to the signature 'Sagos Burger' on the menu after having tried several dinner salads and fajitas during previous visits. Best burger I have had at a bar anywhere. 

For those looking for late night food in this part of town, or a quick bite to eat for lunch, I highly recommend Sagos. They accept restaurant.com certificates as well. Don't think they have desserts so just drive a minute south to Yelp favourite Sweet Addictions in the Apache plaza for dessert. - E",2012-12-09 18:59:47

The interior of the store is quite nice (I remember the lighting being very soft and flattering).  There is quite a bit of food merchandise (pancake mix, candy, gift baskets) and, weirdly, a display nook of costume jewelry and a handbag.  They also have very large pastry case displays filled with goodies.  I do think the baked goods look ""too perfect"" and mass produced though (this was a red flag).  The cashier was pleasant.

While family members seemed to enjoy the treats, I found them lacking.  The gingerbread man (with chocolate pants, a detail family enjoyed) had a very dry texture and was somewhat ""dog biscuit-like"" (very bland and crumbly).  The peppermint brownie was HALF frosting (chocolate frosting over peppermint frosting/creme over a chocolate chip brownie), which attempted to distract from the fact that the brownie itself was on the dry side, but it didn't make up for the loss of brownie ""gooey-ness.""

But, I cannot even believe it that I had never been on British Airways until this month. My daughter had booked our entire Holiday to Celebrate her Birthday and to be in Ireland for Saint Patrick Day.
We took a direct flight out of Phoenix, AZ to London Heathrow. Airport.
I will start by saying the Aircraft is wonderfully clean. All 4 aircraft's that we were on.
Everyone was provided with Blankets ,pillows, headsets and toothbrushes,even a  bit of dental floss, which is nice for those long flights.
I have read some of the other reviews, and you cannot really judge the Airline by one Flight Attendant or one incident. 
I am reporting on the entire experience. 
We did have one gate agent in Dublin, Ireland that was not the most informative or helpful. But, I do not judge it all on her.
Back to our first flight. They boarded the plane in an orderly manner. The plane was a comfortable temp as well as nicely lit.
The staff greet you when you come in and they were all very pleasant.
When you have over 200 people to deal with at one time I am sure it can get quite tiring ,but they were all wonderful.
They are dressed very nicely, and I found them all to be very polite and doing their best to attend to everyone's needs.
The service in Coach was very nice. They even gave my daughter and I a Glass of Champagne for her Birthday. I can only imagine how marvelous their First Class service is.
The food was really great. That is saying something for Airplane food. Especially on the way out of London back to Phoenix. It was 5 star and piping hot.
They came through with water and juices all the time and if you wanted anything else they would bring it to you.
The toilets stayed clean, neat and stocked the entire 10 hour flight.
They have individual movie screen so you can watch anything you want any time you want and even rewind, fast forward, and stop in the middle, or go back to it at any time.You can even see exactly where you are via moving map as well as time ,temp, and distance.

If you are of the carnivorous group, plenty of beef options. Ethiopians tend to stick with beef since it is more plenty. Not too crazy about the meat options, but definitely interesting and always worth the adventure. 

The service is so nice and very friendly. If you're not sure what to order, (Shiro Wat would be confusing to most, I'm sure) they are very helpful. Don't be afraid to ask. They know most people aren't familiar with Ethiopian.

I guess I woudn't technically call it ""New York"" style pizza BUT it is really good pizza regardless. The sauce is flavorful and well balanced and there's lost of cheese that doesn't slip and slide all over like most new york style slices. 
- Salads: Great! Usually pizza places have lame salads, but Streets of New York has fresh ingredients and a lot of different salad options (like pear blue cheese, spinach, greek, cobb, etc.).

My client was only in Vegas for 2 nights!
All and all, after going back with Showtime tours, the agent there pretty much told me the tours were cancelled and my client was screwed SO I told them to cancel and process a refund, in which the agent said ""FINE"" and hung up on me...

First of all, I need to say I wanted to check this place forever. Heard so much hype about it that I pretty much decided for everyone that's where we're having lunch.
We came in on Saturday (2 adults and child). It was busy but we got seated almost immediately. And after that everything went downhill.

Our server was either the rudest or the most incompetent one I have ever had. Still can't decide which one of those is the case. My bf ordered espresso shot, he started listing all the drinks made with espresso shots. Asked him about specials or signature dishes, mumbled that everything is there. It got to the point where I was uncomfortable to even ask him a question.

For food I had ahi tuna melt sandwich, bf ordered The Affaire salad and kiddo grilled sandwich. Out of all three, grilled sandwich was the only decent choice. Salad was looking very nice, and that's about it. No dressing, a loot of lettuce and nothing more. After one bite, bf said he's returning it. Tuna sandwich was messy and greasy. And just plain ok. Supposed to come with house salad, which I am assuming was the 2 pieces of lettuce, carrot and corn on a side was. 

At the end we waited extra 10 minutes for our check and it did not come until bf went and found server. At that point we were so frustrated and just wanted out. He did took the salad off the bill, but bf went home hungry.

Well bottom line is that I will probably not go back. Service was lame, food was lame and the whole experience was not better at all.",2012-11-12 00:07:25

Why you might ask? Oh because i grew up with them and own a mixed pitbull? GASP OH MY GAWD. UGH. I HATE THOSE PEOPLE. Hate is a strong word but when people talk sh*t to my dog and have the audacity to PHYSICALLY KICK MY DOG TO KEEP HIM INSIDE THE PARK BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING THEIR SWEET TIME LEAVING MAKES ME WANT TO GO APE SH*T ON YOU LIKE ""PITBULLS"" GO ON YOUR DOGS (when they are really just playing.) Want to know something totally crazy you stupid ignorant SOBs? :)
our pit mix lives with a pug and the pug is not dead!!!!!! 
Can YOU believe that??
Crazy right?

So anyways the park was awesome the first two times because of the lack of people and dogs. 2nd to last time was the best. Because there was a boxer owner that had just got him from the pound. My dog did not kill him either. THEY PLAY ROUGH GET OVER IT OR DON'T BRING YOUR WEAK DOG TO THE PARK OR PUT HIM IN THE KIDDIE DOG AREA FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! So they played got their energy out awesome! Time to go home or to the condo so he can get his anxiety back hence the dog park trips that i do not make it to on a weekly basis because of the fact of the ANNNNNOYING dog owners that bring their froo froo dogs that can't hold their own like our pug can when they play fight.  This dog park is huge kinda dirty not much grass but honestly i DONT CARE ABOUT THAT. I care about my dog getting his anxiety out! yes i tend to worry about the water there because its aqua tealish blue. But my dog isn't exactly a water dog. So i am safe. My friend who has a pound pitbull mix (ooga booga!) on the other hand has a water dog i worry about.  

If you come during the day be prepared because it won't be very shaded except for the little picnic area table. 

So i am completely undecided if i want to go back or not. My friend doesn't get as riled up as i do because her puppy only plays rough with my dog when they are in the backyard together and my dog just takes it and doesn't bite back! Nice park. Horrid people. As usual!",2011-09-30 06:32:07

So needless to say every single time I drove past Cuttlefish the same thought went through my mind ""I REALLY need to try that place"". They had fresh oysters, and a bar with vespa seats, how could it NOT be good?! So finally the opportunity came knocking at my door and I jumped at it.... Dinner at cuttlefish, youbetcha!

This evening we walked into Cuttlefish and the place was empty. The waiter/host/still not sure who he was, told us to find a seat and he would be out with a menu. No real warm welcome, it was kind of shocking. So we sat down outside since it was a 80 something degree evening in Arizona in May. We ordered a bottle of wine and then a bottle of Champagne came out, thankfully we noticed before he had opened it. Then we come to find out that they were out of both of the other bottles of wine we wanted. Finally we found one that was available (woo-hoo!), We ordered half a dozen oysters on the half shell, 3 of each of the two varieties they had. The oysters themselves were beyond fresh and flavorful.  The large kumamoto oysters they had were so yummy and fresh it was like eating butter. The only down fall was that in every single bite I got huge pieces  of shell. 

For dinner I had the Branzino with tomatoes, pine nuts and olives. The plate arrived it was a plate of two thin filets of perfectly cooked Branzino with super crispy skin. The tomato sauce with pine nuts and olives was a perfect pairing with the fish. My friend ordered the halibut, the crust on the top was super yummy but the fish was slightly overcooked and wasn't as tender as it should have been. 

I will say that service was absolutely wonderful, our waiter was knowable, friendly, and discreet. While my visit wasn't as stellar as I had read, I wonder If I happened to just come on an off evening, For a dinner costing over $150.00, I just expected a bit more.",2014-05-13 07:26:21

While the sun was out it had started to  get a bit chilly so we didn't get to sit out on the patio. However, it looked really inviting and would definitely go back next summer to enjoy that.

To be honest nothing here was really memorable. Food was delish and dessert were up to expectation for an establishment like this. Only issue was that the creme brulee had way too much alcohol. I think all 3 of us spat it out in unison on our first bite as it was so incredibly strong. (Thank god R.I.D.E. was not parked out).

Ambience and decor is really nice and staff is not too stuffy.

The tea however was phenomenal. I ABSOLUTELY loved the jasmine green tea. I'm a big fan of this kind to begin with yet it is extremely rare to find genuine jasmine smelling green tea as authentic as you find in Asia but well done Ritz! The Earl Grey was fantastic as well.

My appetizer was great Eddie has managed to put some imagination back into Calamari!. Now the hard part, when we go to a top steakhouse serving Prime cuts you expect to pay minimum $110 a head. At this price range one gets to nit-pick. The sides were average the scallop potatoes were a little crunchy, asparagus and hollandaise-bland. As for my New York strip. it was average. there are different levels of Prime. Great steak houses have relationships with ranchers who produce incredible Prime meat. The steak felt like a Costco piece of prime meat. Not a bad piece of meat, definitely prime, but nothing great. My company had similar reactions to their entree and the sides. Also the desert menu needs work. As for the service, Valentine's weekend can be long for these folks so they were a little tired, but the service was ok. Eddie might think about aging their beef.

It's a quick and painless process, albeit there is some paper work involved and proof of immunization records required after your visit; I believe you get a 30 day grace period. We emailed the records in and brought copies with us when we first registered so we wouldn't have issues. 

You will find kids quest located next to the movie theater and around the corner from the bowling alley. You wait in line for drop off, sign a few lines, kids get a upc code sticker attached to them, and the kids are off. The kids are well enclosed and they pass through 2 small gates before entering or exiting. We always give our kids the option to buy snacks. My kids are 5 & 7, they never really take advantage of it but will have an icee or something sweet. I just make sure kids are fed before drop off. You can get an invoice. 

Pricing is fair and reasonable, runs you about $10/hour a kid. Kids can stay up to 5 hours a day. We like to break the time up throughout the day. Our kids really like it and enjoy the freedom. I enjoy a little freedom too. We usually go to dinner, watch a movie, or hang out in the casino. We never leave the resort. You can leave the resort if you want to but you will need to inform the staff on the paper work.  

Phone reception is poor throughout the casino. I suggest hooking up to the Wi-Fi and you will be good. I did receive a call on last visit because kids missed us. It wasn't a problem. 

The staff is friendly and helpful. Looks like they have plenty of staff to watch the little ones. 

They have great hours too. At first I thought wow, I can't believe people are taking their kids here so late at night and leave them past midnight. I figured people are coming from all parts of the world so everyone has a different circadian rhythm. 10 pm to me might be late but for others it's morning. 

Stop by and drop off the kids. Take some of that ""me"" time you deserve. The main reason we stay at the resort is because of kids quest. Not a bad option to have. FYI- I read other reviews about wait times or bad experiences and I have never had nothing less than a 4 star experience. Good luck!",2015-12-25 13:50:34

How I've been in Scottsdale for four years and just now finally made it to see some Spring Training games, I don't know... but better late than never!

I've been to a couple of games at Scottsdale Stadium (home of the SF Giants) so far this year... and I intend to make a few more as well.  It's easy since we're walking distance to the stadium and lawn seats are a bargain.

I grew up a huge Detroit Tiger fan but I have to admit, I haven't been following baseball as much as I'd like.  But, there is something about going to these games that brings back childhood memories... they are so fun!

This place is one of the few places at the Scottsdale waterfront area that impresses me. I think it's a gem above the Pink Taco, PF Chang-izing down there. The Stetson salad was refreshing and delectable. I was impressed by the ""air dried"" corn and the dressing didn't taste like run of the mill Caesar. Also had buffalo carpaccio for an appetizer which I hadn't had before. It was thin and flavorful. I like overall how the menu had atypical fare. I had the special, pork loin with a corn-green chili waffle. The waffle's texture was perfect--crispy outside and moist inside. 
Couldn't leave without trying the bacon chocolate chip cookies. Very filling and the bacon bits are really tiny and subtle.

So perhaps the next time I find myself out and about early and can get here at this timeframe, I may try to dine in for Dim Sum.

Since I ordered to go, I won't comment on the temperature of the food; however, it was still warm when I got it home, so that is a good thing.  All the steamed dumplings were good, well seasoned and had a good flavor.  The spicy Salt squid was ok, the batter was a bit heavier than I had expected, but the flavor was good.  I thought the Sticky Rice Wraps were a bit smaller than other places in the valley and the Hom Sui Gok was not the best.  I know they took it from the case that was probably sitting there when they first opened, so it was not hot to begin with nor crispy anymore.  That would be my only complaint, is to keep it under a heat lamp for a minimal amount of time so that it does not get overly cold and will not lose it's crispy texture that it would have if recently cooked and sitting.

I could freely take the transit up and down 7th avenue without paying and as frequently as I needed.  But then I had to actually expand the areas of my travelling, while looking for employment and I was a little hesitant with the oncoming minus 10 to 30 winter weather and having to try our bus lines.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was extremely easy, passbooks of 10 were a little more than 20 dollars and I could get a transfer which would let me travel in any direction for another 90 minutes.  The bus stops are well marked and if you need to know the time of the next bus that was arriving you could simply call a phone line clearly marked on each bus marker and search the number allocated to your bus stop.

The other advantage was how easy it was to find a certain address on Calgary Transit online, simply type in to and from directions and your travel plans were easily explained for you there; what number of bus to take, the times and the locations of the bus stops.

My biggest problem in the wintertime was the terminal changes downtown, I could not remember which terminal was closed and which terminal was going through renovations.  The maps inside the trains did never specified any of these changes, so often times I would forget and have to walk back more than a couple of blocks to get to where I needed to go downtown.

I also had to wait several times for more than 45 minutes for buses in the winter,  but city transit can't really do much if there are accidents on the highway, nor change weather conditions.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very ""neat/cute"" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My favorite item was the ""Pig Face"" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth.

Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink ""Hey Bartender""... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.",2014-01-04 23:52:43

When it was my turn, I was told to sit at the seat by the entrance and a lady (I think she's the owner) began working on my nails. She filed and shaped my nails nicely. I had a couple nails that chipped at the side so I thought I would have had to file all my nails down short. She was able to shape them to where I was able to keep them long but it not look weird. I asked for french tips with blk zebra stripes. She did the french tips and said she would add the stripes after my pedi. 

She switched with an older lady to do someone else's nails while the older lady did my pedi. This part wasn't pleasant. This is how it went down when I was trying to tell the lady what color polish I wanted for my toes. 

Me: Gray, like this. (points to the arm rest of the chair) 

She gets up to the polish display, grabs two different polishes and returns. 

Lady: Which one? (showing me two silver polishes) 
Me: Umm... just matte no glitters, and nothing shiny. 
Lady: (gets up and goes back to the polish station and grabs 3 other colors and comes back) Okay, which one you like? 
Me: (looks at the 3 pearlish white colors) Never mind. I'll just get black. 
Lady: (annoyed face w raised eyebrows) Black!? 
Me: Yes sorry, black. 

She puts her head down and pulls my foot closer to her and begins polishing my toes quickly. I just sat there quietly. I was sitting there watching everyone else getting their feet and calves rubs/massages while all I got a measely 10 second ball and heel scrub. I felt as though she rushed through the whole pedi. My bf's sister who came with me got started on her pedi when I got started with my mani and I was done with my mani and pedi before her pedi. In fact, when I got seated there were 4 other people halfway through their pedi session and I was done before ALL of them. 

After my pedi, I returned to the chair I was sitting in for my mani and another lady came to paint on zebra stripes. 

My mani came out looking good, my pedi not so much so it evens out to a 3 star experience. My total was $35 which is a great deal but I'd pay the little extra for better service all around.

Sushi was ok, I think the rice was a little mushy, but still tasty enough to eat.  

They had a station w/miso soup or udon soup.  The miso was a little on the salty side and had cucumbers in it for some reason.  The udon soup had lots of enoki and shitake mushrooms so the broth was slightly salty but still good.  You can add tempura crunchies, green onion and chili powder to it as well.

Hot food includes :  pork tonkatsu (very good!), fried rice, chow mein, seafood noodles, sea bass, stuffed cod, bacon wrapped zucchini, beef teriyaki (dry and tough)

But the service was just not right. They act like they only cared for the paycheck. I mean, everyone works for their paycheck but the employees their are so rude to each other. I witness the girls fighting over bring customers their food and rolling their eyes at each other. That's just not right. 

Does the chef not know there's a wide open window in front of them? They be scratching their head, taking off their hat and then not wash their hands and continue to handle the food with those dirty hands. That's just nasty. I wonder if the kitchen is even clean....

I don't know who the manager is, but he or she needs to trained the employees a little better.

This will be one of my few exceptions. 

My friends know when my night out is ending when they see the famous ""Yelp Check In"" at Del Taco. This one is on the way home for me and so on a Friday or Saturday night, sometime between 2:00 am, to as late as 6:30 am the last time I was here, this is my last stop before hitting the bed.

The drive thru is open 24/7. They are always super fast giving me my secret combo of value menu items to prevent that next day hang over. 

OK, you convinced me to give up my secret. This is how I prevent hangovers. Get the bean and cheese burrito, and the chicken soft taco. Get your preferred level of hot sauce (mine is inferno, nothing but the hottest for me). It's only $2.07 out the door with tax and when you get home, drink lots of water and tear into your food. I never have a hang over when I do this. 

Protip: Take out your contacts before eating that burrito. It's tough enough taking out those things when drunk but when your fingers are like little balls of fire that your just rubbing into your eye, it never ends well.",2011-12-05 21:18:30

This is one of the *very* few Toronto restaurants you can drop into the middle of NYC or LA (though I wouldn't really call LA a foodie town, but for the cool factor) and it would be packed six days a week. The space is very cool -- vaulting ceilings, exposed brick walls, etc... and the food is equally spectacular. Pastas seem to be the specialty but some of the smaller antipasti (thinking of the fried lamb brain saltimbocca) are great and unique.

I will say the service here is incredibly pretentious and affected -- not to say it's not friendly and well-oiled, but they lay it on pretty thick, as others have mentioned. It's a bit distracting.

Wine list has lots of interesting selections off the beaten path and is overall reasonable for this type of place.

Watch out, the bill will creep up on you -- even though 90% of the menu is $15-25, two people need to split 4-5 dishes to be full...with wine, you're definitely going to be over $200 all-in without realizing. But it'll probably be money well spent.",2013-05-11 22:37:32

It's not attractive, upstairs, and cash only - and believe me, I would love to dock a star for it being cash only - but it's really good for what it is.

I usually order the baked pork chop with tomato sauce on spaghetti and a cold HK milk tea. The soup it comes with is boring - nothing to write home about, needs a good few dashes of black pepper whatever kind you get. The milk tea is on point. I don't feel it needs sugar or anything and it goes down really smoothly with nice flavor.

As for my choice of entree? The spaghetti isn't mushy or anything (which I've heard can be an issue at similar places), the pork chop is meaty and tasty without too many weird bits (bone, etc.), the little mushroom and onion pieces are a nice touch, and the sauce is the perfect sugary, slippery, worst-spag-bol-you've-ever-had-but-you-crave-it-every-week stuff.

The cookie selection is typical and so are the ice cream flavors. Think classic flavors. You can do an ice cream bowl (think Pizookie), donut sandwiches or ice cream cookie sandwiches. Decided to split a cookie ice cream sandwich with a friend and chose to mix and match cookies: Cinnamon Bun and White Chocolate Macadamia with their House ice cream, Bear Batter which is a cake batter dyed blue with brownie pieces. We got it warmed and split as well.

The cookies were underwhelming, crumbly and not warm at all. Definitely expected a soft, chewy and substantial cookie. As for the ice cream, it was icy and tasted freezer burnt. The artificial cake batter flavor was off putting and stains ones mouth blue. Definitely not good nor acceptable to be eating pieces of frost. 

The interior is simple, with a vibe of being unfinished. There is however, lots of seating indoors and out on the patio area.

The bar up front seemed a bit exposed to the lobby but the bar in back was pleasantly secluded and looked onto the expansive and lush patio. The patio being full, we took a seat at the bar while we waiting for a table outside to open up. Our bartender was a guy named Chris who was absolutely amazing. Funny, friendly and professional he gave us a great wine suggestion (a bottle of great chardonnay, the name of which I cannot remember) and food suggestions, skip the poutine which was too heavy, go with the pleasant smoked salmon salad, light and flavorful. 

Even though the bar was fairly empty I was still without a stool, giving the lone spare to my GF (chivalrous as ever). Also, the decor didn't strike me as particularly nice - not unpleasant, but not the kind of seating you would expect for a world-class hotel. We had our glass and waiting. We saw two seats open up but the hostess never came to get us. Eventually we had to ask Chris to help us out, which he dutifully did. By the time we were out, the nicer seats had filled up again, but our chairs by the fireplace were still great. As mentioned, the patio was beautiful, and even though it's in the city center it feels secluded and peaceful, albeit with a magnificent view of the CN Tower.

All in all it was a great evening, but I couldn't shake the feeling that after dropping about $100 for wine and a split dish, the whole thing could have been a bit more polished.

I would give this place a 5 star, if their banchan selection was more extensive.  However, for the location, the food and the service, I will definitely be coming to this place, again and again...

A.  Location - Harmon, Swenson, Paradise.  There is a small strip mall there that has plenty of food choices and this location is perfect for so many.  Right across from Hard Rock....

B.  The Service - extremely efficient and pleasant. I came here for lunch and while it was not terribly busy, the server was just right in being very efficient, always there when you wanted her, very nice and top notch.

C.  The Menu - Loved the menu.  The cuts here are smaller in size and also more reasonable in portion and pricing. You can order a huge variety of different meats, seafood and veggies all ranging in prices form 3.00 to 12.00 per plate.  I loved the mix and match. IF I brought my glasses and had more time, I would have done this.  Instead, I turned over the menu to the combo page and pre-ordered one of the combos to make it easier for me.

D.  The Food- 

a.  Miso Soup - OK, so we are in a Korean restaurant and they serve Miso soup. I find that odd, and at same time I really cannot complain since it was tasty.  However, when I am eating BBQ, I like the real basic soup that is plain and simple.

b.  The meats - 

Chicken Tender Cheese Fondue -   OK, I am not a huge non traditional foodie, but man, this was really cool and tasty.

Bulgogi - Wow was that really fast and the sauce was PERFECT.

Filet Mignon - So tender and juicy...

Shrimp Garlic - Would have preferred Shrimp PRAWN, but these tiny morsels were okay.

Harami Miso - Man was this steak just right. Never had it before and I really enjoyed it.

Assorted Veggies - Cool. Normal stuff. but those corn on the cob were awesome.

c.The appetizers - Again, miso soup, rice, salad and some kind of cream cheese wonton thing.  Different, okay. I prefer banchan.

E.  Come back factor - This is one cool place, the food is good, the portions are manageable so you can try different things for sure.  For business lunch, hanging out, this is a really nice restaurant and I do plan to come back.  If I am focused only on the bbq, I may try Tofu Hut or other places DJK, but I really enjoyed this Gangnam BBQ.

-Pork Belly bao (roasted pork belly, lettuce with hoisin mayo) - $4.69
For $5 the bao was tiny and the pork belly was like a piece of bacon. I could tell the meat was frozen and it lacked any sort of flavors. The vegetables were just... cold lettuce with carrots, thus it would have been better to pickled the carrots to cut the fattiness of the pork belly. There was also supposed to be a hoisin mayo sauce but I couldn't taste any of it. The bao itself was cold and not as soft as the ones I had in downtown, overall a very disappointing dish.

-Duck Confit taco (peking duck confit, lettuce and hoisin mayo) - $4.99
The duck confit was packed with flavors, tender and juicy! I think more sauce would have been nice and the taco shell was able to held all the ingredients together without breaking apart. Again what's with the raw and bland vegetables?

-Korean Beef Bulgogi (seared Korean beef bulgogi, spicy kimchi, jalapeno, corn, scallion, and bulgogi sauce) - $4.99
The beef was soft and really good as well but lacked that sweetness that you often find in Korean beef bulgogi. The taco itself was not too spicy and I found the corn was a nice addition to cut the heat from the jalapeno. My only complain was that there was too much bulgogi sauce, either they added some extra or it came from the meat...

When I walked in there was 2 older woman and they saw me yet didn't greet me or even say hello. After looking around a bit at the fabric and seeing that it all looked dated, I walked up to another lady I noticed and asked her if they sold craft glue and she directed me to it and asked if I needed any help finding anything else. Hancock is smaller than Hobby Lobby or Michael's, so the selection and brands are limited. The craft glue was actually the same price as it would be at the other mentioned stores, but I also could have used a 40 percent off coupon at those other said places, making the craft glue more expensive here if I were to come here to get it each time unless Hancock offered the same coupon that could be used daily and that I could just pull up on my phone like I can at the other places. I did sign up for some sort of rewards card, so if they send deals worthy enough, I'll stop by no problem. The fabric today was on sale 40-50 percent and that's good, but the selection was terrible. The quality of the fabric at Walmart (if you can even find it anymore because they have taken a lot of their fabric isles down) is very poor, so it's nice to have a place like Hancock that has good quality fabric, but it has to be on sale to be worth it and they need more patterns that aren't so dated.

Once at the office, I filled out a questionnaire about my health and any ailments that I might need to have addressed. 
Overall I am a happy and healthy person. I told the Dr. so during our brief get to know you session. She recommended I go for the overall rebalance treatment.
 I got on the table and she inserted 12 needles from toe to head and then turned on a heat lamp for my feet and let me be. She checked on me once during the session which was nice. I am not sure how to explain what happened, but I did feel some sort of energy or chi as she explained it move throughout the pinpoints. 
At first I fell into a deep trance like state. So relaxed and in touch with the energy moving through my body. Then, I saw everything in the room so clearly and I was wide awake. I can't say I felt any different hours or even the next day, but I did appreciate being able to experience that type of sensation of chi. 
After the time was up, she removed the needles and I paid my bill and was on my way. 
The one downside to the appointment was the room was near the front of the office and I heard the comings and goings and conversations of the patients and doctor. That did take away from my attempt to focus and relax. 
So did it hurt? A few of the insertions I could feel a quick poke but no, there was no pain or discomfort during or after the session.
 I may give it another try down the road if my stiff neck acts up again, but from what I've read, for improved results the sessions should be more often than not.

Felt a little disappointed that they were not as crispy as I would've like them to be and majority of them were short, like left over fries.

The service was decent and welcoming but the menu was overwhelming and kind of felt rushed to order. Totally missed out on the poutine menu on the left side. They should've had the menu board organized so that the sides are on the right for flow. I was also a little confused about the drinks because they had bottled sodas in a fridge and only found out later that they had a self serving soda dispenser.

I've never eaten at a Wingstop before, but I'm all about some good wings with beer! 

The sign said open for business, so I stopped in to check it out. The aroma of the wings hits you as you enter in and because the place is so new [5 days old], the place has am immaculate look to it with the tables almost full of patrons who are eating or waiting for their order.

The cashier immediately says, ""Hi, welcome to Wingstop"" with enthusiasm. With a smile to match her energy, I did feel welcomed.

I let her know that I was just checking things out and without pushing products on me, she let me know that she was there to answer any questions if I had any.

The menu board was simple, not to complicated, and had quite a few flavor selections all menu items bundled with drinks and fries of different varieties.

I perused the menu and found something I would enjoy.

I ordered the 10 piece wings and had 2 choices of flavors. I chose garlic parmesan and BBQ wings.

I did not know that they came with a drink and side of fries. WOW! All for 11.99! Good deal! 

I placed my order and began walking around observing the dinging area. Lot's of seating, clean tables, and the patrons seem to be enjoying their meals.

I chatted it up with the cashiers and then eventually the manager asking if it was okay to take pictures for Yelp. He smiled and let me know that it was totally fine.

After receiving my order, which wasn't a very long wait at all, I headed home.

I couldn't wait to take a bite of the food and here's my assessment:

The wings, they were cooked just right, juicy and not drowning in butter garlic sauce or BBQ, plus I was given ranch dressing [You do get to choose your dipping sauces], The fries were soft, I prefer mine extra crispy but, that's my fault, I should've said something.

They Coke products but I did find a green tea that I enjoyed as it wasn't too sweet and so refreshing on such a hot day here in Las Vegas.

The customer service, the wait time for my food, and to biting into my wings seemed flawless and worth the wait.

I'm happy this place is now just down the street and is  another offering in the downtown Las Vegas area adding to the diversity of food to choose from if you're like me who resides in the area.

I'll be coming back again when I have them wing cravings! If you're in the Charleston/Maryland are, come stop in for a some good wings to enjoy!

angles of parking spaces often have people driving the wrong way down the row, and the exterior does not say which entrance closes at night so you may go in and park directly in front of one only to have to maneuver your cart over speed bumps and across the entire lot when you leave after the doors are locked--- at an absurdly early 8PM.
The right-hand entrance goes straight to the deli section, but that's also where they store the shopping carts, so you may be blocked from actually entering the store. If it's not carts, the absurdly long line to the tax/banking business will block you, too.

And prices are hella high here, unless you're deliberately going in for featured items in their circular- how on earth they're charging $12 for a bottle of McCormick's ground cloves, I have no idea. I went in to get it for a recipe and left without it, those are highway robbery prices. Up to twice the price for produce, too.

But sometimes you'll luck out and find $3 off stickers on their butcher packages of chicken thighs, bringing them down to sane pricing. Their boneless skinless chicken breasts regularly get put down to $1.49/pound, too, which is good to look out for.

On the bright side, staff tends to be on the friendly side and the self-checkout is nearly always open.

We ordered so many plates. Of course, you have to start with the salted Edamame and Miso Soup, then the Seaweed salad which isn't normally my style, but it was amazing. For main plates, we ordered the Toban Filet, Pop Rockin' roll (which actually has Pop Rocks in it! - wha???). The texture and pop really was quite tasty - I recommend it. Then we ordered the Kumikaze... and loved it so much we ordered another one (the lemon slices MAKE this roll!). Oh, the Kobe Tataki was absolutely amazing!

I came with my brother after wanting to try it since it opened.  The day we came was a beautiful day, but there were lots of clouds.  It turned out that when we were walking on the edge that it was all white underneath.  It literally felt like we were walking on the clouds.  I think that helped my nerves b/c I couldn't see the bottom.  We saw our shadows in the clouds, a rainbow in the clouds and a plane come out from the clouds.  The only thing that sucked was that we didn't see the ground - but the staff don't have control over that!  

All of the staff were great and helpful.  Our guide in particular was very enthusiastic.  I felt completely safe the entire time.

Mi-RkRVMnHC-kFjqY41mUQ,JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,5,16,12,12,"Before I talk about the quality of the food and service at ""Anime Ramen"", I first want to address something that has caught my attention. I have lived in Las Vegas for a long time, and noticed the rivalry and dislike that many of the Asians have for each other here. As I read the reviews below and the reviews for many other Asian owned establishments here on yelp, I notice that there is always a group of conservative Japanese, Filipino, and mainland Chinese yelpers who give negative ratings to a business all on account of the owner being a member of an Asian nationality that they dislike. Most my family immigrated to America in the 1800s from Japan, and since the beginning we and all the Chinese, Koreans, and other races of Asians, TOGETHER  had to endure Anti-Asian laws, discrimination, internment camps, and mass deportation. They banned our marriage, they put us in concentration camps, they deported us, they taxed us for just being Asian, they took our houses and savings, they rioted and burned down our businesses, and they took away all our freedom and dignity. They didn't care what particular type of Asian we were.. we were all the same to them. As Asian-AMERICANS, we ALL had to endure the same discrimination TOGETHER.  Instead of hating each other, we should be united especially due to our history of enduring hate. This is America, and we all have the right to be here and we should all live together in peace. If you disagree with that, and dislike diversity then go back to whatever Asian country you came from and leave us Asian-AMERICANS alone.

Getting to the subject of ""Anime Ramen"". I personally believe that ""Anime Ramen"" has a better Miso Ramen than the much more popular ""Monta"". Though I think that ""Monta"" has the best Shoyu in the world, I think that the Miso Ramen isn't that great.  As we all already know, Miso Ramen is my favorite food in the world. I like Miso Ramen more than I like crack and various other narcotics(just kidding, but I really do love Miso Ramen). ""Anime"" has a thinner yet more flavorful Miso broth that I really enjoy. The broth is very similar to the popular ""Chin Ma Ya"" in Little Tokyo, LA.    
 
One of the best things about ""Anime Ramen"" is that they throw in many of the sides for free. At ""Monta"", they charge extra for corn, eggs, and a 3rd slice of Charsiu. At ""Anime"", you get the egg, 3 slices of charsiu, and the corn all included. Also, ""Monta"" makes you buy extra noodles on the side because they don't give that much in the first place. At ""Anime"" you get a lot of noodles, and a bowl of broth which is probably about 30% larger than other Ramen houses in Las Vegas.

Surprisingly, they also have really good french fries here for people who can't eat Asian food. This is great because I have a lot of European friends who just cannot eat anything that comes from Asia(picky eaters). I wish they had those Teriyaki fries that you get at Hawaiian restaurants, but what they got here is good enough. I really recommend getting a side of their fries! 

The best thing about this place is that there is always a seat open. Sometimes at ""Monta"" I gotta wait 30 minutes to an hour to get a seat. I have never had to wait to be seated here at ""Anime"".  

Maybe the one problem I have here is that servers tend to be a little creepy and have way too much energy. As soon as I took my chopsticks out of the paper wrapper, the Neon Anime Girl sprinted over to me, took the wrapper out of my hand then ran across the room and threw it away in the trash can. Then a few minutes later I used my napkin, and the moment I put it back down on the table she sprinted over again, took it, and then ran away. I didn't even see her coming that time. It literally looked like she came out from under a table. BTW, I like to use my  napkin more than just once you know... The weirdest thing was that I told my server that I thought that the Miso Ramen here is better than ""Monta"", and she got all shocked and practically told me that it is not nice to say bad things about other restaurants even if they are competitors. 

I guess you can tell that the owner is not Japanese by the interior design. The art that is displayed on the walls are from Japanese anime's that were popular in America but not extremely popular amongst Japanese anime critics, such as: ""Naruto"", ""Pokemon"" and ""Sailor Moon"". A few years ago I went to an Anime themed restaurant which was owned by a man from Kobe. His restaurant was decorated with art from animes which had a lot of cultural significance in Japan, such as: ""Mazinger Z"", ""Battleship Yamato"" ""Galaxy Express 999"", ""A Girl of the Alps"", ""Cutey Honey"" ""Candy Candy"" and ""Mobile Suit Gundam"". That's the first clue in identifying if the place is actually Japanese owned, but who really cares about that. Even if this place was owned by someone named Marco Antonio Lopez, I would still come back here everyday because the service and food is really good.",2012-02-06 07:11:55

When you enter the restaurant there's a small shop where you can get various coffee grounds, teas, and sandwiches/salads. 

I always come rather early, around 8 or 9am (they are open at 7am), so I'm always seated very promptly. There are individual tables for parties of 2/4 and also long communal tables for larger groups. 

The menu is large with lots of sweet and savoury options. I always get the brunch des cantons that comes with bacon, sausage, ham (not the deli kind), beans, and roasted potatoes in duck fat in a cast iron skillet. The ham is my favourite part of the dish because it's very fatty and tender. If you don't eat much in the morning I wouldn't recommend this unless you are going to share it with someone else.

The place was full on Friday night at 10ish when we arrived, a good sign. There were some spots at the bar so the three of us saddled up, and a fourth joined us a short time later.

I picked the tapas with a little bit of input from the ladies I was with, but they picked the wine (red of course). For our noshing I chose the frosted beef tenders ($15), smoked swordfish ceviche ($15), and by the bartenders recommendation, the parsnip pave ($8). Some of the plates is the lounge's own twist on some popular common menu items.

The frosted beef tenders are small chunks of beef, battered and lightly fried, and topped with a ginger & mirin reduction. It's like ginger beef, but a little different. Each morsel looks like a meatball, but inside the light breading is a delicious tender chunk of heaven.

The ceviche was interesting. While I've had better ceviche, this one did not disappoint in the slightest. The spicy aioli was an excellent compliment to the swordfish.

Our bartender made an excellent suggestion with the parsnip pave. It was a hit with all three of us. This is a must order. It's nice and crunchy with a good kick from the vinaigrette.  There's also bacon, you can never go wrong with bacon.

As we were enjoying our wine and waiting for our tapas I had tweeted that I was at the lounge and was eagerly awaiting the food. During the evening my food related tweet and my Yelp check-in tweet were re-tweeted by the lounge. Near the end of our visit the bar tender brought by a creme brule on the house. Whether this was a thank-you gesture for the tweets or for any other reason it didn't matter. This was a five-star visit long before the free dessert.",2012-03-07 06:38:04

When the question of where to host an informal celebratory dinner with friends and family came up, the answer was easy, Asian Legend.  Good food.  Nice, clean space.  Lovely private rooms.

From my experience, Asian Legend has been consistently good.  I knew I could count on them to deliver a great dinning experience and set the tones of the rest of the evening.  They were right on.

The entire dinner has been pre-ordered ahead of time [Thank you, you know who you are].  So when the entourage arrived and was seated, the staff brought out each course without a hitch.

One dish that stood out was the Peking Duck.  It was Peking-Delicious!  The crispy skin and tender meat were so good.  It looked so tasty that one of our vegetarian guests ALMOST jumped off the wagon to join in!  Thumbs up from all around the table.

The lobster dishes with Szechuan and Ginger & Green Onion sauce were also a hit.  They were freshly and properly prepared.  Our dad didn't say a word after the lobster dishes arrived.  You wonder why?  Both dishes stayed right in front of him most of the time.

We love and appreciate that the meals came out fresh and hot from the kitchen like they should.  And in terms of tastiness, you know that everything must be mouthwatering good, when there are no photos attached to this review.  No time for snapping photos when you are dinning with my group of people.  You snooze, you lose!

Overall, I could not ask for a more fun and delightful evening at Asian Legend.  Even the staff, who usually look stern, cracked smiles...or was it the promise of the automatic gratuity that brought out those bright smiles?",2011-01-13 22:11:22

When I found my row, I could feel the past in my seat.  Constructed in 1927 as a movie theatre and revamped in 2002 as a live music venue, Kent Stage provides a quality sound and decent seating from every angle.  

I especially love the intimacy the theatre brings with it's smaller size, which was perfect for seeing our favorite band, Over the Rhine, play last night.  Karin & Linford warmed us up from the cold outside, and wove their way in to our hearts, as they do. We saw them in concert just over a year ago in Seattle, but to see them in their home state was a real treat.

Artists are the most frequent patrons, and many a theatre meeting has taken place upstairs at Balzac's (where there are various couches, chairs, tables, nooks and crannies... and balconies... to settle on). Decorated with local art, there is a great vibe here.

The beans are roasted until they are nearly burnt - yummmm! On the days where they do their roasting, you can smell it as far away as Front & Church! The location is amazing - best place for a coffee date, whether it's with a friend or a lover. Also, it reminds me of Stratford (where the original Balzac's is).

Crispy fish tacos, Beef and Pork tacos are $5.  Pretzel fondue is also $5.  There's others but I only remember the items we ordered and loved.

Previously known as Jimmy Nails, Super Nails and Spa is under new management. I met the new owner, she works there, and tended to my grandma's manicure and pedicure. 

Ambiance:
-What the nail salon lacks in ambiance (not much paint/decoration), it makes up in skill, attention to detail and care for their patrons.
-low, relaxing music (Christian radio station) playing over the speakers
-comfortable pedicure chairs, look brand new

Cleanliness:
-here's where a lot of people will be excited: this spa is the cleanest, most sanitary nail salon I've ever been to.
-pedicure tubs have plastic liners, no extra charge like at some salons
-nail tech wears gloves during pedicure
-pedicure nail tools are sterilized in individual pouches

Staff:
-unlike other nail salons I've been to, it's apparent their primary concern is the patron in front of them. The bilingual chatter is kept to a minimum, and the nail techs converse and joke in a genuine way with their clientele. 
-the owner, who did my grandma's mani/pedi, was very adept at her skill and never once nicked my grandma's fragile aging skin. She also did my grandma's manicure there in the pedicure chair so she wouldn't have to get up (my grandma's mobility has severely decreased recently).

Quality:
-my grandma's natural nails have never looked so good! She was so impressed, she can't wait to go back. 
-I had my eyebrows waxed here and am very pleased with the results.

Cost: 
-a basic mani/pedi cost $28 before tip, a deal in my opinion for the quality received. Of course, there are add-ons and up-charges, but the price list I grabbed on the way out all seemed very reasonable.

As I said before, this place has encouraged me to get regular mani/pedis: not only are the affordable, but their staff is friendly, efficient and take pride in what they do.",2014-05-27 22:13:03

Fast forward to now. China Joe's has gone through ownership changes and they haven't had Curry Chicken on the lunch special menu for several years. As a result, I pretty much never go there anymore. For some reason, I decided to get lunch there today. Being a General Tso's Chicken fan, I went with that ($5.25). It smelled amazing as I was driving back to the office, but when I opened the container, it just looked off. The sauce for the chicken was way too dark, like they just threw a ton of soy sauce into the mix. It actually tasted OK, but definitely not like the GTC I was hoping for. Appearance affects taste almost as much as smell and something just didn't seem right in my mind.

It may be unfair to dismiss them based on one dish, but I don't think I'll be returning (at least for another few years). In a way, I'm glad. Having one less option to choose from makes the lunch decision ever-so-slightly easier.",2011-01-13 21:19:00

The policy here is really strange, every person in a group is required to order an item of a minimal price. This is probably because it gets quite busy on weekends, and it's never been a problem for me because everyone in my group generally orders something anyway, but it's tacky (and petty) to be stated so directly. 

On my last experience, however I was with a friend discussing something quite important, and we were requested to reorder. After an hour of being there, that too, with a minimal order amount of $10. I looked around and the place was pretty empty, so I was obviously surprised by the money-grab. The internet connection is free with several strings attached.

bGCLKx45KHxec8tdGqR7Mw,gVmUR8rqUFdbSeZbsg6z_w,R-XlTnuAH4E53QUgFPJAkg,4,1,0,1,"I am such a fan of Dooby's Grill. It is a fantastic little hideaway off of Dobson Rd in Mesa. We drive 45 minutes out of our way to eat there and are thankful that the price of gas has decreased enough to make it worth our while to go more frequently.

First of all, Dooby's is NOT Greek food. It is Israeli food with some Mediterranean stylings added in so for those of you who consider yourselves fans of Greek fare, keep this in mind when you come to Dooby's. 

The atmosphere at Dooby's is very Middle Eastern-casual. There are standard tables, but also tables with pillows on the floor as well. If you plan to eat a lot, eat at a standard table, because there is nothing more humbling than trying to roll yourself into a standing position after gorging on warm pitas, lamb kebabs, and baba ghannouj. Don't count on this being a quick meal either. Food comes out of the kitchen at a steady pace, but if you are intending to have a quickie lunch, it's better to phone your order ahead. 

The lentil soup is fantastic. Very flavorful and the texture is perfect. The hummus is wonderful as well. Get the hummus deluxe as it has diced pieces of lamb in it. Yum! And the hummus has body to it. It's not some paste smeared on a plate. My meal of choice is always the Chicken Schwarma. You can have it as either a meal or a sandwich but it doesn't matter which way you have it; it melts in your mouth. The garlic sauce is a nice addition to the schwarma, but you don't necessarily need it as the schwarma has great flavor. Every once in a while, I like to add some shug to my schwarma for a little kick. For those that don't know, shug is a Yemeni hot sauce made with cilantro and jalapeno peppers. My hubby and son enjoy the chicken schnitzel. We have enjoyed pretty much everything on the menu.

One area where Dooby's could improve is in the salad department. The salads are unexciting at most. But then, most people don't go to Dooby's for the salad anyway. And it's the 2nd reason why I enjoy the lentil soup.
Also, and maybe it's a personal preference, but I find the falafel lacking as well. They remind me of dense, flavorless hockey pucks. I generally skip them because I am used to more crisp, flatter, less dense falafel. Perhaps I've become a falafel snob? But I digress....

The service staff at Dooby's is very casual and friendly. Dooby himself is in the kitchen cooking and I can't remember a time when he's not there. There is also belly dancing as well which personally, I can take it or leave it, but my male companions seem to enjoy it for whatever reason. But because of the belly dancing, it's not necessarily the most kid friendly place. Kids are a bit uncomfortable with the whole half-naked lady gyrating around the dining room thing. 

Oh and one last thing, you have to ask for the check at Dooby's. They don't just bring it to you. It's a European thing and something I rather enjoy because you never feel like you are being rushed out of the restaurant.

Go to Dooby's and see for yourself. Don't take my word for it.",2009-01-04 05:25:32

Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special. 

But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.  

One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.

But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.  

They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.

Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.

Enjoy!",2014-01-23 19:05:23

We sat outside and apprehensively parked the dog outside, making sure to clear it with the staff that it was okay to have him outside. The petite brunette barista (wish I had gotten her name!) was so incredibly sweet and gracious. She took the time to come outside and greet our dog, even bringing him a ""puppyccino,"" just water in a bowl but a very sweet gesture nonetheless.

The inside is clean and modern looking, but not so modern that all the furniture is uncomfortable.

I'm not usually one to complain, but I just need to let this out because I left this place pretty upset.

I booked a convertible through a popular third party website. 

As I got in line, I overheard the lady helping the couple in front of me. She was denying this patient couple a car because their reservation was at 7 pm and it was about 7:45 pm at this point. The couple explained that their flight was delayed and so they could not do anything about their subsequent tardiness. The lady from Advantage just told them to try another agency. As you can tell, I was super excited to see what great news she had for me.

Once I got to the counter, she asked for my last name. I reply and hand her my ID and credit card as well. She scans it for a moment then asks if I was a local, to which I reply, yes. She then mentions that per company policy she cannot allow me to rent a convertible. Instead she offers me a Toyota Camry,  which I obviously wasn't too thrilled about. I explain to her that I had already paid for the car I wanted, so there should be some leniency at least in this case. She did not seem sympathetic and conversely came off snide and standoffish.

I highly suggest for the owner to just print out the menu on paper and tri-fold it for return customers.  

The fish was really good and well fried AND they give you a lot. Hubs and daughter liked the chicken and said it was well seasoned. i'm saving the wings for lunch tomorrow. I tasted one and it's good too. Quite honestly, I thought the food pricing was super cheap. The paranoia in me wondered, ""is this really fish and where did they get them chickens?""

Our first server was a little brusque (the French influence, I'll presume) and our second server was very friendly but a little too earnest. If I return, I'd like to see a balance between the two hospitality styles. 

I didn't have a drink because I was feeling the onset of a cold (shocker, I know!), but everyone else commented that their mixed drinks and wine were enjoyable. I did take a sip of someone's gin fizz and thought the flavor was fantastic. 

The complimentary appetizers Metro provided were also quite enjoyable. The pate and onion tart were solidly executed, but the real standout was the fried oysters. The oysters themselves were clearly the freshest available and the crispy, salty coating was to die for. In that moment, I was wishing I had ordered an icy cold beer to go along with them!

On one of our trips to the UK I introduce the wife to the British Carvery, to give you an idea take a look here : http://www.tobycarvery.co.uk/carvery/

Now, as these are non existent in Vegas, we are left with places that serve a traditional British Sunday Dinner, right, Crown and Anchor it is.

The service is always good here, the wait staff are always friendly and quick....... And let's be honest here, whoever came up with their uniforms, you deserve a medal.

But it is the food we are interested in.

The wife went for the Sunday Dinner with roast beef, I had the Sunday dinner with lamb and beef, both dishes are served with Yorkshire pudding, veg and A roast potato (more on those in a minute), along with this my wife ordered a small house salad.

After a while we had pretty much given up on the salad, no big deal, these things do happen. however, when are meals came out, they each had a house salad on the plate, along with the meat, potatoes, veg, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.....

A pet peeve of mine is when waitstaff know that something isn't right, how a house salad, with gravy even makes it out of the kitchen is beyond me (unless this is the way the owners want it, in which case....WOW).

Anyways, a quick recovery by the lady serving us, my salad which I did not order is gone and my wife has a nice house salad on the side, which would have been better served before the meal came out, but ok, on to the meal itself.

Is it a ""traditional British Sunday dinner"", well yeah it is, in the same way that as a McDonald's 1/4 pounder is a gourmet burger, all the pieces are correct, it looks right, but there is just something missing.

So let us dissect the meal :

The meats were good, maybe a little thinly sliced, but that happens to be the way I like them, so I was happy, however, putting beef gravy on to lamb just destroys any taste to the meat, if you are going to offer both meats, it's actually better to serve the gravy on the side and let the customer mess it up.

The Yorkshire pudding was good, this is something that normally causes all kinds of issues to those not raised with the darn things, but they were good.

Veg is veg, enough said and ignored.

Now for the real crime on this dish, the roast potato.....This is going to be long, it is a story and a rant.

The Great British Roast Potato, a food that when done right makes a Brit smile and a non Brit wish they had been born a Brit, sounds like exaggeration huh ? 

A couple of years ago we were lucky enough to host the family Christmas dinner here, it seemed like half of California showed up, the women folk worked their wonders on the veg, the father in law worked on turkey and prime rib.

Over in a corner of the kitchen the Brit who married into the family was hiding in a cloud of steam, gently giggling to himself, these poor Americans had no idea what was about to hit them. A bag of potatoes had been boiled, cut in half and were now being gently rocked back and forth in a colander.

The women were looking at the wife wondering, WTF did you go and marry this guy for ? And why won't he answer any questions about what he is cooking ?

45 minutes before we are due to eat, the potatoes are placed in the oven, set at 325, basting in a bath of melted lard and drippings. After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.

So 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !

That is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.

Now the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.

Yes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right.
For this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not.",2012-08-20 10:40:31

Between my friend and I, we tried several different rolls. They're all basic and you get four pieces of each, so not a full roll like you'd get at other places. My favorite was the eel and avocado, seemed to have the most substance. The crispy roll is a skip, it literally was like tempura flakes rolled in seaweed and rice. Didn't taste extremely fresh, but for $10, how high can your standards really be? 

Rolls weren't anything spectacular, fried rice (also included in the all-you-can-eat) was not your typical fried rice, it was sticky rice that looked like they tossed some carrots in. I wouldn't order it again. The spring rolls were just okay, sauce was at least yummy. Service seemed slow for a weekday lunch, after I arrived it took forever for our waiter to come back and take our order, but he was semi-attentive after that until the place started to fill up. He at least didn't let our drinks go empty. If I return, I'd probably order a roll off the actual menu next time.",2016-03-09 02:21:45

There are a few prime picnic areas that you can reserve but there are also plenty of picnic areas that you can grab if you go super early (6am on a holiday weekend) or late in the afternoon when the early birds start heading home. There are many picnic tables shaded by trees; but my favorite spot has to be the one near the Jose Rizal memorial which is sheltered by these gorgeous flowering trees with pink blossoms. Bbq grills are available but you can also bring your own grills, tables and even tents.

Formerly a farm then a golf course: this park has one of the two ski & snowboard centres run by the City of Toronto. It totally took me by surprise to see a ski lift so far away from a mountain range. During the warm months the view from the top of the ski hill is beautiful. It's a wonderful place to sit down with a book and relax. With the panoramic view of the city skyline in front of you, you really just need to take it all in......and.....breathe.

I asked them about grip and to my surprise the rep at Verizon had no idea what grip even was.  I called this location this morning and of course the guy says that they always tell customers there are more then just the grip plan.

Verizon has a role in this as well, they shouldn't allow companies to sell their products if they aren't going to do it honestly.

First, the dude at the door was full on rude to my friend while she was waiting for me. Going on a Sunday night and the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty, she still got attitude from an older man working the hostess stand.  He basically snapped at her as she was standing near the front door waiting for me and ordered her to move away from the door and that she 'had' to wait at the bar.  She almost wanted to leave after, but we opted to stick it out and not let some crabby guy dictate our plans.

I like that they are finding ways to use the event space during the day as well and not just at night. It looks like your standard nightclub inside with a large open dance floor which works well for setting up market booths and for yoga. The lobby bit has nice seating and the bar is usually open during these events for mimosas and other drinks. The brunch they served after yoga had a sweet and savory option and the savory option was tots with a Mexican twist and it was delicious!,2017-06-19 20:49:58

Welllll, it was quite disappointing the nachos SUCKED! Worst I've ever had! The chips were very salty, it was covered with -what tasted like- cheese whiz (yuck!), a meat sauce and the whole thing covered in a mountain of diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.

You'd think it'd be pretty hard to eff up nachos but these guys did a great job of doing it unless you like very salty chips, cheese whiz and a mediocre meat sauce then I guess you'll love these!

You'll find all your traditional Spanish dishes here as well as some Spanish-American fusion type things.  My favorites are the paella and the red snapper.  Things are reasonably priced for the good quality that you will get.

The dessert menu is insanity, and they literally bring the dessert items to you on a platter for you to drool over as you ponder your decision.  There are cakes a' plenty, torts, pastries, and my favorite - the tres leches.  Check out the picture I posted and tell me you don't want that!

The food is always hot and fresh--never cold. The portions are ample with some to spare.  I always get the fried seafood. The flavor tends to be on the lackluster side and requires some doctoring (Old Bay and Ketchup) to make it good.

We had a great energetic server who went above and beyond to give us separate bills, including a sep one for our appetisers and one for our wine which only a few people shared. 

Food was ample and tasty. For appetisers we got the combination salad which comes with crispy falafels and choice of salad or dip (3).

For our mains, AT and I shared a lamb kebobs (2) $15 and a ground meat kebab. All come with potatoes or rice and salad (meh) 

It was tasty but not as flavourful as I hoped. Maybe the spices ? AT suspects it because it's not cooked on top of a charcoal fire that gives it that smoky taste.

Sq5ZZNUPHTvjz6YcnM44XQ,b3W6QCbEQYMNM19N_12sXQ,QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA,4,1,0,0,"I have lived in Phoenix for about 18 months now.  My first six months I had plenty of chances to eat out.  The whole time I was looking for more authentic Chinese food.  Not the overly sweet sauces of americanized Chinese food, but edgier stuff.

While living in the Netherlands (where Chinese food is even worse than Phoenix) we learned that good Chinese restaurants have two menus, one for the casual Chinese eater looking for a step up from Panda Express and Chinese buffets and one menu for the die hards, native Chinese food eaters.  Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).

Well, my looking in Phoenix has come to an end.  Szechwan Palance has such a menu.  Granted, theirs is not so seret, they share the same menu, but in different sections.

I have been here twice and I have found the food to be quite good.  there are some edgier dishes that we have not braved yet (i.e. kidney, brains, intestines, odd seafood etc.) but the ones we have tried have been quite tasty.  

Dan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap.
Chinese egglplant in spicy bean sauce - very good, ordered it twice, and I do not even like eggplant.
Beef boiled soup - I have grown to love this dish over the last few years (starting in netherlands),  There are so many flavors and interesting items included.  We love to get rice with it to sop up as much juice as we can.  though we have been told by friends that broth is simply there to cook the meat and veggies, not to eat as a soup.

We have Chinese national friends and they all claim it is a great place for authentic Chinese Szechwan.  

The Service - many comment on the service - OK it is only so so.  Last time we were there they never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  Had to ask them to clear dishes etc.  Not really rude, just not what we are used to in restaurants.  I wont let this curtain our dinning there, I count it as part of the experience.",2014-06-16 21:51:45

I saw people of all ages enjoying meals and it was a Thursday afternoon. So it was hardly like a nursing home as another reviewer posted.

I had the fish and chips (as did my mother) - very good and they come with a salad appie. My grandma had a western sandwich - she asked if they could just give her a few chips (fries) for a taste and they did (no charge). They also quickly brought a plate so I could share some salad with her.

The pizza is consistently good, we have tried and enjoyed a couple varieties. 

That being said, the service is consistently poor. It takes forever for the servers to even notice you're there. Half the time, I just see them standing at their station playing on their phone. In fact, we went for lunch last week and another customer ""joked"" to the waitress ""Hello! You didn't even notice me in here?"" after he tried getting her attention numerous times. 

What we do like is the lunchtime special from 11:30 - 4:00, on weekdays. You get a pizza (margerita or pizza of the day) and a side (two types of salad to choose from, or in the winter soup). This minestrone soup that they serve is AWFUL! First, it's not the classic Italian minestrone that is a tomato based broth with beans and vegetables. It's a clear broth (seemed to me to be water) with some cut up vegetables. It had no flavour, and it took forever to be served to us. Which I didn't understand as it's already made and just had to be poured into a bowl and brought to us. When it did arrive, it was cold. DONT GET THE SOUP, It's awful!!! Get the caesar salad!

And, perhaps more importantly, the support and service ever since has been exceptional. Hats off to Bill Watson, service manager, and his team. Whether it be ""pool school"", where they teach you how to care for your pool system, or service and repairs on site at your pool/spa, the responsiveness is exceptional, the work is competent, and the turnaround is fast. Just this morning, they resolved an issue that was making my filtration system fail, and did so within an hour of me contacting them.

Granted, sometimes it takes a little longer for a service tech to arrive (depending on other calls and where they are at the time), and some issues are more complicated to solve, but you can always expect a great product from Presidential, along with exceptional ongoing support and service.

I came here for their Summerlicious menu for dinner with a friend recently. We both ordered the crab BLT for our appetizer, the BC albacore tuna and the tandoori lamb for our mains, and the cannoli and strawberries to end off on a sweet note.

The crab BLT was refreshing and not mayonnaise heavy like many seafood sandwiches. What my friend and I absolutely loved were the vegetable chips that accompanied them. Those chips were so addicting! We commented on how we prefer them over potato chips and wish we could make them at home.

My BC tuna was great. The salad it came with and the dressing matched perfectly with the freshness of the tuna. Great presentation as well. I loved the grilled oyster mushroom it came with. My friend said her tandoori lamb was the most tender lamb she's ever tasted. I couldn't agree more. No weird gamey aftertaste either.

Dessert was ok. I've had way better cannolis in Scarborough and elsewhere. The mascerated strawberries with ice-cream was simple and done right. So simple I could make them at home. On the plus side, you could see vanilla bean in the ice cream. Legit.

We had a bottle of pinot grigio as suggested by our server and I think he made a great pairing to our dishes.

Summary: Good food, great service, the place was also newly renovated so that's definitely a plus. Would definitely come back to try their regular menu! A solid 4.

Recommendations: Crab BLT (wish we could ask for extra veggie chips!)",2013-07-18 14:21:48

I've seen it for quite sometime but because we were shopping at Smart and Final, I decided to take our staff the Kabob Oasis...And we were not disappointed. The Gyros sandwich was da bomb! The Gyro meat was just how I like it, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They give you huge portions of meat and the bread was handmade in the restaurant to order. For $4.99 the Gyro sandwich was a steal. Only down side is they charge $2.50 for fountain drinks; a bit steep for a place like this. Anyways, we liked it so much we came back two days later and the food was still just as good. BTW: a side of Gyro meat was a great addition to any meat lovers. Also, the salad comes with dressing...not sure what the person complaining about dry salad is all about...All they had to do was ask. The people there are amazingly friendly. Oh, the other thing, we saw someone just order the flat bread fresh. I think I will try that next time. It's a hole in the wall kind of place so don't be too harsh on the appearance.

I've only ever had salads. The Market Salad is quite tasty. Although, it seems to have spaghetti in it. Not the grain I was expecting. The Chinese Chicken Salad is just ok; it needs more spice. The pretzel balls are legit.

It's a pretty decent sized place. There's of course a huge selection of items from the bakery. There's also a deli area, and the centre is a mini-grocery store with some imported items.

At this point, I've ordered a few types of danishes, croissants, cannoli, bread and cappuccino. There's so much more to try, such as the hot table items and their famous gelato, but this place is already a bonafide winner for me. The quality is superb and they seem to reach the desired level for each item, whether it is: sweetness, flakiness, texture and so on. Even other things like having a good-quality fruit filling in the pastries.

As always, value is huge for me and the bill is always lower than I expect. The prices aren't listed (that I can see), yet I no longer care since I know it will be probably even better priced than I'd hope for.

I know everyone was excited about Jeni's ice cream and I was too, but something about the addition of french fries catches my attention even more.

When I missed out on the stand Sweetie Fry had in Coventry, I cried a little inside. The promise of maple bacon ice cream close to home had sifted through my fingers. I was going to go without ever knowing what Sweetie Fry was like for the rest of my life...

And then!! Sweetie Fry moves into this really cute and sweet location on Lee! Perfect! I went for the first time on a Saturday and we were a bit early, so we ran some errands and came back at 12:02, since the door said they open at 12. Door locked. GASP. Then, a man let us in and told us they don't open for another half hour, but we can come in and sample some ice cream. Immediately, the owner struck up conversation with us and began trying to pair ice creams with our personalities and other tastes! It was so fun! The girl behind the counter was just as helpful, suggesting her favorites and good ""sweetie scoops"" (a mini scoop of another flavor on top of your first choice. cute and good for people such as myself--bad at decisions.) to add on to our regular orders. Once the owner heard that I love goat cheese, he went and got his box of goat cheese shipped from Wisconsin and showed me the gigantic mouth watering hunks of cheese. I had to try the ice cream and of course, that's the one I settled on! The key lime pie was eerily similar to a piece of pie and ended up being my second choice, but my sweetie scoop choice was the cinnamon--definitely not like Big Red; delicious! 

Unfortunately, they weren't making fries since we came in early, so we didn't get to try those, but I'm sure they're amazing. I'll be coming back for more of that goat cheese ice cream, for sure! And definitely returning for some of the maple bacon, which they were out of.",2011-12-09 12:58:25

We were a bit leary as we'd not heard much about this place and felt like we would have if it was any good. Since I had a Citipass coupon, and we were both getting crabby because we were hungry, we decided to check it out.

The atmosphere is a bit generic but there were a ton of tables inside; it is much bigger than you'd expect. There was a bar in the back and quite a few of the tables were taken, but we were led promptly to a booth. Chips and salsa immediately arrived and they were pretty good. I decided to start with the orange pineapple crush, which was delicious but a bit pricey at $9. I saw a happy hour menu with prices listed that were the same as the regular menu, but they did have drink specials ($2.50 bottles of Mexican beer on Thursday nights). 

Our server, Karen C, was quite attentive (without being annoying) and even helped me choose my beverage. We got the guacamole made tableside ($9) and it was actually very good; I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars for how fresh it tasted. My boyfriend got the Enchiladas Verdes ($13), which came with only rice, so he had to order a side of refried beans (which ended up being enough refried beans for about four people). Being quite the enchilada aficianado, he said he enjoyed these. I ordered the fajita quesadilla, which was very good as well, but huge. I ended up eating a1/3 of it and plan to eat the rest for lunch AND dinner today...three meals for $10 is a great deal in my book.  

Ultimately, if you just have to have some Mexican and Cantina 1511 is on a two hour wait (as they are frequently on weekends), this is a solid back-up choice. Plenty of parking available in the lots behind and across the street.",2011-03-25 12:43:04
AlZNy7DeUOEc--6ipUwCbQ,uEKuEB0lsvd-Ht8z4ekEiw,Jy5afZ2MwYGNXhK1pDMbiQ,5,3,4,2,"I had the AMAZING opportunity to try Red Wagon Diner during the EatRealYYC festival. I say 'amazing' because firstly, I don't get to try food trucks too often because I don't work downtown, so anytime I do find them, I take full advantage. Secondly, my experience with Red Wagon Diner was nothing short of AMAZING. 

At the EatRealYYC festival when I was walking around trying to decide which truck to settle on for lunch, I saw that the lineup at Red Wagon was tiny to non-existent. As a huge fan of NOT waiting in lines, I took a look at their menu, and saw that their menu was mostly Montreal smoked meat. Their 'Montreal Smoked Meat Breakfast Hash' (was that what it was called?) looked particularly interesting. I made up my mind and approached their truck. They took my order and had it ready in about 5 minutes. 

When I grabbed a bench nearby and opened my styrofoam takeout container, my eyes took a double take at the huge portion of eggs, smoked meat, and potato hash, mixed with onions and peppers. I shamelessly dove into the egg yolks, breaking them into this perfect combination of hash, onions, smoked meat... and upon shoving some of that deliciousness into my mouth, started shamelessly gasping and proclaiming the love affair my taste buds were having at that very moment. Ooohs and aaahs and eye rolls and mmmmms, all on a public bench sitting next to strangers. Shameless Sabz.

Anyway, I indulged in my Montreal Smoked Meat Breakfast Hash until it all ran out. Mmmm.. Why can I not have this every single morning? By that I mean, every morning when I wake up, I would open my door to find the Red Wagon Diner parked right outside, and they would greet me with a cheery ""Good morning Sabz! The usual?"", to which I would nod a sleepy yes, and within a few minutes they would give me my styrofoam takeout container containing the Montreal Smoked Meat Breakfast Hash. Then they would drive away happily, and I would happily stuff myself before getting on with my day.

Why can't life be perfect like this? What is it that makes this smoked meat hash SO DARNED GOOD? Why must I exercise constraint sitting next to strangers in park benches?

Even though it looks like I've strayed off-topic, let me tell you that the Red Wagon Diner is certainly madness-inducing. Now get yourselves some Smoked Meat Breakfast Hash, pronto!",2012-06-06 02:57:09

Arriving at Odelay, it's clear that some thought was put into all the design and esthetics. Outside is a large water cooler that is solely there to fill the large dog water bowl below- as a dog person I think that is super rad, +3 points Odelay. 

Entering the business and you see a beautiful rustic wood wall and other great design elements. 

As I waited in line, I observed the employee at the counter struggling to get the iPad to accept the credit card payment of the customer ahead of me. For about ten minutes she tried to run the card and it wouldn't take. The customer was clearly getting annoyed (understandably) and I felt bad for the employee, as it's not her fault that the system was buggy.  I was trying to send the employee an ESP message to offer the customer a free coffee or comp one of the bagels- something to make up for the very long delay. But nothing. When the customer finally got her order she was clearly unhappy and left the place quickly. I can guarantee that a free coffee or bagel for her would have made a lifelong customer, but I bet she never returns. 

When it's my turn I order a half dozen bagels and a single serve side of butter. I'm charged $10.84. I pay and don't really think about it, but then realize I just paid $3.00 for a tiny side of butter. That is insane, because that's the price of half dozen and a decent side of cream cheese. So a tiny side of butter is the same price as a large cream cheese here somehow?

Getting home- the bagels were better than average, but a bit undercooked. Strangely- there seemed to be a million sesame seeds on each bagel- but none of them wanted to remain on the bagel. Weird. 

Overall this place is better than Einsteins, but not as good as Chompie's. I highly suggest some front of house training to learn how to fix little mistakes and ensure you don't lose customers. There is a lack of communication between the cashier and prep staff.  It seemed as though the employee didn't know what to charge for a tiny butter, so I ended up paying the same price as I would have for a decent sized cream cheese.   I wish them all the best, but for me this place is one and done.",2015-10-26 18:38:00

Poutine, something I'm delighted to try without visiting Quebec, has made its way to Mill Ave. It's the fast food you HAVE to try. Traditionally, it's just fries, gravy, and cheese curds, but US Fries gives you the option of dumping a variety of meats or veggies on something that already has like a million calories. 

God Bless America. 

I couldn't decide which variety to get, so I played it safe and went with the bacon variety. Because the base ingredients are pre-made, it was ready in just a couple minues. Loaded with scallions, I was pretty excited to dig into this one. The first few bites were great! But around the halfway point, I slowed down abruptly. This may have been the saltiest meal I've ever had. The gravy on its own would be OK, as would the bacon, but combined it was just too intense for me. Next time, I'll try a different, sweeter variety. Or a burger. Or both! I would classify the size of these poutine boxes as adequate for a small lunch.

The reason? The prices are ridiculous!

I guess I have been a professional student for the past few years. Being at UNLV long enough I know that Rebel Books preys upon students who don't know better. There are 3 brick and mortar bookstores serving UNLV: Beat the Bookstore, the UNLV on campus bookstore, and this place. After having priced compared all 3 places for the course of my multple semesters as Rebel, I can assure you that this place is the most expensive.

Their books are on average 10-30% higher than either of the 2 other stores. I don't know why they charge so much but they take pride in ripping you off. The rebel gear isn't cheap either. They have a decent selection but at $20-30 a t-shirt, you can go to wal-mart and get twice as much Rebel clothes for your money. Just not worth it. 

 On top of that, they seem to think that everyone who comes in is going to steal. Upon entering you must place whatever backpack/purse/fannypack you have on a big rack before looking around. After that, one of the employees will watch you like a hawk and follow you around the entire store. Maybe they have a theft problem, but customer service should not have to suffer as a result.

My crew ventures here often. Our latest adventure was Saturday afternoon. March Madness on the TVs, 30-some year olds gambling over who's better at the hoop shoot out game. If a read head named Ford challenges you, run. He's automatic at that game. Checkers, skee ball, pool, Kenny Floyd providing the tunes. A good time as always.

Trivia on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Music on Wednesday, general on Thursday. Get there early to grab a table. I consider myself a somewhat intelligent person. I did not feel that way after a night of general trivia. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays.

Sure there are other options for Korean BBQ but I always come back to Lee's because the food just tastes better and the meat is of better quality than most of the other AYCE restaurants.  I come in with a party of two to three most times so grill space is not an issue. I have a set standard of 4-5 meats that I always order so I know what I'm getting as soon as sit down. A couple of my favorite things to see are a few thin sliced Rib Eye steaks or a huge platter of thinly sliced brisket go down on a hot grill and sizzling. I'll order another round before the first turn of the meat because I want to keep the party going. The Galbi and Bulgogi are outstanding too. There are no sliced onions in the Bulgogi, it's all meat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The standard Banchan is available with other options on the menu.

I have seen some lower scoring reviews on the topic of service, but my personal experiences with service at Lee's Korean BBQ have been great.  I appreciate the service of someone tending to my grill and taking care of me. I have even found a favorite server.

Not recommended for beginners at all. And be prepared with plenty of water and a small snack to reenergize when you reach the top. The climb itself is about 2075 ft so it does get tiring.

I've done this hike about 7x since moving to Vegas 3 years ago. Summer was a killer since it gets very hot. Bring plenty of water, a sunscreen since this trail offers no shade at all and also stay on the track or you'll be doing more climbing than necessary. Spring time is the best season to do this hike.

Kay has been on a sushi kick as of late, and when she's on a kick, she's Gary Anderson, so who was I to deny her cravings?

I looked about online for establishments that serve sushi, and being intrepid, decided that we try Dasonii in Robinson, which hadn't been touched yet on Yelp. 

Let me tell you, there is nothing like watching a Steelers game in a busy Korean restaurant on a Saturday evening. 

MAN, do they love Hines Ward. As far as they are concerned he is Superman, and that admiration absolutely toasts the heart. 

Also heart-toasting was the service. I was greeted by a man and a woman (I assume they were the owners) who seemed anxious due to the Steelers/Ravens game playing out on the big screen TV above the bar. We were given a good spot so as to watch the game whilst dining. Each time the Steelers made a big play or scored, everyone in the restaurant, from toddlers in high chairs to very distinguished looking adults in expensive clothes, looked at us (the only non-Koreans in the room) with smiles on their faces, clapping, excited.

Hell, THIS is the kind of place I'd like to watch a game at. There was no screaming, no fighting, no cussing (unless they were doing so in Korean), no bimbos, no buttheads, just a feeling that the Steeler Nation is universal.

Oh wait. I see the triceratops sitting over there on the sofa with the words ""KOREAN SUSHI???"" spraypainted across its hide. 

Everyone else, young and old alike, seemed to be enjoying Dasonii's various ""hot pots"" which include weird things (and I worship the weird) like octopus and beef intestine. 

We almost went that route, but when Kay wants sushi, she must have sushi or our plane of reality will be fractured into oblivion!!!

I kid the galpal. 

We opted for the Sushi & Sashimi Combination Super Deluxe which serves two, comes with Dasonii's fine miso soup as a starter, and is brought to your table on an exquisite wooden tray/plate, with a presentation so ornate, again I regretted not capturing it on film. 

I can't remember how many pieces we were given, but it was more than enough for both of us. You got the nigirizushi, the makizushi, the futomaki, the hosomaki, the temaki, the uromaki, and the sashimi which consisted of salmon, different cuts of tuna, and another fish that I think was monkfish or anglerfish (even our fine waiter and ardent Steeler fan Sejin wasn't sure).

As I keep repeating to avoid being bagged on, I have yet to achieve ""guru"" status concerning sushi and sashimi, but I am not afraid to say that I greatly enjoyed my meal. The sashimi was so good, I barely used the obligatory wasabi, ginger slices, soy sauce and daikon, eating it almost bare. The fatty tuna was satin, the salmon was pure velvet. Naked. Elegance. 

I dunno sushi/sashimi geeks, come here, try Dasonii, and let us know what you think. I wish I could be more eloquent and knowledgeable about the whole affair, but I can honestly say that our mouths and bellies were impressed. 

The nigirizushi (God bless Jimmy Wales), came with shrimp, octopus (!), and eel (!!). The eel was the highlight for me; so rich, so savory, so beautifully alien, Atlantean. 

Dasonii's only real dessert is Green Tea Ice Cream which we did not have. 

Last night marked another new experience for me; I had Ikura (salmon roe) for the very first time atop a small purse of nori. Some would call it caviar, I call them gummy red BB's that burst into mildly salty juiciness when your teeth crush them. Tantalizing. 

Not-so-new experience for me: Realizing once more that I cannot master the use of chopsticks, despite Kay's futile tutorials. Embarassing. My fingers are just not programmed for 'em. Their chopsticks are stainless steel as are the tables, Dasonii's decor being tre modern, sleek, and stylish despite being casual. 

Lesson Learned: One can enjoy an important Steeler game (and eat terrific food for that matter) without having to contend with drunken, uncivil conduct and with people who come from other lands and speak English secondarily. Try it sometime. The name of the restaurant means ""the person you love"" in Korean, and I felt loved, from perfect strangers who were just glad we ate at their restaurant, liked their cuisine, and cared about the Steelers as much as they did. The only thing more joyful than Hines Ward's performance was watching their reactions to the amazing plays he made. 

Heck, we didn't even think they'd have it on.

We started off with some drinks. My pomegranate martini was delicious. We also ordered the port of Manhattan, it looked very pretty because of all the cherries. It was very strong because of the bourbon. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail. It is always fresh & it comes with that dry ice affect which looks very interesting. I have ordered other appetizers. The coconut shrimp is also very delicious & crispy. And, I really love their beet salad & lobster bisque. 

I wasn't very hungry this time. But, I have never been disappointed with anything that I have ordered as an entrée, either for lunch or dinner. 

We did have an appetite for their chocolate lava cake. Which looks beautiful, but it tastes even better than it looks! Also, the view of the giant beautiful aquarium is always a treat! Even though, we had a rocky start this time... Thanks to Mark & all the other wonderful people that work there, we ended up having an amazing time!",2017-02-13 18:29:08

I must say I do prefer this place over moes or qdoba as the ingredients always seem to be a notch above in flavor and quality.  I adore their honey jalapeno vinaigrette on their salads and I cannot guarantee that I have that salad dressing name right all I know is that its delicious and when they ask if I want it I say heck yeah.  I think my only complaint is that its a bit pricey and nothing comes with chips and I don't know what kind of salt they use on their chips but I'm addicted so yes I'm upset that chips don't come with my meal but yes I will still pay for them :/

There are some rules to remember of course. When you walk in the door, don't expect much of customer service or someone to say hello and take you to your table. Just walk in, find a clean looking table and have a seat, the menus (there are few) can be found somewhere around the restaurant. It may be a while until someone will come to take your order, so make sure you bring a good book to read or a your favorite friend to talk to. I've seen some couples walking out after  10 minutes of waiting, I personally was just eager to taste the food and didn't mind a long wait.

The food is okay. I should say breakfast food is okay. I found it pretty funny how the jam was on top of my eggs (in the middle of my plate) and overall presentation of the meal I received. But, you don't come here for the food or customer service, it's an experience.

The atmosphere reminded me of going back in time, it has this retro vibe going on for sure, makes you feel like you're in a movie. 

I give it a solid 3 star rating, I personally enjoyed my breakfast there, not so much the food but mostly, I will repeat again, the experience. Oh, and the best part is that it won't break your budget at all, probably the cheapest breakfast I've seen in Montreal.",2017-07-09 14:47:31

It really didn't wow me. The sauce was good, perhaps more suitable for something else, but it wasn't memorable. The potato cakes were good; fancy name for fast food-style hash browns. We also ordered the ribeye with eggs and their house potatoes. The meat was cooked nicely and the potatoes were good. Again, nothing spectacular though.

Every time I go to Smeek's, I'm drinking cream soda, wearing a finger tentacle, holding a bag full of vegan chocolate bars, and taking pictures in a photobooth, within minutes. Plus, It's so hipster I can't even convey how hipster it is (except maybe to say that there are a plethora of mustache-themed items and vintage candies lining the walls). Either way, it's trendiness and gourmet treats make it just as much fun for big kids, if not more fun, than it is for little kids.

The only reason I don't give Smeek's that coveted fifth star, even though I only have good things to say... is because it's overpriced. If penny candies weren't dead before, they are now. Get ready to whip out a $20 if you want a decent amount of sugar and a photobooth session. If you venture into the novelties, just put it on the credit card and stop thinking about prices altogether.

Here are my highlights of this location:

Pros: location is great because it's located centrally downtown next to the Concordia Campus; BYOB so there is a SAQ located right across the street! No corkage fees either! I found quality of food was better- especially in terms of presentation. 

Rating on five stars :
I ordered the butter chicken ****(generous amount of white meat good for 2 people); shahi paneer **(mostly just a heavy cream sauce - with really small pieces of paneer/cheese); tandoor Roti ***(slightly greasy, came in two pieces); garlic naan ***(very well seasoned and salted - still greasy -came in two pieces); papdi chaat ****(fried tortilla pieces garnished with chick peas, yogurt, tamarind, cilantro, and various chutneys). Each item cost less than 10$. This meal complimented nicely with a white wine : Pinot Gris

Cons: this place has a more of a fast food vibe compared to the other location. Service was kind of off- lacking speed, or was hard to flag down the waitress at times. You had to walk up to the cash to pay - another offset.

Some awesome attributes:

-Very large complex which offers a good variety of shows for different folks

-Clean and tidy (every time I've visited) - even the restroom which makes me happy and feel safe

-Friendly and helpful staff - they seem to enjoy what they do as opposed to being the slouched over guy that's miserable and mumbles instructions to you.

-Popcorn. I like theirs because it's not too greasy but a good balance of sodium. Mmmmm

-Quality acoustics in each viewing theater

-Design of the theater (inclined floor as you walk to the farther from the screen. Honestly, not a bad seat in the house. Well, except for front row. I will never do that again. Ever.

-Theater seats themselves?! Large, comfortable but still firm, a handy drink holder, AND reclining seats so that it's practically as low as a damn bed. In fact, I got so comfy when I watched Arrival that I slept through the whole damn picture. Smh

I'm lucky enough to be the new fur-momma of an adorable rescue pup, Archie. He's the perfect little man and it was surely love at first sight... especially since I drove 10 hours to Hagerstown, MD and back just to get 'em. 

Anyways, I searched Yelp to find a great vet around downtown Cleveland that I could trust with my new fur babe. And once again, CLE yelpers have not let me down. They pointed me right to Gateway Animal Clinic, which I've driven by numerous times but never thought twice about. 

Yelpers also let me on to the whole ""first come, first serve"" style of this vet clinic, so I wasn't confused when I walked in. Actually, I got the first ticket! So, I waited a short while and was welcomed in with my Archie to the examining room. 

I'm not sure which vet I saw, but she was very sweet and thorough with her examination. She answered all of my questions and let me get my typical nervousness out. Unfortunately she informed me that little Arch has a heart murmur that needs further examination. So, that broke my heart, but she recommended some heart specialists to go to for more support. The one thing I would have hoped for was more practical, everyday advice on how to care for Archie's murmur, how to keep him healthy, etc. 

Even the receptionist/nurse was sugar-sweet! She gave me lots of helpful tips on who to go to for training and took the time to chat with me a little. I think she could tell that I was a little shaken-up by the news, so she took extra time to talk with me. So appreciated. 

Overall, you can't beat Gateway for the cost. $37 dollars for a check-up? With vets that nice and thorough? You can't beat that. I was also able to stock up on heartworm meds, and noticed that I could just stop by the front desk to buy more when I need it. Huge convenience! 

Archie and I will definitely be back for his yearly check-ups!",2011-03-25 01:46:52

The outdoor patio area has plenty of tables and can be a good place to relax and traffic watch.

The food is also good at this location. Turkey and swiss on croissant is my general meal of choice, and when its available, I also get the excellent broccoli and cheese soup.

Parking can be a bit of a problem, with the lot outside serving a row of businesses, which is why I'm giving this location only 4 stars.

Thankfully, ""The Crepe's"" savory portions are a bit larger than others I've had in the past.  I'd still probably need the second one, but at least I don't feel hungry immediately afterwards eating only one.

The reason I am giving the extra star was due to the Mommy/Daddy & Me deal, where the little ones get a FREE crepe (sweet or savory) just half portioned.  This lets Little Foodie and me eat relatively well for a fair price!

We tried the Germany ($10.50): Bratwurst, Sauerkraut, Pickles, Green Onion & Mustard Sauce. Interesting combination, but it works well! Good size and pretty filling considering it's a crepe lol. 

Italy ($9.80): Cured Prosciutto, Scrambled Eggs, Italian Cheese, Tomatoes & Pesto Sauce.  A bit less filling than the Germany, but I enjoyed the flavors here.

Europa ($6.50 Kid's size): Nutella & Fruit. Just like it sounds...with plenty of Nutella hiding inside!  Some places are a bit stingy with the goods, but they LAYER Nutella in there :)

Have been there before and it was a better experience (before), based on what we ordered.  It was at least a five star experience then.

We ordered one bibim nyengmyeon for Hubster and one hwae bibim nyengmyeon for me.  It was gorgeously presented, no question.  But the gochu-chang was ridiculously over the top very sweet.  It is supposed to be sweet but not like candy!  In Korea, the gochu-chang has a slight sweetness but this was crazy sweet.  The ingredients were OK.  The panchan, except for the kimchi which was well-fermented and strong was lacklustre.  Portions of main course were large.  Oyi kimchi portion was microscopic.  Service was alright.

I will go back because this place is clean and the food is generally good.  Will order a ttukbegae next time.  They serve some very traditional Korean dishes which I have not seen in a long time - which will be good for the winter.",2018-06-28 21:24:23

An event was being coordinated by the Wounded Warrior Project organization and I was to meet with other wounded warriors for a little what I thought was a meet and greet. Once I met the coordinator, she mentioned there were to be 70 attendees. Yes. Seven, zero. I braced myself for the worst.

At the strike of ten the doors opened and the games began. But what happened threw me off in a good way. The manager asked for the party of 70 right off the bat and immediately had us seated in a very large area of the restaurant designated just for our event. Servers were swarming, the manager was always present, water pitchers were pouring.  Good things were happening and I was truly impressed. I don't know if they had a pep talk in the back before we came in the door and said something like,""There is a group of 70 combat injured guests and their families coming in today. Get them whatever they want and do whatever they ask"" because that is exactly what I felt like was happening. First class service.

Now the food. I grabbed the Monte Cristo brunch sandwich which was egg, ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese between two thick pieces of French toast and dusted with powdered sugar. It was just as salty and sweet as you can imagine it was. It was in fact to sweet for me. Thankfully, my wife was having the Baja Chicken Hash meal which was ""Two Crisp Tortillas Topped with Chicken Chorizo, Poblano Chiles, Potatoes, Corn, Peppers, Onions and Cheese. Topped with Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce.""  I copied that from the website so hopefully they don't care but I can't explain all of what was in the meal. It was simply awesome. It was spicy and hearty with the hash browns and I loved it. So my wife and I switched dishes and were officially set. My daughter had a three pancake and bacon meal which she loved. Simple palate simply pleased. One thing to note. The orange juice was truly fresh squeezed and along with the pulp even had that slight bitter rind taste to go with it. The virtual cherry on top of the breakfast. Really, truly, good.

It all really came together. 70 of us sat down and there was not a single beat missed by the staff this morning. My coffee and water never went empty. My food came promptly piping hot and tasty.

We walked in and were seated at a tiny table for 2 with an extra chair stuck on the side. Needless to say, the three of us weren't exactly comfortable in such a cramped space.

The waitress came over and took our drink order first and the drinks were delivered quite quickly. She came back a while later to go through the menu with us. We really appreciated that she explained each item in detail, although we would have liked to have actual menus in our hands rather than having to look at a chalk board at the other end of the restaurant.

We ordered 2 Caesar salads and one gravlax for appetizers. The kitchen was kind enough to make one Caesar without anchovies as our son has an allergy. The dressing was delicious on both salads and the gravlax was also very nice.

For our main dishes, we had one tartare de cheval, one bavette de boeuf and one pork chop. The tartare was served with frites, grilled bread and a side order of grilled vegetables. It was very good, but the tartare (albeit a huge portion) could have used some acid (maybe a little mustard). The bavette de boeuf was served with a gratin of potatoes and was quite tasty. The pork chop was served with mashed potatoes (lovely and smooth and well-seasoned) and a jus with tomatillos. The dish was really well-balanced but the pork chop was overcooked without even a hint of pink.

All in all, the meal was good but not a good as we had anticipated after reading reviews on Yelp. For almost $300 for three people (including drinks), we were left wanting.

The staff were friendly and efficient, so there was no complaint on that front. We live far too far away to visit on a regular basis, but to be honest we probably wouldn't go back in a hurry even if we lived closer.

pl_kPsKhejfdNsr952041A,6cmLcsKtyzDwPvkYckD3hg,6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,5,1,2,1,"The first time I went to Lee's was in California while looking at wedding dresses for my sister nearly 2 years ago. It was lunchtime and we were not far from one. She suggested it, as she had been there several times. I had never had a banh mi sandwich, so she ordered what she liked best. #5, the Grilled Pork. It was a while ago, and I only remembered that it was yum. 

I've lived in the Phoenix area for 4 years and I didn't know there was a Lee's here until several months ago I was in the Costco parking lot at Cave Creek & Loop 101. There was a tattered, torn and dirty Lee's bahn mi paper bag on the ground. What?!? Lee's?!? Here?!? I looked it up online, and sure enough, there was a Lee's in Arizona. But in Chandler, an hour away from home. 

The mister and I just purchased a home in North Phoenix in June and needed a washer/dryer. Instead of purchasing new, we Craiglisted for a decent nice set. Lucky me, I found a set worth the drive to Chandler. Right down the street from Lee's. I really wanted to go, but was skeptical because Louie is more tentative with trying new foods (although he's doing a lot better at that now). He agreed and we went. It was fantastic and Louie loved it. I think this trip we both had the #10, Cured Pork and Pork Roll. The meat is thinly sliced and has the perfect saltiness to match the sweetness of their special mayo, tangy & crisp pickled veggies, with a bit of spice from jalapenos (I had mine with no onions). The French baguette was perfect. We were able to stuff ourselves for less than $10 including fountain drinks.

The staff is great. The following weekend we made another trip to the area, to Ikea. Since we were already this far, Lee's was added to the itinerary, so our friend could try it out. Louie thought the #11 Special Combo sounded good, so he ordered it. The young lady that took our order was nice enough to ask if he knew what was in it. Headcheese. I'm not a big foodie, so I didn't know what it was exactly. Not cheese. She gave him a sample and it's a good thing she did. He is not a fan of headcheese. LOL. 

The place is clean, has a huge dining area, a bakery counter and an ice cream counter, I think....? No one was at the other counters, so I didn't take a good look. I've yet to have them, but the smoothies and boba drinks look yum, so next time I'll give them a try. The only downside is that we are debit card people and they are cash only.

At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting into as I drove from Tempe out to the country-esque suburb known as Gilbert for dinner, but as soon as I saw the neon signage and gravel parking lot for Joe's Farm Grill with picnic tables outside and the line out the door, I knew I hit the jackpot.  

As I stood waiting in line and trying to figure out the system of ordering for JFG (it's not confusing at all.  you just order like normal.), I saw posters up of Guy Fieri, the guy (no pun intended) from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network.  Apparently, he had been there to tape a show on JFG and feature their onion rings (which i then promptly ordered, which were not only good, but HUMONGOUS).  In all honesty, though, I liked the sweet potato fries better than the onion rings.  Anyway, I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with a side of cole slaw, the onion rings, and a vanilla shake while my friends ordered burgers and sweet potato fries.  Everything was DELISH!  The price was also perfect, and the people were totally friendly.  

What makes JFG great in addition to everything else is their attention to detail like their focus on local ingredients.  I'm a big fan of supporting local agriculture (including fruits, veggies, and meats), so it's great that JFG supports it, too, to the extent that they can.  I noticed that at the bottom of the menu, it said: Spring 2010, so I'm assuming that the menu changes seasonally based on the farm goods available.  JFG also tries to not use prepared foods much, so they create their own sauces and bread their own onion rings.  Joe's Farm Grill is everything that other restaurants should strive to become, and I HIGHLY recommend you go.  They also have what appears to be a killer breakfast menu, so I might have to try that out in the NEAR future.

Note: If you notice that no condiments or drinks were given to you on your tray or filled in your cup, don't do what my friends and I did and stand there looking for them.  You have to walk out the door.",2010-03-21 05:26:58

I live down the street and always see the guys lined up outside at the taco cart. Hopped on yelp to see what all the buzz was about. I was not disappointed! Perfectly cooked well seasoned meat grilled in front of you and nuzzled into homemade tortillas. Sprinkle with onion and cilantro and go for the orange sauce. It's like a chipolte ranch or something. It's killer. I loved being able to walk there grab tacos for an OK price and stuff my face with them on the walk home. I think $1.50 for a taco would be a bit more reasonable that $2 but overall a good experience. Would happily go back.,2014-12-03 17:59:37

Came here at my suggestion for a good friend's birthday dinner last week. Her salmon dinner was ridiculously under cooked. We sent it back and another was brought out, but this should've never happened, let alone on her birthday. It was never mentioned or offered to be refunded. 

Tonight I dined with my children, and my daughter was halfway through her burger when I noticed it too was severely undercooked. We ordered a medium burger, and it was very RAW. I felt bad that I hadn't noticed it earlier, but again: it should've never been served this raw. My son ordered the same burger and it too was raw. Our waitress did remove one burger from our bill, but why not both? Both burgers were undercooked! She didn't even pretend to care. We had a horrible, neglected dinner. I guess we weren't worthy enough to offer the dessert tray to either. I didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I did leave a crappy one. Very disappointed, because I come here often and these back to back poor experiences just left me angry. 

I don't know what the hell happened to this place. But two visits in one week and awful food is unacceptable. Where is the accountability in the kitchen?!?! Stop sending out under-cooked food!

Another Sunday fighting the crowds at Ikea - I recently bought two complete kitchens from them what a Pita!! - from there to the nearest home depot. I'm rarely at that end of town so I ask the young man behind the counter what's a good place for brunch in NODA and he says .... Cabo Fish taco.  Great idea! 

We get there about 2:30, the place is busy but not unmanageable. Mexico and Marley theme joint, my partner asked if it was a part of a chain. Told her, no but it wants to be. We get a table immediately, the waitress is very friendly and attentive, although the bar was slow getting the drinks out. 

- Salsa and chips. Boooring, the corn heavy but too light on onions and spice mixture is no salsa and chips are cardboardy - I'd be surprised if they're not packaged. 

-The skinny Margarita got two thumbs down but I was cozy with my Negra modelo. 

- Mahi taco .. with tangy bbq sauce? The sauce was tasty but out of place, it overpowered the whole dish. Mahi, which in Fla we usually call dolphin is a strong tasting fish that can even be served blackened and it's flavor will still come through. Here it was so bland it could have been a chicken. It wasn't bad but the mahi taco tasted like bbq chicken taco so I'd call that a fail. My companion said she would have liked it if it hadn't been for the sauce , not me.

- Honey wasabi Tuna wrap, hu menu says burrito. Exact same result, wasabi/honey is the only flavor that came through and the wasabi tasted more like sharp yellow mustard than like wasabi.  And I'm a wasabi eater, at home I even use it on cold chicken or cold roast beef.  Tuna, unlike mahi is easy to overpower but still that was another honey/mustard chicken wrap not a fish burrito.

The refried beans and the mashed potatoes with jalapenos were the best thing of the whole meal. Price was reasonable. Would I go back? No, it wasn't bad but the food was Charlotte-grade boring.",2012-03-05 17:41:56

It is not my main nail salon but I love the fact that it is open until 9pm due to my work schedule. I usually go with one of my girlfriends to get mani / pedis. A few weeks ago she had to go without me with some of her other friends and the owner Andy (the husband of Helen) did her pink and white fill in. Once she sat down the owner began to question her about her friend that usually comes with her (me). Asking what it is that i do for a living because he did not think that I made a lot of money but acted as I did by how ""picky"" I was about my nails. After that he proceeded to tell her that I was not going to every get married, etc... Just basic girly gossip (coming for a grown man).  My girlfriend left the salon with the rest of her friends and called me to tell me what happened. A few weeks go by and the other night we decided o get our nails done but had to to go Avalon due to the fact that it was Memorial day and all other salons were closed. Once we walked in my girlfriend signed us in and told the owner that she wanted to get a pedicure and that I wanted a gel polish manicure. He told her to pick out the color and he would be right back. 8 minutes go by and he comes back to the front and say that he has no nail tech that could do gel nails but there was a pedicure tech that would take her. Once I looked around and saw there was a lady that just had gel polish on her nails my friend asked to make sure we understood that he was saying there was no one that could do gel nails. Andy responded and said ""No, no one can do it!"" He walked away and I asked his wife Helen because I didn't know if he was confused thinking I meant get nails vs. gel polish. She answered and said, "" Yes, someone can do it for you."" Andy came back up once her herd Helen say that and interrupted and said, ""NO! She is not going to do it for you, I need her to do other things."" My friend and I just looked at each other because we really didn't understand what he was trying to say. My friend then said, ""Do you just not want to do her nails?"" Andy responded and said, ""No, we not do her nail. She picky! She can not get done here."" My friend responds and says, "" Ok, but you want to do my nails?"" Andy said, "" Yes, we want your business but not hers!""  At that point I had nothing else to say other then, ""Let's Go!"" After we left the salon my friend suggested that we go to the mall office and report the business. The main office was closed so a security guard suggested that I call the next morning and report the company. So... I did just that! I called the mall manager Randy Thomas and spoke with him giving him complete detail on the evening. He listened to me and pretty much told me there was nothing that he could do about it but that I should email him so that he could put it in his file in case there was ever anything that came up such as not paying rent or something of that sort.

For the entree, I got fish tacos. It was okay, but the fish was a little too crispy for my liking. I have to say though, I absolutely loved their white sangria. Drinks are half off during happy hour on weekdays 4:30-6:30pm as well! 

One thing that ticked me off during my visit was the nonchalant servers. I know Kaya has the whole laid-back beach vibe going on, but that doesn't mean that the servers should behave that way too. We were in a rush, and whenever we asked our server for the check, refill, to-go boxes, he would respond with a ""Okay, I'll get that for you in a second"" and skip along to do something else first. It gets pretty frustrating the third time he says that. A little sense of urgency would be nice.

The combo came with steamed egg and soup to start then dessert to end. The dessert included ice cream sandwiches of your choice of flavor - it was SO good! The cookies n cream one was delish. 

Back to the main food... meat was very high quality, juicy, and cooked to perfection thanks to the attentive staff.

The prices on the spices were amazingly cheap and I bought several other spice items for when I do Indian based cooking (lentils are good for you but man they need some spices to taste interesting).

I had the good fortune to talk with the owner of the establishment. He told me the prices are so affordable because he deals with ethnic clientele  who use lots of spices and simply will not pay the sort of prices one sees in most stores. However, he assured me that he buys his spices in small batches (like 5 pounds) and then breaks them up himself and he checks everything when it comes in, if it doesn't smell fresh he sends it back and noted that he has a large base of customers that just buy from him for the spices.

I bet they are good too.  Today was nice because they sat us in the area in the back that can be closed for privacy.  That is great since we talk business a lot and it is nice to have that privacy.  Plus my hearing is not good, so I was able to hear the conversation.  The one thing that stands out here is the service the gal that waited on our table did a great job.  Very polite and sweet.  She did a good job and kept the drinks topped off too.  Great place and recommend it.",2017-05-02 21:35:22

The gravy is French onion soup tasting which is fine with me. I had the classic chicken and waffle sandwich. The waffle was great but the chicken didn't wow me, I prefer Lolo's. The second time I had the waffle, egg, cheese and bacon sandwich. Again the waffle was great. The bacon was very good but the eggs were over cooked and dry. There was no cheese. We had the poutine fries again which seem to be a bit addictive. 
I wish they would have paper menus so you could sit and decide what to have. We tried finding their menu online but could not. The very sweet waitress also could not find it so she took my phone and took 2 pictures of the wall menu. I thought that was very smart of her and I appreciated it.

A girl with hair that scissors didn't go near for the first 4 years of her life, and a boy who has hair that grows faster than mine. We visit this place about every 5-6 weeks so my son can get lined up with his cute little fohawk, and my daughter just got her first real haircut at our last visit. 

They have a train table and a wall lined with iPads for the kids to play on while you wait, and there never is really much of a wait even without an appointment. Two different car chairs for the young ones to sit in, with a good selection of Disney movies and TV shows to pick from. They also have video games that the older kids can play while getting their haircut.

Baby's first haircut is super cute, I think it was like $20 and they give your kid a certificate that has their after-haircut picture and a baggie with a lock of hair on it. Totally worth it when you're fighting back the sentimental parental tears of the haircut milestone.

They also have an option for little mini-makeovers for the princesses. They can get their hair styled, nails painted, and I think makeup too if you want. I will have to try that next time because my daughter loves being pampered like a grown up.

A regular haircut is $17, which is a worthy price to pay to avoid having a screaming child while someone is attempting to cut their hair. The atmosphere and kid's shows definitely keep them entertained long enough.",2015-09-16 18:06:17

Both are little Parisian-esque cafeterias that showcase delightful bakeries and serve gourmet sandwiches made-to-order in a casual semi self-serve style. Coincidentally, Olive et Gourmando is on Rue Saint-Paul Ouest...huh, look at that.

 
Cubain...zesty! 


 
Roll crevettes + crabe 



 
 
Chevre Chaud with homemade ketchup 


  
Olive et Gourmando is a smaller, less polite version - I found one server scary, and I'm pretty scary myself.  You are directed to a seat and then given a sheet of paper.  You take it and head to the back to order. My sister and I got there late, what with our stop at Jeans Jeans Jeans!  By the time we arrived, they were sold out of the sandwich I wanted - egg on your face - booyah!  I feel like it needs to be followed with a booyah and two-finger gun shot motion?!?  

I opted for the Chevre Chaud aka grilled goat cheese while my sister ordered the Cuban.  Then we decided to share the shrimp and crab roll. A little well-known fact for you: the average sister duo would share two sandwiches...but we above-average oinkers share three plus dessert.  All in all, the sandwiches-paninis-whatever you want to call them were very good, although the shrimp roll did not hold a candle to our mom's.  Our mother makes the BEST sandwiches in the world - her homemade chicken salad and shrimp sandwiches kick ass.
 
For dessert I got the turtle bar which my sister could only nibble at because it had nuts.  Whoops, I'm still getting used to the fact she's avoiding nuts.  Poor sister recently discovered she may be allergic to them and it's still under investigation. It's really sad. Like, really sad. Our family is like animal kingdom, when you tell a pig she can't eat something, the jungle cries.
 
All in all, I liked Olive et Gourmando; it may have been good-er if it wasn't so pricey. 

We finished off our plates and walked off the calories around Old Montreal. I want to go back to try the Apple turnover and egg on your face...but this time I will be sure not to be trop tard...

Olive et Gourmando is trendy and fashionable, but a little high maintenance, huh, sounds a little like me *wink*.",2011-08-31 14:57:06

I gave Cane's 4 stars for their service, cleaniness, and because they have the best fast food chicken tenders in Las Vegas.  Another reason for the 4 stars is because I can't find a Chick fil A around me. So, this place will have to do. 

What I've Tried:
-The Box:  4 Chicken Fingers, Texas Bread, and Fries:  Fries were dry and the chicken fingers were greasy.  Atleast the chicken fingers were real chicken breast cuts and cooked fresh.  The Texas Bread was actually the highlight.

-Chicken Sandwich:  Pretty good, but still with greasy chicken fingers.  This was basically the chicken fingers inside a bun.
  
-The Sauce:  Another highlight

Really wanted to love this place, especially since fellow yelpers and friends swear by them. All this place really did for me was crave Chick fil A even more.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken fingers were pretty good.  Just not good enough for me to give it 5 stars. 

My other issue is their menu.  Not much more than just a Chicken Sandwich and Chicken Fingers.  At least Chick fil A offers wraps and breakfast. Maybe this place has a special menu like IN-N-Out.  I suggest they create a Texas Bread Chicken Sandwich.  Now that would be good.",2012-10-17 03:21:57

Order took a lil while, which I expected ( a lil over/under 10 mins albeit the place was pretty much empty but I kept thinking they make it fresh ).  Anyways my order arrived and immediately I noticed the order did not looked right.  I know Louisiana rub and what I got was NOT Louisiana rub.  So I proceeded to tell the server to get it corrected, he agreed said he'd never seen Louisiana rub like that ( the rub was non existant, pretty much they gave me oily wings with pepper and some salt ).  He went to the kitchen, spoke to the cook came back a few mins later and to my surprise told me okay here you go.  I was like the same ones?  He then said yup the cook says that's how it looks.
    So I ended up unsatisfied.  Even my friend tried them,  said that does not taste like Louisiana rub.  In all a bad experience, the server tried, but the cook made it for a bad outing.

They have the different spices / sauces / other condiments that you can add in depending on your taste.  We had the medium bowls that were just the right portion.  You can also add more for an extra charge (we didn't).  Really enjoyed the Pho and the dumplings.

I've always wanted to try this place and despite my friends wanting to get ""salads"" and the title of the restaurant didn't really yell salads, I made them come here and I was extremely glad I did!

I learned several things that evening!

1. Order the Candlestick Maker. (Well, if you're a bourbon fan like me!) It has Makers 46, lemon, Thatcher's Spiced Apple, honey and angostura

2. Order the Old Fashioned. (They do it right here!)

3. Share the Penn Cove Mussels with a friend -  Spicy Salumi, Charred Tomato,   Grilled Bread

4. Enjoy the house soft pretzels with provolone fondue. - You may also want to share this one, but who knows, maybe you're extra hungry with those cocktails and want something to ""absorb"" the potency of those cocktails. 

We enjoyed ourselves so much here that we were there past when the kitchen closed. To my dismay, I didn't know that the kitchen closed at 9pm, and my husband, who was at home, wanted something to eat. When the waiter informed me the kitchen closed, I shamefully whined, ""Wait! I was supposed to bring home something for my husband! You can't let me go home empty handed. He'd be so angry with me."" The waiter then asked me if I knew what I wanted to order to go. I said, ""The short rib stew!"" He answered, ""Well let me see what we can do.."" He then proceeded to head to the kitchen. My anxiety reached all new heights as I awaited his response. It wasn't long before he returned and said, ""We still have some stew, which means, yes, you can still get it to go!"" I was so elated! I loudly exclaimed, ""You and the kitchen just made my night!!!"" I love how accommodating they were there! This is a great example of how great their service is!!

The decor is very IG-worthy with its palette of pastel colours, framed pictures of dolled up ice cream and the oh so selfie-worthy front display.  This front display consists of a pink road bike and a multicoloured platform for people to take photos with their desserts in front of the store.  Unfortunately, it was raining, so I didn't take a shot at the front display, but it's on my bucket list for the future. 

The prices here are very fair for being in a tourist area. You get soft serve dipped in chocolate for 3-5 dollars depending on the size you get. The sizes are very generous as well since I felt that my medium sized cone was almost akin to a large. Their ice cream flavours are limited, but they have a whole plethora of chocolate dips, including Ferrero Rocher chocolate, caramel chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, Oreo chocolate, dark chocolate, etc.  Even though the ice cream choices are limited their dips add a kick to the flavour.  This is because the chocolate dip hardens almost instantly, leaving you with a nice chocolate shell to bite into to get to the soft serve core.  

I got the hazelnut soft serve in medium with a peanut butter chocolate dip and my bf got the hazelnut soft serve in the smallest size with the Ferrero Rocher dip. Both were seriously bomb and were one of the best soft serves we've ever had. If I didn't have a lunch to go to, I would have grabbed a second cone! 

My bf also had a mochaccino and it had a deep coffee flavour that melded well with the  chocolate undertones.  He admits this was the best mochaccino he's ever had as it didn't feel artificial at all and had a good balance between the chocolate and coffee notes.

Our waiter gave us a great recommendation that turned us into AZ wine lovers. We started out sharing the deviled eggs, Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the sausage and grits. Flavors were really good. I could eat that sausage and grits for a meal, though it was just a tad too ""soupy"" this particular night. 

After filling up on wine and appies, my friend and I split the burger and the vegetable chop salad. This burger is exceptional! Chopped bacon flecks throughout the beef, perfectly medium, Caramelized onions, soft egg bun. Delicious! The chopped veg salad was the perfect, light counterpoint to that decadent burger. Our other friend had the short ribs, which she loved. It was a large serving; she couldn't finish it.

As if that weren't enough, we dove into dessert with enthusiasm. Not sure why but I wanted to try the pecan fig pie. I usually only have pie at the holidays but I was curious. Oh my! Yes, it was sweet, but not cloyingly so. The figs provided a nice, chewy twist.. But the best part was a bite of that pie with the accompanying cream cheese lemon zest ice cream. It's the perfect sweet/tart mouthful, you absolutely must try it!

Their prices are high for what it is. We split a single burger, double burger and fries for about $18.  

We had no problem finding a seat. The burger was super tasty. I understand the hype. It had a nice char/crust. Mine came without lettuce so I asked for some and they brought me a whole new burger and to keep the original. It was really no big deal. I was just looking for the green lettuce for some crunch.

What would be consider as Canadian National Food? According to Wikipedia: Poutine and Butter Tarts.

Does Bannock's menu reflect that theme? Certainly!

Roast Duck Poutine Pizza ($15)

I got to have a taste of:

Boneless Back Rib Burger ($15)

Mac n Cheese ($13)

Warm S'mores Pie ($8)
Sour Cream Donuts ($8)

This place is flat out a poor version of Chiptole. I thought I had written a review previously or it was deleted, but I came here a few times for work lunch without any major issues, however about 1/2 a year ago while they were making my burrito, I asked for more cheese. The manager or whoever had the audacity to tell me ""no that is all the cheese you get for a burrito"". I was rather shocked as chiptole you can ask for as much of any toppings as you want. That little ice cream scooper is maybe 1 oz of cheese. After that I vowed not go here again. Well I should have stuck to my guns as it is snowing outside and I wanted a burrito. I went in and all went well until we go to the cheese again. They again gave me a super small amount of cheese and I asked for more which meant one more scoop. I didn't even see but for that one scoop they charged me an extra 50 cents. No where on the menu do they indicate they will charge you more for the toppings on your burrito. Also for 50 cents I am not sure how much that works out to be in price per lb for the cheese you are serving... The steak was actually cold and very hard as well. The only plus is the fresh tortilla skin. With that I am making a vow not to come back. If you want to advertise yourself as making custom burritos, don't nickle and dime people. How much are you going to charge me if I ask for more corn salsa....

Pros: fast burrito service

Cons: Small burritos, 50 cents for a small scoop of cheese come on man!

Hidden deals:
None, be careful as they seem to upcharge you for everything. Queso on your burrito I can understand, but shredded cheese....

This isn't a place I frequent, I stopped in because it was near a few other stores I was shopping at that day, and quite frankly I just came in to check out their patio furniture.

The store is somewhat overwhelming, with a little bit of everything everywhere. They do their best to organize it, but it is still a bit of a mess. It reminds me of a dollar store, in that they have a lot of old food and prior season items.

Their patio furniture seemed reasonably priced, I didn't find anything I loved but it wasn't bad. I did end up buying some fig newtons because my boyfriend mentioned he wanted some the other day, and they happened to have them for $2.50 so how could I pass them up?

There was no line to check out, but the cashier I walked up to first said he was closed, so I had to walk to another register. No big deal, but you'd think they'd have a sign or something. When the second cashier rang up my purchase he never gave me a total, he just stared at me. A little odd, but oh well.

That being said, the statement is true for almost all places in Old Port. Maybe it was because I didn't come in on the weekend when they have an apparently delectable brunch, but nevertheless, it was still satisfactory.

I ordered the raspberry lemonade, the grilled cheese sandwich, and the chocolate banana brioche. First of all, I found the raspberry lemonade slightly disappointing, as it could have used a bit more sugar and more of a fruity flavor. It almost felt as if I was tasting the essence of raspberry rather than the actual fruit at times. The grilled cheese sandwich was a cheesy, gooey, and toasty delight which I loved. The combination of Gouda and raclette cheeses worked extremely well and tasted rich and delicate at the same time, and the caramelized onions added a nice touch of sweetness. I'm not exactly sure if it was worth $12, though.

The chocolate banana brioche was definitely the highlight of the meal. It was so moist and, being a sucker for banana bread, I loved how you could see banana chunks actually baked into the bread. I appreciated that the chocolate part of the filling was more along the lines of dark chocolate, as it highlighted the banana flavoring while being deliciously cacao-y in its own right.

I paid about $27 (ish) for my meal in total including tips I believe. Was it completely worth it? Not exactly, in my opinion. But I'll be sure to come back sometime for brunch because their options look tantalizing and appealing to my tastes by the looks of it.",2017-03-29 20:34:56

I was disappointed that they wouldn't upgrade me despite an email from HH offering said upgrades. 

** I did read all the reviews for this place... and thankfully did not experience those horrors. The management was still being transferred from PH to Elara so there were a few small hiccups at the front desk, but nothing major**

What's to like: 
x SUPER location - center Strip, attached to PH, close to all the action
x attached self parking structure makes for ease of moving your luggage around
x AWESOME ceiling to floor and wall to wall views of the Strip 
x freebie wi-fi if you're a HH member
x chic decor -- big plushy bed with glam headboard
x separate shower and toilet area
x very convenient pool area close to lobby
x attached to miracle mile shops
x good follow-up service
x express check out
x little kitchenette area (no stove though)
x jacuzzi tub *though, I don't use 'em... don't trust if they are clean*
x large TV
x lovely sofa/chaise that overlooks view of the Strip... very relaxing!!

What's just OK:
x limited toiletries -- no shower cap and the soaps, lotion, shampoo are not good quality -- suggest bringing your own

I love kimchi, and I love corn tortillas, so kimchi tacos seemed like a guaranteed culinary nirvana. Mix it up with tofu, and I was convinced someone had been listening to my prayers.

Alas, the kimchi tofu egg taco at Hanshik was a disappointment. I only had one taco, so I am giving them 3 stars as a benefit of the doubt. Sadly, the solo taco experience will probably prevent me from returning unless I hear of a tofu rework. 

What were the shortcomings of the taco? Well, there were primarily three:
1. The tortilla was not corn. It was a big, fat flour one. Props for providing generous tacos, but the flour tortilla was not warm and yummy. Perhaps corn does not go well with tofu? If not, then, I think a thinner, warmer perhaps even smaller flour tortilla would make a more delightful taco.
2. The kimchi was not kimpressive. It reminded me more of sauerkraut. Yes, the cabbage was fresh, but the seasoning was heavy on the sourness without the balance of the chili spice.
3. The tofu and egg mixture was not seasoned well, and thus, pretty much tasted like plain scrambled eggs. 

All of this combined for a taco that I think could use some improvement. As always, mad props for an inventive and passionate entrepreneur. Service was definitely nice and enthusiastic.

And by ""been here"" I mean made it through the door and managed to stay for about 1 minute before we were met with the delightful attitude of the owner. I've never made it more than 3 or 4 feet into this cramped and overpriced store. 

The first time we came in after grabbing some coffee from Dutch Bros next door. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly ""NO DRINKS ALLOWED!"" Since we obviously look like the spilling of drinks type, we moved along and did not return for about a year. I guess a simple ""can you please leave your drinks in your car"" or some other friendly solution was inconceivable! 

Recently, we reluctantly decided to give the store another shot since were out & about looking for mid-century treasures. This time we even left our coffee in the car, since we didn't want to be accosted by the owner. We entered. My husband saw something and asked the owner a question about it. The owner opened his mouth & gave him a snide remark. That's when we remembered how awful this man is.

This was probably due to the fact that Home Depot accepted a return from a customer that used or ABUSED this dolly. Either reject this person from making the return OR take your losses and demote this thing to be used on the floor. Do NOT try to resell it as NEW?!?

Getting in didn't take long and security was friendly. The outdoor patio had open seating (such a rarity) so we got a whole big booth to ourselves. Oddly enough, for a club called Rok, it played almost all hip hop. That worked okay for us and we danced for hours.

Honestly the only reason we decided to come was because it was the only place open at 11 am on a Sunday in the area.  Popped my friends Shake Shack cherry!  Right now their featured shake is cookies and cream. But there's more! You have it either chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.  I had to go with the strawberry cookies and cream shake just because I was told it tasted like strawberry cheesecake.  It did not disappoint! It was even topped with vanilla Oreo crumbles. My only compliant about the shakes there is that I would like to be able to order it when I order my meal and then come back to the counter after I eat my meal and pick it up (like they do at Freddys) by the time I finished my meal and moved onto the shake, it was already melted and warm. 
On to the food! I had the shack burger with fries and added onion. Friend had the smoked shack burger.  He really enjoyed his but we both agreed it wasn't worth the cost.  The patty was thin and over cooked. Nothing juicy about it.  I'm not a fan of their fries either. Thick Crinkle cut fries just don't hit the spot.

I had lower expectations than my brother and sister-in-law as they just came back from Macau. In terms of it being compare to the one in Macau which I last had two years ago, it's not really your traditional Portuguese egg tart. It was more like a custard tart...what I mean by that is that the custard kinda bleeds out...almost like a chocolate souffle kind of dessert when it's suppose to be more set. It tasted okay, I think honestly the most disappointing part about it was that it just wasn't hot at all. Anything that is luke warm to me is the worst...bc it shows that your intention is to have it hot but whatever reason it isn't. We are all in agree that if I was at the outlet, I would get one. If I'm not gonna go to the outlet, I wouldn't drive all the way there just to get it.

THE GOOD:
+ customer service
+ quality ingredients
+ good portions
+ affordable prices
+ lots of vegan and vegetarian options 
+ the food

THE BAD:
- There is no bad. Please revert back to the first line of the review. 

Joking aside, this place is really, really good. If you want something light (as in smaller, not healthier), I recommend getting the Croissant and Egg. The croissants are always perfectly flaky, rich, and buttery.

If you want to try the quiche, get the Veggie Quiche. Ask anyone who works here, and they almost always prefer the veggie.

If you want to try a sandwich, get the Pesto with eggplant. Delicious sun dried tomato walnut pesto, avocado, mozzarella, and eggplant on their fantastically crusty baguette.

If you want something sweet, get the Chocolate Twist. 

And lastly, grab a cup of soup as a side, because they're always good (and almost always vegan or vegetarian!) You can even ask to Pick Two.

Overall, definitely recommend this place! ~",2017-04-10 22:12:07

Therefore, this breakfast joint is middle of the road. When a friend first mentioned heading here for lunch, I was curious, and after reading reviews. I was scared. But I trust said friend, and allowed myself to be led in blindly to another Two Hippies joint. 

Here are items that were factored into this 3-star rating:

** First and foremost, I didn't love it, but I most certainly didn't hate it either. If someone wanted to go back, I would agree. There are a few more things on the menu that intrigue me enough to want to try them.

** I didn't like the decor as much as their pizza joint. It was too much on the stoner side of hippie.. to a nauseating degree. Then there was this random old stove that didn't scream hippie at all. I personally prefer happy hippie. Oooh now there's an awesome alliteration. And another. BAM!

** The green chile burger I got was pretty damn good. I wish the heat was kicked up a few notches, but it was solid. I was so pleased I nearly swallowed that thing whole.

** They have the lemonade I love. I tried mango this time. Not as good as blood orange, but still solid.

** I did not find the breakfast menu so appealing I wanted it instead of lunch. This was a disappointment. I also heard they don't serve breakfast all day, though one of the people I was dining with did get breakfast. I think we were there around 1pm if I remember correctly.

** The fries were terrible. I love crinkle fries but these were so dry I was unable to enjoy them. Fries aren't supposed to be healthy. Give me the grease. Even adding sauce to them (I tried sriracha) did no good. I will never have fries there again.",2011-05-02 18:53:28

*Tip: call and book an appointment 

I arrived a few minutes early and filled out a short form (including a waiver) as it was my first time. 

The esthetician was ready for me and took me into a clean room and showed me where I could put my belongings as well as where other things were in the room e.g. A small towel. She also asked what areas I needed waxed. She provided instructions and then left while I got ready and came back a few mins later. 

I can't remember her name as it was very unique and started with the letter M. She kept up a nice cheery banter most likely to distract me from any pain. 
She was good about not making me feel self-conscious as she was very nonchalant and kept on chatting. She was quick and let me know how many more strips she would be using. It was quite quick thankfully! I won't say it was pain free but it was as painless as could be expected for having your hair ripped out using hot wax. Ha! 

Before she left the room she gave me instructions for 2-days post waxing (loofah/exfoliate!) which was helpful. 
And pointed me in the direction of the complementary wax removal spray, body lotion and wipes which I appreciated. 

I didn't feel rushed as they have many rooms and it took me a while to get all my outdoor winter layers on. But she just took the next client in the room next door. 

The receptionist was pleasant and knew what service I had. They accept all types of payment except Amex.

My brother had a few beermosas with an IPA. He compared it to Blue Moon with an orange... but better. I had a few basic Mimosas (although they offered a few different varieties) and tasted a few beers. I also, tried one of their hot dogz with jalapenos and cheese. It was really great! They had a nice selection of craft beers and even offered some options for brunch (besides dogz). So you could totally eat there for breakfast.

The egg rolls were really oily, the har gao had an odd flavor to the shrimp, and the shu mai didn't taste meaty (more fatty). The Baked BBQ pork buns were good though. The worst dish I had was the chow mein. It was severely overlooked and had no ""dragon breath"" flavor to it. If it were only the dishes I might have just given them an update of 2 stars but their customer service was horrendous.

All the person at the door directing people to tables said was WAIT A MINUTE in a very unapologetic and rude tone. When we were finally seated we waited a very long time before we even got our water.

The food came out in a short time.  While I was waiting, I went to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of their spicy Salsa.  The first item I ate was the Steak Street Taco....the meat was dry and Guacamole was bland.  I poured a lot of the Salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture.  Very disappointing.

Next, I had the Burrito.  That was dry too!  Even with the Sour Cream in the Burrito, it was dry...the Steak, Rice, Beans...all was dry.  Needless to say, I used a heavy dose of Salso on that as well.  To make it worse, the Chips that came with the Burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale...so they were chewy...that means they combined new, fresh Chips with a batch of old ones....bummer.

One positive thing is that the service here was outstanding.  The cashier was very friendly and had a nice, welcoming smile.  I also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine....the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one.

 Yes, you can get addicted to ramen, and I'm talking about the real thing, trying to resuscitate dead noodles by adding hot water to it doesn't work for me anymore.

I think it was a smart idea by Rick Moonen to change the upstairs of RM Seafood to this.  It's a really cool space with interesting furniture and displays.  I have no idea what steampunk is though.  I can only imagine Joey Ramone in a sauna.  

We chose to sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders and get their opinions on drinks etc.  It was also a treat to see them make some of these concoctions.  I know quite a few Yelpers that love the whiskey and this should be a spot to check out.  I will definitely try the smoked whiskey next time.  Check out some of the other people's pics.  

My wife wasn't into any of the specialty cocktails and opted for the appletini (ha fn ha).  But they used actual apple instead of that Pucker BS so it tasted as legit as an appletini could.  I went with some long titled cocktail called ""Mario Warped the something something"" which featured egg white, tequila and thyme.  It tasted like a margarita made by a mad scientist.  I also had a bottle of an Austrian lemon beer I'd never had before which was super refreshing.  

The chicken liver pate was just OK.  One of the bartenders tried to build up the fact that the pate was ""like in this totally cool jar"".  That'd be interesting if Thomas Keller hadn't already been doing that up the street at Bouchon since they opened.  I prefer duck liver pate any day of the week.  I'd skip this.  

Interesting idea with the inside out French onion grilled cheese but I feel like it totally missed the mark on both ends.  I'd rather have an excellent grilled cheese sandwich or a robust and cheesy French onion soup than this combo.  This is a skip too.

We both really liked the Lamb Osso Bucco Greek style.  Two gloriously tender shanks of lamb with orzo on the bottom that was swimming in the lamb juice.  Anthony M's picture of it is way better than mine.

Shockingly the best thing we had was dessert.  2 of the bartenders kept raving and raving about the green tea panna cotta with pineapple and macadamia nut cookie. It was definitely all that.

When we arrived at Buca, we were blown away by the beautiful space: high ceilings, brick walls, cozy lighting, open kitchen...it was all stunning. It's also tucked away in a back alley, making you really feel like you're walking into a hidden gem. 

Truth is, in many ways it is. The space is lovely, the wine list extensive, and the food creative. The only problem is, I didn't really find the food to be that wowing. And, even after communicating our food restrictions, we were still served meat - not once, but twice.

We let our waitress know early on that we're vegetarian as the menu was quite meat-heavy and we wanted to be sure we wouldn't inadvertently eat meat. We started by ordering three cheeses and the selection of fresh baked breads. Much to our surprise, one of the loaves had little pork pieces in the bread. It wasn't until we asked our server what the little pink stuff was that she said it was pork. She quickly realized her error and apologized, but didn't even offer to take away the breads and bring us a new basket. Instead, we had to push the meat-stuffed buns off to the side and continue eating the non-meat ones. I was quite surprised that she wouldn't think to bring fresh buns that weren't mingling with the pork-based buns - not very accommodating to a vegetarian, or pork-free crowd.

Trying to remain excited about our meal, we shrugged off the first problem and ventured on. We then asked our server for her suggestions for mains. I was shocked when she suggested a main that had beef in it...like, hello, did we not just have the whole no-meat discussion?! Anyway, we continued on and ordered a squid-ink pizza with calamari on it (ok, ok, we admit, we are  occasional pescatarians), an order of gnocci - asking that they hold the meat (which she told us was possible), a salad (sorry I cant recall which one), and an order of the spaghetti pomodoro. 

What do you know, but our mains come out and the gnocci has meat in it. Suffice to say, we were at this point quite fed up. We quickly let our waitress know the mistake, she again apologized, and we were at least this time given a fresh plate of gnocci. By this point, we had lost all trust in the competence of the staff at Buca to not inadvertently serve us some meat. It put a bad taste in our mouths (literally) and made the rest of the meal and bit uncomfortable. 

We stayed for dessert and coffee, paid our bill and left. The company was lovely, the space amazing, but the food -- not really worth it. I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan of Buca and I likely won't come back, certainly not for the food.",2015-04-19 20:56:09

I have a love/hate relationship with their craft beer selection.  I love it because it's a nicely curated selection and there's always something I want to try.  I hate it because the beer I want is often kicked.  In fact, I once went to Harris only to find they had ZERO draft beers available that weekend night.  Zero.

Boo that.",2014-01-03 21:38:39

I went to King's Kitchen last night for dinner and something has definitely changed about this place. For starters it took forever for our server to bring us water and bread and when the bread did come out it was very cold and hard. Secondly I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and it seemed to take 20 minutes or more for the food to come out when it did the portion was so small that I asked the server if this was an appetizer for $22.00 I feel like I got totally ripped off the dish tasted good but the portion was not a normal size for an entree also to top it all off the server took what was supposed to be a 45.00 bill and ran 79.00 through on my card! They corrected the issue but it was a hassle to say the least This place needs to step their game up or they will go out of business..,2015-10-11 01:51:11

We had a table of 10 good friends enjoying different brews before deciding on our meal strategy. Before we could dabble into the Raw Bar we were greeted with two pretzel and cheese dishes. Apparently the secret was out that this was a birthday. So we carried on enjoying the pretzel and cheese and ordering oysters, shrimp and mussels. All which were tasty. The shrimp are enormous, the oysters about average and their Jalapeño Mignonette sauce was something that stood out for me. I could almost drink it, but I've got a thing for spice. 

I decided to stick with the seafood theme and I ordered the New Zealand Sea Bass for dinner and it was tasty. Living in Florida the past 3 years has spoiled me with seafood compared to Arizona. With that said the price of the seafood was a little steep but the quality was there.

Everyone ordered something different and I tried a bite of each one... All were good. We also tried one of every dessert.... All were good!

I believe this is one of those places that you can't go wrong with. I will come back and thanks Arrogant Butcher for showing my group a good time.",2014-10-15 01:51:12

Great list of choices for what you liked. And they are perfect size. Not too small and not too big. Last time i was at Nami they cost $5. But ive been told the price went up a little.  Ive looked and i cannot find any place here in Portland similar to Nami. I even got my meat eating, cow dairy loving friends hooked on the Tsoynami's. They would all finish the whole Tsoynami. Nothing left in the cup. (Lol) thats how darn good they are. And some times would go for a second one.  Great average sized seating area inside and patio seating out front or in the back.

The waitress was very nice. It went all downhill from there. 

I had an Egg, Cheese, Bacon Sandwich, on a bagel.
Terrible, no other way to describe it. Egg was omelette style, thin, cold and cheese was not melted. Bacon was dry, burnt, pieces that had been sitting around for a while. Half the bagel was slightly toasted/grilled, but the other half was not? The Bagel was obviously a very cheap, frozen grocery store brand. Worst breakfast sandwich I've ever had, McDonalds probably has better. 

My wife's 2 eggs over-medium were fine. The ""Homemade"" Biscuit. I asked if it was Homemade to be sure. Well a picture is worth a thousand words.  Burnt on top . Hard on the bottom. Disgusting inedible. You have to be a real lazy, uncaring staff to serve that, both the Cook (Just  got out of prison, crackhead looking dude)  and the waitress (brunette) who brought it over.  If that was homemade, burn down your home and slap your mama for even feeding you that Garbage. 

Both of us had Homefries. Just cut up symmetric cubes of potatoes (so uniformly cut they had to be frozen also) deep fried and very crisp. Lazy, unappetizing, calorie-laden way to make breakfast potatoes but that seems to sum up the whole place. Lazy. 

No one asked us how our food was. Never saw someone who resembled a Manager. When we went to the cashier, she yawned at me a few times and didn't ask either, she was very sleepy, I felt bad bothering her. 

The whole thing reminded me of the beginning of an episode of Ramseys Kitchen Nightmares. 

Spend a few extra bucks, go to Toast down the road or Stacks in Waxhaw. The 5 star reviews below, I suspect they are friends/staff/fake because the Owners of this place obviously haven't a clue.",2017-03-18 22:52:25

Came here for AYCE.  They have a good list of items, and one of the best things about this place is they offer half orders (for most sushi rolls).

I noticed alot of their items are similar to the items that are in Sumo Sushi or Jjanga.  They also have some korean food, and I'm curious if they are affiliated with Hwaro....only because the first time I tried ""the Shit"" was in Hwaro, and they offer than same ""the Shit"" here in Sakana.  

They have every time of fish, including my favorites that cannot be found in all places: super white tuna, salmon belly, and yellowtail belly.  They are very generous with their portions to.  I like that they put some kind of sauce in their nigiris so it doesn't taste too plain.  

They rolls were good.  I got the Something Wrong roll, which has the fried soft shell crab on the inside, and two pieces of fish on the outside with garlic ponzu sauce.  One of my favorites.  Also tried some of their spicy rolls, and yes they were spicy!  

Also on of my favorites about this place is the desserts.  Most AYCE only offer one thing of dessert, but you can order some of the dessert items more than once (except ice cream).  

Being in an older location (and maybe it was wrong for me to judge a restroom based on this), the restroom is very clean.  There's a floor lamp and Hello Kitty painted on the back of the women's restrooms.

It was pretty busy, which we took initially as a good sign.  We got seated at one of two tables off of the main, sunny dining room, next to the rest rooms and the bar.  We were the only customers in the room, which wasn't so much fun.  We saw a friend, who warned us not to order the espresso.  Two of us ordered the drip coffee, which was fine, but we had to keep asking for more refills and cream.  D ordered the iced tea, which made her make a horrible face.  She sent it back to the kitchen.  G and I split the biscuits and gravy and the pumpking pie pancakes with ""whip"" cream.  We all agreed they lose a star for that grammatical error.  D got the banana pecan French toast which looked amazing, and a side of potatoes.  I tasted her potatoes; they were ok.  But, if you're going to set up shop across the street from Matt's, your potatoes should probably ROCK.

I had no complaints with either of my choices.  The sausage, which D said is house-made, was very tasty.  The pancakes were yummy, too.  Our table, however, was not big enough to hold all of our food comfortable, and it wobbled like heck.  We had to stick a folded sugar packet under it to keep it steady.

Service was ok, but the food was a little slow to our table.  I'll go one more time before I write this place off completely, but I cannot say the same for my friends.",2012-08-19 23:13:22

We sampled a few flavors and thought the pineapple tasted funny. Something like rotten milk  (no I'm not exaggerating). So we didn't go with that one. And we didn't sample everything obviously. 

We went with the new york cheesecake flavor and hoped it was good. It however tasted the same. Like a bad rotten milk flavor. Not great. We got half mint and half NY cheesecake and they both tasted like this. So thats 3x that this had a weird taste to it. Not good.

Prior to this, we asked the lady what the most popular flavor was, and literally rolled her eyes and told us cake batter which such a blunt tone.

I do not want to give an unfavorable review after only one visit. Truthfully, I cannot even recall what I ate. I just remember that no one at the table was thrilled with their food. We walked away full but the food was totally forgettable. The first visit was at night, the place was bustling. We had good service despite the crowd.

A few days ago I visited Gates and Brovi at lunch time. It was a business meeting of sorts but my friend and I agreed that we would not bring our paperwork into the restaurant as not to ""hog"" a table during the busy lunch hour. It turned out we had nothing to worry about. We were at the restaurant for a couple of hours and there were many tables available during our stay.

I had the shrimp salad sandwich and my friend had the eggplant sandwich. I thought the dressing on the shrimp was extremely thin and tasteless. The shrimp were small and probably had been frozen. The bread became soggy and there was  a sad little lettuce leaf for some desperately needed crunch. I ate the sandwich with a fork.

The eggplant sandwich looked very appealing. It was a pretty plate of food. However, my friend stated that the sandwich was terribly under-spiced and just bland in general. 

So, I do not plan to return until I hear that changes have been made. The menu is very small and not many of the items drew my attention. I cannot believe that the restaurant is run by the same folks who own Sardine and Marigold. Both restaurants have consistently excellent food and a great vibe to go with it. I still hold out hope for Gates and Brovi for the future. ( I wish they would change the name).",2013-08-08 23:09:10
1PhhIiZPyRvsCrwkVikEgA,XuCbLgo9j1q5dDh9251vkg,k1q6ArrSV2Z_Yodwu4epVg,3,4,0,1,"Lazar is a spacious and clean bakery and deli with a sit down area that was surprisingly busy with people enjoying pastries, donuts and coffee at 9:30 am on a Friday.  I guess nobody is in a rush to get to work on a snowy Friday... well, neither was I :)

First things first, a quick summary: I tried an apple struddle. I'm a bit underwhelmed with the struddle, it wasn't as flaky as I like and is more expensive than other bakeries in the area, but it wasn't bad per se. The prices for pastries in general are a bit high, but they have a large selection of breads, pastries and desserts. The pastries and breads are fresh though, and the amount of people in here makes me think that the overall quality of food must be good so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

A bit more in depth:
I came in the back entrance, and the first thing I saw was the large selection of breads they had.  Raisin, corn, Caldense, Rye, Multigrain, they had a ton of selection of loafs and all were about $3.   They had a smaller selection of buns/rolls and a handful of bagels for $0.50 each. 

They also had a fairly large selection of pastries, croissants (plan, chocolate, almond), apple & cherry turnovers, struddles, donuts, churrios, assortment of tarts and other flaky pastries. These were all $2, which is more expensive than the other bakeries in the area (normally $1.25-$1.50 each).  I picked up an apple struddle and I'm sorry to say I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't particularly good. It wasn't too crisp and as flaky as I like my pastries, it was rather a bit softer. 

They also had a number of desserts (see my pics), cakes and tarts, cannoli ($2 for a large, I think $1.25 for a small).

The cheese and deli section was large, and I imagine this place has a lot of customers during lunch. 

Also a display of cakes which liked really good, each cake was about $30 I believe. 

All in all, if I'm looking for a pastry, of the bakeries I've tried in this area I'd prefer Nova Bakery which is about 5 minutes away: I had a better experience with their apple turnover and they have cheaper prices, but I'll have to go back to both shops for a more in depth comparison.  Lazar does have a bigger selection than Nova though.",2011-02-25 15:51:51

Patria is a chic upscale tapas restaurant located on King Street West in Toronto. Great atmosphere. Attentive service. A tad on the pricey but justified by the quality of the food.

While all of the tapas were delicious, there were a few standouts. To start, I would recommend the Pulpo A La Gallegos, featuring Spanish octopus. It was prepared with the octopus sitting on fingerling potatoes. The brussels sprouts with spicy tomatoes, aioli and chorizo was also delicious.

I would also recommend the paella - which is a house specialty.  The paella is served in the traditional way, in a wide, two-handled pan, with a thin layer of bomba rice that tastes like super-concentrated seafood and is just perceptibly caramelized and crunchy wherever it touched the pan. The cuttlefish and langoustines on top taste silky and almost creamy.

I feel like many places are expensive just to be expensive, most notably the extremely overpriced day spa/hair styling/massage/pedicure/manicure/jewelry line selling monstrosities around the valley. 

After having a sub par experience at one of those places I decided to give Ulta a try. They were running their holiday deal. A cut and accent highlights for $50! Super cheap!

Lacey Jo did my cut and color, during the morning of Christmas Eve. I felt like she understood exactly what I wanted and didn't need too much guidance. I got a graduated bob that I wanted very short in the back. The last place I went to, the stylist pushed me against going super short in the back saying something about it not working well with my hair type. I found that to be odd considering I had it done before and it worked well. 

Thankfully Lacey Jo didn't say any such garbage and cut it how I wanted, which was fabulous! She massaged my scalp for what seemed like 15 minutes when she washed it (heaven) and was very nice and personable throughout the experience. 

The great thing is, it's only $40 for a cut and $50 for the accent highlights normally which is WAY cheaper than so many other places out there. I was so thrilled with my service here that I booked out my next appointment upon leaving, something I never do.",2011-01-17 03:29:03

Overall, the Duck is clean, unpretentious and a worth-while stop on any Ohio City bar crawl.  You'll sit next to some local Duck Island residents, overflow from Velvet Tango, or possibly a bike courier or two, but everyone has welcomed us in with open arms.

I admit: I have a bias towards locally owned boutiques simply because I want to see more of them do well in Vegas. Ultimately, it leads to better gifts for everyone! Despite the somewhat disconcerting name (because who really wants to self-label as a hipster?), I have visited R+D on two occasions. On the first occasion, I thought things were a tad overpriced, but the selection was interesting, very LA. I was store neutral.

Most recently, I have been on a quest fo shimmery TOMS. I don't own a pair and quite honestly, had thought them pretty darn ugly. However, when in need of a flat to wear with socks, I decided they were a good option, especially when they shine! When I noticed a sign in the Boca Park lot announcing R+D carried TOMS, my husband coaxed me into perusing their selection. 

Their selection of TOMS is huge! They have a variety of colors and styles for children, women and men. They even had a limited edition metallic style that I had not seen anywhere, and after being told they didn't have my size, the owner stepped up to try to help find a replacement. She had them run an inventory of everything in my size, and voila: it indicated they did indeed have one pair of the shoe I coveted in my size! The owner went in the back and found the elusive pair, and I left the store elated with my discovery and purchase. 

In additional to clothes and TOMS shoes, they also have jewelry, some cute gift possibilities for your trendy pals and even their kids, other shoes, TOMS sunglasses and some items from local artisans. If it hadn't been for the owner, I don't think the aloof staff would have found my shoes, but the owner was helpful and knowledgeable. Overall, this trip was store positive!",2012-05-07 17:57:40

Our server, Anthony knew the menu well and made good suggestions. I came in specifically for the Noca (I think that's right...lol) torta. I follow Otro on Instagram and someone posted a pic of that sammich, I literally told my wife to make a Uturn and head to Otro for that one - carne asada (ribeye) with guac on the bun and two fried eggs (I had over medium, perfect temp for a sammich). It was loaded with flavor, I would definitely reccomend that torta! Or, they will make it for you as a burrito also. Delicious! Sorry about not taking a photo of it! There is one on their Instagram page...lol.

My wife had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, avocado and of course, hollandaise sauce....lots of hollandaise...lol. She likes it saucy, like her. I had a taste of course and it was savory and delicious! She enjoyed it very much, she is a eggs benedict addict. 

Our little girl had a kid's quesadilla with Oxaca cheese and some crispy fried potatoes. She ate every bite and ate some of ours! I guess she likes it.

I wouldn't initially think hot avocado as something I would like but it works really well in this dish.  I love that they give you a lot of sauce to because I like soaking the sauce up with the rice.

What I'm left with, more than anything, is that this place is fucking HOT in the summer.  Is there anyway the people who run The Underground could hook up a portable AC or something?  It was a relief to hit the 104 degree street after each band was done.

Aside from that the venue is just small enough to be intimate and large enough to hold a decent crowd.  It's enough of a dive to retain street cred but (somehow) established enough to host larger bands who still marginally exist below the mainstream radars.

They sell water, soda, snacks and earplugs.

Owned by Tiffany Jones and inspired by a childhood of baking intended to please her own personal tastes with skills honed at California Culinary Academy and some of the best properties on the Strip, it was largely a matter of location that had kept me from revisiting Peridot Sweets for so long but a recent encounter with Mrs. Jones over pizza proved plenty an impetus to point the GPS south, the young lady's work having reached new degrees of refinement with cookies, cakes, and confections all trumping any West-side bakeshop, several selections proving the best in the Valley as a whole. 

Carefully trending 'cutesy' without going all-in like Wonderland or other commercial outfits throughout the (702,) Peridot Sweets features a small cooler-case up front alongside a couch and cafe with the prep kitchen tucked away in back, and greeted by Tiffany on entry the entirety of an order consisted of nine items, another eight sampled the previous week with not a single one failing to set high standards for texture as well as taste.

Assured in her skill-set with recipes based on education, experience, as well as good ol' trial and error the inspiration behind Peridot Sweets came from the owner's desire to leave behind Las Vegas Boulevard's long hours in order to start a family, and with much of the business based on elegant event cakes those looking to experience the shop's signature bites are strongly encouraged to begin with any of the scratch-baked cupcakes, the cocoa-laden red velvet far less dainty than the majority while both a banana-caramel composition and maple stuffed with bacon prove even more robust.

Having admittedly perused the website in order to make a few requests it was in two stacked cakes that taste buds were additionally invested and as much as the carrot cake sang with savory notes and spice beneath the lightest of cream cheese frostings it was the ""Banana Brigade"" that proved the very best of Peridot's creations, the same supple banana bread as that from the cupcake given a baba au rhum treatment with cream cheese frosting and caramelized bananas adding levity, though certainly not enough to render the booze mute or particularly 'kid friendly.'

Stating that cheesecakes were another item she loved to create, suffice it to say that Tiffany's silky smooth version trends far closer to her ethereal cream cheese frosting than any heavy New York slice, and whether topped with fresh berries or a thick lacquer of chocolate and caramel the results are equally enthralling, a buttery rich crust more than capable of standing up to the moisture both here and in the case of a tangy lemon petit four sampled just one week prior.

Also offering cookies, bars, brownies, and fanciful macarons in a variety of flavors that change with the the Chef and her team's whims, one would be hard pressed to find fault in anything except perhaps the confusing colors, both the 'cookies and cream' and 'salty caramel' oddly tinged in blue while creamsicle trended more appropriate, the tastes absolutely spot on with textures improved by room-temperature serving, the ""7-Layer Bar"" an entirely sinful amalgam of sweetness reined in by coconut while both the Mexican Wedding cookie reminisced of the Russian Tea Balls of Christmas during childhood.

Easily overlooked or dismissed as a 'cake bakery' in a city where Freed's has far too long held sovereignty Peridot Sweets is putting on a mighty fine showing in the West Side of the Valley, what it lacks in quantity more than compensated for by an investment in quality.",2015-09-02 14:18:00

Just around the corner from the set of escalators on the casino floor or the elevators. The menu is displayed outside so you can decide if you really want to eat there or not. I walked up to the hostess table & asked if they do take-out. They said yes but they'd still have to seat me at a table & I would have to order from one of the waiters still. Thought that was weird but I was hungry & agreed.

 I was seated at the nearest table to the host. The waiter in that section seemed quite busy. I remember distinctly him telling a party that was seated after me that he'd be right with them but there were 2 parties ahead of them. I was hoping he implied I was one of those parties because at that moment he still had not acknowledged me. He was taking down the orders of a table close by to where I was sitting. In the meantime a busboy and a female waitress had asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. At least they were on their game. The waiter came to take my order after about 5 mins of me waiting. Cant really say he made eye contact with me. Cant remember. He seem hurried but I was ordering one thing & I knew what it was. I wanted breakfast. 2 eggs scrambled, 2 bacon strips, hash browns & sourdough toast. I had to repeat my order to him. He must not have been paying attention when I clearly stated what I wanted the first time. SMH... Food came in a plastic bag ready to go about 7-10 minutes later and was given to me by the busser. Not too long of a wait. I still left a tip... It was for the busboy and waitress that had smiles and actually asked me if I needed anything. I understand I was only a take-out customer but i deserve the same level of acknowledgement and customer service as any dine-in patron. That's my 2 cents and I feel strongly about it.

Food wasnt bad. Hash browns were crispy on the outside and tasty. I added a little bit of salt. Scrambled eggs were standard. Bacon was smoky & crispy. Sourdough bread was buttered and plenty of Smucker's jam (grape & strawberry) were packed along with utensils & salt packets.

The restaurant is located in a tiny little plaza where there is limited parking.

I ended up further away at a pizza pizza by the next traffic light which was a short walk over but come on! I want to park where Im eating people!!

Although the restuarant is basically at full capacity - the staff are quick to get the ball rolling.  I would suggest if you are not asian (like myself) that you have an asian friend or crowd with you - the 'specials' are basically in chinese so if you want the english menu you're probably getting riped off. 

I had 9 people in my party and we ordered from the special chinese menu.
We had 6 dishes plus 2 desserts.  The bill came to roughly $112 which ended up being $15/person. 
The food came quickly and hot.  In all we had - 2 dishes with duck, pineapple chicken, soup broth, BBQ ribs, lobster, fried porkchop, seseme sessert (like black soup lol) and the tofu looking soup with sweet syrup. 
I was pretty stuffed and there was plenty of food to go around.

And you pay at the register by the front door, not at the table.  That makes it easy to split the check with a group.  They just remodeled the inside and got rid of the booths that were falling apart.  Nice, new, dark wood tables that make the place look clean and organized.

Boba places have been popping up in Henderson every now and then. Some are trendy and some really need to work on their menu. 

Sweetea stands out to me because their menu is a little different. They had flavors that seem to be ""different"" with drinks such as Hokkaido, red bean,and sea salt flavor. I only had a handful of flavors but have enjoyed all of them.

Boba balls are always cooked right ( doesn't get stuck in straw when cooled).Drinks are always well blended. All the employees are nice and will customize a drink for you. 

I give them a 5 star but only wish they had one of those sealers for the drinks instead of topping of the cups with a lid. ( easier to shake the boba around )I know those sealers probably cost a lot so hopefully they invest in one eventually.",2018-04-17 18:40:31

So we treated it as a late night snack, rather than dinner. When we arrived the hostess said we could only have 6 people at a table. She didn't know why someone would have made a reservation for 7, so they weren't very thrilled. Luckily, after a short wait, they seated us all in an upstairs booth, with a chair on the end. It was honestly nice for them to still accommodate us, since that's not restaurant protocol. 

Side note: I'm not sure why the earliest reservation was 11pm, since the upstairs was totally empty. So that was a little annoying to know we could have been there much earlier and actually had a nice dinner. Clearly whoever made the reservation didn't know what they were doing.

They had a DJ playing (also upstairs) and it was so loud! We couldn't really talk to each other and our waiter (who was awesome) couldn't hear our orders very well. It was so dark that we used our flashlight apps to read the menu, more of a joke, than a necessity, but it still made it 1000x easier. I loved the way the menu was presented, on newspaper paper. Despite how loud it was, I loved the dark vibe. The decor is so cool, octopus theme, low red lighting, and so unique to Pittsburgh. Another place that made me feel like I was in some real-life TrueBlood scene, if only you replaced the vampires on the show with octopus. 

When it came to the food, I ordered the Baja fish tacos to share and a Pineapple Jalapeno Margarita. Also we shared an order of guacamole.

Located just 30 minutes outside of Las Vegas, this place is a must for those who want to get away from the light and noise of the city. You don't have to be a hardcore hiker or rock climber to enjoy a variety of trails here at Red Rock Canyon. There are 19 trails, ranging from easy to strenuous. Some are as short as a quick 55 min hike while others can be as long as 3.5 hours.

We did the Lost Creek hike, which was relatively easy (I'm far from a pro hiker). Only took about an hour and was able to do it in my regular sneakers. At the end of the trail, we were rewarded by a mini waterfall. Part of the trail was shaded by trees, bushes, and rocks, so we weren't in the sun the entire time. As we were hiking, we probably ran into 5 groups so the trail was not crowded at all.

In order to reach the trail (as well as a majority of the trails) we had to take the 13-mile scenic drive. The drive is one way only, so make sure you drive slowly enough so that you may take in everything. There are parking areas / turnouts all along the scenic drive so that you can park and get some up close photos of nature at its finest.

For $7 per car (cash and check only), how can you beat that! We will definitely be back to hike some of the other trails :D

FYI: 13mile Scenic Drive, Red Rock Overlook on State Route 159 and Red Spring

Y'all are probably wondering why would a person who cannot eat spicy food come here and all I gotta say is #YOLO.

I ordered the chengdu zajiang dish which was pretty tasty and is a chef's choice! The noodles had a good amount of chew factor and the broth in the dish added plenty of flavor. They could have given a bit more meat and veggies with the dish, but overall it was a good dish. Eating it kind of reminded me of spaghetti with ground beef...just without the marinara sauce.

Another cool thing about this place is that you get this mung bean drink that is really refreshing, cool, and has a hint of sweetness to it. This is meant to help you cool down from the spicy dishes, but it is pretty good even if you don't eat spicy food like me.

Except, there's none in Cave Creek/Carefree worth eating.  But we had stopped at Home Depot in Anthem and we see the sign for Hong Kong Asian and thought---hey!

I don't know why people are complaining about the pricing.  It was right on par with the Chinese restaurants in our old hometown.  I ordered the Pan Fried Noodles and DH went for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I also added the egg roll and cream cheese wonton to my meal and we ordered a hot and sour soup to share.

Okay, the soup was maybe a dollar more for the same quantity.  And at our old place, for 3.95 you could combo up to an eggroll AND soup.  But I have noticed that AZ restaurants are really stingy on their ""add-ons"".

You know, it wasn't bad.  Not fabulous, but it was the first *real* Chinese we have had in a year.  There was plenty of beef, pork, chicken and shrimp in my nicely sauced noodles---they don't skimp on the proteins----and lots of tender/crisp veggies.  Same for DH's Kung Pao.  The egg roll had a crisp exterior, but the inside was bland and mushy.  The cream cheese wonton was tasty---I could have munched many of those.  The hot and sour soup lacked a depth of flavor that I was accustomed to at our old fave.

I have to agree, though, it was salty.  Not so much that it was inedible, but after the first bite, I removed my rings because I knew there was some finger-swelling in my future.  But frankly, we overlooked that in our pleasure of *real* Chinese for the first time in a long time!  I wonder if you can ask them to pull back on the salt?  Or if they even read these comments and can tweak the kitchen on their own?

We took our meals home, but the restaurant looked quite clean, though the decor was nothing to get excited about.  About half the tables were full and there was a steady stream of folks picking up their carry-out.  The guy at the counter was polite, if not warm and fuzzy.

Oh---and quantity---we each got two meals out of our containers.  I think that's reasonable.

Because of the salt, I probably would have gone with a 2.5 star rating, but you know how Yelp is.  Whole numbers only.

Mr. Sushi's food is still great and the prices are OK but the experience has taken a nose dive because we can never get a seat at the sushi bar anymore.  They have dedicated half of the sushi bar to a waitress service area and they never seat people efficiently at the sushi bar so our party of three is always bumped to a table even if three different chairs spread out across the bar are open.

I've had dozens of flavours from this place and while you could absolutely go here and get boring options, they provide a steady number of rotating flavours so you're never bored with the selection. 

I went by this weekend and tried one I'd never seen before (easy to say when they have enough space for dozens of flavours a day) the Cassata. It was an Italian trifle style gelato with candied fruit, layers of trifle and an orange base. Absolutely delicious and not nearly as creamy as some of the other flavours, less dense and more refreshing. My other favourites include the Pistachio, Cappuchino and the Chocolate Hazelnut, but go wild, they will let you sample as many flavours (I'm sure, within reason) as you will! I even saw a Peanut Butter Chocolate Marscapone the other day..

One cup of one flavour will ring up at about $4.75 so it's definitely up there in terms of gelato pricing, but it's absolutely worth it. You can even get take-home and family size containers for later!

My only complaint is that you pay at the front then wave your ticket to the next available staffer to fill your order, and they don't always pay attention to the order in which they should serve customers. Not the biggest problem, but it's happened a few times and on busy, hot days I can see it causing some issues.",2013-06-03 20:32:42

So why isn't Crema my first choice when I go out for coffee in The Junction? One reason: The Stroller Patrol!

I can make coffee at home. Espressos too. If I'm going our for a coffee, I want to take a seat, read a paper, catch up on the internet, people watch out the window, chat with my partner or whoever else I take, and most importantly, relax. That's tough to do when getting from the front door to the bar usually involves running a gauntlet of prams. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of gauntlet-running. If someone wants to make a Takeshi's Castle themed restaurant I'd be the first in line. But that's not the vibe I'm looking for in a coffee house.

The Mattress Factory is a contemporary art museum spread out over three different buildings in the North Side. All of the buildings are in walking distance of each other, and I actually quite like this concept of spreading out to a few different buildings. As you move along on the tour, you're able to see some of the beautiful houses in the Mexican War Streets. While my parents and I did get a little lost at first trying to find the entrance/ticket area, we eventually found our way.

We came on a Saturday, so we expected it to be busy. However, we didn't expect to wait almost twenty minutes to buy our tickets in the tiny lobby. The employees were really taking their time, to say the least. We did get a bit impatient, but eventually were able to get our tickets. The museum itself was worth the wait. Some of the art installations are permanent, while others are only present for a short time before being deconstructed and replaced. This means that getting a membership is pretty worth it, because the displays do change over time. This is not the type of museum where you walk through and view paintings; these art pieces are large installations that take up whole rooms. I was especially impressed with Yayoi Kusama's installations - ""Infinity Dots Mirrored Room"" and ""Repetitive Vision."" Wow. I love the way most of the installations at the Mattress Factory challenge your ideas of reality. You'll come just to see the art, but leave in very deep thought about what you've just seen.

Overall, the Mattress Factory is a must-see on the museum scene in Pittsburgh. They have installations here that you truly won't see anywhere else, and all of the employees are very helpful and clearly quite knowledgable about the pieces. A must visit!",2016-02-15 00:56:25

4) the service is always attentive and warm.

They even do weddings here and they are so easy to work with. They don't charge you to rent the space, which is rare for such a beautiful venue. (At least they didn't about two years ago, not sure if they do now.)

We ordered two burrito bows. 5 minutes into sitting down to eat, the manager and three people being interviewed sat at the table behind us. My next bite had a hair in it. I have long  shedding hair so I always look at the hair first. The hair was black, mine is blonde and it was stuck between an onion and a tomato.  I went inside and told the person who took our order. She stated she would have a new one made and bring it out and the manager would be out in a min. The manager continued his interviews, the women came out to tell him what was going on. Those being interviewed said ""smile and give her a coupon"" and laughed..... the manager continued interviewing them..... then scheduled second interviews and went inside. When my corrected food was brought out, she asked how we paid, I replied with a card and a gift card. she then asked if we wanted drinks or chips while we waited. We already both had chips and drinks on the table so we declined. At that point I was upset and chose not to eat my hopefully hair free meal. My husband finished his and we refilled our drinks and left. Never once heard from the manager. 

During the interviews the manager stated that with their open kitchen model customer service and cleanliness is of utmost importance. But this situation exemplifies the lack of customer service and cleanliness that this store has. He also said that the customers are always watching. His response to the situation shows he doesn't care what his customers see. 

When I got my refills the person who brought out my meal, said we are really sorry. I told her the hair wasn't as big of a deal as the way the potential employees and manager acted.

I insisted on being seated on the patio and do not regret this decision for one minute. I hadn't quite decided what I was going to eat as a main course or drink that evening... but I knew I was devouring the shit out of that cheddar fondue. And I was right. There was a lot though, and I'm glad I had a friend to help devour it. I think we both agreed it was the best pretzel bread we've had. The pork and the sausage were great additions and I'm a sucker for apples and cheese. Another point for you sir.

The server kindly agreed to allow the flavor of the ginger in the no. 89 to rise above the pear and I appreciate him for that. It came out in a cute glass and lasted me through my courses. Not too strong, not too weak. 

I was saving room for Churn (how can you not), so I settled on the Waldorf chicken salad for dinner. However, the layout of your menu confused me. In the same space below it, it listed different additions such as salmon, shrimp and chicken so I thought I needed to clarify I wanted chicken. Then I confused the server. Apparently, those options are for the other salad items. But the layout of the menu layout implies the opposite. You may want to reconsider the organization of the salad section. One of the best Waldorf salad's I've had though. Great presentation. My date for the evening had the Windsor burger with mac & cheese, of which I sampled the mac & cheese and one of the wine smothered onions. That will be my next attempt. 

Everything's pretty reasonably priced and there's a great selection of beer and wine available as well as well thought out cocktails.

The folks at Cafe Med are friendly people. Our server talked us into some Moroccan Madness (tea) while we waited for the rest of our peeps to arrive.

As far as sheesha bars go, I have nothing else to compare this one to! So it's got three stars in my books. Mostly because the guy serving our table offered to fill our tea pots up with more hot water, took the pots away and didn't return with them until we inquired about them again. And also because, even though it's a spot to come smoke things, there were times the haze built up enough to burn my eyes for a moment or two.

Positives? Staff is very friendly and patient. They are fast, efficient, and keep the place clean. I like the flavorings you can put in the sodas. The chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch. I've tried several soups and they are amazing.

Negatives? Sandwiches are small for the price. The chocolate dipped strawberry is often under-ripe. The bread that comes with the soup is awful, just bad texture, and it's so easy to get good bread! Soups are never hot enough. Salads are okay, nothing spectacular, and the chicken in them tastes off. The desserts are terrible, the brûlées are nothing but a pudding or custard with some runny sauce masquerading as caramel or a few berries with a runny berry sauce. The brownie was hard. When you consider how much you've paid, you realize you've not gotten much food. And very little of it is great.",2015-03-22 16:45:37

As the side option I had zucchini fries with extra feta cheese. The sandwich meat was chicken and was so moist , normally I hate onions and forgot to have them taken off. The way they were cooked into the meat it mixed well with the chicken and I went for it. While I did pull the big pieces of onion out I still ate the sandwich cooked in onion

We also ordered the Greek fries to to try them, but with extra feta and those were great as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant was casual and upbeat. The wait staff was wonderful.

The place is pretty cut and dry. There are karaoke rooms, there is a bar, there are restrooms. The rest is up to you! Their song choices are overall pretty decent, there were a few here and there that we couldn't believe they didn't offer. The videos, though as lots of people mention have absolutely no bearing on what song you're singing, were incredibly entertaining! I mean one of the stars in numerous videos was named Banana Girl...how can you not love that??!! Who needs American videos?

My only semi-complaint was that we weren't made aware of a button to get the waiter so we went out and got our drinks every time. Not the end of the world cause you get some fresh air but minus a star on customer service. The drinks aren't bargain basement but they're strong so who cares.

I don't know what they did to the broccoli but it tasted super strong like maybe it was decomposing.

We managed to get a 5:30 pm reservation on a Sunday (it was either that or after 9), so if you want a better time slot, you better book at least two weeks in advance. 

Buca does not offer complimentary bread, but their nodini ($6)- warm bread knots with olive oil, rosemary, garlic and sea salt- are a must try! These were perfect warm pockets of garlicky goodness! I could eat them all day long. 

For appetizer, we shared parmigiana di melanzane ($14)- preserved tomato and fried eggplant layered with bufala ricotta and burrata cheese. It was well-executed and I only wished that it stayed hot for longer. 

My boyfriend ordered gnocchi alla cenere ($26)- hand-rolled dumplings made from onion ash, served with fresh broccoli, pecorino and parmigiano cheese finished with fresh pregiato truffles. The gnocchi was very delicate, just the way I like it, and the truffles and cheese made for a heavenly rich combination- too rich for the bf, actually. We ended up trading plates (though quite unwillingly on my part). 

I opted for Buca's famous bigoli ($19)- hand-cranked duck egg pasta with duck leg, offal ragu, venetian spices, mascarpone and basil. The ragu had a great depth of flavour and thought it was superbly delicious, though not as rich as the gnocchi. I had read reviews that complained about the portion of this dish, but I found size perfectly adequate. Even though I liked the gnocchi, I was sad to give up my plate.

For dessert, we had tiramisu di Buca ($12)- espresso soaked house-made biscuits, layered with mascarpone and chocolate mousse. For me, the chocolate was too overpowering and I wasn't a big fan of it. 

Dessert aside, I really enjoyed the food at Buca, and I was sad that we didn't try any of their famous pizza. The prices are a bit too high for my liking, but I wouldn't mind an occasional indulgence.

They've been open about a month. A welcome addition to Uptown Plaza which was sorely in need of a value-priced option for lunch given all of the changes going on.

The restaurant was clean - mid-afternoon/weekday - and the staff were friendly. My order was made correctly but the assembler had overdone some of the ingredients and the tortilla couldn't hold it all in. This caused her some stress. I suggested she could just dump it all in a bowl which took her a bit to figure out.

My issue is that the chicken was a mix of hot, lukewarm and cold. This is not a good thing as it can make people sick. Every time I was about to get up and comment, I'd take another bite and get a piece that was hot. By the time I'd figured out that what was most likely to have happened - the chicken at the top of the serving container was cold and the deeper down into the serving bowl was hot - I'd eaten enough of the burrito that I figured it wouldn't be fair to complain or comment.

It is clear that this location is still very new. Training staff takes time. I'll let them work through some kinks and give them a try in a couple of months.",2016-10-17 23:10:58

I asked for a recommendation & the worker guided me to the Bee Royal (Apple, Lemon, Extra Ginger). I really enjoyed it! It was like a lemonade with a pleasant ginger zing aftertaste. However, not so enjoyable when I found out that 1 bottle has 47g of sugar!! Maybe I should've had pizza instead.

The process works the same as any other conveyor spot, you grab the plates you want as they come around. You can also order some other items directly with your sever from the menu like appetizers or desserts.

Majority of the items we tried were from the belt itself. Some pros were being able to try multiple different items, the side sauces that come with almost all of the half rolls, and that the severs were on point with constantly keeping our drinks refilled. The cons were the quality and taste. I felt the food just wasn't as fresh as similar competitors and the flavors were just kinda of meh and basic.

I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. 

I waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. 

I'll break it down. 

DRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps ""aren't working."" 

APPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the ""Britney Spears"" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.

MAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? 

I don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between ""ok"" and ""good."" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....

SERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service. 

But truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.  Revising their menu wouldn't be a bad idea, either...",2013-01-05 20:47:31

We were trolling Markham for a dinner place when I remembered Fancy.  We had been here once before about a year ago, when reservations were needed about a week in advance and there was still a 20 min. wait for a table.

On this particular Monday night though, we were able to stroll in sans reservation around 8pm and get a table for four with ease.

We decided to go with the set dinner for 4 ($53.95) which included our choice of a main like lobster, bass, crab, etc and then 3 other dishes.  We chose lobster, beef with bak choi, deep fried salt and pepper fish and half a crispy chicken.

Dinner started with complimentary house soup and then our dishes arrived quickly after.  Lobster was good with impressive meaty pieces.  Beef and bak choi, a bit on the greasy side and bak choi cooked pretty al dente but I prefer it this way.  Salt and pepper fish...so salty, so satisfying.  Crispy chicken, just crispy like it's namesake.  Portion sizes were good and along with 3 bowls of rice, it was just enough food for the four of us (no leftovers).

Dessert was a choice of red/green bean soup or warm tofu (tofu faa), and a few cookies.  Other tables got sesame balls but we did not.

Service was not bad.  Wait staff had a sense of humour and were efficient at taking away empty plates and lobster shells.  And how could you not love those flashing neon name tags?  Just when I thought the service industry couldn't introduce any more flair.

They don't take VISA so cash is probably preferred.

They have so many great, fresh, organic and unique products here all under one roof. I feel so good shopping here...this is a place for body, mind AND soul! Other mentionables: Great line of Aegean hummus and dips (chipotle hummus, and sun-dried tomato tzatziki to name just a couple outstanding ones), always fresh organic produce, and a terrific lineup of body care products.

Okay, the main reason they get 3 out of 5 stars is the lack of customer service on the part of the checker people. One guy who works there should, honestly, not be working with the public at all, as he is a no-personality kid who looks like a bum. I went there 2 nights ago and a different guy was also no-personality-glum-uninterested in my shopping experience. Hello??? Whatever happened to, ""Hello, sir, how are you this evening? Did you find everything alright? Good."" and maybe...a smile? Conversationality? Yes, you work as a...grocery checkout person and probably loathe that fact of your life...but you still...work in a professional, public relations capacity, like it or not, and need to fake it like any good server or store clerk, etc. I've actually gone to Sprouts or Trader Joe's a few times instead, because of this. Oh yeah, and try to have your checkers thoroughly trained before putting them on the floor...one gal I had one day - it must have been her first day on the job and she was so slow and held up the line forever while she looked through this book and that and had to call people to help her on simple stuff. Yikes.

Another reason I give them 3 stars is they can be a bit pricey (even for an organic specialty store), and their average bread price is well over $4. But things do go on sale quite often, and I think they have Whole Foods beat, overall on price. I haven't minded spending substantially more here, as the products are top notch, feel good, natural, and ultimately worth it.

I did, but unfortunately not by much. From the outside it looks like a big place, but it is actually quite small with only a handful of tables to sit down at. It is very casual, and I suspect most people are taking their orders to go.

Surveying the menu, I decided on going for hummus, and Lamb Souvlaki with fries and a bottle of water. That turned out to be much more expensive that I thought for such a casual place. But if the food was great I can justify it.

My meal started with a greek salad (comes with the entree), and that was very good. Honestly, it was the best part of the meal. The hummus with pita bread came next. The hummus was good, much better than the last place. Creamy, with some whole garbanzos mixed in with some paprika and olive oil. The pita bread was nothing special, but worked for dipping into hummus.

Then came the Lamb Souvlaki and fries. The fries were very disappointing. It reminded me of my childhood when I would make Ore Ida Zesties freezer fries. The Lamb was cooked okay, but had very little seasoning on it. It just tasted like meat. It was good quality, but not properly seasoned.

A lot of this could be forgiven if it was properly priced, but as it is I wouldn't go back. While I was waiting for my food, three ladies went to order and there total was over $70. They were shocked and just left. So I think for this class of restaurant, the price is steep. But they seem to be doing okay, lol, so perhaps it is just me. :)",2017-07-01 02:03:53

Donuts were just ok! On the small size but appeared to be semi fresh. Coffee was good but overly sweet. There was about a half inch of sugar in the bottom of my cup. Still was a good cup of coffee.

Service was good with everyone smiling and pleasant, order taker efficient.

Everything was so good. The more you eat, the more you want it. All the flavors and texture and the contrast between the hearty sauce & meat and he fresh tangy pickles was just too frigging awesome.

Needless to say, I regret not knowing about this place until now.

I can't for the life of me remember our servers names (2 gentlemen) but they handled everything great. Each server basically had one side of a very long table. 
Great explanations and suggestions from the servers. They were extremely knowledgeable about all the food, and promptly answered any questions we had about the menu. Even getting down to details about how the food is prepped and cooked. That I really loved. 
The apps were great we had the calamari, and crab dip. We ordered 2 of each and they were gone within minutes.
Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food, out of 12, 1 dish was sent back for being under cooked. I loved my food as did my wife, I had the halibut, which according to our server is one of the most popular on the menu. The halibut was cooked perfectly, served on one of the most delicious crab/potato cakes I have ever had. Wife had the lamb, came cooked perfectly. and was delicious.

We decided to visit this restaurant to broaden our knowledge of ramen and see what other tastes there are out there. 

Based on my previous experience at the first ramen restaurant I went to, this place has a better tasting broth. There's more depth to it: it's salty, flavourful and the broth is thick (not watery). The noodles were similar to the instant noodles but tastes fresh. I liked that the texture was similar.

My only issue was that the bowl sizes were a bit small for the price. The first ramen place I went to had much bigger servings at the same price. I left the restaurant feeling quite hungry still- I suppose I should order some appetizers next time.. But still, it kind of sucks knowing I have to pay more at this restaurant to get full when I can just pay less at another restaurant to get more full! 

Like I said, taste-wise I don't know what ""good"" or ""bad"" ramen tastes like so I will have to go to a few more ramen places and try out their broths and noodle and then come back to write another review. 

The service here was great. We had water and tea on our table right away and the kind waitress helped me pick out a bowl when I wasn't sure what to get (I decided on the most popular pork broth with the milk in it). My husband got the super spicy bowl (level 2 spice). I tried it and it was amazing! It's the kind of spice that adds flavour and doesn't bite your throat in a bad way.

My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. 

I began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill ""Harbison""; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia ""Calcagno""; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon ""Leonora""; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.",2015-06-24 18:06:38

Stayed at Palazzo and have eaten at Craftsteak, Cut, Delmonico, and being from Chicago, we know our way around our Beef (Nine, Gene and Georgetti's, Gibsons, Chicago Chop House, Keefers, Kinzie...).  Considered return to Cut, booked and unbooked Carnevino and Prime before settling on Mastro's because of our evening plans (Mandarin Oriental for drinks) and because we've wanted to try the newbie here in Chicago.  

Request, and wait for if necessary, the tree house dining.  

Mike R (ASK FOR HIM, HE'S THAT GOOD) did an excellent job with the pacing of our meal.  He knew it was our anniversary and he made sure to congratulate us several times, chat us up without being intrusive, and sincerely took an interest in making our experience pleasurable.

Wife had the bone in Filet (12 oz) and I had the bone in Rib eye...plate, ordered the au gratin potatos to share (our server Mike R recommended one side to share due to the size) and the meal was worth every single of the five stars we are giving this place.    

For our anniversary, they treated us to their signature butter cake.  We were stuffed but did our due dilligence....very tasty, very good, and if you actually save room for it, worth ordering. 

Upon reflection, this was a perfect destination to celebrate an anniversary.  Live music was noticable, but not intrusive, the tree house, particularly when the sun went down, created a very romantic atmosphere.  Have read complaints about the setting (basically in the middle of the mall) but I don't share those complaints.  Yes, you are in a mall, albeit a mall the average person can walk through but not afford to shop in, but you hardly notice the people honestly.  Saw many people enjoying either bottles of wine (like us...oh, and yes the list has some mark up and bottles you would have to mortgage your home to afford, but also some very reasonably priced, well worth the mark up bottles to be enjoyed ... ) or their signature cocktails which were generous pours and will be on ""the list"" next time we visit.  

But I have to come back to Mkie R, he was a throwback, a restaurant professional who knows the food, knows the wine list, knows the importance of making your feel as though he is there only to make your experience memorable.

I will dare say that this place is the next best thing to eating in Thailand, & I know because I have been there more than a few times ;) 

I had the chicken noodle soup with a combo of flat & egg noodles, which is just as good as you can get from the best street vendors in Thailand! The broth was definitely very flavorful & they give you all the great condiments to go with it. The sliced peppers in vinegar are awesome! However, it could have used a little more sprouts, cilantro & green onions in the soup. That would be my only request :) 

That is the best part about the street vendors, everything on their carts are fresh & plentiful & you can add as much & whatever you like & as many noodle combinations as you want in your soup. 

My date du jour had the pineapple fried rice & from the look on her face & her comments, she really enjoyed it. After we finished the main course, we decided to split the fried bananas with ice cream & drizzled with honey. WOW!! That delicious little dish is what earned that 5th star :D 

I also ordered some pork chow mein to take home with me, cuz I gots to have my noodles! I F**K's with them noodles! I F**K's with them hard!! I have to say, it wasn't bad.

DJ_YB7ydCpKfjyow1TziTQ,1nTGhcG7qqL4qNR8pBwc3w,Ck6zHE15TuWTaNJ2YNawZA,5,1,0,1,"A hidden gem in Markham for desserts! I've tried fresh lemon, chocolate brownie, honey crisps, popice, milk oreo, whiskey chocolate. 

My top 3 faves would have to be:

1) Fresh Lemon ~ $5.99 (medium) - milk ice cream, lemon, honey
The lemon and milk ratio produces such a soothing flavour. It's also lighter in flavour in comparison to all the others and can be finished by a singular person. I really like how they put lemon and lime zest, and a slice of candied lemon ontop. The honey is a sweetener and the amount of it can be controlled by how much you squeeze in

2) Popice ~$7.99 mango, mango pudding
This tastes like dipping dots, with a texture similar to feta cheese, but definitely a lot more moist where it melts in your mouth instead of dry up your tongue. The mango chunks and sauce taste amazing, and the mango pudding at the bottom tones down the sweetness of the huge cuppa dessert (Definitely needs to be shared amongst your friends)

3) Whiskey Chocolate ~$5.99 chocolate ice cream, whiskey, chocolate roll, chocolate sauce
Whiskey and chocolate is deliciouss. This satisfied my chocolate cravings so well. The chocolate was rich and had an intense cocoa flavour

Verdict: The icecream is made on the spot, and it's amusing watching them pour liquid nitrogen over the masterpiece. The icecream is really densely packed into the cup, and is extremely flavourful, almost like gelato, actually! Although there are no chairs here, it's a cool hangout spot. PS. they also have Frozen Breath (liquid nitrogen Cheetos)that you can put in your mouth and blow out smoke from your nose and mouth which are cool for snapchat vids",2016-10-16 18:42:35

Great service, my daughter and I arrived early and we almost had to hide under the table when all the steam carts converged on our table.  Looked like bees around a hive.  Everything we ordered was flavorful and hot. 

Take away is great too.  We often phone in a Sunday order and enjoy a tableful of Shu Mai, Har Gow, and about a dozen other delicious dumplings and plates.  BBQ pork is excellent, as are the Shrimp rolls.

Next, we had ordered the four-cheese pasta which features broccoli and chicken, and it fell flat. The rich white sauce lacked flavor,and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd. The chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way, but it was still kind of odd.

The flavors were awesome, but I have to agree with other reviews in saying that the portions were way overpriced. The prices for alcohol weren't as hugely marked up however, which was a plus to see.

I was invited to Milestone Grill + Bar (@MilestonesCa)  to try out their new Summer Chef's Menu (hashtag #milestoneschefmenu) available as of today, I really don't remember when was the last time I have been to Milestone but I do remember that it wasn't great. Since Chef Jason Rosso (@jasonrosso) joined, Milestone have been working to elevate the chain restaurant to an Independent Restaurant Experience.

Within the last 8 months, they have created, tested and launched 15 new menu items with another 10 coming out soon. They are working hard to change the public's notion of the Brand by revitalizing their menu across the 50 locations across the country.

 We were treated to a 6 course tasting menu complete with wine pairing provided by Constellation Brands and presented by Dave Grant (@sommdavidgrant).
 It was an all seafood menu which is light and refreshing, perfect as summer menu items.

 Crispy Quinoa Shrimp
~ Chimmi churri aioli and vegetable slaw
~ paired w/ The People's Wine Pinot Gris
~ The shrimp was quoted with raw quinoa and fried, never had quinoa that way and it resulted in great contrast of texture with the shrimp. 
~ And somehow, it wasn't oily at all which made it very airy and perfect with the spicy and garlicky chimmi churri.

  Panko Blue Crab Cakes
~ Fennel and Arugula salad, chipotle aioli
~ paired w/ Kim Crawford's Unoaked Chardonnay
 ~ This was made with 100% crab with no filler which you don't find in a lot of places. But I find it a tiny bit heavy on the black pepper and it was a bit much with the spicy chipotle aioli.

 Spicy Thai Basil Stirfry
~ Rice Noodles, shrimp and coconut milk
~ paired w/ Inniskillin 2011 East-West Series Riesling-Gewurztraminer
~ This was my fave wine pairing so far, it has a very intense aroma, crisp and well balanced white which was perfect with the spicy stirfry.
~ It says spicy but the previous 2 dishes was actually spicier than this one. ~ Although I like the flavor here, I find the noodle a tiny bit overcook/too soft and it was broken into really small pieces.

 Grilled Japanese Tuna Tataki
~ Asparagus and fennel slaw, mandarin dressing
~ paired w/ Le Clos Jordanne (LCJ) Claystone Terrace 2010 Pinot Noir
~ This was my favorite dish of the night, love the coarse salt on top and it had a slightly smokey flavor from the searing. 
~ And love how it was paired with a Pinot Noir, a lighter body red. 

 ""Surf and Turf""
~ A duo of grilled flat iron and lobster fricassee
~ paired w/ Dreaming Tree 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon
~ I was surprised at how well cook the flat iron steak was given how thin it was, perfect moist medium rare. 
~ And love the surf part wasn't just the lobster sitting on top but it came with a intense lobster sauce and lobster hash.

Avocado and Lime Tart
~ Brown sugar Chantilly
~ paired w/ Inniskillin 2008 Vidal Icewine
~ Sound like a weird combination but I love how it's not too sweet and had such a creamy smooth texture. 
~ Even with this huge portion, I had no problem finishing it.

Verdict :
~ We were both fully impressed with this new menu and definitely change my mind about Milestone.
~ I highly recommend giving them another chance.",2013-05-15 02:09:33

This time I  began with a bowl of real hot and outstanding creamy Clam Chowder filled with clams, potatoes, and a few pieces of celery.  This crock of smoking goodness that was almost like a meal in itself was just a little too salty.  Diane's cup of Clam Chowder was just as hot and good as my bowl, but at $2.00 less, looked like a filled thimble beside it.

Next up was a rather massive Side Salad with crisp and cool Iceberg Lettuce, multiple tomato wedges, sliced cucumbers, Red Onions, some snippets of Red Cabbage, and a few carrot splinters.  It came with an ordered Honey Mustard Dressing that was mellow, Dijon-like but milder, and excellent.

Then I enjoyed a generous portion of tender Tri-Tip covered with a delicious Brown Gravy, and served with a creamy and this time rather rich Mashed Potatoes; vegetables that were neither too hard nor too soft, but just right; and a tasty hunk of crusty Sourdough Bread.  Meanwhile, Diane waxed euphoric over her Beef Dip Sandwich dunked in great au jus.  I know because she insisted I try a bite; it was full of lean roast beef mixed with melted Swiss Cheese and the taste of a savory hot beefy liquid that nicely broke down the soft roll.  That fine bite convinced me to order this beauty for myself one day soon.

Our booth seating in the bright and modernistic dining room was very comfortable, and our pleasant server hopped to and fro with water refills, extra butter, and more au jus.

This just proves that restaurants that don't deliver too well on the first visit, but show some promise, should still often be given another chance months later.  A diner may very well be happily rewarded with marked improvement and a memorable meal!",2014-11-15 12:47:48

This is a sparkling clean and well organized store. I shop here from time to time to pick up some fresh catnip or toys for my kitty. The prices on everyday things like food and cat litter aren't very competitive when compared to Target or Wal-Mart but they do carry specialty toys, pet carriers, beds and items that you can't find anywhere else.

A few minutes pass and I'm now thinking of more than just wanting coffee. I want a good latte, possibly a nice warm breakfast, but definitely a cozy atmosphere and some people watching. Bingo. Koffie Cafe!

It's tucked away on one of my favorite little streets in one of my favorite neighborhoods of Cleveland. I love riding my bike over here in the AM, ordering up a coffee and just posting up outside on their sunny patio. Ahhhhh, welcome to relaxation at its finest! No BS or hoity-toity crowds. Just a great coffee shop, plain and simple.  

Koffie Cafe also serves up some fresh-pressed paninis and sandwiches that are honestly really tasty. It's surprising for such a small space, but I'm telling you, even the plain turkey sandwich is amaze-balls. My favorite has to be the breakfast sandwiches though, served all day too! (Oh b-fast, how I love thee) Ahem...bagel sandwich with egg and cheese = winner. 

Love to people watch? Just sit outside on the patio with your coffee and catch all sorts of folks strolling along Market Avenue. I swear, everyone is in slow motion on that street. It's like an instant relaxer!  Plus, it's just such a great neighborhood to really enjoy. What a beautiful part of Cleveland. 

Need some WiFi and a place to get your ""nerd"" on? Koffie is the place to do it! I frequent this hot spot to get work done and love the atmosphere. You'll see creatives and business people alike utilizing the relaxing space at Koffie!

Why not 5-stars? Well, although my love for Koffie Cafe runs deep, the high prices sort of irk me. On the other hand, they are a local, independent coffee shop.

I had the Power Flock salad to go. It's loaded with ultra healthy ingredient and the best part is - it has flavour. Often times when you get really healthy salads you are sacrificing taste. Certainly not the case here. Their in house white miso dressing is light and Delish.

Tasted like plastic, and I enjoyed the whipped cream more.
The reason I am giving such a poor rating is because both times we went they brought out the wrong food.  Although both times it was corrected, It's just sad that it wasnt even busy and they just seem so unorganized.  For the price of the food, its really not worth it.

- Spinach Artichoke Dip:  an excellent starter, served hot from the oven, with just enough bubbly cheese on top.

- Pear & Blue Salad:  great, fresh, tasty, and big enough to be an entree.

- Burger:  just okay, nothing special.  Served hot, cooked as requested.

For dinner, I had the meatloaf and my spouse had the chicken cutlet. They were both really good and we had plenty for leftovers. We both had sauteed seasonal veggies which were crisp and flavorful. I had horseradish mashed potatoes and he had the grits. We enjoyed the sides. Dessert was the coca cola cake. It came with two generous slice. They were moist and fudgey.

I have to be honest, but I truly don't understand the hoopla about this place. It's not awful, but it's not really anything to rave about either. Maybe it was because by the time my coworker brought back the food my pizza wasn't that warm, but I just wasn't too impressed. After having a few pieces, I decided it may be the dough/crust. It didn't seem done. Not only was it mushy and falling apart (along with the cheese and sauce), but the flour still left on it was waaaaay too much for me. I had flour all over my face and hands.

Upon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly. 

I ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine), a side salad, and the ""What it is"" . The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The ""What it is"" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department. 

My biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it.

I'm glad I walked into this place out of many Coffee shops in the neighborhood after having their tasty **cookies(Chocolate/Peanut/Bacon & White Chocolate/ Macadamia) and a delicious **Chai iced latte w/soy milk :P. Their Chai iced latte was one of the best I've ever tried before!!

It's a ""trendy"" coffee shop type of place. When I walked in, there were several people  sit around either working on their laptops or reading books.  I really like their very modern style of mismatched colorful furniture.  I enjoy the chalkboard menus on the wall as well.  It seems like they serve quiet a few selection of beers and foods:)  To my surprise and amazement, they had an alcohol beverage and keep in mind, this is a coffee shop. Most notable Wow, I would never thought this place might sell beer... 

A place to come and do some work on your laptop sipping coffee and then transition to beers later in the day-sounds awesome!!  Maybe some people might think it doesn't look exactly a beer destination place, but I can see myself having a glass of cold beer on a hot summer night :P.

I inquired about getting my daughters ears pierced after reading a review. I was also told that as long as she is 6 months old and up to date on her immunizations we're good. My daughter is 9 months so she's good. 

I made this late enough to avoid any mishaps as my lo had a swim class from 11-11:30 AM the same day. So I figured 1 PM on Saturday would be enough time to wash and dress my baby after swim class and drive over there.

I arrive and it's a small spot but friendly and efficient. We waited only about 10 minutes. Before that we were told to choose the earrings (from a great selection) as well as a back up pair just in case they didn't have my first choice. Once they were ready for us and there were two stylists available, we were led to a small area in the back where I held my lo on my lap. My dude had to hold her head just in case but they marked her ears first and one of the stylists said she marked it the way she did so there would still be room for her to get other piercings in the future if she wants. I appreciated that. It was even. She let me check. 

They both pierced her ears really fast. It was over in .5 milliseconds literally. My baby cried for like 10 seconds if that but she was good. Like it never happened. They told me this was a great age to get it done (as i figured) because babies tend to forget pain faster than older kids and they don't fuss as much. 

They gave us some solution for her ears and told us what to do each day for 3 months for her holes and that we can change out her earrings after 6 months. 

While I was waiting I was able to view how the stylists were with the kids getting their hair cut and styled and they were awesome. Really patient with the fussy/crying kids and really nice. I'm not surprised but I'm impressed. I'd go back if my next one is a boy and he needs a cut. Who am I kidding... My husband will cut his hair.

- Whiskey Sour was impossibly weak. All ice and sour. 1 star 
- Chipotle chicken nachos were huge, but mostly all chips. Chicken had a decent flavor. Salsa was meh. Guac was good. 2.5 stars

I was surprised how this place looks so small from the outside (no kidding) and I was ""prepared"" to seat myself in really tiny spots inside the restaurant if it calls for it. Little did I know that the place was actually quite roomy once you go in so  I was very pleased about that.

The layout of the place is interesting because of the wall dividers in some parts of the room and there's tiny (door less) cubicles where you can dine in with a group of people. That being said, the concept itself doesn't help the servers since they seem to have trouble noticing some of the customers when they call their attention. 

So if your ever there, it's either you make yourself ""heard"" so they know your ready for your order OR you patiently wait until they notice your done looking at the menu. I mean, its not a painful waiting game ... it just takes a little while until they take your order when your seated away from their line of vision if the place is really busy.

Anyway, the food is good and the menu packs a lot of variety compared to the WOW korean restaurant (also located in dundas, but just a bit further). THIS place packs the flavor. I love how the food is spicy and rich in texture. The price is inexpensive for 2 people and they serve a good portion of a meal. The side dishes wasn't that great so don't expect too much. 

Am quite puzzled as to why Song Cook is the restaurant's name but it's called ""Soft Tofu"" on the banner outside. It makes it a little weird trying to locate it when your looking for the actual name.

But do visit this place when your around the area if your looking for good korean food with more choices on the menu.",2012-04-04 10:21:05

It was a cold and rainy day and I was craving something tasty and hot. The Deli is behind Starbucks and has been there for years. It's a bit hidden but the space is kinda nice. 
It was very quiet with only two guests. Mid afternoon it was not a surprise. Service was friendly and efficient and after looking at the menu I knew what I wanted when I arrived at the counter. Philly Cheese Steak. To Go.
I figured a quick beer while I waited, and the cook asked if I wanted fries. I didn't but I relented and agreed. A Heineken and $14 and change. I gathered napkins and a few condiments and headed to the light rail. While I waited for the train I was very hungry and had snuck some fries on the way. Hmm, seasoned fries. Prefab frozen type, likely US Foods or Sysco.

That's where the joy ended.
As I sat and attempted to pick up half of the sandwich, the bottom was already soaked through and soggy, naturally falling apart as I brought it to my mouth. One bite and I nearly gagged. It tasted like dog food. It was beef, I think with overcooked chunks of onion and green pepper and a slice of cheese on top. It was gross. It had some type of reddish sauce that was completely flavorless. My guess is that it was cooked monday, and then reheated daily all week until today, thursday and reconstituted as the moisture evaporated as it sat at a steam table. 
It was disgusting. I wouldn't feed it to my dogs. The best part were the frozen fries.
And of course the bellyache 20 minutes later that has lasted so far 4 and a half hours hasn't helped.

Don't waste your time or money. There are so many better choices in this city. The only saving grace was the friendly service. Whoever operates this place has clearly lost their passion for quality food.",2016-12-23 02:46:19

I like their menu a lot but their pressed sushi was way too heavy on the rice and their sashimi was terrible. You can definitely tell it's not very fresh. I did however really like their aburi nigiri (torched sushi), so stick to that if you decide to pay a visit. Some of their tataki's were pretty good, but the issue I found is that the sauces didn't always match what the menu said. I think they must've run out of certain sauces and substituted with something else.

Don't get me wrong-it was a fantastic experience. I just didn't realize all the body parts that would be addressed! I would recommend wearing loose-fitting clothing. 

This is not a fancy spa. (It's in a strip mall next to Giant Hamburger.) They've done a nice job though: the treatment areas are curtained off, with twinkling lights above. They also have water features flowing (good white noise) and soothing music playing.

I really wanted to like this bar / restaurant since I'm a Sammy Hagar fan and they have live hard rock music most nights. Great location on the strip in PH. They have a really cool patio where you can look out over the strip and people watch. The patio gets busy so you need to get a spot early or hold onto it once you have it.. 

They have a mix of live music, karaoke and jam sessions with famous musicians including Sammy when he is in town. Bonus if your lucky enough to be around when this happens. The bands are very loud in the evening so not a place to have a quiet conversation.

They specialize in Sammy's own tequila - Cabo Wabo. I'm not a tequila expert by any means but this stuff is strong! You can have it straight up, in a mixed drink or in a frozen drink blend. I switched to Beer after the first tequila, unfortunately they had a limited selection.

Food is average. We had the nachos and home made Guac. which was both good and refreshing (lot's of cilantro). The fish tacos were good as was the burrito.  

Service was good, we were given a table quickly and received our drinks within minutes. Not sure if we had a new survey on my last visit but they were not overly familiar with the menu details. The server also gave us some recommendations for various bars to visit later in the evening.    

Prices were on the higher end for what you get which is why I rated Cabo 2.5 stars. I would go back depending on the live music in the evening but would grab dinner elsewhere before arriving. Stick with drinks and appetizers given all the food options in Vegas.",2013-01-05 19:28:27

For the last few years I've enjoyed them just as much if not more than all the GiorMalnati's East imports receiving disproportionate attention. I love their sauce. I love the crust so thick and heavy it may have its own gravitational pull that keeps drawing me in.

But most of my experiences with this brand have just been picking up to-go orders. Now it came time to give it a try in a full-service sports bar. Some of my favorite pizza while watching a Cards game sounds amazing, after all. 

But it really turned out to be a big fail here. I mean seriously, has management ever run a sports bar before? Here's what disliked. 

-No TV out on the patio, something virtually every sports bar should have. What a bummer considering the *perfect* Fall weather. 

-Sound was waaaay too quiet. I struggled to hear it from my table. When the game is on and most people are there to watch it, it NEEDS to be the center of attention.

We saw many great reviews on yelp for this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. It was pretty busy when we went in which was expected as it was a Friday night. We expected a wait but there was none & we were seated promptly. The waitress was completely in a hurry & seemed like she wanted us to order right away. Since we had never been to the restaurant, we were taking a look through the menu & trying to make a decision.

After a few moments, we decided to order the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, medium spice & the Pad Garlic Sauce with Chicken, medium plus spice. About 25 minutes after we had ordered, we finally got our order. No one checked on us during that time to let us know our food was coming or asked us if we wanted to order something while we waited as it was going to be a while. Considering how hungry we were, we definitely would've ordered an appetizer.

Like previously mentioned, the food was really good. The Drunken Noodles were full of flavor & the spice level was just right. The Pad Garlic Sauce was the same way. It came with a side of steamed mixed vegetables, which honestly, I wish they would've tossed them in the garlic sauce with the chicken but since it was a large bowl, I mixed together the rice & vegetables in it.

I've eaten at quite a few different Thai restaurants in the area & it seemed like the portion sizes at this restaurant were smaller than what they normally are. For the taste, I guess it could be argued that it was worth the cost ... Maybe.

After we had finished our meal, our waitress came back & dropped off the check. She didn't ask if we wanted any dessert or how our meal was (no one checked in with us while we were eating either). Not sure if we will come back .. If we do, it'll probably just be to pick up an order.",2014-09-14 17:13:09

My mom and I decided to try out a new joint for my birthday lunch and I found this place via my Yelp iPhone application (win!). This place is located on Central and Oregon (small side street) that we missed on our first attempt, but thanks to the Circle K reference sign, we found our way into the parking lot and found a spot without needing to use valet. 

We ordered an iced tea while we looked at the menu and decided we were going to start with the Cheddar Foundue, I was going to have the Mixed Grain Salad and my mom was going to have the Crab Cake BLT. Our waitress brought back our iced tea, we places our ordered, and then sipped our iced that turned out to be super tastey and was garnished with an orange. We were already off to a good start!

The cheddar fondue came out next with the tea light candle heat keeping the, generous  portioned, cheddar cheese nice a creamy to dip our sausage, apple slices, and delicious scrumptious pretzel bread. Anyone that comes here needs to order this app! The Mixed Grain Salad and the Crab Cake BLT were both equally as enjoyable. The sandwich came with three small crabcakes ontop of a toasted hoagie roll. We chose the roasted veggies, that were doused in oil, but that's want made is so scrumptious! The mixed grain salad was also scrumptious....but on the more healthier side! :)

The restaurant  is decorated in super cute retro style and there is a very large patio, with misters, to enjoy lunch/dinner/happy hour on. From beginning to end, our food (and drink) experiences were amazing and we will both be back really, really, seriously, really, soon!!!",2012-05-02 02:05:44

Chopt really takes salad to a new level.  They have a bunch of different types of lettuce, from romaine to kale, and feel free to mix/match two different kinds.  They also have a ton of toppings, from your standard cucumbers and tomatoes, to soba noodles and cotija cheese.  They also have a huge variety of dressings, so you can be as good or bad as you want on the calories.

There is one thing that stands out, and that's the destination salads.  If your'e one of those people that walks in and orders the same thing every time, I encourage you to try out one of their own creations.  They put some inventive combinations together so salad will never be boring to you again.

Tip from a pro.  If you pretty much know what you want, order your salad through the Chopt app!!!  Not only will you sip the ridiculous line that never seems to die down at any point in time during the day, but you can just pick up your salad and eat it there if you don't want it to go.  You can also earn Chopt points through the app!  The only downside is that you can't stand there and try different dressings/toppings.  You've gotta know what you want.

I absolutely love this place, so yes, I will be back again and again and again.  I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're starving and need instant food gratification.  Save that for a drive-through.  If you want to just get a really good lunch or dinner made your way, Chopt is a great place to go.",2017-01-17 19:19:08

Located in the Circus Jerkus casino which I would normally avoid but here we were. We Lyfted it over around 8pm or so and the place was pretty hopping. A number of families with little kids were seated near us so I guess you can so it's ok for families. Motley Crue gold records and guitars on the wall so it's like a Hard Rock Cafe centered around Motley Crue. A couple of the items are named after Motley Crue songs - Mac & Cheese Feelgoods Delight and Wild Side BBQ Bacon. I had the Wild Side BBQ Bacon. It was alright. I was starving. They had Lagunitas on draft of which I partook but their beer selection was rather limited. The karaoke host that night was very animated - not sure if I ever saw a host so full of energy. He would put on wigs and rock out with a blow-up guitar standing along the singer whenever they were singing a rock and roll type song. Either that or he would do a dance. Also he would give away prizes and keep the audience engaged with various tricks and audience participation games. The karaoke is done on a big stage and there is a little screen right in the middle where the lyrics get displayed. The microphone is even on a big microphone stand if you ever wanted to play rock star and channel your inner Steven Tyler or Vince Neil and do microphone stand tricks. Food was ok. Karaoke show was a bigger plus in my book. Disappointed that more menu items weren't named after Motley Crue songs. Here's a few suggestions: ""Droppin' Like"" Fries, Shout at the Devil Quesadilla, Smoke the Sky Salmon, Kickstart My Hearty Chili, Grilled, Grilled, Grilled Steak, Hammered Shrimp, Live Wire Burger, Knock 'Em Dead, Dip, Sticky Sweet Creme Brulee.

Large restaurant, t.v.s throughout, nice large bar that is separate from the dining area. 

We came with our kids so we knew that burgers and or pizza was going to be ordered that evening. As far as appetizers go, we got the Diablo tots which were indeed good. 

3 of the 5 in our family ordered burgers. Honestly, there isn't anything special about the burgers. One of the kids ordered the pizza, he ate it all so it must have been good. I ordered the roasted beet and goat cheese salad, I couldn't finish it, the arugula was too overpowering. Thought they would have mixed the arugula with some spring mix, I was wrong. 

One thing that had us talking was the kids menu. My 8 year old daughter ordered off of it, she got a burger and with that burger, she would also get an ice cream. On the kids menu they put that in no way will they let you take the ice cream to go, the way it was written was so unprofessional. It must have been an issue with families with kids wanting to get the ice cream off the kids menu to go. We all know when we have little kids, by the time dessert comes they are tired, so why not put the ice cream in a little cup and let the parents take them home WITH their ice cream? The only alternative is that you keep the tired kids there to get their ice cream and let other paying customers hear tired kids. LOL, doesn't make sense. Give parents the option to get the ice cream to go for their tired kids! It's almost comical how they have it written on the menu, almost insulting to parents.",2018-01-24 13:47:27

We love getting their mussels as an appetizer to share. I recommend any pasta here because their tomato juice is ""on point"".

We had zero wait although the place was somewhat packed even at 7:30 on a Tuesday. We started with pickle chips which were sliced a bit thicker than I remember at the Old Penguin- but the taste of the ranch and batter was the same. The 1/2 serving was huge- so share!

For my meal I went with the Greek Po'boy which was a lamb burger, feta, and tzatziki with french fries, slaw and a pickle.

Although it has a trendy design and comfortable  ambience, this cafe Mirage seeks to be an upscale eatery, which it falls to do. 

Although the setting is nice, the actual food and drinks, coupled with the prices, are subpar.

Shared a few rounds of beer with my friends. No real special beers to be offered here, and saying the price is above average would be an understatement. Expensive beers would only be tolerate at the Bier Markt downtown, and at least those beers are special and unique.

The coffee is terrible, possibly even worst than terrible, but I'd rather not waste the energy to think of another word, since the watered down coffee was unable to supply me with any caffine what so ever. For a cafe, you'd think that coffee would be the most essential aspect of the resturants repetoire.

The food we ordered were finger foods, hoping to have a delicious snack with our drinks. First the chicken wings, but more likely described as Chick wings, as they were tiny. tiny tiny tiny. The flavour was nothing special, and for the price, a complete rip off. We also ordered sweet potato fries, which too, was a tiny order for a heafty price. 

We dared not stay for dessert.

If you were thinking of going to this establishment, don't. You're better off going to the beer store or LCBO, picking up a six-pack, get some frozen wings and snacks, and enjoy it at home.

But this is the complete opposite of that. In my few times here, I have yet to hear a country song & there is nothing laid back about this bar.

The dance floor is huge & always crowded. The key is making it onto the stage area to the 2nd dance floor that's a little less crowded. The music is usually hip-hop & pop, & usually keeps the tempo upbeat. For me, it's a great place for someone that likes to dance to rap & hip-hop. But if you don't prefer the dance scene, you can hang out in the bull riding area to catch the willing getting tossed around. 

There are 2 main bars, along with beer tubs throughout. But if you have a card, expect to wait a good while at either bar to get a beer. And beer isn't cheap, so along with the $7 cover, expect to spend a good chunk of change here.

I can't believe the high-pressure sales tactics used at some of the other mattress stores around town.  With that said, I recommend Half Price Mattress.  They used to be known as Big Red Mattress: http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-red-mattress-henderson . I'm not sure what the story is behind the name change, but it doesn't really matter to me.

I've been in need of a mattress for a long time and stopped at Half Price on whim.  Christina, the sales person was very informative and very friendly.  There was no pressure to make a decision.  She gave us the facts and answered every question we had.  She urged us to lay on EVERY bed in the shop to figure out which one would best suit our needs.  At the end of our first visit, she urged us to shop around and do all the research we could.  After a couple weeks of shopping around and researching online, we came back and got a Cal King Euro Top for $900 including delivery.  

We purchased the bed on a Sunday and it was delivered by 10am the next day.  The delivery guy, Bob, was really nice and got the mattress upstairs rather quickly and without damage to it or the house.

The only concern I had was the brand.  It's a Kingdom Mattress Co. mattress.  I could find little to nothing online about the manufacturer (they don't even have a website).  But after looking all over town and talking to a friend in the mattress business in Houston, I decided to take the gamble.  So far, I am very pleased with everything.

The staff here was extremely friendly and the vibe of the restaurant has that neighborhood sandwich place kind of feel. It was not very busy and had little wait for our food. Oh and there were some cops eating there too, so that tells you the food is good right there.

Once I tried the first bite of that sandwich, after taking pictures of it for Yelp of course, I was immediately a fan. Everything about this sandwich was great, the bread, the meat, the toppings, couldn't think of a single complaint about it. It even came with a lollipop!! Everyone I was with was saying the same thing about their orders as well. In fact, it was so goodI actually ordered a sandwich ""To Go"" to eat later.

I got the feeling that all the waiters were simply very fast paced and if they thought you didn't need them, they simply scurried about their business. 

We went to Happy Hour right when it started at 3p on a Sunday. The menu is overly large and exciting which made us very indecisive. So we started off ordering only a few things with the plan to order more from there. Here's all of what we ordered and what I thought. 

Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus - pretty simple and hard to mess up. But with all the other exciting options, I'd pass on it next time. 

Sweet Cheese Corn - one of my favorites! It was sweet, but not too sweet. And adding cheese never hurts. I would definitely order this again!

Fried Wontons - This is obviously of staple of just about every Asian menu. They were yummy as always, but not noticeably different from any other place. 

Filet Mignon - Again, very simple. But so enjoyable. Be responsible and don't over-cook it! The meat quality was great and is very tender and delicious when you keep it medium rare. I would order this again. 

Bulgogi - Very easy to over-cook due to the thin slices. But if you watch it, it comes out very tender and the marinade was everything I wanted! I would definitely order this again!

Cream Cheese Wontons - The wonton wrapper was super thin and delicate. It had the perfect light Crunch before breaking through to the cream Cheese. The sweet sauce it came with was great! I would order these again!

Chicken Karrage - I had never had this anywhere. So I was surprised to see that the pieces of fried chicken were cut in all different shapes and sizes. In fact, at first I thought the waiter had brought us the wrong thing. I thought it was fried calamari! The chicken itself didn't have much flavor. But the spicy dipping sauce it came with was great! Not sure I'd bother ordering it again, though....

Korean Chicken Cheese Fondue - I enjoyed this chicken even more than I expected! I loved the Crunch that developed from grilling! While the insides remained tender. The cheese came in a little foil bowl. It was shredded and cold and immediately put of the grill. It tasted like an American cheese. I would get this chicken again. 

Vanilla Ice Cream Macaron Sandwich - the Macaron was purple and I'm not sure what flavor it was meant to be - it simply tasted sweet to me. Even after being frozen, it still had that perfect Macaron chew. And the vanilla ice cream was so creamy and smooth!

We had a great time at this place and will definitely be back to try more!",2017-01-17 06:34:56

Complimentary Tortilla Chips with two types of salsa were warm but rather hard.  Much better was a very cold Lump Crab Guacamole app, served with bits of oranges, radish, and jalapenos paired with hard and round but flat fried tortillas.  It was an exciting and surprising mix of sweet and spicy flavors.

A medium-sized bowl of Pozole Soup with Guajillo Broth, Seasoned Pulled Pork, Hominy, cabbage, onions, and cilantro was quite tasty.  Not that I needed it, but I also cashed in a Yelp check in for a Grilled Corn on the Cob with Cotija Cheese and Mayo Butter, which I found to be somewhat sour.

While Diane liked her Baja Burger of a bun-enclosed 1/2 lb. hamburger patty with ham and very tasty skinny Fries, the star of the show for me was a very filling and tasty Carne Asada Burrito containing Pico De Gallo, Mexican Cheese Blend, rice, sour cream, and refried beans.  To top it off, I had it covered with Chimichanga Sauce divided in thirds: Red Sauce, Green Sauce, and Cheese Sauce.

To finish on a cool note, I opted for an order of Fried Ice Cream, which consisted of a large ball of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream covered with Coconut Chips and Frosted Flakes, accompanied by assorted mini-fruits and Strawberry Sauce.  It was a very good ending.  Service was excellent in a convivial Mexican fiesta-like setting, with wood furniture and pinatas swinging overhead.",2018-05-31 05:40:06

My favorite sandwich is the Green Goddess (chicken salad). The portions are large, and the side salad that comes with the sandwich is enough for a whole meal.  You can upgrade this sandwich by adding bacon. Either way, the sandwich is amazing.

They greeted us and asked if we had a reservation and we didn't, but they sat us anyway. We were a party of 6. There were two tables sat and two people at the bar in the whole restaurant. Anyway, my sisters had been here previously and had the $1 oysters so we were expecting to get a bunch of those. Our server was a lady and we didn't quite get her name. My friend asked for a certain beer and they didn't have it. My two sisters wanted the grapefruit beer but they only had one bottle left so they had to share it. There were no $1 oysters on the board so we were quite disappointed. We ended up getting an assortment of 18 oysters that were $2.50 each, you have to order by 6. they were really good oysters with pretty good sauces. My husband and I got the hot pot and the pork belly kimchi fried rice. The hot pot was pretty small for $21 and wasn't as good as I thought it was gonna be. They also had these bowls that stuck to the table so almost everyone of us, including our server ended up tipping it over. The kimchi fried rice was the highlight of our night. Really flavorful and the pork belly was nice and tender. Our table also ordered the deviled eggs, oyster Rockefeller, and chicken wings. The deviled eggs and oyster Rockefeller were pretty tasty. We were nearly done with everything when my sister asked our server when the chicken wings will be ready. She had a look on her face but quickly said it should be out any minute now. It came out about 10-15 minutes later confirming our suspicions that they forgot. Chicken wings finally came out and I grabbed one to split with my husband, they were whole chicken wings. It was pretty bloody so I told them to check all the wings and 2 out of 4 was bloody so we told our server. She said that that's how it is and that it's safe to eat. It was too red for us so we ended up just not eating it. With all that said, we don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. I really wanted to love the place because of all the great reviews and hype but I think it fell a little short on both food and service.

One of the funniest happenings of the evening, besides the plates used as giant eyes or flat boobs was the server who did not hide her emotion well at all.  When we asked for separate checks she was not happy at all.

What I DO NOT understand is how a person who works mostly for tips doesn't jump at the chance for separate checks.  More checks equals more and bigger tips - say yes, act nice and get more money.  She wasn't rude at all, it was just humorous to see her distaste at the request.

Nine of us rolled in - it was pretty quiet outside of us.  In fact, we were able to request pizzas for the buffet they had.  It worked out well.  Good breadsticks - tasty and fresh.

The kids (and some of adults - I'll admit it) went to the back to play some video games.  It's a nice distraction if you have to wait for food.

Couldn't find the one I wanted and left to head home, but decided to check out Subaru next door. Was greeted immediately by Travis Gudknecht(? not sure how to spell!). He had just the right demeanor for me, low-key but very personable, great smile, and also very knowledgeable about the cars. We took multiple test drives in the Outback and the Forester so I could compare, not even sure how many times I repeated in each, but he was so patient. Fell in love with the Outback and can't believe how many features there are for the money. The interior is beautiful (I was a little disappointed by my beloved Hondas!) and it is so quiet and comfy. Every single person I have encountered at Subaru has been terrific, and they treat you like you're the most important customer they have ever had. I paid for the extra treatments to the paint and interior and they gave me a loaner to use days before it could be scheduled, so nothing would happen to the finish on my long commute. Had to take it back due to a little residue from the treatment, and I barely had pulled up and someone came out to greet me and find out the problem, whisked the car away and brought it back all sparkling clean.

The sides are very good as well - the slaw is nice, the cornbread is not overly sweet (which is a good thing). The baked beans are maybe just average.

I was at a local Irish Bar last night and met the owner though and found out he had started up this place only a few months ago. He noted that he had to be up and making bagels at 2 am (baker's hours indeed!). I promised I would come by this morning and check it out. Well, I'm glad I did, he has a lovely establishment and a great selection of freshly made bagels. I bought both the black pepper Parmesan and the Jalapeno cheddar bagels and also the bacon and horseradish and the Italian herbs and chives smear. I also had a chance to say high to the owner again who had indeed, been up early, making all the bagels in the bagel bins. 

The bagel type he makes reminds me of Noah's bagels that I've had in Los Angeles, being more of the lighter style of bagel versus the extremely chewy New York style of bagel. The nice thing, certainly makes them easier to slice when you get home (though you can get them toasted and smeared at the establishment.

I noticed that you can also get your bagel with Lox (sorry, not a huge fan of the smoked fish on a bagel but I know many people love it) and the establishment also makes a nice array of coffee based drinks (the store has an espresso machine) and teas, and they have fresh brewed iced tea.

I will say I certainly look forward to going back and trying some of the other bagels and it's nice to see someone successfully starting and running his own business who obviously knows what he's doing.   Oh, when you drive up, the signage above the story says ""Bagels & Coffee"" - the name of the business is on the glass window so you know, that is the place. 

My only request, think about a peppercorn potato bagel - it's my favorite one at Noah's in California. Looking forward to my next visit and hearing more of the owner's story about how he got into the bagel business - I only heard a bit of it at the Irish bar but it sounds fascinating.

P.S. - he also employees extremely nice and well-mannered kids from the local high school so when you support this place, you not only get some great bagels and coffee but you support a local business that provides work opportunities for young people in the community, so a win-win all the way around.;-)",2015-08-09 16:33:26

Restaurant Week gave me the push to try Lao Sze Chuan.  I probably wouldn't have stopped here but for their being on the Restaurant Week list.   Their menu actually is four courses and they have flexibility with their offering.

After asking for the Restaurant Week menu, the server brought it to me and explained that I could mix both the appetizers and the mains with smaller portions so you could try more.  Instead of getting three pot stickers, I was able to order 1 Shanghai egg roll, 1 chicken egg roll, and 1 pork pot sticker.  For the main course, I was allowed to get half portions of any two dishes so I ordered the three chili chicken and the lemon shrimp.  I opted for the hot and sour soup and for dessert I ordered the coconut ice cream.

My iced tea was brought quickly and I took the time to enjoy the beautiful room.  It is very nice.  Soon a gentleman brought my hot and sour soup.  When I was halfway through the soup, my server brought me the appetizer.  I just don't understand this lack of serving separate courses that I've experienced in Asian restaurants--twice during this Restaurant Week period.  The hot and sour soup was very good and I wish I had some time to savor the flavors after finishing before having to dig into the appetizer.  The egg rolls were OK.  The pot sticker was a bit of a letdown.  One side was not completely done and had a doughy taste.  With the appetizer I got soy, hot mustard, and sweet and sour sauce.  

The main courses were large servings.  A full serving would be a large amount of food for sure.  The lemon shrimp was very good and consisted of 11 shrimp if I counted correctly.  The three chili chicken was good but it wasn't as spicy as I like.  What kick there was came from cracked pepper in the batter and hot sesame oil.  The plate had a lot of oil from the chicken.  

The coconut ice cream was very good and a nice way to end the meal.  The ice cream not only had a coconut flavor but also had toasted coconut flakes mixed throughout.  Very refreshing.

The service was a mixed bag here.  My server, Rachel, was quite good.  She brought me a fresh iced tea when my first one was only half finished.  She was very pleasant, had a great smile, and if she had been doing all the serving, I have a feeling the soup and the apps wouldn't have overlapped.

This could be a four star place.  I'd recommend they watch the courses and space them out a bit more.  I was in and out of the restaurant in just over 45 minutes.  Give me a little more time to savor the separate parts of the meal.",2015-06-23 22:27:11

I enjoyed the small plates of food, but nothing knocked my socks off. I did really enjoy the dates wrapped in bacon, glazed in the gooey, sweet sauce.

Paella was done very well, and used great ingredients, so it's worth the $50 or so. The bottom was artfully burnt for a crispy bottom, aka. soccarat. The ""burnt"" rice was not bitter at all. I had the meat paella, and it was delish. Last time I had a seafood paella, and I definitely prefer the meat one because it just tasted more rich (surprise, surprise). No, but seriously, the seafood in the seafood paella is a bit dull tasting in my opinion. Yes, the flavour of the seafood is seeped into the rice, but I guess I just personally liked the meat one more, because it had more oomph...But they could use less salt in the paellas.

Our main waiter was a bit aggressive, and was also kind of rude when we were about to pay. Generally, the other ones were fine.

Their dessert menu is large and interesting. 

Paella is good to share between three people, or two large-portioned people, if you order a few tapas items.

I don't really like to drink but I love a good hamburger and fried appetizer which pretty much defines bar food in Madison, Wisconsin.  As my search continues to find new and delicious burgers my husband and I decided to check out Mr. Brews Taphouse a little late on a Friday night.  We arrived at this location around 10:00pm to  find it full but not crowded.  It has a nice sports bar atmosphere and it was noisy but not to the point that we couldn't have a calm conversation.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese burger and the Kentucky Bourbon burger with all the fixins as well as a side of the Pub chips.  The burger were both tasty and well done, however the Kentucky Burbon burger was a favorite with a bourbon sauce mayo and a generous portion of bacon.  The pub chips were topped with a very generous portion of delicious beer cheese sauce, bacon bits and scallions.  All in all we had so much food we could barley finish it and all of this along with the beer my husband ordered came to about $25 too (a little less than we usually pay for something similar  at other restaurants in Madison).  I will warn you that the menu is pretty much limited to cheese curds, burgers (including a couple burger alternatives like black bean patties and a turkey burger), fries and chips, and a single salad choice, so if you need more choices than that, this wouldn't be the restaurant for you.

It has a massive parking lot around back that was not lit but scattered with bottles. There were a few cars and a dim light coming from a well-hidden door to the alley; had I not been with a group, I might have turned my car around at this point.
After entry, there is no sign which door to enter, rather something like ""Yes, we are open. Try this door. If it doesn't work, try the other."" I only found out once I read the reviews that upstairs is 5-pin (downstairs is 10).
I guess I'm used to paying only for shoes at the start then getting a lane and paying for the time used; here it was all up-front and from my first impression it looked like they might have had a few instances of bowl and dash that led to the practice. 
The lane itself was is lousy shape. Right in front of the foul line the boards were bare and falling apart, totally throwing off a bowl. There seemed to be a patch we worked through in our time there that pushed each ball bowled over 11 mph (the screen showed our bowling speed) to the left abruptly before the pins.
A few lanes over, a ""bowler"" was launching the ball in the air and it came to a thud about a third of the way down the lane. Our group remarked that any alley owner/manager/staff that cared would have put a quick end to that; the staff here allowed that to carry on.

I will definently be going there on a regular basis. I hadnt had my hair done in 2 months and after talking to him a bit about what i wanted, he hit the nail on the head. I wanted mostly blonde on top with my highlights and not one drab color and he brightened it up beautifully. I also asked him to keep as much length as possible but give me some volume with my layers and he did great! Would reccomend this place to anyone!

Also got my toes done by Kapua, she is awesome as well! Very friendly and gentle with my very ticklish feet!

Very happy over all experience with Aspen dont have one bad thing to say!

It came out VERY thing and served with some sliced veggies and some crispy pita bread sorta thing.  The side items were very good, and I did actually like the hummus but it needed more carribean kick in the flavor and not be so thin and bland.

I tried their new Shrimp and 4 cheese grits.  The dish was made perfect and so were the grits but again everything was bland. It needs more kick in the flavor dept.  

The pineapple upside down chocolate cake was soooooooooo yummmy though.  Their seafood chowder is always good, and I've had their black beans and fish tacos many times and it is definitely yummmy.

So I made reservations about 6 weeks prior to Bastille Day, for brunch, we had a group of 10, so I wanted to make sure I gave plenty of notice (I'm a planner). I arrive the day of, led out to the patio area, and the hostess says, I'm so sorry, I thought we had the table ready. So I'm led to another area of the patio and seated. It's July 11, and when I made the reservation, I wasn't anticipating sitting outside, so I didn't bother requesting inside. I see there are quite a few people outside, and they had fans going, so I decided to toughen up and enjoy it (I love outside dining, just not when it's 108 degrees out). As we are sitting there, the misters would shoot on for 2 seconds and shut off, I asked our waitress if there was any way they could leave them on, she said they ""were working on it"". As the table is sitting there, all of us are dressed up, we are all dripping with sweat and having a hard time enjoying ourselves. As we are leaving, the hostess apologizes for the heat and asked us ""did your waitress tell you what happened"" we said no, she said a customer had decided to try and redirect one of the misters directly on him and it broke the entire system, the hostess then followed it up with ""your waitress should've offered to move you girls inside"". Little late now. Also, I had a restaurant.com voucher that I attempted to use, if anyone is familiar with those, they are very specific on the voucher about day, times, etc about when you can use them. My voucher only stated not valid on alcohol. So, they would not accept my voucher because they said their system is only set up to accept the vouchers for dinner (does not state this anywhere) the mgr claimed he has been meaning to contact them to correct it. That's my rant. 

The food. Our brunch was amazing. Every single dish. A few stand outs were, French Toast, Lobster Salad Croissant and of course the Croque Madame. The Creme Brûlée was delicious, I attempted to get the bread pudding, but they were out of vanilla ice cream, and the waitress tried talking me into subbing mango ice cream instead, which sounded terrible together. 

I enjoyed my food enough to overlook the service issues we had and to come back and dine again.",2014-07-19 01:22:02

I'm pretty loyal to the nearby Learned Owl bookstore at Open Door Coffee Company and decided to adventure into the plaza behind them on Main Street.

If you're a cook, you'll really dig the huge selection of hot sauces, salsas, BBQ's, snacks, condiments, sea salts, peppercorns, herbs, spices and sauces. Admittedly, I'm not a huge cook, but I really loved shopping their tea accessories and select homewares. I purchased strawberry-kiwi loose leaf tea that smells heavenly and a new tea infuser in the form of a babushka gal (its too cute).

This is a cool place to stop into if you need a little something to jazz up a meal or purchase some fancy jams/honeys/etc. for entertaining purposes to impress your fancy friend or annoying relatives. The owner is super passionate about what she does, so don't be shy to ask her for suggestions.

Interior and atmosphere was very nice smelled of wood fire which was lovely. Only complaint would be that the tables were super close together which made a bit of a tight squeeze getting in and out. Another down side was the arguing couple right next to us who was almost elbow to elbow. It felt like the crazy lady was kinda yelling at me bc of how close they were. It was even harder to look away bc I could see her frowny face from the corner of my eye without even trying 


* Get Off The Lawn was very strong. Served with an orange peel and a very very small beef jerky that is supposed to be eaten while you drink ..gonna need a much bigger piece of jerky to go with that drink tho lol

* Model T - was good. Cucumber was very refreshing 

* Beef Cheek & Marrow Dumplings - We ordered this to start when we ordered our drinks but it never came out bummer bc I really wanted to try this. (We probably sat at our table foodless for at least 30 mins) 

* Duck & Foie Gras - Amazeballs!! This was the first food item to come out to our table. Comes with 3 slices of duck breast over wood ear mushrooms topped with a good piece of foie gras in a savory sauce.

* Butcher Wings - sold by per wing. Really liked the wood fired char taste to it. Very moist as a wing should be. 

* Argentinean Red Shrimp - Served with 3 shrimps with heads on a plate. Really enjoyed the sauce it came in 

* Beef Carpaccio - Good 

* Sweetbreads - Good. Haven't had good sweetbreads since Rosemarys was still open. Loved everything about this dish from the sweetbreads to grilled baby romaine wrapped with bacon to the sweet english peas and pea shoots 

Tres Leches - kinda torn on this one. Served with the cake on the bottom and a chocolate Hennessy moose on top with chocolate tuilles. I'm a Hennessy shot drinker myself but the amount of cognac in the moose made the flavor too strong to enjoy. If you love the strong taste of cognac then you will like this cake more than I did.

Overall the food is good. The portions are on the smaller size but you are paying the higher price for the better quality. After being open for 1 month the service could be better. Our server was nice but she did not check back on us often. After she took our drink order and failed to put in our dumpling order she never came back to take our food order. We had to wave her down after we finished our drinks to take our food order then had to ask another server for a dessert menu. We will be back to try the other yummy items on the menu.

Quill Creek Cafe offers both inside and outside dining options. Cool evenings you might enjoy the comfort of their giant outside fireplace. Warm evenings are cooled by circulating fans and occasionally the feel of well positioned misters. Prices are reasonable and the selection is robust enough to satisfy most everyone in your party. My favorite selection on the menu would be the wings. They cook them crisp and season with either buffalo or ranch. Can't decide, order them 50/50. Wine prices are excellent and they have a selection of finer wines priced more on the retail side and not the inflated restaurant prices we are all used to seeing.

JSB3Sz-2CLRRUyCJHy-NOg,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,0p0PqX7Zsm_0lvXzEWpwWA,5,4,1,3,"First off, I just want to say this is an awesome library as far as libraries go.

And this is now my LVCCLD library of choice.  It is located conveniently close to where I live now (SW Las Vegas).  And before that when I crashed at a friend's condo for month without a steady Internet, it is where I would literally drive down the block to surf the web, check out the DVD library and of course the cookbooks and magazines.

I almost always leave the library with at least 20-30 cookbooks, and most of them are in great condition.  Of course we also have patrons that can not be bothered to xerox a few pages and decided to ripe out entire section on sauces and dips in Nobu's cookbook that is beautiful enough to be a coffee table book. But I digress.

This particular library is probably the best looking structure out of the ones I have visited thus far in Las Vegas, and is more beautiful than many libraries I have been to in California.  Parking is usually not an issue, but can get rather scarce when special events are scheduled (book reading for children).

Since it is part of the LVCCLD it has access to a vast collection of books distributed across the library system, of which I am mostly interested in the cookbooks and related topics. And they have some very nice selections of high end books in this category.

For patrons interested in borrowing DVDs, you can place your requests on future releases and wait for an email alerting you to go pick it up.  Or you can browse the selections of DVDs on shelves located on the 2nd floor.

For music lovers, the CDs are located on the main floor on the right, just past the self-check out stations.  I have never used this service, but see plenty of people take advantage of the collection, especially on weekends.

The periodicals available is decent.  And you can check out the ones that is not the latest issue.  The only thing i don't like is that the system does not tell you what it is you are checking out, just the barcode.  So if you check out a lot of magazines like me, it can be a chore to try and track down the ones that has to due for a return.
 
As mentioned by other reviews, the Internet access is free, and takes a few steps to get connected. 

With the summer heat, I sometimes like to just go and check out what new cookbooks or magazines are available for purchase in the used book store.  Then spend the rest of the time in the library reading or surfing the web in the cool comfort of the library's air conditioned complex.  But unfortunately with the severe budget crisis affecting the country, state, and municipalities, LVCCLD has recently been forced to eliminate several staff positions and reduced the hours of operation.  

New hours of operation at Sahara West:
M - Th, 10 a.m. - 7 p.m.
F - Sun, 10 a.m. - 6 p.m

And here is a quick summery about this library from the webpage:
The Sahara West Library features a computer center with 12 public computer workstations, a 150-seat multipurpose room, a 45 seat board room, a 35 seat meeting room, and a used bookstore. The library houses the International Language Collection, a collection of books, magazines, newspapers and videos in 37 different languages. It also offers free wireless Internet access.",2010-07-16 00:40:57

The ambience is not quite 'fine' fine dining, more of a contemporary steakhouse. Not a bad thing at all, just be advised if you're looking for truly romantic, this is probably not it. Regardless, the food befits the title of fine dining without any consideration.

Began with the short rib ravioli. While smaller in portion, the flavor was unparalleled, including the apples and carrots included. Highly recommended.

As for steak, spend the money. It's a fair bit, but do it DO. IT. I'm talking, of course, about the Mishima reserve wagyu. The rib cap was divine. Melt in your mouth, lose your mind perfection. It doesn't quite stand to A5 kobe, but the price differential between the two may as well be the Grand Canyon. A bernaise sauce complements the steak well. I recommend the medium rare wagyu rib cap.

Sides. Oh my God, sides. If you don't order the potatoes au gratin, you're a fool. Plain and simple. I probably gained 2 pounds from this side alone, and I don't care. One of the best sides in the city. Period. 

Oh crap, almost didn't mention the complimentary duck fat fries with tasting sauces. If you've never had these, you've never had fries. This redefines the experience.

You will absolutely pay for this meal. And it is absolutely worth it. I'll be back again...and again...and again!

I warn families to maybe show up and find out how the process works before considering hosting a party.

When we first arrived we had been treated by our party host who was friendly but didn't share the chain of events that would unfold and how. Then she disappeared and we had to track her down around an hour and a half later to find out where the food was to feed our guest. The food didn't show until 15 minutes before the party was supposed to be over. I kept hearing this snotty unwelcoming host upset that we over stayed and was trying to rush us out, when all we had was was 15 minutes for food and cake. I kept being reminded by the host that we had to leave for the next party to come in. We had to ask for more plates, silverware and cups since the room wasn't set up with enough for everyone. When we needed refills for pizza no one was to be found. In fact, we had all these drink cups and no one showed us where to get drinks. It was like here you go and the girls disappeared and if you attempted to locate them the attitude was rude and unwelcoming. The communication was not there what so ever.

I went around 11:30ish and the place was packed.  The line to order your sandwich had about 4 or 5 people in it ahead of me, but they had 3 registers going so it moved quickly.  I had just the right amount of time to check out their menu board and figure out which sandwich to order.  I ordered the #9 Combo, the Firehouse Hero.  The combo is sandwich with chips & drink which came to $8.94 which is pretty pricey.  The Firehouse Hero has  roast beef, smoked turkey breast, honey ham, and melted provolone.  You can get it ""Fully Involved"" which is mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a dill spear on the side.  I got my drink and sat down to wait for my sandwich.  I didn't time it, but it probably took about 5 minutes to get my sandwich.  Which to me seemed a long time.  But, I was able to order immediately and get my drink so I didn't have to stand in line while they made my sandwich.  The sandwich was hot and the provolone was melted across the top.  The meats were juicy and tasty.  Overall a pretty good sandwich.   If there weren't other sandwich shops I would probably go here, but $9 for a sandwich, chips and drink is just to high when you can go to Subway or Quiznos and get about the same thing for less money.

The options for the hotpot was small and not very diverse/unique.  The service micro-managed our order form.  I wanted to order 6 orders of the beef (which isn't alot, considering it was only 8 slices per order) and he said that i should order a smaller amount and order more when we have cooked/eaten all of the order.  We took his ""advice"" and ordered as we finished.  The order fulfillment was pretty slow.  It would take about 10 mins for them to bring out the next round of food.  

The soup was bland.  They did not give us enough condiments.  Between the 5 of us, we had to share 3 different condiment bowls, 3 scoops, & 2 ladles.  The table was small, so it make it really hard to pass the condiments and ladles around.  

I would NOT recommend this place for the hot pot.  $24.95 per adult (2 adult+).",2016-01-21 19:21:03

As for the meal itself, it was good. Not the best but pretty good.  I had the ground beef Quesadilla. It was a bit too salty for my liking (and I like salty). The hot sauce and the Guacamole were really delicious. 

The Décor is simple and I think it's still working out the details but sometimes less is more and this seems to be the case.

The fiancé sat down at the bar immediately and I ran to the facilities. I say that to say this: I came back and the bartender proceeded to ignore us for the next 15 minutes. Actively! Like, looking alllll the way around us while serving other patrons. Apparently, he said hi to the fiancé while I was gone, but didn't do or say anything after that. Really? We don't even have a water glass in front of us at the very least and we're sitting at the bar. This doesn't look weird to you? Fine. Whatever. 

Another woman comes out of the back to help and about 5 seconds after that, the bartender comes over to introduce himself to me and asks us if we want some water. Seriously? Whatever. Better late than never, I guess. She comes over right after him and automatically prepares water for us because she sees we don't have any. We place our orders and wait. They have these little food trays that go on the side of the bar to make it easier for you to get to your food. Two of them sat next to us dirty the entire time. But the bartender found new, clean ones and gave them to these customers he couldn't wait to help as soon as they came in. Nothing makes me more annoyed than being ignored and seeing new patrons get super service. What the hell, dude? Is it me? I just got here! What could I possibly have done to you?

Anyway, I chalked up the service to an off night because I usually have a relatively decent experience here and just made a note not to sit at the bar anymore. Then I got my food. The sirloin looked fine, tasted meh. The asparagus? It was burnt as hell. I seriously wondered how you could plate that and bring it to someone. When the lady from the back came out to check on us, I asked for some new vegetables. When she brought them back out, she said they were already making new ones for me before she got back there. Which makes no sense. If you knew they were that bad, why would you plate them? They were hoping I ate it without a fuss and somebody else's cook time just got pushed back. The whole thing was just deflating. Next time we feel like some Outback, we'll just go to LongHorn.",2015-09-27 13:21:35

I would have never thought to come here for a six pack, but needing to get one for a party and having read that many beer distributors don't sell them (gah, PA liquor laws), I asked my labmate where I could pick one up, and she suggested the O.  Of course, I forgot the cash only policy (under $10 orders), so I had to run around to find a functional ATM (the one on Forbes was out of service).  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for me, since I usually carry some cash, but having just returned from a trip, I was fresh out.  Ten minutes of running around later, I was able to purchase my Mike's and be on my way.

When I ate in, I came here for dinner with a couple of friends on a Fri. night around 6:30.  One of my friends suggested it, since he'd heard that CNN rated their french fries as some of the best in the country.  We ordered a medium order of fries, and there were plenty enough for all three of us to share with no problem.  Although I don't know if I'd concur with CNN's verdict, they were definitely some of the best thin-cut fries I've had in PGH, speaking as someone who doesn't usually care much for thin-cut fries (for thick-cut fries, I recommend the Pub Chip Shop).  We also ordered the cheese sauce and the gravy dips to go with the fries (note: they charged for all of them), and although the cheese sauce went with them well (it's your typical Velveeta-type cheese fry dip), I was underwhelmed by the gravy, which I found salty and greasy.  In addition to the fries, I ordered a chicken gyro, which was dry and flavorless, and a chocolate milkshake, which was thick and delicious.  I can't comment on the hot dogs, since I don't eat beef, so I'll have to defer to other reviewers for that.  If I come back, I think I'll just get the fries and the milkshake, and maybe try dipping the fries in the milkshake, Frosty-style.

The atmosphere is grungy, so don't expect it to be the cleanest place you've ever eaten.   Service was curt when I ordered dinner, but was okay more recently.  Although I haven't been here late at night, I understand that they charge a premium for the food at that hour to subsidize the rent-a-cop that they keep on hand to avoid brawling between drunk customers.  It's worth trying once, but I don't know that I'll be back unless I have a craving for fries or am looking for late night eats.",2014-06-15 17:05:04

I also steal a lot of their green sauce. It's delicious and I use one cup on each taco and a few for my chips if i get any. Sometimes I just want to stop in and get chips and 6 sauces.. And I do. It's a weakness!! I'm a huge fan of the carne asada nachos. They are so big and delicious but I can't order them a lot. It's too much food for me and day two isn't as good.

Watermelon Kimuchi (3/5) - I think considering the rave reviews I read, this was pretty disappointing. Lacked the acidity I feel is really important in any good kimchi. 

Wings (4/5) - Great! Tasty but a bit too salty and not particularly special in any way. 

East Coast Salmon Sashimi (4/5) - Really fresh, came with really good wasabi, but not worth the 12 bucks we paid for the 7 pieces we got.

Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi (5/5) - Superb! Definitely get this if available. 

Beef Tongue (5/5) - So good! Just make sure you don't cook it on the hot stone too long or it'll be tough. 

Uni and Scallop Rice (2/5) - I'm sorry but I hated this! Cooked uni? No thanks.

Toro Pressed Sushi (1/5) - This was the worst dish of the night. The fish was clearly not fresh--it was tough and stringy and I ended up eating less than one piece. 

Pork Tantan Ramen (4/5) - Good, but once again, way too salty. The noodles were yummy though. 

Soft Tofu with Mushroom (5/5) - HANDS DOWN the best dish of the night. The skin of the tofu was soooo tasty. 

All desserts (3.5/5) - We got the pudding, the creme brûlée and the gelato. The pudding and the brûlée were good, but the gelato was so lacklustre.

Their food is pretty good and the service is OK. Nothing wrong but nothing great either. I was definitely a little disappointed because the location on Eastern and 215 has such excellent customer service and is always busy but this place almost felt like it was closed and customer service was just OK because she felt like she was just there to do a job while their Eastern and 215 location is informative and make you feel welcomed. Also, their portions seemed a bit smaller than I usually get.
As a reply to the owner comment: I am aware that I can add additional toppings because I order the exact same bowl every time and that is how I can tell that the portions are smaller. This is a preselected bowl on your menu, not one that I created myself. The amount of customers that a store serves should not determine whether they serve larger or smaller portions.

So, I came back nearly a year later to try out this location one more time. This time my portion was up to par but, within less than an hour of eating here, I became sick to my stomach and vomited the rest of the day!

There's a new late night spot to hang out in that isn't the Lied Library. It's equipped with free wi-fi, plenty of power outlets, and an arsenal caffeinated drinks to keep you jolted.

3pm Cafe offers a wide variety of teas ranging from fruit and milk teas, along with an assortment of smoothies and non-caffeinated beverages. You can come here hungry too, since they offer apps and entrees. Most of the menu consists of dishes originating from Taiwan, with some popular Japanese fare like chicken katsu bento boxes and katsu curry. After a brief chat with the staff, they seemed to take most pride in their homemade Taiwanese dishes, so it would probably be best to give those a try.

Here's what I tried on my first visit:
-Minced Pork Over Rice - A simple, yet very comforting Taiwanese dish.
-Iced Coffee Milk Tea w/ Boba - I admit that I'm not much of a boba drinker, but I enjoyed this. It was a refreshing beverage that catered to my coffee addiction.
-Popcorn Chicken - I was brought out a sample of this dish. It was a bit salty, but in a satisfying way. It was very tender and flavorful. I wouldn't mind getting this over rice.

Walking in, you get some top-notch service, with clarification on menu items if you're unsure of what to get. The staff never hesitated to make sure I was happy with my meal. I even had a sweet little old lady come out to check if I liked the food. Apparently, she was the mind that went behind the delicious recipes on the menu.

I could definitely see myself regularly dropping by this spot for a quick lunch or for a much-needed study session.

As my kiddo whispered upon arrival, ""This isn't fancy, there's no white table cloth.""  Haha, correct.  But still, I loved the very open and airy decòr of the space.  The exposed beams gave it a lofty lodge feel.

Fortunately, they had plenty of parking, often times an issue in the CenPho and Arcadia areas.  We arrived moments before our reservation and were seated promptly.  Our server was very attentive.  He came right over, offered suggestions and offered small talk about the day.  He was a great server.

We ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits and expected light fluffy moist biscuits, but I will caution you not to expect that.  The biscuits are rustic and not fluffy at all.  They were hard, in fact.  Unfortunately, and I'm sure you can guess, we didn't find the biscuits pleasing to our palates at all.

For our entrees, we tried a Steamed Bass and the Mac and Cheese.  The steamed bass came over a mixture of veggies, including broccoli and other root veggies.  The fish entree was edible.  My child didn't find the Mac and cheese pleasing at all and therefore didn't eat it.

I wanted to love this place as so many do.  Alas, none of our food was good to us there.  Definitely not good enough to make a repeat trip.  However, great server and atmosphere.

Now the difficulty of choosing between the sweet (which we were here for) and the salty (which also seemed well reviewed). Alas, we got both - and thankfully we did! Both very well balanced and refreshing. The RICOTTA (SALTY) - with sauteed broccolini, pine nuts, parmesan, and dried currents, served alongside ricotta drizzled in olive oil and a healthy sprinkling of black pepper. beautiful combination of creamy, crunchu, chewy, salty, sweet, bitter, hot, cold. Everything. The RICOTTA (SWEET) was far less complex in ingredients but just as flavourful. Orange zest, (possibly orange-infused) honey, and salt flakes garnishing ricotta. Both are incredibly refreshing and different enough that it didn't seem like we were overloading on the ricotta. Both also came with enough slices of crusty bread to scoop it all up, except we got an extra CHEESE CROISSANT for good measure. More of the chewy than flaky-and-crumble-all-over-your-face type. not bad at all but the cheese was unnecessary in this pairing.

Decor is so homey (with the cutest menu illustrations on the wall), and there's a comfortable amount of natural light.

To start, we ordered the escargot (which I'm told might have actually been periwinkle) and the salmon rillette. The escargot was doused in butter and garlic, which I unashamedly sopped up with bread. The salmon rillette was served on endives which, in my opinion, allows you to appreciate the flavours way more than some crusty old cracker or toasted bread. 

For the mains, we ordered the blackened cod and the fried chicken. The cod was perfectly cooked and served in the most oozingly delicious beurre blanc. Honestly, if we were sitting in a dark corner I would have licked that plate clean. The fried chicken was crisp and tender and seasoned to perfection. If the chicken connoisseur ever tried it, he might put this in contention for the pengest munch. Plus, the garlic chips it comes served with... are you kidding me?! Whoever came up with this recipe needs to patent it, open a factory and start bagging those things. With the money they earn, they could run for politics on a pure chip platform. Soon, everyone on the planet will have tried those chips, and this person will be the most influential celebrity in the world. People will beg them for the recipe, but they'll never give it up. And one day when they pass away, the recipe will disappear with them, which will lead to a global crisis the lies of which we have never seen. Tragic.",2017-01-18 14:46:43

The atmosphere in this place is something run-down and beautiful, there is character and charm, like the rest of NoDa. Vaulted ceilings make the place seem more open airy, and the brick walls add more warmth. 

As for the food, excellent, we came in on an off time  (3pm) and it came out fast. 
We ordered 3x appetizers, wings, duck confit flatbread, and a spinach artichoke dip. All were extremely good and not over seasoned like my fear of most restaurants. 

Everything about this review seems great. 

Except for the service. Like stated above- this was an off time for the brewery. 
Being a manager at a restaurant, I understand understaffing during off hours- and what not. In total number of customers, there were 9 people in the house. 
I waited 15 minutes to be seated. 
Tables were left dirty. 
Waited another 10 minutes to have water brought to my table. 
Then another 15 for my waitress to come and take my order. (At this point the waitress saw me take my keys and I was about to leave, and she just so happened to serve me) 

40 minutes to place my order at 3pm. 
My father who took me here said this has never happened before. And he was appalled at how terrible this was. 

I'll come back again, and update this review- because I believe in the food and the beer was great. I was just so disappointed with the service, I'll come back with in a month.",2016-12-23 17:23:09
