Actually, our chef was going Gangnam Style, singing the song and waving his knives around.  These guys not only embrace cultural jokes, but run with them (in a good way).

We went to Tomo after getting a Groupon and no, we didn't make reservations.  It wasn't a problem, we sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and were able to be sat at one of the ""entertainment"" seats.  

The bartender, bless her soul, was probably hired on her looks instead of her apt bartending abilities.  First they were out of ginger beer (gasp!), but the drinks she made were fine.  It just took forever to get them and then to close out our tab when we moved to a table.

As for the hibachi, no complaints here!  Our chefs were Beninhana styled jokesters.  Keeping us laughing and engaged from soup to Hibachi.  It probably didn't hurt that they were shooting saki in our mouths the whole time either!  

The food seemed fresh and was diced and tossed and played with great skill!  We got the chicken and shrimp as well as the Tomo Special (ahem, thanks to my boyfriend who always orders the most expensive thing on the menu when I'm paying!).  It was all great!  I'd probably skip the chicken, just because the shrimp was to die for, and holy moly was that lobster and steak good ( I did at least get a taste).  Their secret mayo/pink sauce, I couldn't get enough of it either!  

So even though our bill wasn't cheap, we had a great time!  I want to come back and bring a big group because the Saki fights were getting pretty intense - but I""m sure my friends could keep the game up!",2013-08-20 21:44:39

Be sure to visit Buffalo Chip Saloon on Friday nights. The professional live bull riding makes it worth the drive, trust me. 

Since my last visit, they've built an entirely new edition to the Saloon where they serve the famous BBQ buffet. It's very nice and makes for a good place to sit and eat! 

I just love it here. This place is definitely what you would think AZ looks like if you lived elsewhere and had never been to Arizona, but sometimes even the locals need a little tourist social night in their life!",2011-01-16 14:21:38

I had a glazed donut, which was still super soft and airy at 2pm. The glaze had a nice flavor to it, but I felt like the donut itself was missing something - if that makes any sense. The glaze did help carry the flavor of the donut though. I'm glad I got to try these donuts, but I probably won't go out of my way to try more from them since there's better out there. Definitely try it if you're driving by it though.",2018-02-15 03:10:34

This doubles as a karaoke bar which seemed like a great place for a night of fun. I ordered takeout so unfortunately I couldn't stay but I'm sure that if I did, it would be a good time. 

I can tell by the smell of the curry if it's gonna be good.

The Lemon Pepper Shrimp was so delicious (and yes, they have brown rice). We also ordered the hot n sour soup, which - vegetarians beware - is generously filled with not just tofu, but shrimp and pork as well. Not a pork eater myself, I'll have to take my cohort's word for it that it was equally delicious. Meals were reasonably priced, especially the chef's specials. Service was fine - quite attentive, actually. Atmosphere was interesting - nothing to rave about, but we happened to be there as the sun was setting, and the place seemed to take on a bit of a cooler vibe the darker it got. Enough so that we took our time finishing up our Sake Bombers and just hung out for a while. Oh yeah, we'll be back.",2008-06-21 01:03:59

There are 3 spots....the dog beach, the obstacle park, and the timid dog area.  The designers put a lot of effort in designing the park.....sometimes parks look like someone just put up a fence and never put any thought in how to move dogs around.  I love the fact that the park is set down low and a distance from the parking lot...it gives my dog a period of time to take in all the stimuli before he gets to the park itself.  The pond is really cool, it's clean, and the whole park is well taken care of.  I love the city of Gilbert, they have to be one of the best cities I have lived in.  I can't wait to get back!!!!

Ok we got the 2/25.00 the broccoli soup was awful. Very out of the can taste. The hubby got tomato,,, that was much tastier. 
Hubby got fettuccine and it was good he said. Good garlic taste. I got the baked manicotti ,,, it wasn't bad but I prefer a more flavorful taste. Just kinda bland so I put pepper flakes all over it.

My husband made reservations finally after we tried their food at the Best Restaurant Party.  The decor is neat and the hostess was nice.  Our waitress was kind of odd and I didn't think she was listening half the time.  We tried the conch hushpuppies that were really good (I hate seafood and I loved them).  The sauces with them were amazing.  My husband got the flanksteak with yucca cakes.  It was also cooked very well and tasted great.  I got the burger, mostly because I saw someone else and it looked tasty.   It is a large burger (too big to eat without a fork and knife) and and it comes with a medley of root vegetable chips (but I asked for waffle fries).  My burger was burnt to a CRISP and tasted like it was on a charcoal grill too long.  I loved the sauce, but the waitress forgot to put in the waffle fries so I got the chips.  She did fix it when I brought it to her attention but then I got 1/3 of a tasting cup of ketchup which I thought was kind of strange.  So....  there were definite highlights (appetizer and my husband's meal) but my burger and the waitress was much to be desired.  Food prices seems on par with the other big burrito restaurants (so pricey but you get a good amount of food).",2014-03-23 21:40:01

Oh, and it's uber small, so definitely don't try to bring a large group here... or really any more than 2-3 people. It would be nice if they could set a few outside tables on the outside. During dinner, the line can get a little long. Worth the wait though, they take care of you at Maskadores. 
 
Get a plate of their 5 tacos and pay the upcharge to get a variety of meats. Forewarning, they are a bit spicy, especially combined with their least-spiciest salsa (applied before your plate is handed to you). I was a little disappointed at how spicy it was altogether, but thus is life in the Southwest. I liked the carne asada though.

Captured by their name and went in to see how crazy this place is.  Nice décor with wood plank walls; simple and yet modern.  We were greeted and seated right away.  There was a small menu with pictures of ten items on the table.  We got the Japanese Donkatsu and Cheese kimchi rice bowl without even looking at the one page menu.  First came the three Korean side dishes and in less than 20 minutes came our entries.  They both came in big portion and were nicely presented.  The pork cutlet was crispy outside; tender and juicy inside.  Rice bowl was good as well; nothing would go wrong with cheese.  The winning dish is ...... Donkatsu! I definitely will be back again!

The slider had a crispy chicken breast coated in Buffalo sauce, and drizzled with chipotle ranch, nestled in a soft bun. Nom! The pizza pops were like muffins filled with familiar pizza toppings. They were a fun snack. Similarly, was the Grilled PB & J.  I loved these warm peanut butter sandwiches with the chipotle peach jam. There was just enough heat to cut the sweet.

It took me a while to decide on which flavour to try and finally settled on making a unique combination with durian and banana flavoured bubble tea powder with maple syrup. It was pretty tasty and adding evaporated milk made the drink a bit creamier. It is an interesting concept but can get pretty pricey if you add too many toppings.

There is no hcg food and I even called ahead and was told there was. My friend ordered balsamic chicken and didn't like it at all. I ordered berry salad with shrimp. The greens were bitter and limp, the shrimp was so so. I asked to leave the goat cheese off as I hate it. They forgot and put it on and then picked it back off. The whole thing tasted like goat cheese. The waiter asked if I was allergic to it. I should have said yes. I ate the berries and 5 shrimp. It was $16.99 which I think is pricy for lunch.

Nice people sincerely cooking up fantastic Japanese street food. Nothing overly fancy but you can almost taste the commitment to quality in their food.
Served in a tidy takeout container, coated cardboard so the soy sauce floats around on the bottom. I've had the chicken a couple times and it is so good I can't seem to get myself to go back to their special featuring the purple rice. A five piece box of juicy morsels coated in a crunchy layer for 12 bucks? Truly a jewel of a stop on busy Queen Street. 
They coat the chicken in a squirt of mayo when you order, which adds to the juiciness, but feel free to ask them to leave it off. The soy sauce goes great on it! I haven't asked for any other garnishes but I imagine they might have other goodies behind the counter.
I call the place it's in, a loser mall, because everyone knows what I mean. Especially OCAD students as it's in their backyard. A little bit of heaven of a jerk spot is in the very back of the long empty dark and very dingy aisle, and before the smells of the Caribbean awaken your senses, is where the great Japanese god Gushi resides.

Was definitely disappointed with the fried chicken - the breading was MUCH too dense and overpowered the chicken. I felt like I got so full on the breading I wasn't able to enjoy and truly taste too much of the chicken. Should you give it a try, I'd say split it between 2 people. It's much too large a portion for 1. The Chow Chow & Honey is quite sweet - be warned. The TN Hot is their variation of Nashville Hot chicken, but not quite there.

We also tried the fried green tomatoes and fried chicken skins for appetizers - both were good. The chicken skins were definitely a special treat since we don't consumer those too often. The highlight of the night.

Craft cocktails were tasty and unique.

As per their website the chicken is sourced from Beretta Farms and promises to be free-range, hormone/steroid-free, no antibiotics, grain fed, and air chilled.  

The sides are constantly changing to make the best use of seasonal ingredients.  The sides will also change based on popularity (ATM I think the baked beans and the baked squash are on the chopping block).

Ironically their website states that they will ""..change your expectations of what fast food can be!""  If changing my expectations of fast food means that I'm going from a less than 5 minute wait to a full 30 minute wait - then that phrase is sadly true!  

In their defense, they had been running a WagJag promotion and the expiry date was fast-approaching so the volume was outside their SOP.

The chicken was indeed tasty and there are a handful of sauces to choose from - I opted for the plum sauce and barbecue sauce.  Our winged friend was less oily than the usual, and tender.  

The sides were kind of bland and boring.  They need to kick it up a notch on flavour.

A whole chicken + 2 sides will ring you in at $24.  I'm perfectly happy going to the Superstore or Wal-Mart and picking up their whole roasted chickens for $7.99-$9.99.  I could probably make tastier sides myself!",2012-09-19 13:37:24

My most recent trip we sat at the bar for the first time and had a great experience. The bartender, Jay, was super friendly and attentive. We ordered the garbanzo beans, the cheese & fruit plate, and the crispy potatoes. All great choices for tapas! (The potatoes actually aren't crispy, but they are still good!) A pitcher of sangria and the rum cake made for a full meal (we were stuffed with this amount of food!)

Here are my tips:

Must have: Red Sangria! The pitcher is our go-to and really is delicious!

Consider: My favorite meal is the chicken cannelloni, the Spanish rice & veggies (that come with every entree) is great! Dessert: you can't go wrong - but I never have room for it! Tapas: the cheese and fruit plate is sizeable, be sure you have enough people to tackle it!

The patio is lovely - even through the fall it's a great outdoor area for dinner! They have the patio, a few areas of dining rooms, and the front bar area - so all people can find a place to please them!

At the end of every meal they give you a shot of almond liquor - enjoy!

MoqNKX5HHl4PIpDT5DSGTA,b9V7cySVcF0R3Z017B8v3A,CvonRhKDJaH155xhtpz_iw,3,1,0,0,"So took the family to try State 48 last week. First the pros: I had The Boss pizza. It was delicious. Though a couple of things did diminish my experience. First, for a $15 pie it should be bigger. The Boss is a small/personal pizza at other pizzerias. Next, there was too much flour on the bottom crust. I know they use it to keep the pizza from sticking in the wood-fired oven. But, for the love of God, less could be used. My son had the chicken wings-- as with the pizza, the wings were delicious-- though overpriced (10 wings for $11)! My daughter had the chicken Caesar salad. She didn't really care for it-- but she is 9, so not a big surprise. My wife ordered one of the sandwiches-- I forget which one. She too enjoyed the meal. My wife and I shared the beet salad. Wife liked it; I did not. I didn't like the salad because of the greens. I'm not a fan of bitter greens. So my dislike is personal taste and not food related. 

Now for the cons. The service was incredibly slow. We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated even though the restaurant appeared to be able to accommodate more patrons. I get it, sometimes there isn't enough staff to cover the entire restaurant. Nevertheless, once we were seated it took a little bit of time for the server to greet our table and take drink orders. Once drinks were ordered and brought out we were ready to place the rest of our order. At this point is when the service really falls off. It took a long time for anything to be brought to the table. In all fairness we were told that the pizza takes a little longer-- no problem. Well, the Beet Salad came out. Then my son's chicken wings; the my wife's sandwich, then my pizza (which was supposed to take a little longer) then after an even longer wait-- my daughter's chicken Caesar salad. 

The server didn't come back to the table to ask if everything was ok. If the server did return to the table we would have ordered mac & cheese for my daughter and get drink refills. In some restaurants if you can get the attention of another server, they will either help you, or go get the server for your table. I made eye contact with and motioned to two different servers-- both looked away and kept walking. 

Overall the food is very good-- expensive for the portions-- and the service was not good at all. A final thought, hopefully there will be a few more tv's in the bar as well. Depending where you sit at the table, you may have your back to the screens.",2016-06-29 21:44:25

Ordered the AYCE this time. Maybe it's just in my head, but meat never tastes as good off the AYCE menu. Still, the food deserves 4 stars. There are fancier Korean places that may give more side dishes, but cooking on that clay or stone pot thing makes the meat perfectly crisp. Combo dinners include the mixed rice cooked on the same pot. A must try. Left full and 100% satisfied. 

AYCE costs $20. Seems reasonable. Not sure why others feel this place is so expensive. Spent $20+ for the worst chicken salad sandwich and diet coke at the Mandalay Bay that very morning. Puts things into perspective for me. 

Warning - If you are not Korean, you will most likely get poor service. I am Korean, and still expect poor service. Go for the food, and nothing more. Ambiance = non-existent, Service = better odds on the tables, Food = damn good.",2011-12-09 15:53:18

Being that it was Mother's Day I had the choice of where I wanted to celebrate, though I'm a creature of habit, I like to check out and try places that my friends and family like.
We planned on trying Sakana and I sure am glad we did! We got there right at 11 as they opened for lunch, the adults decided on the AYCE which was $20.95 and the kids got individual plates.

All I had to do was read Antonia R's and my trusted yelpers reviews to steer me in the right direction on what to order. We started with seaweed salad, edamame, gyoza and shrimp tempura. Then moved on to their nigiri's: Salmon, Garlic tuna, Yuzu yellowtail and my favorite salmon belly! OMG I'm salivating right now just talking about it. It was so buttery, melt in your mouth goodness! As many have mentioned, the fish to rice ratio is incredible! Of the rolls we tried, I liked the lobster roll and Hawaiian roll the best. I had their salmon skin roll extra crispy and that too was amazing! The bulgogi nachos I wasn't a fan of, it was way too sweet and the flavors didn't meld well. My son got a curry plate with chicken katsu. My daughter doesn't eat curry so we got her just the rice and pork tonkatsu but they still charged us as if we got the curry plate (just a TIP: they don't offer katsu plates, so if you want that, you have to order the curry plate minus the curry and pick either chicken katsu or pork katsu as a topping for an extra $2 and $3 respectively) 

The service was great up until about an hour after they opened when it started getting really busy, it took over 30 minutes for us to get our baked mussels, I didn't care so much as I was bursting in the seams at that point. For dessert I got the green tea panna cotta which was just ok and the honey toast with honey cream inside topped with ice cream, which was awesome. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes. Thanks again Antonia R for this rockin' recommendation!",2015-05-18 21:22:47

First: Check In, we waited a little since some people were late, no biggie. The guy who helped us out was freaking funny. He loved to talk about food! He gets so overly passionate about it too. He was great!

Second: Wait for everyone to check in. Then they go over a few things before we start.

Third: The story begins: 

Fourth: Get in the shuttle and get driven to first location. The driver is super awesome as well, don't remember his name but he's the one with tattoos everywhere. There were snacks and drinks in the shuttle. 

Fifth: Go crazy!, it's hard at first because I was lost, not sure what to do, but seriously tear the place up..!! LOL. its fun, but don't damage anything.

Sixth: Second and last location, now that you got a hang of things, do the same as this location to discover some secrets. 

It was super fun! It was active, everyone does have to work together for everything to make sense. Our group was great, we had some locals and the rest of the group are from Cali. We bonded during that time, and we all got along. It was great!

I haven't been to a Pinkberry in the longest time, but am once again a fan. It seems like they've made some changes to their options - wheras before they would charge you for each topping, now it is ""whatever fits comfortably in the cup."" You can also mix flavors now. I was with my parents, so we each got a medium with 2 flavors, allowing us to sample each others'.  Original, grapefruit, and pear were all refreshing...as was mango, although the consistency was not like froyo and more like sorbet. And chocolate hazelnut was good and made me feel like I was eating the healthy version since it wasn't straight up ice cream.

The biggest gripe I used to have with Pinkberry is that they swirled around the yogurt and the middle of the cup was empty - so it would look very full but the center would be air. Pleased to say this is no longer the case.

So annoying because there were so many people who had not eaten yet.  The restaurant should have had a system in place to handle 350 people but it didn't. Maybe this was there first event here. They need some organization, if they ever do something like this again. 

Once we got to the front to start getting our food the plates ran out. Nobody was there to help us or get more plates.  In fact, I got out of line went up towards the salad bar and grabbed a giant stack for everyone.  I had to stock the plates. Really?

So with plate in hand there were three choices of meat...two red meat and one pork. The pork was dry but had potential. One red meat was full of fat and I couldn't even cut it with the knife provided. I would have told you what the meats were but when I asked they guy cutting it he didn't even seem to know.  That's not good!!

Salad bar items were okay. A few dishes were completely empty. Again no one from the staff was there keeping an eye on this. Empanadas were dry and lacking meat...it was more dough then anything.  Also the yummy Brazilian little cheese buns you find at other Brazilian restaurants were here.  The only difference these were just completely terrible. I had no idea they could taste that bad...usually I can't stop eating these but I didn't have that problem here. The best thing on the salad bar were the rice balls.  Wow these were really good...a nice Sicilian dish made perfectly at a Brazilian place. Very confusing to me but glad something besides the cheese and olives that was good. 

Bartenders were nice but I had to wait
Twice for a Spotted Cow (draft beer) while issues with the keg were sorted out. That was not fun. 

Now I have no idea how this place is when you actually order off the menu but as a banquet location it was completely terrible.  I blame the management for not being more organized and actually treating the large party with the respect of an individual table. They were probably at the bank cashing the check (allegedly)!!!

I would not want to attend an event here ever and probably would not want to come back as an individual.  I was completely let down with Samba!!!",2011-06-18 17:32:49

It's a bit of a drive and isn't near anything I frequent and while I liked the decor and style, the food won't have me coming back.

I ordered fish and chips, tempura style... All I could taste was flour and mush. The fish was soggy and completely without flavor. The chips were actual potato crisps (I was expecting fries, so it was a little disappointing) The best part of the meal was the veggie slaw. The ice cream and dessert did sound amazing (but then so did the fish and chips;) ). I tried a few spoonfuls of different flavored ice creams and they were quite good. So maybe it's more of a dessert kinda place?

I don't think Id want to go and sit down for dinner as its not really a sit down style restaurant. If you are set up for a casual lunch you should have a lunch menu or if you are wanting to be a real restaurant and serve dinner I think you should have real tables, chairs, maybe a booth or two and set it up that way.

Well after an afternoon of exhaustive shopping we popped into Bannock for, what I thought was just a sandwich/fries lunch but ended up seriously impressing me with some scrumptious Canadian cuisine! Started off with Poutine (yummm) and Split Pea Fritters. Now, between the two you would probably think the poutine was the table hit but you would be wrong! The fritters are accompanied by a peppery/curried (?) sauce and a surprisingly well put together salad.
My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the pepper flat iron steak with duck fat potatoes. Both were absolutely fantastic but halfway through my indulgent duck fat potatoes and perfectly cooked steak when my stomach communicated to my brain ""that's enough"", I actually frowned in disappointment as I had been eyeing the s'mores pie and sour cream donuts since before our meal.

Let me start off by saying the service was decent nothing stellar, and the food was absolutely terrific. I have never had better mozzarella sticks that had amazing cheese and a light batter. Don't get me started on the dipping sauces because I am just drooling thinking about them. I was kind of bummed when the waitress took them away because I could have definitely used those sauces to dip my French fries in. Not like you really need them with their awesome fries but it would have made it a million times better. 

My boyfriend and his coworker got the burgers and they were MASSIVE. I didn't get to try either but they ranted and raved about them(the par 5 and the pastrami) sounded so delish on the menu.  I myself had ordered the burger wrap which was also pretty good and filling I would have liked no onions in it though not really Big on fresh cut onions. Bleh.

The rooms have a lodgy feel and are very comfortable. Some rooms have nice views, and others, not so much. Either way, they continue the homey and ""wine by the fire"" vibe that hotel gives off overall.

Love the clean and modernized decoration. Richmond Hill definitely need a high end Chinese restaurant that would cater to those special occasions. There are quite a few private rooms of various sizes if you do want some privacy.

Love the tea selection. And for $1.50 per person it is not bad for what I am getting. At least the tea is clean and kept fresh in a vacuum sealed bag.

Dim Sum Selection is a little limited but as long as the quality is good, then I am A OK with it. They do have most of the classic and some with a little twist to the presentation. We shared:

金絲鳳尾蝦 (L) Deep Fried Shrimp with Salad Dressing - 3/5 It is more like a deep fried taro dumpling which I do like, but why the spicy mayo on top of chips as a side?
朝陽珍珠雞 (L) Chicken Duck Egg in Sticky Rice Wrap - 3/5 interesting presentation but why teriyaki sauce on the chicken? Love the crispy rice and the generous duck egg though
錦繡脆春卷 (S) Pork and Shrimp Spring Roll - 2/5 meh, pass
陳皮牛肉球 (S) Citrus Beef Ball 3/5 beef balls are A-OK, but the bitter melon was not prep properly 
錦袍燒賣皇 (L) Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai - 2.5/5 Siu Mai was really good but why were they drowned in Sweet and Sour Sauce?! 
天下第一包 (M) Almond Custard Bun - 5/5 Best item out of everything we ordered. This is really a baked bun with BBQ pork filling. Crispy top and soft bread with nice balance of sweet and savory
上等鰻魚腸 (L) Eel Rice Noodle Roll - 3/5 the Rice Roll is good but why the tofu on the side drowned in Teriyaki Sauce??
漁膳鲜蝦餃 (L) Shrimp Dumpling - 3/5 Well cooked but why the shrimps on the side drowned in Sweet and Sour Sauce??

Personally I think Yu Seafood tried too hard on presentation and being ""creative"". The kitchen has good dim sum techniques and the ingredients used were good quality. But why trying to add colour or contrast to the presentation by using cheap bottled S&S and Teriyaki sauce? By doing so, the taste of the dish itself were compromised and even overpowered by all these over saucing of interior components. 

And why those Mega plates? Those are really table wares for dinner service and they just use that for dim sum too.

I have e-mailed the proprietor of the establishment the second time it happened and she assured me that she would have a discussion with the management and staff.  Either she did not or it did not sink in.  Not only that, but even when your order is right, the cheese is never melted on the burgers.  There is ketchup all over the side of the bun.  I used to work in a restaurant, so it is very rare that I am coarse or rude with the staff, because I know how customers can be rude and don't care and how most of these people are underpaid and are disrespected.  However, tonight I lost it after the fourth time with my order getting screwed up.  I demanded to see the manager and demanded my money back.  She proceeded to give me a refund for the double cheeseburger only.  I had to explain to her that I got the extra value meal and showed her my receipt.  She started to argue with me that the meal was half eaten, which was a lie.  I may have had six fries out of a medium fry, one bite of the burger, which I spit out when I got a mouth full of onions and I had a quarter of the coke, mostly to get the disgusting onion taste out of my mouth.  She finally gave me the refund.  I should know better than to even go to McDonald's, but it's always good when you're in a hurry.  However, I am 100% DONE with this location.",2016-01-22 11:04:08

Atmosphere: huge televisions to watch sporting events, TouchTones, dart board, outdoor seating, a long bar, bar-type seating behind the bar, big tables for groups

Service: very friendly service, even when they were very busy we were served promptly and courteously, bartenders are nice and mix good drinks

It was opening week, so they weren't taking reservations but we showed up at opening (5 pm) and got a table no problem.  The cocktails were the best part--they are all unique and many have mezcal (a smoky tequila, YUM!), which is a rare find in PGH.

We split chips and salsa, and each got an order of tacos.  I got the baja tacos (tempura fish) and my husband got the Korean tacos.  Everything was really good.  None of the salsas were too spicy, but they have homemade hot sauce they will bring out to you also, which has a kick.  Everything is made fresh and so delicious!  If I could say anything bad (and I really can't), they aren't many veggie options--there was a mushroom taco, but it had huitlacoche (corn fungus) as part of the plate and I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous. :)

We also shared the tres leches pie for dessert.  It was good--not my favorite dessert ever, but definitely delicious, and the desserts are big enough for two.

My first experience with them wasn't really anything special. I do enjoy the fact that they make the burgers the way you want them too, but the ingredients going into the burger is nothing special.

Also, the way they stack the burger is what kills it for me. By putting the mushrooms and onions on the bottom of the double patties, it kind of melts the bottom bun, which was a big bummer for me. The meat wasn't spiced at all, but tasted fresh, which gives them some points. 

As for the potatoes, I don't really care where they come from, so having a sign to tell us where they come from seems kind of pointless. We got the Cajun spiced fries, which the wife didn't enjoy, but I liked. 

They tasted frozen though, which was kind of a let down.  EDIT: Just found out they always use fresh potatoes...didn't taste fresh.

I was minding my own business, walking out of the Charlotte Ear Eyes Nose & Throat where I was shadowing an audiologist, and BOOM! I see a giant buffalo-man walking around Rivergate. I approach him, give him a high-five, and find out that the Buffalo Wild Wings down the way is going to open on Monday, but that they are offering FREE FOOD for people that dine in today for lunch. 

Victory. I called up a buddy and we got into lunch-mode. We shared the fried roasted garlic mushrooms, which were delicious. I ordered twelve traditional wings, split between the asian zing and traditional buffalo sauces. I preferred the later, which was rich and buttery, while the asian zing was a bit too sweet for my palette. My buddy ordered the steak stack sandwich, which featured strips of steak topped on  with pepper jack cheese, onion rings, and spicy garlic BWW sauce. He devoured it.

Well it's nice looking since they remodeled after the fire, since we are Korean we thought it would be a good place to have a nice meal and it's located next to the only really good Korean supermarket in the Las Vegas valley. We ordered our lunch items and soon the standard banchan (side dishes) come out, about 2 teaspoons of macaroni salad, 3 pieces of potato, a teaspoon of black beans and a micro portion of over-ripe and stale kim chee. The bulgogi (bbq beef) was tender and well cooked, but really on the small side, the grilled eel is undercooked which makes the bones a hazard to eat since when throughly cooked the bones are edible. My bibimbap (mixed rice, with meat and veggies) was mostly lettuce and the chili sauce is not very good and probably store bought.
We asked for a little more potato banchan and the lady acknowledged us, but never brought us anymore. Maybe she forgot or maybe she would rather keep 3 more tiny piece of potato for future use? Everyone is very welcoming when you first come in, but once you've started eating you are on your own. No asking if we need anything else, just the bill left on the table. No sliced orange or cold rice drink often served after a Korean meal. (Traditional Korean hospitality jesture)

We had Pistachio as well as Pine Nut Baklava and they were both wonderful. They differ from the Greek version in that they are not as sweet or sticky. They are similar, except the honey glaze on the Greek version is more muted here. They serve a variety of pickled vegetables with their dishes which adds a unique flair.

The food is great. It's all seafood.. lots crabs and fresh fish. Like many Chinese seafood restaurants, they have the obligatory tanks full of aquarium. This restaurant housed the tanks behind beautifully shaped windows, but it does not change the fact that these creatures were destined for our bellies (It's sad and I am a hypocrite for still eating seafood)

We were in a private room with a round table and the lazy susan is automatic with a remote control which we unfortunately had a bit of trouble getting used to lol... At one point, one of our dinner companion tried to put the ""public"" chopstick back but the dish had already circled away from him.

We felt a bit rushed as the they rushed us out because they had the room booked for a second seating for the evening. I don't know if this is common practice nowadays but was kinda of my first time being rushed out of a restaurant.

It had a nice flavor.   My pho came out with the noodles in a clump.  Once I broke it up mixed in some jalapeños, lime , basil, and sprouts, I was ready to chao!

The pho was about 10$ a bowl, I think there should have had a bit more meat!  I was unable to finish all the noodles. . But still aprox 25$  for dinner for two is still quite reasonable.

But most of time I am traveling with munchkins with insatiable appetites, so I've got snacks in there for them and/or lots of books.  

We go to this theater all the time, and I take my back pack there all the time too.  But this time it created a problem.  

We got our tickets and were happily standing at the concession counter ordering tons of overpriced, bad for you, food when this teeny, tiny, little teenage employee approached me and advises me that they are going to have to search my back pack.  WTF??

They got a homeless guy out front smokin' a doobie with some teenagers, but they want to search my stuff?!?!  But you see I was wrong about what they were looking for.  

Knowing that I had nothing in my pack that was without prescription, (ho ho hee hee) I willingly handed it over to the mickey mouse club house member.  She opens the first big zipper and finds, OH MY GAWD!!  

RICE CAKES!!!  

I am so busted.  That's right she was lookin' for food contraband, not drugs!  The first thing she says is, ""yep, food"" and she hands the pack back to me looking disgusted.  She then advises me that I have to leave the pack locked in the office during the movie we came to see.

Because you know, even though we're standing there with food from the concession stand, we still might wanna eat them rice cakes instead!!!!  

At this point everyone is looking, and my fellow movie companion is standing there eating his newly purchased popcorn enjoying the live action theater.  I thought I wouldn't care if she wanted to hold on to it while I watch a movie, but my credit cards, cell phone, iPod and prescription drugs were the real items of value and that had me worried.  

Thankfully for me all the contents of my pack were still there when I got it back from food police.  However the movie sucked, I sat there the whole time wondering if her and her teenage friends were rifling through my pack.

All this because of rice cakes my friends.  So the next time you dare purchase some, just remember it's better to use them as target practice than to mistakenly bring them into the theater!!!

Even though bringing in outside food was not my intention this time, I can say that next time I go, I think I'll wear a trench coat and inside I'll have bags of popcorn and cans of soda strapped to me so I can smuggle in the contraband and be an arsehole just for the heck of it.",2008-09-21 19:07:09

so...we're in Tolleson now, far from our old haunts of Tempe, Mesa, Ahwatukee. I've been craving some sweet, wonderful uni for ages, and so we did some research(i.e--Yelp-search), and came across Tomo. and, thanks to all of you darling Yelpers, we weren't disappointed =^.^=

the decor at Tomo was lovely; understated, with dark wood, low chairs, and the glow of red lanterns. we sat at the sushi bar, where we were attended to within a couple of minutes. upon receiving the menu, we decided upon miso soup, edamame, and the Salmon Skin Salad, to share. I ordered the uni sashimi, and he had the Monkey Balls and the Ninja roll.

the miso soup was average: delicious, warming, with bits of seaweed, scallions, and tofu. the edamame was a bit of a let-down, however: it wasn't salty enough, and far less than satisfying due to the fact that they used regular table salt, rather than coarse grain/sea salt.

the Salmon Skin Salad($6.95) was enormous! it consisted of a huge mound of lettuce, mixed with cucumbers and glass noodles, drizzled in a slightly-sweet mustard vinaigrette. there were tons of strips of crispy salmon skin surrounding the veggies, all coated in sweet eel sauce...smoky, savory, sweet, spectacular(although slightly greasy).

the Monkey Balls(deep-fried, stuffed mushrooms) were yummy, and spicy, though they seemed a little gamey, or just...too meaty, as an aftertaste.

Jamie's Ninja Roll was fantastic; a huge roll(in diameter), with the perfect blend of sweetness and spice(eel sauce, spicy mayo, Sriracha sauce), surrounding a not-too-spicy deep-fried jalapeno, stuffed with cream cheese. wow.

and now for the piece de resistance: my uni sashimi! it consisted of 6 wonderfully fresh, sweet, delectable slices of sea urchin roe, simply and beautifully presented. always a delight, especially with just a touch of soy sauce to accentuate the inherent dolce tones of the uni itself.

to conclude: the service was attentive, but not overbearing. the ambiance was chill, with a blend of smooth jazz and dance playing in the background, and the food was fantastic; a great mix of tradition and innovation.

we'll definitely be returning to Tomo :)",2011-01-26 01:39:37

It's the kind of place you want to visit when you're down, feeling nostalgic, have a sweet tooth, need to buy a unique gift, want to have your photo taken in a photo booth, want to buy a fun toy for your desk at work, or just feel like checking out the new/seasonal inventory.  What's best is that Smeeks is locally owned and staffed by some really great people.

I have rarely been able to get out of Smeeks without spending less than $20.  It's not that everything is really expensive, although some stuff is a bit pricier than I'd like, but it's all unique and tough to find anywhere else.  It's just that you want that cool set of erasers, and some of that candy you loved as a kid, and a new keychain, and some cool wind-up toys, and some bacon-flavored lip balm (yes, you read that right), and... the list goes on.

I tried 2 different starters: the chopped liver and the salmon tartare. Of the two, I prefer the tartare, which tastes really fresh (always a good sign). I never really liked to eat liver, maybe that is why I prefer the tartare. 
For main course, I had the ribsteak, rare, with a Monte Carlo potato. The potato is a must! I don't know what they do with it, but I think I am addicted to that potato.

Thor was kind of a revelation to me and I found out about it through the Finnish Tourism Board (don't ask). It looks much bigger than it is, but that's part of its charm (as is that wee little mural behind the counter). It's also a lot cozier than it looks too.

Tons of travel mags/publications lying about if you're as big of a fan as I am (or the owners). 

The owners are some of the nicest you'll ever meet.  They'll chat with everyone and know your name. They will also help you with your computer if something really strange happens to it (as it did mine). 

Oh, and they just got a new barrista in from Italy. Woot Woot!

I ordered The Italian Panini, my cousin had the Quinoa salad (not sure what it was called), and my other cousin actually ordered a pesto pasta (not on the menu, they basically take mac and cheese pasta and put pesto in it instead). My panini was good, but it was better refrigerated when I got home and got to add ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise and all that! ;p 

I loved the banana peppers in the panini. My cousin's salad was alright, I'm not a huge fan of quinoa so I didn't care for it much but my cousin didn't like it too much- she didn't finish it or bother packing it to take home. 

My other cousin finished her pesto salad, I tried some and initially I thought it was bland but she gave me another part of it which was super flavorful, so just make sure to mix it evenly throughout. 

We got the pizza cookie for our free dessert and they used a vanilla gelato on top of our chocolate chip cookie that wasn't cooked in a little pan. It was delicious. Great service, as well. The food is delivered to your table and all the workers come up to check on you even though it almost is self-serve.

I don't like the oversized lounge chairs - thay are totally uncormfartable and clunky.  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  They do have a seperate dining area.

The food here is ok.  We got there during a thursday night football game so they had some game specials.  3 apps for $8.95.  Sounded good but the apps were like mini size.  Jal poppers, guacamole, mini-shrimps.  The shrimps were small - you could probably call them krill... I understand it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.

You can sit in the restaurant or at the bar to order food. 
The menu is not just for breakfast, but they have great choices for lunch and dinner too! As far as breakfast goes I usually get the half order of biscuits and gravy which comes with a sausage link. This is more then enough food for me, but the regular order would feed a normal person. The gravy isn't greasy and has chunks of sausage in it. You can tell it's definitely home made. I've also tried a couple of their omelettes too. All huge and very well cooked. For lunch or dinner they have an awesome burger! There are several options of burgers the BBQ burger and the one with guacamole are my favorite. My top item to order has to be the BBQ chicken sandwich. The chicken is always moist and not dried out. Even though the BBQ sauce isn't home made it's still tasty. Bonanza lounge also has some crispy fries that are delicious. 
The staff at Bonanza Lounge are friendly and always remember me. Which makes it nice when they just bring me the to go container and I don't have to ask.

As we went straight after work it was quiet but by 6pm it was packed with people waiting. They take reservations so would highly recommend that if you turn into a hungry monster and cant wait.

1. Start by picking your soup base - all 3 of us had different ones and all delicious. We ended up eating truly asian style by stealing each other food out of the pots so really cant remember which base I preferred but they were all tasty.

2. Choose the items you want to cook in it. Ordering was left up to my collegue who had been there before so we ended up with things I would never have thought of - like quails eggs. We had mussels, shrimp, noodles, veg, beef, lamb, chicken, fish paste things and a bunch of others I don't remember.

3. They also have this sauce buffet - take one, take 2 or mix and match and make your own combo. Not gonna lie that I had a mix of sesame paste and hoisin. Everything was dunked in it. Would have licked the bowl clean - that stuff is amazing!

Dessert didn't happen cause we ate everything and then ate a little more, so no space left.

I went to the lowes in Huntersville NC yesterday after having two bad experiences. Figured we could give them one more shot.  Certainly wish we didn't!

I did an in store pickup for a grill, grill cover, electric starter and charcoal.
I then chatted into Lowes to ask how long before it's ready, and then said 30 minutes. Well we wanted to give them the benefit of doubt and we waited nearly 2 hours before heading to Lowes to pickup our order.  

Well we walk in and there was one lady working the whole customer service and return counter!!! There were about 4-5 customers waiting for returns or pick ups!   She finally came over to us and we told her we were there for in store pick up, and she apologized the order was not ready. 

She got on her radio to ask for help, and someone came over who does not work in that department. He asked her if the order was in the back, and she said no he had to get it together off the floor...

Then he tells us to follow him so we can help him!!!  Excuse me? We did in store pickup to have this be an easy process. I then said ""you have the skus right?"" And he proceeded to say, ""Well I do, but I normally don't help this department.""

So I looked at other customers and they were blown away he asked too. Figured I was getting pranked so I went with it!   Low and behold the LOWES employee, my wife and I were going up and down the isles gathering our items that should of been ready! 

Well the grill was on the top shelf, so the employee went and got a ladder. Climbed up the ladder, and of course the grill was to heavy (hello, it's steel).  So then he had to go find a power lift.... He drove it over, and literally stood there trying to figure it out!!! (See attachment) 

Finally got it down, and brought everything on one of those long flat carts. Well we wanted to get 2 patio chairs And a small table.  The customer service employee to be politically correct was a small person, so I kindly asked if we should get the set.  So my wife and I went back and fourth carrying the chairs and the table to the customer service counter. Now you can imagine, we have the flat bed full of products, 2 chairs and a table.  She then didn't even ask if we needed help carrying things out. So I had too. (Keep in mind, while I stood in the isle arms folded with a scowl on my face, a group of ""suits"" or managers/executives from Lowes walked by and didn't stop to address my look or concern.) I would be SO embarrassed to work at this location. It's a zoo. 

Finally some jerk came up front and started heading to the wrong door. I said ""sir, my wife pulled up to the exit over here.""  He said,"" you need to pull up to this entrance."" Are you kidding me? There is no signange saying where to pull up for pickup!!!!  Also how would we know, because he wanted us to exit through the entrance anyways! 

Finally, we get everything outside, and he walks away!!!!!  So I had to lift the ""team lift"" grill of 80+lbs in the car myself.  Thank god I didn't get injured. Well come to find out the chairs were to big, and after 5 minutes of trying to make them fit and countless Lowes employees coming outside saying ""you got this! It'll fit"" and never asking for help, I went BACK inside and asked if they had a small Allen wrench set so I could take apart the set.  Again, no one offered to help. So now my wife and I sat in the front of the store dissembling two patio chairs.  

Needless to say, Lowes has lost a customer who just purchased a home and was planning on some major purchases.",2015-08-12 12:15:24

Food: 4
Value: 3 (used groupon but have to go with menu pricing)

Very cool concept, the groupon made it a great deal and the pizza was pretty good and done in no time at all. Definitely worth consideration if you are in a lunch time crunch and want some pizza.

Went at around 3pm and both girls behind the counter were friendly, informative and helpful, allowing you to taste a couple ingredients you may be unfamiliar with beforehand and offering suggestions such as mixing the diablo sauce with regular sauce to put out the fire...great tip!

I got one crazy pizza mixed with a ton of ingredients and one Margherita pizza to go. The sauce was good on the margherita but just not enough cheese...I know the cheese is the most expensive part of the pizza but if you are charging almost $9 menu price for a small margherita, I'd almost rather pay $12 and go to Settebello's for an insanely good margherita that's considerably larger...or with pizza hut and dominoes always at war with each other offering 50% discount online coupon codes you can get a dominoes artisan pizza for take out almost anytime for around $7...perhaps not quite as good, but more bang for your buck.

If I didn't have the groupon, I would say $20 is a bit steep for two small pizzas. 

The pizza industry is insanely competitive these days and just to be in the restaurant business in Las Vegas to begin with, you better have something magical.

If everyone is coming in with groupons and you have to give groupon 50% of the $7 they used to purchase it...just lower your price $1.50 and you'll have a lot of repeat business with an even better profit margin without having to rely on groupon.

TIP: Text 24587 on your phone while you are there and a coupon pops up on your phone for a free soda with your order (Man, I'm killing these guys).

I know I did some complaining on my 4 star review but the pizza was ""good"" and the service was great.

We had to ask our server for Chips and salsa, which are usually the first thing to hit the table.  And that didn't come for another 5-10 minutes.  

The food is your standard Mexican restaurant fare - nothing to write home about though.  

While we were waiting for our server to come by so we could get to-go boxes and the check, Baby C started fussy.  So instead of being ""those parents"", I took him outside and got him car ready.  I do all this thinking that his dad would be heading out in a few minutes.    

After 10 minutes pass, Im starting to wonder WTH was going on...so I grab the baby and head back inside.  J is still sitting there at the table waiting for our server.  He gets up and asks someone to go get her.  A few minutes later, she comes by....she was apparently tending to silverware.  Yeah, lets forget that you have customers at a table lady.

I told myself should I really spend money again for lashes?? Especially if they're $200!! But I convinced myself that it would be worth it and benefit me. They really are because I'm busy and I have to wake up early in the morning so it helps a lot because I don't have to worry about putting a full face eye look!! At first I was paranoid because I didn't know who to ask for since it's my first time. And I was scared the person they would have given me wouldn't understand my wants!! But my artist was Gypsie!!! She's so great. She's great to talk to and she's a great artist. I love my lashes and I'm thinking of trying featherized for my fill!! Thank you Gypsie and Cherry Lash Lounge for a great first time.

The garlic bread was a half of a round loaf with slices of garlic on it cut into wedges, now it is just slices of bread with garlic  butter.

Our evening started off fine, we sat in the bar in hopes of watching  the Cardinals  game, it wasn't  on but we asked a manager  and he changed it.

Our server, Helena was attentive, but a bit too familiar, calling everyone Loves, Honey etc I feel this is unprofessional  and it is uncomfortable. She wss  bringing our carafe of red sangria which was full of ice, too sour from the citrus and knowing  how much I can drink and feel it-1 glass of wine, i assume it was not much alcohol! We had 2 cups of minestrone and the packages of saltiness stunk horribly! We gave them to the server, she never brought more!

The two managers, bartenders and some servers decided to loudly argue about shifts and performance  in the bar, in front of everyone  at this time! Very unprofessional! 

We were still eating  our soup, which was hot but average, when the pepperoni pizza and baked rigatoni arrived. The pizza was very greasy. The rigatoni could have had more cheese and sausage for the price!!

At this point we were eating,  a couple tables got up and left, including the one next to us who ordered a salad and green beans only,  then complained that their salad was too small to be a large and they would only pay for a small, so the manager fawned all over them! Helena  was AWOL!  The bartender was sloping buckets of water from the mop bucket onto the floor with the  sanibucket, a bit nasty!  We stopped eating  and still no Helena,  a minimum of 15 minutes, I think more, we were done, needing our food wrapped and our check! She seemed to be very grumpy, maybe the manager  yelled  at her about the salad!  She took the pizza to wtap, didn't  come back, didn't  come back... we were going to get dessert  but decided not to! She finally  came back, packaged  the rigatoni and brought the check.

Neither manager EVER said Hello, mentioned the horrible,  stinky crackers, etc! As we left, the bartender seemed frustrated.. I think the earlier conversation  and whatever went on in the kitchen  rolled over into the dining room, spoiling our experience, which is very bad management!

Stay because there are some talented singers crooning, and if you're lucky you will catch Viva Las Vegas, which I adore for two reasons: 1. The opening credits have some of the best footage of classic Vegas neon signs. 2. Elvis.  Just be sure you request a table with a good view of the screens.

In addition to the live tunes being sung by the waitstaff and Elvis, the other good things are that they have no problem with separate checks even if you're a party of 7, and the service is friendly. 

However, I must say my side salad was sad. The iceberg lettuce creation was browning on the edges, and besides black olives and pungent red onions, didn't include too many vegetables. For me, black olives are an immediate sign that you're entering a salad danger zone. I requested blue cheese, and either ended up with ranch or their blue cheese is disappointing. A fresh mixed green salad with balsamic would be more impressive. Really, all you need for a solid salad are fresh goods and a delicious dressing, but those were missing.

I have to give TEC credit for their sparkly holiday decorations and the no-need-to-see-daylight abilities to get to the Bay, the TTC and The Path at large. I also give them credit for (mostly) sticking to the old English way a mall or department store is assembled, by putting the fanciest shops on top, and tiering down from there.

I went with some friends who wanted to hang out (there was also a social experiment involved) when this joint turns into a nightclub... OH WAIT! It's a lounge. What is a lounge? Does it involve me screaming at the top of my lungs because the music is so loud when talking to someone? Does is it involve dancing to hip and r&b music on a dance floor? Does it involve a DJ playing music that makes you want to shake your ass on the dance floor? 

Now I'm not hating on the experience and I'm not knocking what people refer to this place after 11 PM. But ummmmm... I thought a lounge involved yes music, but not so loud that I'm screaming at the top of my lungs to have a conversation. 

Oddly enough there are a good number of people (I asked) who refer to this as a lounge. A lot of people are hanging back watching people walk around, eat, dance, whatever. It's odd. Maybe I'm just out of touch with this scene. 

When you go in they give you this card that you use to order food. If you lose it, you have to pay $50. At the end of the night or whenever you leave, you give the card back and pay for whatever you purchased. I like the concept, but that would totally suck if someone steals another person's card.

First of all, if you are not a Bruce Campbell fan or have never seen the Evil Dead movies, why the sweet flaming hell are you coming to this show? That's like going to see Star Wars and complaining because you don't like science fiction. Or fantasy. Or movies.

This show is a cult classic for a reason. It's cheesy, yes, because that's the point! If you listen to the lyrics, it's even funnier. People pay extra to sit in the splatter zone for the experience. If you don't want to get wet, don't pay extra and don't sit there. Duh.

Chris, playing Ash, out-Campbells Bruce himself. Handsome, hot as hell, and hilarious.

Jim, playing Good Old Reliable Jake, nails it. Campy? God yes. Like a cartoon! Fun! He can really sing, too.

The girl who plays Annie (Shelley in the First scene) has an incredible voice and is quite versatile. I didn't even know it was the same girl until the end, lol.

They have beefed up the choreography since the last time I saw the show. They also have an ""S-Mart"" in the lobby now if you want to buy souvenirs. You will still get free pics with the cast.

The show rocked. 

The venue needs help. Drinks are so expensive and tiny they aren't worth it. The show before ALWAYS runs long, which means we have to wait in line 30-60 minutes while they clear out (rude!) - another reason to ignore Whiny McClueless's review - late starts have nothing to do with them.

We were told that there was a 75 minute seating limit, but we were able to stay longer, as it wasn't too busy. 

I ordered the classic breakfast with 2 slices of toast, 2 poached eggs, a sausage, and fries. All of that only cost $11.25, which is a pretty good value considering the amount of food that was piled on my plate - way too much for me to finish. I expected to get smaller breakfast sausages instead of the one big sausage, but it was good nonetheless. 

My friends ordered the Belgian waffle with blueberry cream cheese icing as well as the eggs benedict with bacon and they were both over the moon with their orders. I wasn't able to get a picture of their food because they had dug in as soon as it arrived. 

The only downside was that the patio was quite windy, and the dust from the neighbouring construction was blowing into our food/coffee.

Free breakfast was not bad either!

I will say this, as a Hilton honors member, and as part of a firm that gives this hotel business when people come from out of town, I was really disappointed when I called back to obtain a receipt from my stay here.

The man I spoke to on the front desk was very short with me, which caused me to take a bit of an attitude with him because I was so taken aback. I told him he did not have to be rude to me (he originally could not find my reservation, which I said did not make sense). This was not a knock on him, it was a general statement because it did not make sense. He became defensive, which escalated the situation even more.  He then misheard and accused me of swearing at him which I did not do, I simply was very off put by his demeanor and made it known that I did not appreciate being spoken to that way. 

Clearly this individual does not have good customer service skills. Instead of diffusing the situation his tone and demeanor made it worse.

This place has been bookmarked for quite some time, but I just had the op to visit it, and it's GREAT!

Initially, I was seated inside the 'Tea' section, but asked to be moved when an available table came up.  The 2 tables that were set up in the 'Tea' section were just too make shift, dark, and separate from the rest of the restaurant.  Getting service there would've been difficult 'cause it's behind a divider.

Highlights of all that was ordered (pictured):
-  Enoki Mushroom Balls - which were more like mini wraps, soo yummy!  The ""balls"" themselves were wrapped in seaweed and deep fried
-  Pan-fried Green Tea Cake - more mochi, love the flavour of the green tea filling
-  Asst. Seitan Platter - I've had this before, but it's a good dish since there are different flavours in 1 dish, bbq, sweet 'n sour, curry, etc.
-  Zen Garden Milk Green Tea - also very good.  Tasted like the ""Milk Green Tea"", sans bubbles, that you'd order, but better!  It did come out warm and slightly too sweet, so you hafta wait 'til some of the ice melts

I could've done without the Har-Gow, Sao Mai, Dumplings.  They were good, but the filling themselves were just too ""loose"".  Not as firm as they would be with pork, shrimp, etc.  Still good though, but I just wouldn't order them next time.

I wanted to order the Coloured Crystal Balls, from the Dim Sum menu, but they were out, so next time!

I wished that they had more photos on their menu.  It's more helpful if you read Chinese, but there are parts of the menu which aren't descriptive at all, re:  Dim Sum.

If you like Dim Sum, but not necessarily the MSG-coma, check this place out!  It's somewhat near the airport.  Service was nice 'n calm, not crazy/rude/rough/rushed like usual Chinese places.",2014-02-16 00:15:18

Upon just parking, you can already see the lines through their windows.  But one thing you have to keep in mind...it's new, it's lunch time, and it's located off Eastern Ave.  So many restaurants off Eastern Ave is super packed during lunch time.  Zupas was no different.

After finally getting parked, you walk in.  The line is organized somewhat like what you see at Disneyland (minus the fast pass).  However, the line for ordering does go pretty quick.  Your food is built in an assembly like fashion starting with your salads, sandwiches, soup, and finally desserts. The place is packed and the other concern is whether or not you will even have a seat.  Go ahead and try to save a table.  Can't do it, it's not allowed.  They even have signs posting that you cannot save a table.  This wasn't a problem since there's was at least 3 tables opened when we ate. But I'm sure there are days where seating in limited. 

As for their food, I got their Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini with their Lobster Bisque.  The soup portions are huge and the food portions are just okay.  My sandwich wasn't bad, actually was pretty good.  It's the soup that I rave about.  The the price and taste of their lobster bisque rivals other sitdown, more expensive restaurants.  Just wish there was thick pieces of lobster in there.  My total order came up to about $10 which included the sandwich, soup, drink, a strawberry, and a lunch roll.  

Prices are about average for the rest of the menu, but they do have a lunch special for $7.99.  This includes sandwich and half soup.  By the way, if you have a sweet tooth, then you have to try their desserts. I'm not saying it's good, because for one, I don't have a sweet tooth. And two, I didn't have any.  The presentation looks good. I guess I will just have to wait for someone else's review to see how good the sweets truly are.

Overall, I am giving this place 4 stars just because I will probably be back and so far, I'm a fan.

PS:  I still think Beach Hut Deli, which is located in the same parking lot, is better.  Also, not as busy.

Haven't seen it at this location yet. 

I've found door mats, garden decorations, and nice scented candles here. Household... Their candles are $1.99 though. Still a good find. They have small light bulbs, tons of cleaning products... which by the way LA's Awesome lemon dishwash liquid - I swear works in cleaning off cabinet surfaces, refrigerator interior, stove top surfaces. I used it to clean almost the entire kitchen at our old apartment without having to spray allergy causing cleaners.

This is where we get our nail polish remover and cottonball/cotton pads. Beauty products... We're okay with cheap costs for that since they're quick use and dispose items. Hair bands and bobby pins are items we go through and lose somewhere we can no longer find; resupplies easily found at 99 cent store. There's a bag of generic qtips with 1000 count - yeah we buy that too. Haven't had an ear accident with em.

Many didn't know this, but if you browse their utility isle, you'll find some fun cellphone covers. Miscellaneous... I got 4pk Panasonic AA batteries.

This is also the spot for party supplies, easy gift wraps/bags accessories, and favors for all occasions and holidays.

The curry is good. It's thick and creamy and consistent in its spice level. It's full of vegetables and chicken and comes with an ample serving of fluffy rice. It's good. The pad see ew... less good. The allure of pad see ew, for me, is the giant chewy delightful noodles. I'd be fine doing away with the chicken and vegetables and just going at a huge pile of pad see ew noodles. The noodles from Thai Hana are thin, like pad Thai noodles, and the sauce was just too sweet for me to enjoy. I feel as though my dining life revolves around finding a Thai restaurant that has equally good curry and noodles... my search continues.

Plenty of options to explore, even from a somewhat simple menu, which should provide ample reasons to return. There were a few distinct highlights and a couple of minor lows, but overall this was a very pleasant dining experience for all. Here's what we had:

House mozzarella w/ spicy salami - This was a stand out winner! The house mozz is creamy, fresh, and delicious. The taste is very subtle, but not at all boring. In fact, the magic of the cheese is how good it seems to make anything you pair with it taste. The obvious pair on this platter was a MOUNTAIN of delicious spicy salami. I was amazed at the generosity of this serving and if I see this again in the future I will be returning often for this dish alone (although the pizzas were also very good). There are several other ways to order a few different styles of mozz and this is something my wife and I in particular are excited to explore more in the future. 

Margherita pizza - This is a perfect example of what old school Neapolitan pizza is all about. Everything about this dish is in service of the crust, and wow does it deliver. The wood burning oven they use for making pizzas at Novanta imparts a deliciously charred crust. There's a subtle but present smokiness that adds a ton to the overall taste. The bright red tomato sauce lends a crisp acidity that is a text book foil for the creamy, string mozzarella. The herbaciousness of the basil brings a floral earthiness to the whole experience that simply can not be beat. Margherita pizza is an almost unbeatable combination of flavors, and when prepared this well it is truly a thing of beauty. 

Garbanzo salad - There was a lot of good things going on in this salad, but for me the whole was somehow less than the sum of it's parts. The highlight to me was the shaved Parmigiano, which was a nice counterpoint to all the mozz we had elsewhere in the meal. The peppers were crisp and very sweet (perhaps almost overly so for the salad composition). I'm not an olive fan, so I sort of avoided the kalamatas and the garbanzo beans were abundant, but very plain (as they are...). To me, his salad was missing maybe one component (thin sliced red onion? a higher ratio of vinegar to oil?), it just seemed a bit out of balance. The wedge of flat bread that's served on top was VERY good, but I just couldn't get into the salad. All that being said, my wife would completely disagree, she chose this salad and thought it was excellent...

Caserta pizza - This was probably the biggest disappointment of the meal. The same delicious crust from the Margherita was totally drowned out by toppings that just weren't very tasty here. I think the prime offender may have been the salami, which had a slightly unpleasant aroma and taste in it's cooked form. The roasting of the peppers was very subtle and they could have used a bit more, while the onions were also under cooked for my taste. This sounded like a great combination to me, but it just didn't quite work. There are other options at Novanta that I'd be far more interested in checking out the next time I come in. 

So that was the food we enjoyed at Novanta (the most important part of a Yelp review). The restaurant space is very open and somewhat sparsely decorated. It was by no means uncomfortable, but also not the sort of place I wanted to luxuriate. Above all I think I'd say it was 'functional'. The staff was very pleasant and the value for what we ordered was good (not amazingly affordable nor out of reach). Both my wife and I mentioned to one another that upon finishing the meal were were pleasantly sated, not stuffed nor still hungry. 

I'll certainly be back to Novanta soon and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll need to update my review to include all five stars!",2015-11-23 14:20:23

I walked in the direction of the young woman. She said happily, ""Alison!"" I stepped closer, leaned down to let her get a good, clear look at my face and whispered, ""I'm not Alison."" Then I walked off, turning the corner and locating my party. Of course I had to tell the story to my family. It was bizarre, after all. The hostess walked by a couple minutes later (while I was telling the story) and said, ""Did she think you were someone else?"" I pointed at the hostess to add credibility to my story. ""See, exactly.""

That set the stage for a very enjoyable and often humorous dinner. From the topics of ""best friends with naked benefits"" to dirty playground jokes to politics, we discussed a wide range of topics. We also enjoyed our meal. I had a salad with shrimp. The waiter was happy to accommodate my request to substitute shrimp with chicken. I also ordered a 22 oz Blue Moon (on happy hour price). Since it was both my and my brother's birthday (we are 5 years apart), we got two free desserts. I let my family select what dessert they wanted. I would have gone with something chocolate, though. My brother went with the white chocolate lava cake. So did my parents. I ate a little bit of it, but soon noticed that my inability to eat white chocolate hasn't change. It's just way too sweet. 

As for the meals, everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. My dad got the Guiltless Salmon with extra veggies. My brother order fajitas. My step mom got something she didn't order, although it did have chicken and shrimp in the mix. She picked at it. When I tasted a piece of her shrimp, I noticed it tasted burnt. Gross. No wonder she didn't eat much. She didn't seem to mind, though.

As for the service, it was great. The waiter knew it was a birthday dinner. He was attentive and fast. When the check came, a manager came over to ask whose birthday it was. I, slightly buzzed, gestured wildly and unrestrained to communicate it was mine birthday, as well as my little brother's. The manager thought that was cool. ""It's also their grandpa's birthday,"" my step-mom said. My brother chirped up, ""And the cat's!"" 

We hugged our goodbyes in front of Chili's and my brother and I set off down N. Mill to find something else to do to celebrate. All in all, a very nice birthday dinner. Chili's may not have been my first choice in ""fine dining"" on such an occasion, but I know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers. Usually I avoid chain restaurants like genital warts (or so I try), but I can hang at Chili's. After all, they have a little bit of something for everyone.",2008-02-14 19:14:37

We were seated promptly and the waitress got waters to us immediately and also got our margaritas out quickly. She answered all the questions we had about the menu in a precise fashion. 

I decided on the grilled Mahi Mahi burrito with a side of pasta salad and my fiancée got the Carne Asada burrito with fresh fruit on the side. The food came out quickly and was perfectly cooked. The Mahi Mahi was just spicy enough to break a sweat, but not overpowering. Same with the pasta salad, just enough spice and flavor. No complaints from across the table the Carne Asada was tender and flavorful and the fruit was fresh and succulent.

We have been about a half a dozen times since my original review always great. Expensive but it is considered a high end steak house. With that said I will begin with the new butter offering I though it just had a drizzol of oil and some cracked pepper ok I put some on my bread it was bread with what was pure salt. Could not taste anything but salt. Asked the buser for some plain butter when he came back I asked him what was on the butter? Some type of special Hawaiian island salt. He smiled, I said do you hear this request for plain butter a lot he gave me the knowing nod. This would not have been an issue if they had served both and explained the salted oily butter.
My husband and I started with crab cocktail it was good kinda hard to mess that up except the creamy mustard sauce served along side the very spicy cocktail sauce was like dipping your crab in mustard not as I remembered.
We split a steak house salad. It was ice cold not chilled more like it had been sitting in the fridge since early afternoon it was over dressed and mushy but what really annoyed me was the brown mush of avocado it was disgusting we each had a few bites before the forks went down. 
The buser took them away you could pretty much tell we did not eat them. Nobody came over to ask if everything was alright. I have a feeling instead of making them fresh to order they are now preparing them in the afternoon and putting them in the fridge unacceptable.
Entree we ordered prime rib we have had the prime rib here before and enjoyed it. We did notic they no longer offer the queen and king cuts. I would get the queen and my husband would get the king now it's a flat 16oz which with mine I would doubt even came close to that. When asked how we would like it we we were apprehensive to ask for mediumwell because a lot of times it comes back so well done it's like eating your shoe. Our waitress assured us she would talk to the chef and let them know we would like it lightly pink. Hahaha like the bottom of my shoe the pink had gone long ago. It was tasty. I ate the tender outside first when the waitress came to check and ask how it was cooked I showed her my overly well done prime rib she offered to redo it. nope we are just gonna finish up. check please. It was not worth the money this time. I'm so disappointed because this is so close to our house. Really the only good thing we ain't were our potatoes. Baked and a sweet.

Hot Entree's: I didn't even touch this, SUPER SUPER Greasy. You could see the oil bubbles. This wasn't Japanese hot dishes more like Americanized fast Chinese Food. 

Sushi: It wasn't fresh at all I'm guessing because they make it then its left out till someone grabs it and they love to pack on the rice, ONLY great thing about this place is they don't care if you eat the rice or not. So I had myself a lot of shashimi. 

Soup/Udon Noodles: There was a small area were the udon noodles were already pre-put into bowls and all you had to do was fill the bowl up with soup. The soup lacked flavor, the noodles were were out so long they dried up. Also no good. 

Desert: Their selection of deserts were very limited and mediocre, Sorry Mr. Makino I guess I was expecting more? The only exciting this about their desert selection was the fondue chocolate fountain (which was a mess) chocolate splatters every where. On the floor on the counter every where. Also the strawberries were half frozen still so the warm fondue chocolate quickly turned cold once it touched the strawberries. I like my chocolate strawberries either hardened or warm and melty

The place: First off this place was disgusting, when I first walked in I couldn't help but notice the floor had bits and pieces of food all over it.

The food sleek for itself, very simple, good, and well seasoning.

But I think the big mistake is the front, it's dirty, the paint need a bright new layer, and their signs are hand cut vinyl and tape paper. I put 4/5 because the food is great, the service is fast and nice ever at Atwater market but clearly the restaurant who is open all year long need a make over.",2017-06-11 21:10:14

So if you do get ask for half and half, make sure you specify that you want them separated haha. I'm still confused.

Plenty of room for a nice size lunch crowd, and I noticed most people were there for the sushi. I wanted Korean food, so we started with a kimchi pancake. It was huge, a single pancake the size of a large dinner plate, thick, and sliced like a pizza. Velvety inside, tasty, but without much crispness. I was disappointed with the soy sauce dipping sauce, hoping for something with a little more spice, and flavor. The 4 panchan side dishes were average, not spicy, or very flavorful. I had the beef Bi Bim Bap, and my daughter ordered the pork Bulgogi. 

The Bap had a nice mix of cucumbers, mushrooms, carrots, and traditional Korean sprouts. The beef was tender, but the egg was not sizzling hot, the kochujang (hot pepper paste) added flavor, but the dish still seemed like it was missing something.

This was my experience at Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar when 4 of us stopped by after the last Steeler's game. We had originally intended to go to the Bettis 36 Grill and grab some food to wait out the traffi but, there was a line out the door. So, we kept walking and decided to try the Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar instead. When we arrvied, the place was fairly full of football fans but we were able to get a table right away. Our waiteress was quick to get us some hot drinks since it was freezing outside. We were able to watch the rest of the games on the multiple tvs in the dining room. I ordered a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup and tried my husband's quesadilla. The quesadilla was pretty average. It came with a small amount of corn and bean salsa. I would have preferred a side of guac. However, my chicken tortilla soup was fantastic. Just what I needed to warm up on a cold December day. I would argue that the soup was homemade which is quite unusual for a sports bar. The flavors were spot on and the chicken was in shredded chunks, not the unifromed cut up pieces you tend to see in this type of restaurant. My only criticism is that I wish there was more of it. The bowl was fairly small. Another interesting aspect of this bar is the cigar lounge. If you're a smoker or a cigar fan then you's probably enjoy this aspect. I did not. The smoke wafted out of the lounge and down the hall into the bathrooms! Luckily, the dining room was far enough away that I wasn't bothered while I ate. However, I smelled like a cigarette factory after a quick trip to the bathroom. Better ventilation is definatey neeed. I was also quite surprised by the bathroom attendants. This does not seem like the type of place to have an attendant. Overall, a good place to grab a meal before or after the game, just avoid the cigar lounge if you are not a smoker.",2013-01-09 22:11:08

He ordered, then went to pick it up.  Firstly, when he got there (about 9:15pm on a Saturday night), the place was empty.  He was a bit surprised, but now we know why.

We ordered 2 medium pizzas, because we like different toppings, and figured we'd have enough for us to enjoy on Sunday, as well.  Plus, an order of their garlic bread.  

I'll start with the bread...it was as if they drowned this poor bread in butter.  I enjoy garlic bread as much as the next person, but neither of us could fathom eating another piece.  It had no flavor, other than butter.  It was as if I poured melted butter in my mouth, and that's it...yech!!!

The pizza's looked and smelled good.  However, that's where the enjoyment ended.  I had 2 toppings on mine (meatballs & caramelized onions), and I know I saw them on the pizza, but I could not taste them.  All I got was a sour, bitter taste in my mouth from each bite.  My husband's was no better.  His had ricotta & tomatoes on it, he took one bite and looked at me with the strangest look on his face.  We had ranch dressing (which was very bland), so we both tried dipping into that, hoping it would help...it didn't.  We ended up throwing what was left of the pizza's away...what a waste!  

A little later, both of us didn't feel well, and ended up being up most of the night due to that.

There were so many items that I wanted to try, but my tummy wasn't big enough for all the vegan things... Next time.  My family was staying at the Mandalay, so it was honestly veggie luck that Hussong's was just a few steps from our room.

On the first visit, I got the Fish Baja Tacos. The tacos were good, but it appeared that the Gardein fishless filets were 1/2 the normal size; I may have gotten 1 or 2 bites of the filet. It was basically a cabbage taco. Also, I tasted, and subsequently saw, vegan cheese inside my tacos. I do not like cheese; vegan or otherwise. The menu does not list cheese in the description, so that was perturbing.  (Side note: it is not listed in the menu description, but this dish also comes with beans and rice.)

On the second visit, I got the Chile Relleno with the Gardein Chick'n strips. This dish is supposed to come with mixed garlic, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and potatoes, then topped with Daiya (vegan cheese) shreds and avocado, served over a tostado with beans and rice.  I requested no tomatoes or cheese. What did I get? Well, I got the open poblano pepper with ""chicken"" strips, tomatoes, avocado slices, a mystery sauce drizzled atop, and the tostado, which was surrounded by a mole sauce. The garlic, onions, carrots, and potatoes were no where to be found. This is a $17 dish. I am going to need them to not omit 1/2 of the ingredients. I picked out the tomatoes and the remaining dish was good, but I wanted the rest of that darn filling!  

The beans & rice, however, were excellent. They were among some of the best and most flavorful vegan rice and beans I have ever had.  

I'd love to give some of the other menu items a try, like that Habanero Guacamole dish, and the Sopes.  But the kitchen needs to make sure they know what does and does not go in their dishes, and/or update the menu descriptions accordingly. 

They were open from 11am-11pm. Carry out orders need to placed at the bar, or you may call ahead. Hussong's Cantina is located in the Shoppes area.

There is a live band that keeps the place lively. During all my visits, I have seen at least a couple of groups coming here for some celebration or the other. On once occasion, I saw a newly wed couple , in their wedding dress with their friends having an amazing time here. Their servers have a different dress code, something from the early 1900 era.

The second thing you'll notice is the measure of drinks :D you can order a  0.5 Litre mug or a 1 litre mug (which is pretty big and equivalent to 3 pints). We usually opt for the 1 Litre mug as it looks kinda fancy. They have a pretty good collection of drinks, most of them brewed by them. I'm a fan of their Oktobefest. Teir food is pretty good too.

Points for the clean front of house. I was expecting it to be a little seedy, but the decor was bright and inviting. Now, to be fair, I've never had Afghani food before. So perhaps I'm not a fan of Afghani food in general-- but I was unimpressed.

The menu on the wall is a bit confusing and doesn't offer any description of what each dish is. Thankfully, they have a printed menu to help you out a bit.

My boyfriend ordered the Vaziri Lamb and really liked that lamb chop kebabs, and was less enchanted with the ground lamb. I ordered the Chaplee Kabob, because it was the spiciest thing on the menu and with two chili peppers beside it, I was in. 

But when our food was ready, all of it kind of looked like dog food. Honestly? Zero points for presentation. Every kebab that came out of the kitchen was brown. Brown, brown, brown. My Chaplee Kabob was two brown patties with a salad and rice. No sauces to accompany the meats, except for the watery, bruschetta like red sauce that they told me was 'hot sauce' when I asked for some. The white sauce tasted like bottled ranch dressing. I think the dressing on the salad was the same thing. So definite loss of points for not making their own sauces, or if those sauces were homemade-- points off for tasting like bottled sauces and/or just bland.

I should say that while the Afghani Naan was hot-- it was quite delicious, but it quickly cooled into a miniature surfboard with sesame seeds.

The spices in the meat were nice, but nothing spectacular--definitely tasted better than dog food, but not especially tender of mouthwatering. I just wasn't too impressed with this lunch--especially with the great reviews it receives from Yelpers whom I know and trust.

Like I said-- maybe it's just not my thing. I normally love new types of food because there are so few that I haven't tried. But I have to say that I was very let down by this experience. Probably would not go back.",2014-03-09 19:23:13

The bartenders weren't the friendliest, and I ordered some boneless wings, half mild and half the ranch dry rub. The wings came out in a timely manner, but the sauce on the mild was orange, which to me, means they are spicy. And I can't do any spice ... Like, on a scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness that I can handle, I can handle barely a 1. I thought I would give them a try anyway - and they had a kick. I haven't ordered wings here before, so I thought that they could very well be mild, but I wanted to check with the bartender. Which is exactly what I said to her, that I haven't eaten here before and I wanted to make sure that I got the right wings in my order and that they were mild. Well, you should have seen the way she looked at me - like I was totally stupid for even asking that and she said ""Yes they are mild - I didn't put in the wrong order"" in a very snotty tone to me. I sat down quickly, and my boyfriend ending up eating the wings. They also gave sour cream to dip my wings in, which I have never had before - it wasn't bad, but you usually get ranch or bleu cheese. Maybe it's something new? Lastly, I had to give my card at the bar when I ordered the wings, so when I checked out, I thought to myself, I need to get my card back. So I got my check to sign and walked away without my card. Now, I know I could have remembered to get it, but it was also sitting right on top of the register - the bartender could have handed it to me.

The meat in the pho is decent enough as pho usually uses cheap cuts. What I normally get here is the broken rice with grilled chicken. Their nuoc mam game is on point. The bun is good too.

The 9 complex is gorgeous. For you non-locals out there, this particular building was an outdated, rather homely, high-rise right smack in the middle of Downtown Cleveland. No doubt a reminder of the slow decline of CLE's past. Not anymore! The exterior of the complex now screams upscale, chic city-nightlife, especially with it's flashy video signage (a la micro-mini-Times Square). Inside it has the same fancy decor, trendy-chic updates to draw not only locals, but travelers alike. Trust me... we have more than enough character-filled hole-in-the-walls and artisan cocktail bars. Some flashy, big-city upgrades are what Downtown Cleveland needs. Plus, this whole project actually saved historic buildings.

Now for the dining experience! 

Service
- I found our server to be sugary-sweet nice, but a little on the shaky side. He was really helpful with the drink menu, although he had to take a look when I asked him sparkling wine suggestions (by the glass.) Again--these are new servers in a new restaurant. This is to be somewhat expected Otherwise he was great with the menu and seemed so happy to be there, which is a major plus on my list. 
- He did forget to put in our order for an extra pita pillow, which isn't a game-changer, but isn't great either.
- When our food was ready, it came out in the hands of about 3 different servers, which I appreciated because it meant they wanted all four of us to get our hot food at the same time. However, not one of them knew who was getting which dish and my pasta almost slid off the plate because the server set it down without much care. 

Food: 
- We ordered the hummus trio shared plate with the pita pillows. It was delicious! I loved how the pita pillow came out puffed-up--stabbing it with a fork was almost too much fun. Just one criticism though... While the menu says, ""Pita Pillows"" you actually get just a single pita. It's honestly not enough for 3 people--the dish should just come with two without the extra charge. There is no pre-dinner bread served here, and how expensive is a pita?
- I tried the Trancredi Sunday Sauce, which I heard was orgasmic. It was delicious, but not mind-blowing good. I wish I had just tried the dish without hearing about it first. It came with a sauce containing huge hunks of pulled pork, which sounds great, right? It was... it just needed more punch--there wasn't quite enough salt or spice. My dining guests ordered the Chicken Francaise with Parmesan polenta. Oh-my-god. This dish is where it's at. You don't really expect memorable chicken dishes from a restaurant, but this one was all kinds of perfect: Tender chicken, creamy-salty-cheesy polenta and Brussels sprouts. 

Overall: 
A memorable, fancy, fun and delicious experience--but not a cheap one, by any means. I was a little surprised by the prices, but I'm assuming they're targeting a business travel crowd and not so much happy hour-ing locals, if that makes sense. Either way, like I mentioned before, CLE has plenty of cheaper options with artisan, locally-sourced foods, microbrews and craft cocktails. This upscale downtown restaurant fits a different market, which is perfect for the new downtown CLE.",2014-11-04 17:59:33

You can also take out the Dim Sum, which we usually do when there is crowd. This place used to be empty when they started few years ago. Now the word of mouth brought them so many customers. You will have to wait in you come after 11:30AM. A friend of mine come down there every week from fountain hills to meet with us. 

The staff is very nice and friendly. They also have a quiet room for reservation if you have party of 10 more. If you are shopping at Lee Lee supermarket, you don't want to miss this Dim Sum place.",2009-11-17 17:20:29

Came in here for bottomless brunch - which is mimosa, Bellini, and Bloody Mary. It was $15 on top of the food you choose. The food I got was about $12. They were really great in serving us. They give you a glass of your choosing at first and then they just ended up giving us bottles instead.

I got the steak and egg tacos. It was okay with all the ingredients together. The steak by itself was so good. Everything else was just okay. It's not something I would get again or would recommend. 

I tried the French toast. That was really good! I definitely would recommend their French toast.

I ordered the carnitas.  It was a bunch of pulled beef on a bed of green chili salsa with red onions on top.  It was overly salty to the extent that I couldn't eat it.  It was like eating beef where the only spice is salt.  My wife tried it and agreed.  Perhaps it's supposed to be very salty because the place is called ""Salt & Lime.""  Anyway, I told the waiter and he said he'd tell the cook.  No offer to get me something else or anything.

When the meal was over, the waiter asked how it was and I said I can't eat it because it's overly salty.  At that point he said he'd take it off our bill and asked me if I wanted anything else to eat.  By that time I'd already filled up on the flour tortillas and chips.  So I declined.  Anyway, my wife had already finished eating at this point and it's not practical to wait for another meal when we're basically done.  She should have offered at the start of the meal.

The funny thing is that when we finished eating, my wife said her burrito (had shrimp in it) was also very salty.  Salt seems to be their seasoning of choice.

I would have rated the restaurant 1 star, but since they didn't make me pay for a lightly eaten salty carnitas, I've bumped it up to 2 stars.

If you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . 

His movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. 

He is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.

This Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. 

The Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.

Service was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. 

Inside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!",2009-06-25 08:22:39

""it's up to you if you register it or not"" you already took ownership. Last thing he told us was that he would also search for a comparable car. ""So what is it you want?

Beautifully Elegant!
It begins at 12 noon and goes to 4pm... at least that's when we left. 
Pretty much because we were too busy gabbing and drinking.
Oh!  I forgot to mention... the bottomless mimosas and champagne.  (Yes, there's a fee for them, but it's a reasonable fee for all the champs we consumed in 4 hours!)

The Ambiance and Service - 
Quiet, Understated Elegance
You are not rushed; You are pampered.

The Food - 
Not your typical brunch; Not your typical buffet either.
There's a few stations: sushi, sashimi (just ask), oysters, crab, shrimp; meat carving station; meats and cheese; variety of salads; dim sum; custom-to-order noodle soup; desserts galore.

And then there's your entrée that you order from a menu of about 8 options.  

I've been to this brunch twice... ordered the Grouper once and the Scallops once.  Both were Fantastic!  The Grouper melted in your mouth. It was light and succulent. The Scallops were perfectly grilled, moist, tender and meaty.  Both were lovely choices that I'd order again.

My mother ordered the Waffles once and the Chicken Makhani once.  The Chicken Makhani hands down is decadent and rich.  It's definitely filling.  She took most of it home.  Now, this is not to say the Waffles are not good. They are VERY good... but the Chicken Makhani was amazing.  


Note: This is the kind of place you go to for a leisurely brunch where you want to wine and dine for a bit.  I believe for the bottomless champs and brunch it was $93pp plus tax and tip. While this is pricey, remember where you are and that the quality of the food and champagne is top notch.  I highly recommend going with folks who enjoy dining and enjoy really good food and wonderful service.  It will be lost on those looking for the run of the mill buffet.",2015-01-28 06:27:14

They have a HUGE breakfast menu, which is served all day long.  I just love all-day breakfast, it's my favourite.  And Dairy Lane certainly hits the top of the list for that one.  They've got all different sorts of dishes from healthy ones to super greasy ones.  You can get your basic fried eggs and ham, french toast, eggs Benny's, yogurt and granola, or even the classic breakfast sandwich.

Careful now, a lot of their food is a little messy, sloppy, or hard to eat, but well worth the mess.  One of my favourite things is that they actually advertise on the menu that you can substitute your usualy hashbrowns for half a grapefruit, fresh fruit bowl or fresh tomato.  I absolutely love that!

They also have a great lunch menu with a bunch of different burgers and sandwiches.  I've only ever tried the breakfast stuff (because I'm addicted to breakfast) but the burgers all look huge and quite appetizing.  I'll stick with my breakfast, thank you very much!

Seriously, Dairy Lane is one of the cutest places ever!  It can get a little crowded, though, since there's only seating for about 20, and usually a bit of a line.  It's well worth the wait to enjoy a meal at Dairy Lane, though.  Hello new favourite breakfast joint!",2009-11-15 01:36:54

Gambling...The only slot machine I'll play is Mermaid's Gold...and they have it!!!  I never win but I love to get their random bonuses.

Sports book...this location is so nice.  It almost feels like a den when you sit in the leather chairs to watch a game.  It's very comfy and entertaining to sit in the bar area....just get there early on a big game day, otherwise you aren't going to get a seat!

Ovation...this is a really nice venue.  It's small and intimate.  It'd be great if they could get more acts to perform...I know we would spend more time there if they did.

Buffet...I normally am not a fan of buffets but this one is very nice.  I'd strongly suggest the breakfast buffet.  Don't forget to get their players card.  You get a discount on the price of the buffet.

The Tree of Life was what I originally planned, but it changed in a split second like a Jedi mind trick when I saw BACON JAM and MAPLE BACON described in the LGBTQ Sandwich, a pretty BOMB rendition of the BLT. We also chose to split the Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad with Candied Pecans. Service here is very pleasant and the workers even toss your salad order if you would like them to. Unfortunately, this salad was lacking in flavor and the pecans lacked that sweet toasted flavor. Their version of a Snickerdoodle was dry and crumbly. The Loving vs. Virginia (AKA Brookie) was nice, warm, chewy, and decadent.

Great spot to chill and meet up for a nice healthy lunch. I'd like to return to  try the highly raved about Tree of Life Pita and Bizness Salad because I heard it was the business...For now, it sits at a little more than A-OK for me.  ALOHA!!!

a blog site that i frequent, recommended this place as a ""new age swiss chalet"" personally i think that's disrespectful to swiss chalet...Swiss chalet can't hold a candle to this place...truthfully. 
located within a comfortable walking distance from either queen or king street, this one off spot, is utterly simple and amazing, everything is promoted as super fresh, and super fresh is what you get. walked in to find a concrete sanctuary of what seemed like a hall style restaurant, what with the high ceilings, everything is super bright and the menu display is very legible. i was a bit taken back by how many people were not eating dinner at this restaurant. as when we walked it, we were the only customers. my first ""complaint"" if at all, they have a tiny piece of space on the menu board that says to order here...but it is behind a concrete pillar. ordered the food, and sat down to one of a dozen seats. the food arrived at the table (impressive) within about ten minutes if that, i loved how we could watch the open display of it all...the start of the meal, all the way to being wrapped up, and brought to our table. 
now to the good stuff

The absolute flavor of this food, is amazing, i love how they combine ingredients together to make an amazing and light blend come together. not withstanding as a hot sauce freak, they offer a hot sauce here, that is on the medium scale, very flavorful and very balanced, which is hard to accomplish, the chimichurri sauce was ok...as i was fascinated with the hot sauce. 

very happy to have spent a date night here, great food, cozy environment, killer staff service and amazing ingredients\hot sauce.

This location has to do better. I permitted and dismissed a number of things but it's been months since the grand opening and the sauce portions are still the worst, they are slow as snails - I rate this based on my online order for a 7:45pm pick up and I get there and had to wait as they were just starting. Please note: I arrived at 7:48pm maybe 7:50pm. 
My order? 4 orders of meatballs. 

What I later learned while standing there it would have been cheaper to order it the way it's posted in the store and I would have received 6 meatballs per order not 5. Well, the website doesn't allow for that and I'll take that up with corporate. 

All in all N&C is a midwest tradition and I hope it picks up around these parts since this is home now. 

There are things that are not on the menu nowadays but the manager, Mr. Willie, is familiar with them so just ask for it to be made.

Upon entering the not so busy restaurant, I was greeted by the lovely owner Oak, who told me to sit wherever  would like.  I got there by 12:30 pm and there was plenty of room...

Looking at their comprehensive menu that lists both breakfast and lunch items, I noticed they had crepes on their menu and decided to give them a try instead of the pancakes  was dreaming about.

Well, my choice was excellent. I ordered the crepes with blueberries and they were scrumptious. It came as an order of three crepes and  I could really tell that the batter was made from scratch. The crepes were served rolled up with blueberries inside and they were honestly to die for.I was almost tempted to order another set but the owner Oak funnily sad to me: ""Oh no, don't do that, you'll be too full.""

Oak the owner was a sweetheart and queried whether it was my first time there.I replied no that I hadn't been there and nearly six years to which she replied: ""How come you haven't been here in that long ? Come back okay!  She was delightful with her Korean accent.

As soon as the drinks and food started flowing everyone  was up singing and dancing all around the rooms. Great service, food and drinks!

Most recently I made a visit to on a Saturday night with my girls and we had a great time, the DJ was playing good music and it was very lively which made for great atmosphere for a ""girls night out"". We started with a round of drinks of course, I ordered the Harajuku Lover which was made with pear vodka and sparkling sake, it was the perfect drink to get the night started. We also ordered an array of appetizers my favs were the edamame and the seasoned fried calamari rings. We got our drinks and appetizers pretty quick but we all ordered specialty maki rolls for our dinner and some of us had to wait up to 45 min. after the first person at the table got their food. I get that that everything is made to order but if we put our orders in at the same time  45 min. is a long time to wait. At one point everyone had their rolls except for me and I had to ask the server was my order put in. If we hadn't been drinking and talking and enjoying ourselves I would have definitely complained.I'm still giving them 4 stars because out of all the times that I come to Geisha this was the only night that there was a slight glitch in the service.

I am going on a trip in a few months and wanted an extra battery and a car charger for the camera.  I checked online but some of the OEM products I am just not willing to try yet.  I'd rather spend the money of real products from a reputable store than to deal with something purchased online that may or may not work.  

So I stopped in here on Saturday morning.  I walked in and someone greeted me right away and asked what I was looking for so he grabbed the battery for me.  I asked about the car charger and he pointed that out to me as well but you have to buy the charger and the travel package separately.  Ok...as long as I know they will work together. 

I came home and the battery works.  The charger seems a little cheap but it fits all sorts of SLR batteries and it has a USB port which will also come in handy.    

Besides all of my needs, they also sell lenses of all sorts, they have rent cameras and have all sorts of accessories for your camera.  And the best part, at least for me, is they are convenient and I don't have to drive all over Charlotte to get there.

Food (8.0/10) = started off with the Jamaican jerk chicken wing appetizers.  When I go back to kaya, this is all I'm going to order.  Absolutely loved it.  The cilantro cream sauce is the best.  I was scraping the plate with the edge of my knife trying to get every ounce of that sauce.  If I wasn't dining with my friends, I would've licked the plate clean like a dog.  Also ordered the fish tacos since it was the most mentioned item on yelp.  The fish itself was nicely done.  Tilapia.  Crispy.  Moist.  Soft.  The only thing weird about the flavor profile was the thousand island dressing in the taco.   It wasn't bad...just felt out of place?  The quantity was a bit overboard as well.  3 big tacos on a platter for $17.  Two tacos would've been just perfect.  This seems to be a recurring formula for restaurant success in Pittsburgh = large quantities of food per order (other examples:  Pamela's, Church Brew).  

Ambiance (7.0/10) = we sat outside.  Strip district is really dead at night.  First time I visited the strip at night.  The surroundings felt like a post-apocalyptic movie, such as I am Legend with Will Smith.

Service (7.5/10) = felt a little awkward whenever our waitress interacted with us.  Not sure what it was.  She was still nice though.  

Overall opinion = fish tacos (most mentioned item on Yelp) is done well by the folks at Kaya, but that thousand island dressing...it bothers me.  If you haven't had it, I'd still try it out.  The real winner, the gold medalist, the award winning dish of Kaya has to be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wings.  The skin is crispy.  The wings are juicy.  And that amazing cilantro cream sauce!

Garvin the owner, happened to be there wrapping up the night and explained how he found this abandoned boat and worked on it himself for over a yr to make it into what it is today. You feel the quaintness and cozy relaxed feel he was trying to achieve. He wants as many people as possible to experience the canal lounge, hence doesn't book the boat for private events (too bad). 
My husband and I were lucky to experience sitting inside as well as on the tip of the boat outside late evening. Completely different experiences. The outside seating is a coveted spot, no reservations taken!!

They had a simple menu with my favorite - Tonkatsu black. The black garlic oil was a lot stronger than I had wanted, so it might be wise to ask for it on the side so you can add it to your taste. They have a choice between thick and thin noodles, depending on what you want. We went for an early dinner so it wasn't very packed and we got our ramen quickly after we put our order in. The broth was rich and fatty just as I was craving for. Be prepared to feel a bit greasy after, but totally worth it.

The lady at the desk was very friendly and welcoming. She gave me a Kindle to use to guide me through the museum. I recommend you accept the kindle. It adds great value to the experience in terms of what the artist was thinking of and intending and as to how all the art relates to each other. For the one gallery there was even a video of the artist explaining the gallery.

The lady at the desk told me to come and ask if I had any questions and genuinely seemed to care as to whether I would enjoy myself. 

This particular exhibit I felt was really something that resonated with me since I love to travel and since our city, Cleveland, is quickly developing. There were photographs taken observing people in their cars, in their high rise apartments, via Google Earth satellite, and to me most interestingly with other strangers on the street. There was also a multi-media instalment. I think it was my favourite as it dealt with a subject I often consider when I travel.

Right off the bat she was super sweet and hilarious! I picked out my color and she quickly begin removing my old polish. Now let me cut to the chase. I have never in my experience had someone clean my nails as well as she did. It was like they were never really cleaned before. She took her time and was very precise with detail throughout the entire process. We shared stories with each other and I swear It felt like I had known this sweet woman for years!

I took the lil' one with me for a burger. She had the kids meal which is a slider and frys and drink. She liked the slider but wanted more cheese. She also laughed at the ""little bit of mustard"" Seriously it was a dot.... 

I had the 2/3lb Cheddar burger. It was good BUT If your customer asks if the burgers are frozen and premade or fresh and handmade you might explain that the 2/3 is actually 2x 1/3 patties. IT IS A DOUBLE 

I prefer burgers cooked med rare on open flame, a 2/3lb would be a nice thick burger.....well not if it is 2 x 1/3 Right? 

They were cooked well done but still had a decent amount of flavor. The toppings were sparse, one small tomato and two small pieces of lettuce. The cheddar spread was good but did not have enough to taste it over the two patties. The bun was good. 

The frys were good, a little under cooked but I happen to like it that way. 

The staff was pleasant but the server should ask if you need anything before dropping the plates and running to hide behind the counter again. (I needed to ask for additional mustard)

 First of all, the layout is just kind of silly.  I totally understand that this is an olllldddd building, so you work with what you're given.  That being said, the entrance/exit is too small and the condiment line backs up into that exit.  It's really frustrating that people feel some need to create a single file line to get sodas, napkins, utensils and condiments when really, there is A LOT of room to share.  It's a really long condiment bar!  Second of all it's way out there for us.  Living in Downtown Phoenix makes the trek out to Gilbert pretty rough sometimes.  Finally, they wouldn't let me sub a smaller version of the green bean fries for regular fries, even though I was willing to pay more than the normal sub fee.

On to the good... The grilled cheese I got was really yummy.  It was made with really thick Texas Toast style bread, had some great cheese on the inside, and it was toasted/grilled just right.  It was a very hearty grilled cheese!  The green bean fries that I wanted just a single sized portion of turned out to be like 3 pounds piled high in a basket!  They were really good and garlicky, and for only 5 bucks a great value.  However, I really just wanted enough for myself because as it turns out, I continued eating them until I made myself sick.

Even though I really like Fuego Bistro (same owners), I have to admit all the food here really has that extra something (maybe it's the chef? Hells ya.) Also, the decor and ambiance at Tacos caters to a more trendy, urban customer. Tacos is more polished, slightly funky, and modern; whereas the bistro is a more traditional Caribbean-style place.

The idea is great! Vegan and organic, what's not to love about that? The menu looks good and has many options. But there were a few issues that need addressed.

One is the smell. The restaurant has a bad smell. I am not even sure how to describe. Somewhere between toilet water and cheese. Maybe it was the wall to wall wood. Maybe it was something else. The bathroom itself didn't smell strongly, I checked it. However, the smell was there. 

The second is the portions. I ordered a meatball sandwich with a side of seasonal vegetables. The sandwich was a tiny little hamburger bun with little tiny meatballs on it. I was really disappointed, and really hungry! The veggies were good but needed salt or oil or both! I can't believe that tiny sandwich was $10. 

Now the actual taste of everything was good. The meatballs were interesting and the fake cheese was weird but vegan cheese is always weird.

Originally, we had our hearts set on trying kaka in Markham which recently opened but we found out they didn't do AYCE lunch. We were at Vaughan Mills so we were just gonna head east to Yoshiko at Bathurst and Steeles (my personal fave) but decided to give a new local place a try :)---big regret!

I was kind of unimpressed right off the bat from the menu, I know AYCE lunch menus have less on them than dinner but I just felt like it was lacking something! Very limited side dishes. They did have red tuna rolls though which I haven't seen on many all you can eat lunch menus.

Normally when I go for sushi I order a ridiculous amount of food because I just want everything. In this case, there were only a few things I was even willing to eat.

The miso soup came first, watered down!! So was the thousand island dressing they used in their green salad. 

My friend ordered a nestea (which costed $1.50 extra) we saw the nestea cans but made bets that they'd bring it in a cup- bingo!! They did, and it was watered down. He asked for an actual can and the waitress just walked away to get it, didn't even reply- busted! I ended up sipping on his watered down drink for the rest of the meal.

The rolls were nothing to write home about- I consider myself a dynamite roll connoisseur and this one had the most miniscule amount of shrimp I've ever seen, the spicy tuna was meh, and the California was meh. My friend really didn't like his sushi pizza and I wasn't crazy about my beef teriyaki- too thick pieces and very peppery! Oh and the best part, he tried to order spicy chicken- it was literally chicken pieces cut up and soaked in like Sriracha, totally could have made that at home and saved myself $15 lol!

At the end we decided to wash down our joke of a meal with ice cream but realized they didn't even have dessert on the lunch menu! (it was one of those check off menus) my friend asked the waitress about it and she handed him a small check off menu- all I could think was what the hell, if he didn't ask they would not have offered this- then I thought of all the poor people who never got any dessert with their lunch because they didn't think to ask!!

The dessert is the only thing I give them props for because they brought the ice cream and fried banana AT THE SAME TIME!! Bless.

I really feel bad writing bad reviews but I'm about to get to the best part..

The bills came and my friend and I both had a charge for pop on our bills even though he was the only one that ordered one. They tried to charge me for sipping on his watered down mess! No thank you! They tried to argue it but there was no way in hell I was paying for that- heck if I wanted to order a pop I'd take a diet coke over Nestea anyway!

Requested to please have Bryan sent out again as he had done such a great job at our place last year.  The dispatcher (I embarrassed as I cannot recall her name, dang!) was outstanding.  She found a Saturday slot for us as we work during the week.  Thanks for that!

Bryan gave a courtesy call this morning letting us know he was 25 minutes out.  When Bryan arrived, it was great to see him again.  He got right to work (he showed respect for our home by putting on covers on his shoes to prevent dirt from getting on our floor which really wasn't necessary, but was appreciated.

Bryan informed us what he would do during the annual AC servicing.  My wife had a question about capturing and reusing the AC condensation water for her houseplants.  Bryan said confirmed her question and informed the condensation was not a problem.  He like my wife's (she's always been clever with this kind of stuff) condensation water recycling solution so much that he snapped a couple of pics on his phone.  He also kindly installed a threaded cap that allowed the hose to fit more securely into the rigged condensation piping coming out of our roof mounted AC.  Thanks Bryan!

Bryan carried out the AC service and did not find any outstanding issues which was welcome news.  I explained that as things were kind of hectic last year, we did not get the heat pump looked at before last Winter.  He explained that he could automatically set us up for the Winter service and showed us our options which we took advantage of a reasonably priced plan.  Appreciate Bryan's proactive suggestion with our busy schedule, now we won't miss that important Winter service for our heat pump.

Very satisfied with Bryan's friendly and professional bearing.  This reflects very well on him personally and on Howard Air.  Great job to you all!  See you this coming Fall!",2015-06-13 23:37:52

He also said regardless of the side I'd get I'd get a baked tomato but no baked tomato came with my dish! Greek salad has iceberg lettuce and garden salad comes with Thousand Island dressing FYI.

I thought it was supposed to be a nicer sit down restaurant but it was like a $5 breakfast place when pay as you have to get up to pay. That only took forever, as well as 5 people to do the bill. Really?

The service was friendly. They do not have any Persian-inspired cocktails, just daiquiris and margaritas. I was hoping for something out of the ordinary for drinks but nope.

I called about 5 different spots to get estimates explaining the window was only about 3 feet tall by 2 feet wide. I was shocked at the quotes I was given. Most places charged a lot more than I expected, because the windows crank out so there is additional costs for putty and placement. The first couple of guys I talked to gave me their quotes, then told me that was ""standard pricing"" when I said I was going to call around more. The last guy was actually pretty rude about it. I decided to stop looking  at the well known places and starting skimming the net for contractors. 

I finally found Garcia's and was amazed when I was quoted about $200 less than at the other companies. The gentleman that came out was polite, professional and very clean (he even cleaned up some of the broken glass I had missed). He was done in just under an hour and the window looks great.

When your first approach it it has a rustic modern architecture. The owner stated that the area had originally been occupied by a four car garage and they took the reclaimed wood from said garage and add it to the Decour of the building.
The menu is very limited. They have no full bar. But they do have local beer and wine offerings. Their pizzas and Panini's are incredible. However my favorite thing to do is to grab a cappuccino and sit out on the back patio area in the morning on the weekend.
Speaking of the back porch, it is genuinely amazing. It has Edison bulb tea lights outside and a very rustic atmosphere.

After all, what kind of authenticity could I expect from a place with such a silly name? Who is this Mr. Chop Chop, and is he the mascot of the restaurant? 

Well, OBVIOUSLY I was a fool. A silly, misguided fool! Whoever Mr. Chop Chop is, I'd definitely want to be his friend. 

We've ordered from them twice and its been consistently flavorful and fast. The boy always gets a red curry when we have thai, and the first time he got a Mongolian beef that he enjoyed. Last time we ordered the curry, spicy mint pork, chicken satay, tom yum kai and crab rangoon. The rangoon was fat with cream cheese and a bit of crab, and the wontons were light and crispy. The curry was spicy and had lots of vegetables with juicy bits of chicken. 

I love tom yum kai and use it as my gauge, and their's was great. It had a definite home-made feel, with big chunks of galangal and lemongrass. The chicken was tender and definitely a lot fresher than some of the other places I've tried. They put strips of jalapeno into the soup and it was definitely spicy! 

The satay came with a peanut sauce and some sweet vinegar pickles that were delicious! A great compliment to the rich peanut sauce. 

The pork was also good, with a medley of vegetables and lots of chunks of fresh garlic. The meat was flavorful without being dense or overly porky, and the mint was a great addition. It made the whole dish taste lighter, fresher and more balanced. 

The delivery was relatively quick, within an hour, and we were very satisfied with the spice level. Most places go easy on it doubting our abilities as caucasians, leaving me to dump chili sauce into it. That was definitely not the case here, my first bite of the tom yum kai was a  shock. So spicy! It was great! I appreciate their generosity with the spice. 

We only got one rice with the meal, but it was enough for the meal. I may need to make a fresh batch for the leftovers, of which there is plenty. We got a ton of food for about $40 with enough for another meal. If we hadn't been so enthusiastic about trying things, we probably could have gotten a third meal out of it.

OLD_9M6xWW8BKovoo_jtDw,3xmsld7B7blgGr4MGh0oiQ,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,3,0,0,0,Let me start off my saying this place is really a hit and miss . I've been here literally 15+ times and every time is different . The sushi is the same which is my main reason for going back all the time . I love the sushi there and the cooks are always extremely friendly . The reason for the 3 star review is the service . They literally go through waiters like no other every time we go there is always a new waiter every time we go . Sometimes you'll get a good one and others they are horrible . We went last night and one of the waiters had no idea what she was doing and would she would go to pick up our empty plates she would put her fingers or hands in our food and leave it there expecting us to eat it . She literally put her hand in our miso soup almost spilled it all and left it there so we can finish it and was surprised when we asked her if she could take it back ? If you are a party of 5 or more they automatically charge you 18% gratuity which seems like more of a reason for the waiters not to give a crap of how they serve you because they get that tip either way . If they can fix their staff then I would not hesitate to give the 5 star review .,2018-07-21 19:34:00

I visited this restaurant with a friend for a late lunch today (Saturday) when the place was almost empty.  This restaurant has a casual vibe and is open 24 hours a day. I actually liked the decor- it has a natural look, with wood chairs and large wooden blinds in a cafeteria-like open space. I liked the fresh and clean look  - no old, dirty worn out rugs and dusty plastic plants like some restaurants have.  The servers were relaxed and friendly, and brought the food promptly.

Speed and convenience seem to be the words for this place. I liked the stacks of spoons and small bowls and the container of chopsticks on each table- no need to ask for anything. They bring a stack of paper napkins and you're pretty much good to go.  There are at least 5 different sauces available at the table, from sweet hoisin to killer-hot sriracha. 

Before my seafood pho arrived, the server placed on the table a large plate of bean sprouts topped with branches of thai basil leaves- I thought it looked pretty cool.  The pho bowl was HUGE- impossible to eat in one sitting!  I enjoyed it, (gotta say, those squid pieces I could have done without- but that's a personal problem).  We pulled leaves off the branches to put into the pho and happily slurped as much pho as we could eat before a personable server offered to pack up the rest for us to take home.  He agreed that the huge bowls of pho were too much for one sitting, but a great deal budget- wise. I paid $11 for an appetizer and the pho and have enough pho for one or two more meals. I should warn, however, that the noodles get soft and mushy in a few hours. Maybe you should take them out of the broth  if you aren't going to eat your leftovers for a few hours. Just an idea.

So, not a fancy place, but very inviting with decent food. I'd come back and I'd bring friends.",2012-04-08 07:16:24

Congbul ($14.99 per person, minimum 2 orders)
I believe it was $13.99 for the regular option with sliced pork, bean sprouts, rice cakes, and green onion, but if you added $1 more you can have squid added. So why not! The rice cakes were cut into small pieces, not the usual long length so I would think there weren't much in the mix. I do love the fact that it was loaded with bean sprouts though, lots of veggies! Flavors were ok, not too strong in my opinion. Order comes with a variety of side dishes, seaweed soup, and egg soufflé soup (which was really good btw!), and rice.

Seafood Pancake ($19.99)
This seemed to be a popular item that most people ordered so we decided to give it a try. Quite expensive, but it did have a lot of seafood ingredients - shrimp, squid, lots of onions. The ends were slightly crispy so that was nice, would have been better if the whole pancakes was crispy. I like how there was a lot of ingredients, the ingredients and batter ratio was well balanced.  Lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion. Normally it should come with some kind of soy sauce to dip in but this place they didn't serve any.

The food quality is excellent, and the presentation is fantastic. The dim sum doesn't come in the typical bamboo steamers, but on pre-heated plates. Nice touch, but personally, I prefer the traditional bamboo containers as I find the food comes piping hot and retains their heat better. 

I would say this place is very comparable in quality and price to Casa Victoria or Casa Imperial for dim sum. I would have to give a slight edge to Casa Victoria for the taste of the food, but Yu definitely wins when it comes to presentation. It's too bad that Yu's regular dim sum menu selection is pretty limited. They do have specialty dishes, but found that their price is quite steep ($20 for cold sweet and sour pork?), so skipped that. 

In terms of presentation, atmosphere, and overall dining experience, I think Yu has a lot to offer. Apparently today was only their 4th day since opening, but service was excellent and food was served promptly. Looking forward to trying out their dinner sometime.",2015-12-25 19:12:21

Tried their salmon poke matcha soba noodles and it was delicious and fresh. The ingredients tasted well together and the flavour was light but savoury. The salmon pieces were buttery soft and were fresh. The seasoning/sauce on the noodles was light and tangy. It almost felt like a salad. The portion of the dish was just enough for a lunch portion. My friend who got the cold matcha soba noodles also liked her dish, she liked the hint of matcha flavour in the soba noodle, but only wished they gave a bit more noodles. 

For dessert, I ordered the matcha ice cream and it was just as good. It had a strong matcha flavour but the ice cream was smooth and not grainy at all. The matcha was blended in well with the cream. The ice cream tasted nothing like the green tea ice cream you find at the supermarket. It had an authentic rich green colour and a bitterness to the ice cream which I enjoyed.

I have never been here during their restaurant hours, so I can't say anything about the food, however the night scene was very good until a bouncer went on a huge power trip!

The interior of the place is very classy the main floor is your classic restaurant/bar area with booths and bar stools. If you head upstairs there is a beautiful patio area, with couches, tables, bar, all surrounded by what looks to be a glass roof. Definitely a great spot during the winter with the closed roof top and I'm sure the summer is just amazing.

This place was a nice place to relax during the night and have fun, but I hate it when a bouncer goes on a huge power trip and starts to assume things that was never done by someone. First of all my family and friends are not young college kids, we all have professional jobs, and we all know our limits. Yes, we like to have a lot of fun but we never go overboard. This is the first time we have ever been kicked out of a place all b/c the bouncer heard someone banging on the glass by the dance floor. Of course the only ones on the dance floor were me, my family, friends, and the club photographer. I mention the club photographer b/c he admitted to the bouncer that it was him that was banging on the glass, but to no luck the bouncer was on a power trip and didn't want to admit he was wrong, so he threw us all out. He even followed us out to the street and told us to stay off the property, even though we were already on the sidewalk not even close to the building. 

Have you ever seen a dance floor empty so quickly? If you were there that night than you know what I mean. I felt bad for our DJ friends b/c they had to finish the gig, but luckily it will be the last time that they are spinning there. I'll let you know where the new venue is at.

Will I return? During the night hell f***ing no! During the day maybe, just b/c I'm a foodie and interested in trying their food, and not to mention that their patio during the summer would be amazing.

We checked in and after walking into our room found what appeared to be lipstick stains on the sheets. We asked them to please come up and change the sheets for us as soon as possible because we we needed to get ready for dinner. Apparently an hour later when they still weren't there was what they meant by ASAP. We decided to get ready while we waited at this point and when we were finished there was still nobody there even though when we called with a reminder they assured us they were ""on the way up."" 

Thinking that our issue was behind us, we went to sleep hoping to sleep in the next morning. However, the freight train starts at 5:30AM and it is LOUD. By loud I mean fog horn in your ear LOUD. We asked if they could switch our rooms while we were out since we couldn't sleep past 530AM. They said they would, totally unsurprised that we were woken at such an early hour.

We returned back for our new room, and entered it ready to finally relax. When we walked it the entire room smelled like the bottom of ocean. Sooooo fishy and gross. We asked if they could again, please move us to another room before we got settled. They said ""NO"". I was in shock. No? Why not? ""We are booked,"" they said. OK then put us in a suite. I don't care what they need to do to make this right but do it. Miraculously, a room opened up. Like the parting of the sea, it was a miracle! I begged them at least 3 times, whatever you do please don't use any scented sprays in the room as someone in our party had extremely severe asthma. They promised they wouldn't use any sprays. Great! We were happy.

We opened the door...before setting foot in the room a cloud of perfume and spray and everything else consumed us. I couldn't believe it. It was almost as if they tried to spite us!! 

I would like to add through this entire process we asked to speak to a manager and were never afforded the opportunity.

After opening the final door, we came down found a manager ourselves and let him know we would now be checking out. As I write this review, he promised he would find us a room that worked and we are waiting. I pray this room will be OK, but regardless our dinner reservation this evening has come and gone.

It would be nice if anyone at this hotel did anything prior to this to help as we asked nicely and explained ourselves reasonably. In the hopes that this final room works out, it was very stressful and this hotel did nothing to ease that stress or help us relax on our vacation! I do not recommend this hotel at ALL.

I ordered the chicken shawarma over hummus.   I always compare to what I consider the standard for Mediterranean food, which is the Jasmine Grill. The chicken was dry and hard to chew here.   The pita bread tasted like cardboard, so said my lunch companion.  And she was right.  At the Jasmine Grill, it is so piping warm and fresh that you just want to shovel it down your throat!   So, I was excited to have my friend try the Palestinian dessert, Knafeh. When I tried to order it, I was told that they didn't have the ingredients to make it. NOT GOOD!   Finally, there were a few other things that I noticed that made me wonder about this restaurant's potential to survive.   The menu said that tea refills were limited to just ONE.  Not good and I have never seen this before.   I was still thirsty and wanted more! There were no other lunch patrons dining in.  The Jasmine Grill is always full.  There were light fixtures burned out and the laminate flooring was in bad repair.   With all these things, there is no way this restaurant will survive.

I liked the place as soon as I walked in. It looks like a cute little restaurant decked out in Japanese stuff. It was a cute environment and fun to look at everything they had going on.

It's about $20 for lunch until 3:00p and then it goes up like $3 for dinner. It's a great price as most AYCE places are about $27 for dinner. Sakana also has all of the premium items you pay the extra couple of bucks for like uni, oysters, ect. It's definitely worth the price in my opinion.

I came for lunch with a couple of friends and their kitchen is FAST. I would place orders on things and get them within minutes. They have a really sweet team. I was nervous reading reviews but I got lucky. I ordered the pictured hand roll and it came to me in like under a minute. The appetizers from the kitchen came out hot and fast also. Empty plates were cleared quickly. Orders could be given to anyone and they did ask often. It went swimmingly. No complaints at all.

Their appetizer selection is big enough, but not huge. The items they do have are done well. I tried the age dashi tofu and the pork belly. 

The main item IMO aside from the fresh fish would have to be tempura shrimp. Why? That's my favorite item in a sushi roll. I really like their shrimp tempura so although I don't remember which rolls I got I did think they were all good. The fried items came out hot in the rolls while the cold items were cold. That's the most enjoyable types of rolls to me.

My one ""complaint"" is their rolls menu is so huge! Not a real complaint lol It's very intimidating or hard to figure out what to order. I suggest looking at Yelp photos or just reading. We did get recommendations from the server which made this a none issue.

Their nigiri that was served was also really good. They serve large slices of fish on their rice. This was a highlight for me. I was able to try different fish without getting full off of a huge rice to fish ratio.

The restaurant was clean, service was attentive, their food quality was good, and I can't wait to go back. Add the affordable price and Sakana now is up there on my AYCE  sushi list.

Pro tip! I heard a group next to us pay the dinner price to get their dinner specials. I wish I knew this was an option earlier on as I did want to try their oysters and uni along with their other dinner only items.",2015-10-27 01:37:44

It would have went a long way for them to acknowledge that they're short on people today and say sorry about the wait.  Not even a thank you after we placed our order.  Though this attitude seem to be par at some Chinese restaurants I've been to.  I don't expect this at an American restaurant.

After ordering, our food came out within 7-8 minutes, much quicker than expected considering how long it took to order.  We ordered 2 kids smash burgers with sweet potato fries (an extra $.50 upgrade--it only costs $.20 to upgrade from regular fries to sweet potato fries for the regular side, but costs $0.50 for a kids meal upgrade :(), an Oreo shake, an avocado club grilled chicken and a triple double.  We used a coupon for a free burger.  Even with the coupon the total was over $26.

The kids burgers were small, as expected.  It has been a 2-3 years since I've been to a Smashburger, but the triple double burger seemed small.  The only difference between my kids' burgers was another patty and lettuce tomatoes and pickles.  My main problem with the Triple Double was that it was soaking in grease.  When I lifted the burger from the paper, there was lots of grease on the paper.  When I put the burger down and looked at my fingers, it was covered in grease.  If I wanted to eat a grease burger, I would go to one of its competitors instead.  My wife said the avocado club grilled chicken was greasy, but not as bad.  My kids said that their burgers were fine and not greasy like my burger.

Like most of the others, we just left everything on our table, the wire trays, drink cups, napkins, etc. because the only trash can near the kitchen door we saw was completely filled with trash and trays.  There were no other trash cans that we saw.  We had to clean our tables ourselves so we could sit at a table.

Maybe we should have left like the people we saw leaving before and after ordering, but we didn't--this is what we get for staying.  If the 3 people working there weren't happy, then I don't expect that anyone there would be happy as well, including the customers.  I don't recall 1 smile from any of the workers the whole time we were there, in fact I don't think there were any smiles from customers either.  I hope this experience at this location is an exception.",2018-01-14 18:43:32

lut1IbjGOG5KSv7TVzFepw,U5YQX_vMl_xQy8EQDqlNQQ,T_FSk5WLFz-fTpig9-vdMA,3,3,1,1,"2.5*  As per Janey's review, Dolce 21 is location on the main level of Pac Mall, on the east side.  If you come in from the main entrance of the mall, walk to your right, towards the back of the mall.  Nathan Ave + 138th Street is the ""intersection"".

It's a family-run business, so I'm hesitant to give it less than 3*s.  Lady who was manning the cash was very sweet.

In summary, they have a soft-serve machine that has Green Tea, ""Tiffany Vanilla"" (whatever that means), & a mix of the 2 flavours.  And on top of that, there is a whole slew of options of crap you can put on top of whatever soft-serve flavour you select!  I'm sure that all the toppings are pre-packaged and not made in-house or anything like that, re:  honeycomb, red bean mochi, mixed, coloured popcorn, etc.

Since I didn't want anything too sweet, I tried the Green Tea soft-serve on its own and it was over $5!  (A bit steep in comparison to other places in the mall or Wooffles & Cream.)  The flavour of the soft-serve wasn't good.  It smelled somewhat fermented, a bit wine-like.  No trace of green tea at all.

Soft-serve with various toppings were ~$6-7.  If you ask me, it's a bit gimmicky, than quality/flavour.",2016-04-17 18:30:55

We went with a group of friends to celebrate the end of the academic year, and had a lot of fun.  Yes, it's loud. Yes, it's super crowded.  Yes, it's disproportionately expensive.  But where else will a band alternate playing traditional Bavarian music with Jimmy Buffet covers?  Where else will you stand on your seat with your friends while doing shots off of a shot-ski?  Where you will watch a bachelorette party and bachelor party challenge each other to a drinking contest?  And where else will give you an entire liter of beer in a German mug?

I will admit that, having appropriate expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  The giant pretzel is excellent.  My sauerbraten was delicious.  My husband liked the jagerschnitzel, and I heard good things from table-mates about the onion rings, pierogies and potato pancakes.  If you're a vegetarian or looking for something low-calorie... maybe get yourself a snack before you venture here.  Prices are high, but portions are huge, so this isn't where the rip-off is.  Their beer is quintessentially German, so don't go looking for anything exotically weird, but it tastes great, and is generally of low ABV as to allow you to drink liter-size units of it without being in any sort of dangerous.  Shots are a rip-off, but if you're going to spend the money for the experience of it, the German apple is tasty.

Other tidbits: reservations recommended.  Also, they have valet parking but it's expensive, and let's face it, unless you have a friend willing to DD, you should probably Uber here anyway (see above re: giant beers).

Not a great deal, and not the greatest of food, but if you're looking to have a fun night with a group of friends, it's a great place for it.",2017-06-10 22:03:17

The Diamond has plenty of good hamburger options, but like all true diners, that is not all they specialize in.

The scrambled eggs tasted somewhat artificial,  it was about the quality of fast food type eggs. The home fries were okay, again, nothing to write home about.  It also comes with turkey sausage, and Swedish pancakes with lingonberry sauce.  The sauce/jam was nice.  I wasn't sure how to eat the pancakes....with or without syrup?  or just the sauce?  They were a bit gummy and not that great. The food also could have been warmer. I noticed a small microwave in the area, so maybe you can avail yourself of that to get your food a little hotter. 

The best thing is the coffee refills if you get the Ikea family card which is a free card, so you need to get that for lots of refills.  You get regular or decaf coffee, as well as latte, capppucino, or tea.  The latte was very good, so you can't beat that refill deal! 

The interior setting of the restaurant which is on the second floor  is very pretty, with great views of the mountains.  Everything is very clean and orderly, and once you get the hang of how the restaurant flows, it's easy to figure it all out and enjoy a pleasant meal.  

In addition to breakfast, I also sampled a couple of their sweets - the Princess (it's the pink dessert).... was okay, although I wasn't over the top about it.  It's advertised as being coated in marzipan, but it didn't taste much like marzipan to me...just a sweet-ish coating.  Do you see a pattern here?  I wasn't thrilled with their food, but I give them the benefit of the doubt for keeping the price low and it is a nice area to eat, re-fuel and relax before or after shopping. 

In addition, I shopped at the marketplace on the first floor near the check out and exit area. It was a bit confusing because you have to go thru the check out area to get over to that marketplace area, so just walk thru the check out area and they are okay with that. 
Then if you buy something at the marketplace, you have to circle back to the check out area.
A little bit of a confusion in the flow in that area which maybe could be improved. .

 I  bought a bag of the meatballs (since i didn't have  a chance to sample them at the restaurant), a jar of lingonberry jam (4.99, a bit pricey), and some other items.  Total on the groceries was $22, and I didn't buy that much -  these specialty items are fun to try once, but probably I won't be a repeat buyer. (I found the lingonberry jam to be rather tart, not a fan of that unfortunately).  Maybe Swedish food just isn't my thing!  I also bought a can of the pear soda, which is very nice and enjoyable. 

Even though I found the food items to be somewhat hit or mess, it's still nice to have Ikea in town, and I'm sure ""locals"" will certainly enjoy being able to get a decent-ish breakfast for cheap and lots of coffee and tea refills.

 I came here because I was craving for some macaroons.  I was expecting many different flavors, but when I got there, their were only 3 different flavors available.  All Chocolate: Strawberry, Lavender, & Orange.  Bonus for checking in on yelp, you do get a free macaroon.  Another bonus is that the macaroon is only $1.25 each.  Now a days with the big macaroon raves, they are a bit expensive.  So that is pretty awesome.  

This seems to be a great place for catering, so at least I know for options of when I want to order ahead of time for a party, this place is not too far from home & work.

I saw that they had Tea, so I ordered a cup of tea too.  However, I did have to wait a little longer for it because they had to make it and I didn't mind.

7ZZpbKcpkJIf7-Szi26zYA,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,rMrymOj6RcBBddGuOjv_IQ,1,13,11,7,"Umm, no. This has got to be one of the worst arenas I have ever been to. Let me get all the negatives out of the way because for damn sure it outweighs the positives.

Have you ever wondered what it felt like to be a cow, goat, sheep, etc being in a herd? Well thats exactly what you feel like when you make your way to the lobby of the arena. Feeling like a sardine in a can is another way of putting it. The walkway going through the metal detectors and then having the ticket takers scan your tickets is a very slow and unorganized process. If you are claustrophobic, you will suffer. If you are not claustrophobic, then you just might be after an episode at this arena. This is also the point where you know who has not showered and does not  have deoderant on. The same goes for when you exit. You are one of many going in one direction like mindless zombies.

I have always heard about the great music artists and famous popular sporting events like boxing and MMA go down here so that alone should tell me that the arena itself should be top notch right? WRONG.

Since this was my very first event here and it just so happens to be the Billboard Music Awards I was very ecstatic of what I was about to witness. Taylor Swift won 4 awards and no, Kanye West didnt do or say anything stupid this time around although I wouldnt have been surprised if he did. He got booed when he was introduced. 

Oops, sorry for the little rant there. The very first thing that  horribly stood out was the audio quality or lack there of. You can barely hear what the hosts and award presenters were saying. A lot of times I had to ask my seatmates what was just said and vice versa. As for the singers, it varied but the main theme was that there was no consistency due to just bad sound quality all around. The only thing that might be construed as positive were the subwoofers. The bass was really good on just about every performance. But then again, the overall low decibel levels of the vocals practically cancels that out.

Where we sat was basically the nosebleeds towards the back of the arena. You can see the stage meaning the people on it looked like a flea circus. Of course I expect that sitting so far away but they tried to alleviate that by putting 1 big projection screen right above the stage and 1 to the right and left of it. Only problem was that some of it was being blocked by the lighting fixtures strewn about hanging down from the ceiling.

If you plan on getting any kind of concessions here, I recommend you eat before coming here because basically they legally rob you.

Which brings me to another disappointing observation. Anywhere you went inside the arena whether in your seat or going up and down the stairs the floor was consistently sticky. Probably from all the beer and sodas that people spill. I was thinking that they had people assigned specifically to clean the floors. Either they dont do that or people were spilling beverages left and right just before we got there. Here's the kicker though. There are railings you can hold on to assist you while moving up and down the stairs. These things were sticky too! After touching the railings I was afraid of getting a staph infection!

Another bummer is that the ventilation and cooling system was virtually non existent. I was pretty much sweating the whole time just sitting there and I was wearing cargo shorts and a plain t-shirt. From my recollection I know they usually blast the AC in these big arenas for obvious reasons but it doesn't seem to apply here.

Now for the couple positives from this experience. First one I noticed plenty of security guards and law enforcement all over the place so at least you know you will be safe. Not sure if they can protect you from staph infections though. Second one was that the bathrooms were pretty clean and kept up pretty well not to mention easily accessible. So from these two positives you can feel safe while taking a leak.

In closing, I am hoping that the new arena that is almost done being built across the street in between New York New York and Monte Carlo has taken the bad design of the Grand Garden Arena into careful consideration since it is the same company that is involved. The Grand Garden Arena should have a documentary titled, ""How to design and build a poorly constructed arena"". What I witnessed should have been an awesome experience based on the star studded line up but all the negatives pretty much ruined it for me. As a side note, I have been to the Mandalay Events Center, the Orleans Arena, the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, and the Thomas and Mack Center. Whatever negatives these places I have experienced are nothing compared to the Grand Garden Arena in terms of bad logistics.

I set up our reservations online and being a Saturday 8:45 was the earliest unless we wanted to eat with the early birds at 5pm.  I really like the convenience of scheduling reservations online.  When we arrived at the restaurant it wasn't overly busy.  There were a few open tables and a few open spots at the bar.  The Pens game was on, but the one TV I saw was too far away from the table to see.  That's ok, I was really looking forward to this place so concentrating on my meal seemed to trump my attention to the game...  

Well I knew already I wanted to try the wings, and they didn't disappoint.  I absolutely loved the cilantro sauce they were served with. It really heightened the wings to a more sophisticated flavor.  I wanted to ask for extra sauce but we actually ended up finishing them before our waitress returned.  Recommend the wings.  Now as far as the entrée went I really, really wanted to get the fish tacos.  I love a good fish taco and everyone talks highly of Kaya's so I was sure I couldn't go wrong.  However, my H talked me out of getting the tacos and trying something ""new.""  As he put it ""you know what fish tacos are like, try something else.""  So I did, and I can confidently say I was really, really disappointed to say the least.  I got the tropical Paella that had chicken, chorizo, mussels, scallops, shrimp, some pineapple flavor with peas and crushed red pepper.  Ugh I thought this would be delicious considering I am a seafood junkie and it just missed the mark completely.  The chicken and chorizo were totally overcooked and the rice resembled the flavor and texture of Rice A Roni, yes it was that bad and bland.  I found no scallops and there was no sauce to the dish to soak the mussels in meaning dry, dry, dry.  The only part of it that was tasty was the shrimp.  I am guessing they cook up the paella in advance for dinner then reheat it and add fresh shrimp?  Well that was how it tasted... So get this, my H who talked me out of ordering the fish tacos, ordered them for himself, a move I was not anticipating.  A few bites into my dinner and I just said to him, I really don't like this at all.  He offered to swap dinners with me so I had almost 2 whole tacos, and yes folks they were delicious, and way to take one for the team dear!  I knew I should have just went with my gut and got the tacos from the get go.  As for the rest of the Paella he did eat it but grudgingly and had the same opinions about it as I had, not good and definitely not worth $24.00.  

So cool place, good drinks, pleasant atmosphere, attentive servers, but I would never recommend the Paella.  The fish tacos, YES, the paella, NO...",2014-04-30 18:37:11

It's a great ride and quite accessible from Toronto along the waterfront bike path, then a short ride up through Mimico. We weren't sure what to expect inside - maybe just a bottle shop with some taps? - but it was a warm night and were happy to round the corner of the service road and see the huge patio with picnic tables and umbrellas out front.

We were thirsty from the ride and started out with one of our favourites - Octopus Wants to Fight. Then we tried one of GLB's special offerings that was not available at the LCBO, the ""No Chance With Miranda"" raspberry saison. This was delicious. We bought a couple of big bottles to take home. The bottle-shop pours are $5 (they're not full pints, probably 10-12 oz). The service is efficient and friendly and if you're not sure about a beer, you can have a little sample before ordering.

They close early - at 8:00 pm - and we were given short notice of this. There was no bathroom inside, but decent port-a-potties in the parking lot. Apparently there are bathrooms under renovation, so hopefully there will be something indoors in future.

I was sat by the manager and the table had ketchup and Tabasco at the end of it. (For those of you in the restaurant industry, this is a CLEAR marker this table hadn't been wiped down with a sanitized towel. For those of you not in the industry, this is a HUGE thing you need to know.) I told the manager that it looked like the table was dirty and the ketchup was a clear sign it needed to be wiped, and he said different establishments do different things and they always leave the ketchup and Tabasco there on the table. Well that's interesting, because as he said that a busser came up behind him with a sanitizer towel and wiped that table without me asking. (She had obviously just cleared the table and was about to wipe it to make it 100% clean.) She also TOOK THE KETCUP AND TABASCO, so the manager straight up lied about them supposed to be on the table. Then, it took 15 mins for orange juice and the table next to us sat down 10 minutes after us in a different section, and got their food 10 minutes before us. Our pancakes were not cooked all the way through, I saw BATTER & I walked out. My boyfriend tried to explain to the manager that the bussers didn't wipe under the syrup or by the salt which is where the most bacteria builds up, and the manager said I was irate since I walked in the door BECAUSE I ASKED FOR THE TABLE TO BE WIPED DOWN.

First off, i would probably give the burgers 2 stars. i personally don't enjoy the charburger. When i screw up at home or forget i have burgers on the grill, that's when i end up with a charburger. It's not something i would request. Their fries were alright. They did seem like a fresh cut fry variety although i would like some seasoning on them. Not a large menu beyond the burgers, but if i end up here again, i might try the wings or even their hot dog sounded good. Since the burger came with a drink, i opted out of getting a beer which disappointed me as well. 
We did get a chocolate milkshake and overall it didn't impress me. It tasted a lot like a Wendy's frosty (Not that it's bad, but it's cheaper at Wendy's).

The reasons they ended up with 3 stars: 
-great, friendly service
-outdoor seating
-surprising variety of drafts (1554, fat tire and a few others)
-$2 domestic on Saturday and Sunday (i think...check local listings)
-They have a coupon in the Entertainment book for BOGO entree, so it was reasonably priced for my visit",2010-09-07 18:32:46

GMKeBH1venot5eep18vW4g,_t3BJzyGaqr9mcDazYiYAQ,37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg,4,6,6,5,"BIRTHDAY REVIEW!!!!
We made this reservation 2 months in advance and still could not get a spot for Friday (my actual birthday). With a wait like this, one can only imagine the anticipation that was built up for last night's dinner.

Arrival was a bit awkward-- there was only one other table eating in this small restaurant when we arrived at 6:30 so it was a little uncomfortable to be seated directly next to them and have to squeeze in when all the other tables sat open for at least an hour. I felt like we were crashing their private dinner In fact, it didn't really fill up until about 8:30. This made it that much more awkward because there wasn't a lot of background noise to soak up our respective conversations.

We began with a glass of Cava and some warm bread. Then the gildas: Olives stuffed with anchovy and a soft cube of bread. I thought my boyfriend would hate this as he's not a huge anchovy fan, but to my surprise he gave it a big thumbs up! The perfect little mouthful with a glass of sparkling wine!

We were very pleased with how seasonal the menu was. The chef made wonderful use of local ingredients like fiddleheads, wild leeks and morels (always a birthday treat for me!) The seven course carte blanche was very heavy on the fish dishes and all were prepared exqusitely. The standout was the wild caught BC salmon with a pesto of mustard greens and wild leeks. The skin was cooked separately from the fish and presented as a crisp, shattering garnish. The fish was cooked to a soft medium rare with two fat, foraged morels. This dish was honestly a piece of art-- like a painting of a stream with all the fresh ingredients playing a colourful role.

The sweetbreads that were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The lamb was slow roasted and very tender and while the accompanying porcini sauce was tasty, this dish was not our favourite. I kept thinking that something was missing- maybe a little fruit or acidity to balance the earthiness of the mushroom?

Dessert was a mishmash of contrasting textures. I don't remember what the server called it, but it was a pistacho cream with little shards of meringue on top of some orange jelly. I did enjoy the flavours, and the subtle crunch between soft cream and mild jelly-- but I couldn't help but feel that the dish itself had been created from a string of leftovers in the kitchen. A little uninspired, or maybe just not my thing.

In the end, we agreed that the dinner was fabulous and the salmon was one of the most exquisite dishes we've tried. We'd probably go back and try a Sunday Lunch with a bit more emphasis on meat and maybe some foie gras, which was curiously absent from the carte blanche menu.

A memorable experience and fabulous seasonal ingredients highlighting a carefully crafted meal. Why not 5 stars? The seating situation was just awkward, although it felt more comfortable as the restaurant filled up. While the service was mostly great, it was clear that one of the servers was bullshitting her way through the ingredients used in the dishes. She tried, but I'm not sure I believe that there is such a thing as ""wild sauce"". I think there was a noun missing. 

Worth the wait.",2013-05-17 09:36:55

After we went to a lovely afternoon fashion show the 6 of us decided we needed some food to dilute all the alcohol we consumed.  I drive by this place on my way home from work every day so I suggested it. 

Only one other table was occupied when we arrived, which was probably a good thing since we were a little loud.  Gary and I both had pizza, he a potato and gorgonzola (which I did not try because I think gorgonzola is terrible).  He loved it and ate every last bite. 

I had the margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella, basil and added prosciutto.  Their tomato sauce was sweet and smooth and just wonderful!  The pizza crust was charred just the right amount and had those pockets of air dough that I love tearing apart (or sticking my finger into).

Gary had a vodka martini and he said it was smooth and potent, a winning combination.

They also expanded their food menu with variety of noodles, rice, pancakes, etc. Their bubble tea never lets me down, it's also a good place to grab take out bubble tea. 

They give free popcorn for each table. It's perfect when you just want a little snack while waiting for your food to arrive. They also have a huge wall of magazines for you to read.

Service: much improved. The staff is much more comfortable in their rhythm. Still super friendly and chatty (the good kind, not the annoying kind).

Oysters: the selection has gotten much wider and they are very tasty. Also, they have some very reach happy hour hours during the week, where oysters that usually go for $19.50 a half dozen, for $1 or $2 each during HH. I don't remember when, but it's on some weekdays at least from 4-6pm (including Friday). They are damn good. 

Also, their HH includes $2 off drinks. I love having bubbles with oysters and they have a pretty good selection.

They currently have a salmon salad (it's raw, FYI). It is a TON of fish per order despite how small it looks in the cup, so I would get one to share-- yes, share.

The only thing is I find the sauces they come don't really enhance the taste, so I just ask for lemon instead.

First of all, the prices are fantastic! $10 and $11 for a glass of wine (and none of that gosh awful generic cheap stuff you find at many ethnic places (e.g. Jackson Triggs, Coppermoon, Barefoot, Apothic, Oyster Bay).

The food is delish. Risotto balls, seafood pasta and duck confit with gnocchi were all excellent. The seafood in the pasta was fresh and the light broth sauce accented the shellfish. The two broths served with the duck confit and gnocchi were complex, intense and so insanely delicious, we drank every drop.

We left completely stuffed. The bill was about the same we would pay Craft or National.

With their giant Italian inspired menu, I figured there would be something for everyone. 

I had spoken to them on the phone a few times prior to our reservation, to make changes and additions to the group. When they called an hour before our reservation to confirm, I was quite impressed - considering of all the changes, it was great to receive the call to make sure everything was set up.

HOWEVER - when the 9 of us arrived an hour later, there was no table. The server let us know that previous groups had not moved as quickly, and even though there was another large group's empty table (they were late), she wouldn't seat us. 

Quite annoyed, she asked us to wait for 10 minutes until the table became free. We waited (luckily our boss hadn't arrived yet), but the table was still not ready. She suggested we sit at Valens, which is owned by the same person - we agreed, and when she brought us over there, there were still no seats!! She suggested seating us at two tables for four at the opposite end of the restaurant - obviously having forgotten we were 9, and not 8.

The room was stylish and modern, fully equipped and quiet. We had a decent view, a king size bed. Check in was easy, and the front desk clerk we spoke with was polite and courteous. We also used valet and had no issues. 

Excellent Location, comfortable sleep, fitness room, good price, nice pool.

Your initial thoughts may be why are they so poorly lit and on second thoughts, you may even wonder if they are open. They have limited parking, so on busy days/peak hours you might want to get there early.  Its surprising they got more tables than the parking lot.

The person at the reception was all dressed up making us look under-dressed for the occasion. We came here without a reservation and it seemed like you would need to reserve before you come here. But anyway we got a table without much wait. That too for a group of five. The menu was a quick one page which was satisfying to read through. 
We got ourselves some different curries and the waiting took quite some time. The service was alright and mediocre. The food came in fresh and hot. Even though the food had all flavors, it didn't deliver the punch we crave for from an Indian food. Not to be a fault finder, but the food quantity was moderate for an Indian restaurant. If you don't agree, check out their 4$ naan!

Summing up, the entrees on the menu looked very innovative and inspired from different regions of India. The menu was on the pricier side where a dinner for two might cost you 50$ or more. Definitely in the $$$ range. My pet peeve will always be with the restaurant's lighting. Extremely dimly lit interiors and well dressed receptionist gave me chills and reminded me of a cult house from horror movies.

I used to pass a Joe's all the time on my way to I-95 in central New Jersey.  It never beckoned to me then, and that didn't change when I saw the one on Rainbow here in Vegas.

But when we were invited to dinner here, I figured, why not give it a try?  So I'll tell you why not.

First, a disclaimer:  I did not have the crab.  It could very well be that what has kept them in business lo these many years is that they offer fabulous crab.  And that's why I've given them two stars, just in case that's the case.  It wouldn't be fair to ding them on their eponymous coup de table (I made up that French term, but it may really exist) without trying it.  I like crab cakes, if they're not mostly breadcrumbs, but that's where my love affair with the crustacean ends.  Besides, it's not polite to order the most expensive items on the menu when someone else is footing the bill.  Unless that someone else is a billionaire. 

Second, the ambiance:  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Old, with peeling paint.  You get the drift.  I would be supremely embarrassed to invite anyone to dinner here.

So I ordered chicken, of the herb and lemon variety.  I also broke my own ""no fried, no salt"" New Year's Resolution that I didn't make and got deep fried pickles as one of the sides.  But a twinge of conscience had me go with steamed broccoli as the other side.  My husband, the copycat and chicken-all-day-every-day guy, also ordered the same chicken, except with sweet potato fries, well-done, please, and corn on the cob.

The chicken:  Yes, Virginia, there was some chicken with the salt.  So. Much. Salt. Nothing but salt.  Herb, who is never sensitive to that condiment, was gagging, but ate it anyway.  I gave up after half of it.  

The sweet potato fries:  Decent taste, but soggy.

The broccoli:  What broccoli?  The waitress returned to tell me that they had no broccoli, but were putting up a corn for me.  What if I didn't want corn?  I decided to go for it, and the unadulterated, UNSALTED, corn was just as corn on a cob should be.  What else can you say about plain corn except that it was cooked?

The service:  No real complaints, except that we did wait a long time at the beginning.  

I never like to say ""never,"" but I can state unequivocally this time that, to paraphrase the immortal words of the second Mrs. de Winter in Hitchcock's Rebecca, ""I shall never return to Joe's Crab Shack.""",2017-01-08 09:08:32

By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!

I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!

The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.

We decided to try a flight of four at first.  We got the Queen City Common (a traditional semi-dry), Hoppin' Good Thyme (a dry hopped herbal cider), Cherry Bobbin' Trolls (a tart cherry cider), and a dry ginger cider (I can't remember the name, and it may have been a guest tap).  The Queen City Common was good but just a little sweet for my taste.  The ginger cider was good as well, with a wonderful bite from the ginger.  However, the other two were absolutely AMAZING.  The Cherry Bobbin' Trolls had a delightful cherry flavor and was a great balance of sweet and tart.  The Hoppin' Good Thyme was probably the most interesting cider I have ever drank, with a nice taste of floral hops and the herbiness from the thyme (and maybe coridander?), which blended really well with the apple taste.  We ended up ordering a full glass of these last two because they were so good.  Next time I come I want to try the others and probably some of their guest taps (they had a Windy Hill and some other imported ciders on tap as well).  If cider is not your thing, never fear - they have beer on tap from some of the other local breweries and some guest wines as well.

They have a terrific space and a decent amount of parking as well.  The have a large bar and several tables inside.  They only have a few tables outside, and unfortunately not really anywhere else to set your beers down.  If you come on the weekend, they apparently have a food truck outside as well.  This place is also very dog-friendly and there were a lot of them there when we came.  Customer service was quick and friendly here as well, and the prices were reasonable for flights and drinks for the quality.

Oh yes, I will definitely be back next time in I'm in Charlotte.",2016-04-17 14:17:14

Everyone ordered either the french toast or ricotta cakes and there were many empty plates by the end of the meal. The portion size was good - filling but not too much. For the price, it's on par with other upscale brunch places in the area. The service was pretty good - although it took a while to get cream for the coffee, and I had to ask for it versus it being offered. Don't miss the remote controlled bidet - it's pretty fancy (see pics). Just a note, when I called to make a reservation the hostess was rude.

It's a pretty neat little place!  It is very cozy indoors and offers seating at the bar, tall tables, and short tables.  

The staff were friendly.  When I was unable to decide what kind of beer I was in the mood for, our server offered me a few samples to help me make up my mind.  I ended up ordering the Dairy Air because it was on the lighter side and that's what i was feeling, but I would like to enjoy a whole glass of their Plaid Panther sometime.  It was very good.  It just had a bit more bite than I was looking for in the moment.  For all you IPA lovers, they seemed to have an abundance of IPA options, most of which were citra hop or a bit citrusy.  So, if you're into that, you won't be disappointed.

A very unique feature that I loved was the chalkboard they had available where you could purchase a beer for someone even if they weren't there.  Their name is written on a board and they can claim it anytime they'd like.  It makes it fun because you can either tell your friend to stop in, hint at your friend to stop in, or just make it a nice surprise if they ever happen to stop in and see their name on the board.  

They offer trivia on Tuesdays, as well as a couple of TVs, which are placed in a manner that just about anyone in the place can see them.

We have been here in the past and left 5 star review. This time food was not nearly as good. There were 6 of us and 4 didn't speak English so to make it easier my wife just ordered the 5 course and added truffles caviar and focus gras for everyone. 

I kind of felt like we got what they wanted to get rid of and not what was best. Was very disappointed that fois gras was terrine that was just thinly rolled to look pretty and not actually fois gras. The dish with cod had an unbelievably salty sauce that went with it. The dish that came with steak was extremely tough. 

The ravioli were the highlight for sure. They were exceptional. Bread is no longer rolled out between each course and continually updated on variety. Instead you get a bread bowl with a variety for everyone to grab from and a one time visit to view cart while they describe what is there. 

I would agree with another review about sommelier. It took a long time to get our wine and we only got 1 bottle due to this. Probably would have had 3 easily if a little more on top of it. They were quick to fill water though. Who knows? Maybe better margins.

My last visit was no different. We sat upstairs on the patio (first time) and I was amazed by how big and open it was. Not only is there an abundance of extra seating, but a second bar! Very convenient! 

What I love about Local is there ever-changing menu and ability to incorporate local fresh food. Definitely a huge plus! I ordered the Three Rivers Burger and OMG... was it good! A delicious burger sandwich between a pretzel loaded with cheese, peppers and more! If you're into spicy foods, this is for you! What more can you ask for?! All sandwiches are served with a side of homemade chips but you can substitute for fries for a few extra bucks. Even though it sucks paying extra, it's well worth it! They even have sweet potato fries! 

For drinks, all Absolute products were on special for $4 during our visit on Friday night so I ordered a vodka/sprite. Tasty! My boyfriend, however, got an AMAZING Cucumber Melon Smash cocktail (Muddled cucumber and lemon, Effen Cucumber Vodka, melon liquor and honey syrup with a splash of lemonade garnished with a cucumber and lemon). It was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. So refreshing and light, yet enough to get you feeling good!

The curries are indeed on the last page of their menu, hidden away a little bit. The rest of the menu is an odd mixture of ""Southwestern"" offerings (burritos, quesadillas, etc), Cajun food (gumbo, pulled pork), and pan-Asian food (stir-fry, teriyaki). I can't vouch for any of those other cuisines, since we all got curries, but let me tell you, the curry is where it's at. 

We all asked for our curries hot, and that was a pretty manageable level of spiciness (maybe not if you are a native Midwesterner). Among the four of us, we had the dhal curry, mixed vegetable curry (one of that night's specials), and the eggplant dish (do not remember what it was called, one was a curry and one was fried eggplants). The eggplant dish was a bit on the salty side, but the dhal (lentil) curry was really tasty. You can get brown or white rice on the side. One of the things I found odd about KJ's was the pricing for their curries. The chicken and potato curry was $14, and the potato curry was about $12. A little pricey, compared to the green bean curry ($8) and dhal curry ($7). 

Aside from that, the curries are definitely worth checking out, and they have a different special every weekend. Go get you some spice.",2014-01-26 14:36:15

The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!  

I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.

He was funny and cracked jokes with us while cooking.  I know it must be a hard job to have to stand there and entertain people and cook and sweat so we definitely were appreciative for him. 

The husband and I both ordered the ""Splash & Meadow"" - which was jumbo shrimp and steak.  Our son had the ""child's"" version of it. Even though hubby's dinner was ""paid"" for, we still ended up with a $74.00 bill.

When we asked if us ""regulars"" could get ice cream, they said we had to pay extra for it when it CLEARLY states on the menu that it comes with our dinner!  Total crap.

Also, the ""onion"" soup was completely tasteless.  It was just broth with some mushrooms and dried onions tossed in.  I do say that the shrimp and steak was pretty good and even better when dipped in their mustard sauce.

Service was 5+/5. From the moment we walked in we were warmly greeted. Our waitress and waiter we so tentative and polite. 

The restaurant atmosphere was 3/5. The place is small and our tables were too close to each other. The neighbouring table would comment on every dish we ordered. We could hear there conversation and I'm pretty sure they could hear us. 

The food was a good portion. We started with a spicy tuna tartar it was fresh but could have been a bit colder since it was raw seafood. The second course was a wagyu beef skewer with campanelle with meat sauce. The beef skewers were so tender and perfectly seasoned but the pasta was a bit too sweet. Finally finished with a refreshing pink grapefruit gelee with yogurt sorbet with berries. What a great way to finish the meal. Overall the food was a 3.5 /5.

Mongolian beef was good, but I'm a harsh critic on this dish, because the chinese restaurant in our old neighborhood had the best one I've ever had.
I haven't dined in yet, so I can't give a rating on that, but I will try it out one of these days. In the meantime, I absolutely will be ordering delivery again in the near future.

ul3ZxEr5HGmxyxhwnD6cig,GPQ9-bYKnbqOVEfR4zQfcg,GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,4,1,1,2,"I went here for dinner last night with one of my best friends, on the suggestion of another friend. Best friend (J) and I love Korean food, and almost went to Ha Ahn, our usual favorite food joint. Neither of us had been to Miega, so we opted for something new. Initially, we went to Korea House thinking it might be the place we were looking for. Miega is basically across the street, housed in a warehouse type building that also has dance classes, martial arts, and an Asian market. The parking lot was kind of dim, and it took us a minute to find the sign so we knew we were in the right place (that might be our faults - we can both be a little ditzy!)

So one thing that is confusing is that some signs say ""Miga"" and others ""Miega"" (I went with Miega because how could Yelp be wrong?). They have Korean barbecue, but we didn't partake (partially because they didn't ask and we were sat at a table that doesn't accommodate it). We arrived 3 hours before close, so I'm not sure what that was about. I ended up going with Dduk Man Du Kuk (a broth based soup that had dumplings and Korean rice cakes, served with white rice). I usually opt for Bi Bim Bop, but wanted to try something new. J went for Bul Go Gi (which came out sizzling on a cow shaped platter! Sorry for the lack of pictures, we were STARVING). 

As usual at Korean restaurants, you get the little appetizers. I liked that our server asked if we needed any more (more of the kim chi! also, i think we had butternut squash which I devoured). I was a little bummed that my soup came out, then a few minutes later the appetizers, but J had to wait a little more for his food. It seemed worth it, and he enjoyed it. We both agreed that Ha Ahn is better (although has less seating). I like that there are some glass walls so you can look out in to the mall area (I got to watch people practicing martial arts). There was a dance class going on further down, and the music was loud, but not annoying to us (also, high five to the salsa dancers! You all rocked and we loved watching you). 

I didn't finish my soup (I was full), but the server didn't ask if I wanted it to go or if I was done. She just whisked it away. There wasn't a ton left, but I would have taken it for lunch today! Since I checked in on Yelp, I ended up with a coupon for 15% off, which they easily took off. So, overall, the food was good but not great. The ambiance was a little bland, but we weren't there on a romantic date night (we both left our partners at home!). Our food didn't take long to come out at all, and if you don't dig Korean, there is a limited Chinese food portion of the menu.",2016-10-21 14:59:48

This place is literally a hole in the wall type-of-joint.  Small kitchen as you enter, with small tables as you pass on by towards the back.  Maximum capacity for 10 tables, you know you've stumbled onto a small family resto.  La Rosa Chilena is a cute, quaint, and clean environment.  The service was exceptional, however the food... was questionable.
Their Empanadas: 1.5/5 the portion was huge, however not enough meat, and content in the empanada.  Not to mention, their spicy salsa sauce was very salty, which somewhat helped to heighten the flavors of the bland empanadas.

Cazuela: typical Chilean bowl 1/5 soup, rice veggie, meat all in one served in a large soup bowl, with coriander, and herbs.  the Stock was exceptional, however they use a lot of oil in their cooking. The overall presentation was not up to par, however KEEP in mind this isn't a fancy place...

I don't really care for the other Miller's Ale House, but as usual, I was here for a birthday dinner. They were really busy, however, they have a very convenient system of texting you when your table is available. I received an initial text telling me the wait time (25 minutes) and a hyperlink with more information. We ended up getting a table within 12 minutes and a prompt text alerting us of it.

Our server was nice and very attentive (he checked on us at least three times throughout the meal), however, our food didn't reflect our orders exactly. Small errors though like Ruben's burger coming back medium rather than medium rare and the wrong sauce on our chicken; so it was nothing too upsetting.

Ruben and I shared an order of their Zingers ($9.99). The intention was to have the chicken strips tossed in medium AND BBQ sauces, but it came out with just medium sauce. Actually, it was swimming in a bowl of sauce. It made everything soggy and the batter was falling off when we tried to fish it out. It was so weird and kinda gross. It was also not nearly as good as I remember it, which is sad because this was the only thing I enjoyed at Miller's. Also, their ranch isn't very tasty.

I had the Blackened Chicken Key Lime Salad and Ruben had the British Burger with Fries. The salad was all right. Nothing spectacular in appearance or taste. The dressing was bland; I couldn't taste the key lime at all. The tortilla strips were just broken up pieces of tortilla chips, which was awkward when some of the pieces were larger than half dollar coins. Ruben seemed to enjoy his burger for the most part (besides the burger temperature issue). Oh, and their fries are flavorless.

I really don't care for their food or the restaurant in general and wish people would stop choosing their restaurants for gatherings. In any case, I'll end with some positives: there are many televisions with several different games and sports, so it's a great spot to catch a game with your friends; the prices are cheap; and the kids' activity book is very detailed.",2014-11-03 16:58:57

It was not very crowded inside, but the patio was full. We ended up sitting at a high top table, which was fine. It took them awhile to tell us whether or not they had outside seating available. So that was weird. 

I ordered the potato Mona styles eggs. The eggs came with a small piece of toasted bread and a tiny salad. The salad dressing was delicious (balsamic) and the lettuce and tomatoes were incredibly fresh. I would have been ok sacrificing some eggs for more salad. The eggs were also really interesting and tasty. There was a little bit too much cheese on the eggs but I still thought it was yummy. I loved the bread and wish it had been larger!

The experience was overall not pleasant, though. They seemed short staffed. The guy at the front seemed incredibly stressed and frazzled. I think there was a family there that really frazzled the staff. They kept going behind the counter and preparing their own drinks! It was really weird. So I understand that the annoying family was not the staff's fault, but their annoyance was translating onto other customers like us. The guy was clearly not handling it well and it showed. Again, this was really not their fault because that family was so obnoxious!

I would maybe go again if I had a patio seat. I feel like all that frenzied activity would have been shielded from us had we been outside. So, while the food was excellent, the service was very uncomfortable.

I would say it was just a bad day! So that's why I'll still give four stars. I docked a star for the staff experience.",2013-09-22 18:47:01

The restaurant is obviously gorgeous. The first time I sat on the top floor once which was nice and was quieter, and felt more intimate. You get a nice view and great lighting in the late afternoon/early evening. I like sitting in the main dining room more though, just because you feel like you're more in the center of things, plus then you really get to appreciate the high ceilings and cool mood lighting. 

I don't want to go into too much detail about those menus now because they're not even relevant anymore, but I will say that I've been impressed by almost every single thing I've tried at this restaurant, and even the things that were less exciting were still good. I think they do try to offer some interesting items on their Summerlicious/Winterlicious menus every year, so it's definitely a place worth trying and I think it's worth it for the $28 lunch/$45 dinner. In particular, their matcha chicken and waffles and key lime gelatin stood out for me during Summerlicious 2015, while their vegetarian offerings actually stole the show during Winterlicious 2016 - both the baked potato & raclette soup and mushroom & potato bake were superb. And you can never go wrong with their steaks.

Also worth mentioning is their absolutely DELICIOUS jalapeno cornbread which I could just eat all day... my table had to get a refill of this because it was just so good.

You'd expect service at an establishment like this to be top notch and for the most part it is. The waiters are attentive and try to be accommodating. When there was another party coming who had our table reserved, the staff were able to relocate us to a lovely window seat by the bar so we could continue enjoying our cocktails. It can be a bit hit or miss though, I recall our waiter for Summerlicious last year seemed a bit snooty and probably could have been friendlier.",2016-04-19 04:16:35

I don't even own a TV (which Is why I have so many Yelp reviews). So today in Best Buy, I was a sitting duck. Anybody's game for an easy sell on a Roku 3.

I had no idea what a Roku 3 was. My boyfriend mentioned that he wanted one for his birthday so I made a note on my phone and did a brief internet search from which I deduced that It was electronic in nature..

I walked to the middle of the store and waited there for someone to sense my desperation and come to my aid. I mean-- I didn't even know what department to go to. 

Nobody came.

I began to wander, looking for someone in a blue shirt to help me. There was no one. So I went to the Geek Squad counter. Geeks know stuff, right? I sat in front  of the man at the counter underneath a sign that said ""Need Help?""

ME: I need help
GEEK: OK, with Geek Squad Stuff or Best Buy stuff?
ME: I don't know, the sign said ""Need Help?"". I need help, so I came here. Can you help me.

ME: Uh. It's for my boyfriend. It's a gift. He said Roku 3. Is this it?
OTHER GUY (suddenly realizing that he could make a huge sale off me because I have no fucking clue and may purchase non essential accessories) Oh, well, If he wants to hook it up right away, you should get him these cables.
ME: He has cables
OTHER GUY: But these cables for sure fit the Roku 3.
ME: I bet he has the cables at home.
OTHER GUY: Maybe not. Don't you want him to be able to use it right away?

OTHER GUY: (vaguely confused and mildly irritated with my stubbornness and lack of inclination to buy cables) Um. Ok... well if you buy them and they're not the right ones, he can always bring them back.
ME: I'm aware of that. Just the Roku 3, please.
OHER GUY: (ringing through the purchase) There's also a 3 year protection plan that covers...
ME: Are you kidding? in 3 months, he's going to buy something different for the damn TV, I'm not buying a 3 year protection plan!
OTHER GUY: (unamused) That will be $135.64, please.

So in essence, Best Buy is just the same as any other big box electronic store out there. Lack of good service and pressure to buy upgrades. If the service had been better and friendlier from the getgo, I might have browsed more and been easily talked into buying something else electronic from any of the friendly salespeople. Especially since I have no idea about what a man would want from an electronics store. If I had found a sales person I trusted (She-yeah, in BEST BUY??) I might have gone on a limb, but instead, I bought exactly what I was told and left.",2013-11-26 07:36:27

The crowd is a mature crowd. The menu was very limited, not a bit selection. We decided to share the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster roll. For me, I feel like the food could be much better especially for the price paid. The mac and cheese did not have much lobster in it. (not that I expected there to be giant chunks but a good lobster flavour that could be tasted in the mac was what I was hoping for). The lobster roll was small and not mind blowing (I don't like cold foods+it reminded me of other lobster rolls I've had). I wish it came with fries then chips. 

Overall, sharing the meal it was not very filling. I did however like the service and the fact that we had the option for the bill to be split in the middle. I find a lot of restaurants don't offer this and this causes some awkwardness in sharing foods/paying the bill.

I've known about this dessert place since it had opened but never really had the incentive to go try it. However, I gave it a try this past weekend with a girlfriend of mine after dinner. 

The interior of the shop was quite cute with bright white walls and small trinkets everywhere as decorations. There aren't too many tables though so I wouldn't recommend going with a large group.

Most of the menu items are baked and made to order so the wait for the food is about 30-50 mins. We didn't mind this since we were looking for a place to sit and catch up for a while anyways. There are rotations for ice cream flavours etc since they make it all in store and don't like keeping it long.

This place is a gem when you can't find anything remotely close to getting something like this. If you are from the LA area, this place reminds me of Half and Half, in terms of design and feel, but the drinks IMO are way better than Half and Half. The menu is relatively small in comparison to menus you find in the LA area. The drinks though are great. I got the lychee peachy green tea with boba. It had the tea flavor I love with hints of the lychee and peach. If you don't like your drink, just tell the drink maker and they can adjust it for you. I have not needed to use that since I've felt the drinks have been pretty on point. There are a handful of tables here and even though you can study here, I feel the place is a bit cramped to effectively study (unless you are looking for that distracted ""studying"") It's a better place to meet up friends for an after meal snack.  In terms of snacks, they have crepes.  Watch out Paris Hotel Le Creperie, I think BTB might be on your tail.

It is a bit out of the way from the strip and if you are like most, you will probably end up at the places near Chinatown since it is more convenient but if you are wiling to drive about 10 minutes (maybe on your way back to LA since it's off the 215), it is well worth the drive.

Needless to say, I was pretty excited when they announced plans to open up here in Vegas. And while this location might not have the infamous rude service, they do have a pretty solid Chicago dog!

Adding to the trend of transplants coming to Red Rock Casino, The Wiener's Circle can be found right next to the sports book in the old spot where Pink's once was. The restaurant has a decent amount of seating for it's size and is styled almost like a modernized 50's diner. Apart from a lonely fly wandering around, the place was pretty much spotless and thankfully doesn't have a second-hand smoke smell. It is a pay at the counter setup, but they do bring your food out and the two employees we encountered were friendly and helpful.

When it comes to the menu, the main stars are of course dogs and burgers. There's several variations of the dogs, including their char dogs and boiled Vienna Reds. Each dog comes topped like a classic Chicago dog and can even bad had as a double, which is 2 dogs on 1 bun. For those who don't like it at all, they have no problem customizing one to your liking though. There are a few breakfast items on the menu as well, including a breakfast sandwich made with 2 Krispy Kreme doughnuts, which are also served at The Wiener's Circle.

I opted for the double cheddar dog and while it wasn't the best hot dog I've ever had, it was still pretty good. The dog is charred on their specialized grill and since they are somewhat small, I'm glad that I got a double. It had a good snap to it and was surprisingly juicy. I love a good Chicago dog and ordered mine just as it came, but both the toppings and bun fell a bit short. The bun was just way too soggy and neither the tomato or pepper seemed fresh, as they were both pretty mushy. I'd definitely order without the cheese next time though as I think that just added to the sogginess. My meal also came with fries which have a coarse salt on them, but they were really greasy and just okay.

Since they are in a casino, I don't want to complain too much about the price...but it is a tad on the high side for what you get. A double dog is $7-8 and as I mentioned, they are somewhat small. We ended up spending just over $20 for two meals, but if you have a lighter appetite, they offer a couple decently priced value meals. I do think they are a welcome addition to the Red Rock and would definitely return if in the area.",2014-08-04 00:57:01

We came at 4:45 and I sent my son to get our food, they took my son's pay but did not give him a receipt and told him we had to wait another 10 mins. after the 10 mins, it yet was still not ready, I was furious, I finally went inside to see what was the hold up, and they said that they didn't want to serve raw pork. like are you serious?, Who does that! I finally got everything by 5:05. If I knew it would take more than 30 mins to cook my dry pork chop, I would've chose another place to eat.

Bartenders were attentive and we didn't have to wait very long for food. We also got the Obon Ramen which is on happy hour. Broth was a bit on the salty side, noodles didn't taste like instant and the pork belly was tender.

Expecting to be a little more blown away than I was. The atmosphere is nice nouveau night time feel yet comfortable minus the huge bar stealing all the seating from drooling patrons. 

Down to business the burgers: high quality beef which I appreciated nice bread, but overlooked outside of my burger was completely blackened which took away from other tastes for example I could not taste the cheese. The point in having fun non traditional burgers is flavor but you lose some of that if you cook it too fast. At the risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie jerk I preferred my own smoked salmon wasabi burger, and made them for the same price. 

On the bright side I love the beer selection excellent range and FIN DU LA MONDE!!!! Belgian lovers I urged you to check that one out! But other options await you too from stouts to lighter beers. 

Last note the do not take reservations.... This just sucks it does. The average wait is an hour Friday nights but it could take longer. They expect you love walking around a strip mall to wait.... I don't love strip malls. They offer no indoor seating area for you to wait in and waiting in the cramped entrance area is Just awkward sauce.  Your other option is to dive into the bar and grab the first empty bar stool. Yea no thanks not for a party of three. If they changed this way of doing things I would eat here again I am curious to try a better reviewed location and see what I think. 

You can make a custom burger toppings add $$$ quick and pray tell why do they not you know of this while you're spending an hour plus waiting? I could have been creating my meal vs browsing for slippers :(

Scheduled for an 11:30am arrival and actually besting that number by a few minutes by way of EZCater, a plethora of Styrofoam and plastic clamshells brought up to the third floor in one trip using a push-cart and thick cardboard boxes, it was from containers containing Beef, Chicken or Vegetable Wraps plus Fries and Desserts that attendees took their pick, seasoned Spuds unfortunately suffering some sogginess thanks to the warm temperature inside the packaging but nicely flavored just the same.

With that being said we got there at about 9:55 PM last night because I was at a speaking event and wanted some dinner. So we walked in and were told that the kitchen closes in a minute if you want to that they weren't sure if they were able to serve us so I initially got irritated but then the manager said out not a problem will be more than happy to serve you. Then we sat down and we ordered for it quickly out of respect for the kitchen because we didn't want to keep them there any longer than they had to be. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and my girlfriend ordered for tacos. My chicken sandwich was very good it came out nice and juicy I know what you see is a funny word but it did. The boar was a little too gamy for my girlfriend but that has no reflection on this restaurant or the food itself it's just the animal being a bore.
What was really nice however unnecessary was that when I happen to tell my waiter he went to the manager and only charge half price for that. Again completely unnecessary but also very nice. 
The lighting in there was good all of the TVs were nice it was an all-around chill place to go and I'm glad that we went there. It would've been nice if you would've been able to order dessert however again the kitchen was closed so will just have to go there a little earlier next time. I'm giving this five-star review because it meets all of my criteria.

I love a theater that serves booze. However, I don't like the fact that they don't have any sort of matinee pricing (I don't go to night time movies very often, but I think the $14 tickets here are even a little more that most theaters charge for evening shows).

I live halfway between this theater & Tempe Marketplace and like to support Harkins, but the the AMC Esplanade (which is kind of comparable to Camelview) does have matinee pricing and serves booze (that I can have directly delivered to my seat, no less). In the future when I want ""that"" kind of movie experience that's probably where I'll be going. 

To be honest, the only thing I really like ""better"" about this theater compared to others is the seating. It's the comfy, reclining seats, but yet they're lined up in a row so you you're close (but still have a very comfortable space) between you and the people next to you. The one thing I don't like about the Esplanade is that the seats are so separated if you go with more than two people.

Even though I like that this place has alcohol I don't like the set-up. I don't necessarily mind that they don't serve you directly at your seat (sometimes it can get annoying having extra people walking up and down the aisles during a movie), but the bar is on the outside of where they take tickets (and it's further away than the regular snack bar). Not only do you have to carry your drinks a further distance, but you have to put them down to show your ticket to get into the the theater (this is true for ANY concessions since even the main snack bar is on the outside of where they take tickets...not a good setup IMO). 

I very rarely came to the movie theater at the old mall location in Fashion Square, but I did go to Camelview (somewhat) regularly. Sure it was old, and needed a face-lift, but as a lot of movie-goers in the Phoenix area know it was one of the only places to see indy movies and documentaries. I guess it's nice those kind of movies are still available here, but honestly, I liked the ancient theater better.",2016-04-05 20:54:57

The design of the patio is fine, but the interior of the restaurant is very plain. This is a shame, because with a little work on the interior design and menu, the view could make this one of the city's most interesting restaurants.

We ordered a large curly fry (just ok) and a pint of bbq beans, which were actually pretty tasty. It was almost $40 and we didn't get drinks (we did take out). Served 3 people.",2017-04-11 18:47:21

This was my first time jumping out of a perfectly good airplane. But make no mistake. It was bloody incredible.

From the time I arrived to the time I left, it was a great experience. They had me sign in and stand on the scale (to make sure I'm not too much of a fat ass). I then sat down to fill out the paperwork of doom. You pretty much sign your life and your first born child away; I was completely OK with that.

To cut to the chase, I finally went out to the hangar area, put on the gear, and boarded the plane. I didn't order any video or photo package, but the instructor brings the camera anyway in case you change your mind. I was surprised at how quickly the plane gets to takeoff speed. It takes about 10 minutes to reach 15K feet. Finally, the moment of truth. Honestly, I wasn't nervous at all. I've been waiting to do this for EVAR.

The first split second of the freefall gave me that weightlessness feeling, but that was over quickly. Still, it was not disappointing at all. I enjoyed every second of that freefall. After the chute opened, it was much more of a relaxing ride down to terra firma. The instructor let me steer for a little bit. It was fun doing a hard right for a couple of seconds. It felt like the final helix of many roller coasters.

Would I do it again? Hell yes! I enjoyed it so much that I ended up ordering that DVD. Let me tell you. I look horrible in the video! I was having the time of my life, but the video makes me look like I was in severe distress. The uber-tight goggles didn't help.

If it wasn't for the cost, I'd do this every day.",2010-12-06 06:31:19

The inside looks very Japanese but Korean like mixture of both. It looks like they're trying to put both cultures together. I like to order the first combo it has the best meats. But Like if you order brisket in the combo they give you rice and wasabi and roll it like its sushi. 
I love the side dishes they give you, they give you quite a variety. The vegetables are plentiful too.
The quality of the meats I HAVE TO say is probably the best SO far but maybe I'm biased haha. The way they serve it too looks very aesthetic. 
Now if we wanna talk aesthetic I LOVE the bathroom they have tooth brushes in there if you wanna brush your teeth too! Lol 
Definitely have cleanliness down as well it's pretty well maintained. 
I also love the steamed egg they give you OMG they make it so good and same with the bean paste soul. Oh and to add they offer this really good dessert after and it comes with the combo and it's pretty good, well worth my money.

I would not be surprised if zombies start appearing on Butler. If I were a zombie, I would dig myself out of the graveyard up the street and grab a nice hot cup of La Prima coffee (that they brilliantly serve) along side buttery, flaky, and scrumptious brioche, pain au chocolat and the quintessential croissant. 

I have been here numerous times, but my favorite visit was this past Saturday morning. This zombie do not like to get up early in the morning. Yet, this Saturday I was able to convince both Jared and I to partake in the goods.

I have not previously had the paris-brest or délice de pistache. However, after reading others recommendations for such and confirming aesthetic appeal, I ordered both. The nerd within felt the need to research these tasty treats. I was impressed by the history in these delights. I came to learn the paris-brest is pastry made to honor the 1981 Paris to Brest race. Hence, the wheel shape of the choux. Naively, I was thinking it would resemble the tire I will be wearing around my waist with the calories I consumed! I much prefer the French history and not my own. Nevertheless, this delightful pastry has all the sweet and playful bubbled texture of most choux, but its cavernous hallowing was not for any cream- but a hazelnut nut kissed one. The hint of roasted hazelnut, an ever so light touch of sweetness, and the richness of the cream. Worth every single calorie. I will wear my tire with pride.

The délice de pistache a demonstration of the magnificence of pistachios not so much a historical precedent as the paris-brest. Choux dressed with a pistachio mousse that supported a thin plate of dark chocolate. The subtle flavoring of the nuts paired with rich fresh mousse and a thin dark chocolate sheeted tier was perfectly balanced in taste. Admittedly, I would have preferred a drizzling of chocolate as opposed to the thin sheet. The sheet made for awkward eating. However, I felt my personal preference may not be an appropriate deduction. 

I also partook in the broiche. I cannot come to this place and leave without broiche. Airy and buttery, flaky and sweet, ahh the broiche! This visit was the first time I managed to contain myself from eating broiche in the car ride home. The broiche was still delicious- even hours later.

For starters, the poutine was not poutine. This is a classic French-Canadian dish which is simple enough to make: french fries, gravy, and specially made cheese curds all slopped together in one big bucket of calories and lard. I don't make it sound very appetizing but it is *awesome* and I was addicted to it one summer that I spent in Quebec. Anyway, we came here since this place supposedly serves the stuff and, as I said, it's not real poutine. What we got was french fries, some variety of cheese having nothing to do with Quebec-style cheese curds, and an egg on top. Without either the gravy or the correct cheese curds, it tasted nothing at all like poutine and I challenge the restaurant's right to even call it that. 

Breakfast was fine. Nothing out of this world, and nothing I'd drive out of my way to have.

I was actually pretty surprised that we were able to get such good seats considering how crowded the theater was for Valentine's day. I guess it's because we were watching a 2 week old movie.

Usually one of the first malls to get new stores (Sephora, Bath and Body Works, Hollister, etc), convenient location with 2 Subway stops, great place to bring tourists, etc. 

If you are going to actually shop with something in mind, it is hellish. This mall has its fair share of slow-walkers and even those who decide to have a conversation, stopping and standing at the top/bottom of escalators. It is a true ""hang-out"" for teenagers, and while I am trying to not sound like an old curmudgeon, they usually irritate me.

There are 2 very useless food courts. I say useless, because there is rarely any seating, the selection of fast food isn't that great, and they are both at basement-level. Not well lit, noisy, and really - what is up with the 2 food courts? I can see how it would be a good idea, but sometimes I want to get something from food court #1, while my shopping partner was hoping to get something from food court #2. They should've just made a big, central one. 

My other gripe with the Eaton Centre is the double-stores. There are some stores with 2 Eaton Centre locations. Really, the mall is not THAT large, I don't see the point. I hate when I am, say, shoe shopping and I'm in Aldo thinking ""I swear I've already seen all these shoes..."" and then I remember I have, at the other Aldo, at the other end of the mall. I guess this is me just being really picky, now. 

Anyways - I will continue to go here from time to time, because there are some newer stores and my friends/family will always drag me out here.

I think this revamp was way overdue, my first concert was at this venue back when it was the docks, and also for the revamp for what was sound academy. this is the best incarnation of this venue. upon walking in it felt like a venue I've never been to before, and all I could keep thinking was WOW, this is what ten million in renos look like. 
DROP DEAD GORGOUS, I've had a pain in my heart since the government/kool haus closed down. owned by the same gentle soul who had kool haus, hes done very well with this club. 
STOP THE PRESSES, stripper poles are present on the main floor!!! 
the sound is absolutely beautiful and balanced. during a sound check I was fortunate to walk around while the sound check was being done and its so balanced its disgusting. I can't say enough good things about this venue. 
the bad... 
paying for parking is a pain in the butt, 20 bucks every time, with little transit options possible, and a taxi will be 20 bucks back to union. 
security is super aggressive at this venue, as for both concerts I was ""denied"" access to the venue because of a point and shoot camera, luckily I got in cause I spoke to the supervisor. when I talk about super aggressive I mean every sq. inch of your body will be searched they not shy with the private bits either, felt completely violated but safe...if that makes sense.",2016-12-24 12:24:54

A group of my foodie friends and I met up here in order to sort out the deets of our upcoming podcast.  The dude who made our reservation made it for four instead of five, so it took us a little while to get a table.  Not that big of a deal to me, especially since said dude bought a bottle of wine for the group to share.  

At long last we were taken to our table.  Our group nestled in to our cozy booth and perused the menu.  I already knew there wasn't much for me to eat there, as I had checked their menu online.  My cohorts ordered some appetizers: tater tots and deviled eggs.  Both dishes looked good, and everyone seemed pleased.

The service began to get a little shotty at this point. It took a while to get waters to the table and there weren't any napkins or silverware at the table until we asked for some (after the appetizers were delivered).  Two of my friends ordered appetizer salads/soups which didn't come until the entrees came.  Salad friend ordered with no walnuts, he is allergic, but it came full o' nuts. Soup friend was presented soup and no spoon.  Soup friend also ordered several items and was told that they were out (which I can understand, given that there was a Suns game that night), when plates were dropped at the table servers were VERY quick to disappear, leaving us to literally have to yell after them for the missing stuff/refills. 

As for my meal, I ordered the Citrus Marinated Olives and the Chicory Salad.  I let the server know of my vegan/gluten-freeness and he was helpful and accommodating.  The others seemed divided on their meals.  Lots of meat, that's all I can remember of what they had haha.  Eventually, the manager came to the table to apologize for all of the little mishaps and said a round of drinks was on the house. Fine by me, I thoroughly enjoyed my Tito's gimlet, thank you!  Then the executive Chef came out to apologize as well.  It was a nice touch.

All in all, I might give them a second try, but with all of the great places out there, Blue Hound might want to step up their game.",2013-02-05 01:41:42

After going to four different Fox Concept restaurants and leaving unimpressed every time, we tried the Arrogant Butcher.  Maybe we've just had bad luck at the other restaurants in the portfolio, maybe Arrogant Butcher is the star of the show.  Anyways, enough about that.

We came eArly on a Friday evening, managed to catch the very end of happy hour.  Had the pretzels, they were very good...I'd ask for a half size portion next time, they're so good you can't leave one behind.  

Since it was Friday I had the king crab cioppino, it was excellent.  The crab was not a few flakes thrown in just for the name, big sweet pieces right on top.  The supporting cast of fruits de mer were just as good.  They did a great job on this dish.  

Oh, totally need to mention the service the waiter was great.  The lady even mentioned how good the quality of customer service was here.  As we were paying he asked if we had parked at city centre....validated parking.  Not a big deal, but a really good touch.

And yes, I use the word experience because this isn't just a bar or just a restaurant. The Punch Room is an experience. I left feeling like I learned so much, yet I didn't learn enough. 

The Punch Room is located on the 15th floor of the Ritz. We arrived right when they opened on Saturday (6:00) and thus, did not have to wait for a spot. My husband and I grabbed two of the four seats at the bar, simply because we are bar people. However, we didnt realize that those two seats at the bar were basically our tickets to a show all night. The atmosphere inside is very nice looking with couches and lighting everywherer

We received tasting of the punch of the day and Bob introduced himself. He is the head (and only) mixologist here and he had a big list of other places he has worked at. Soul and Pisces were two that came to mind. 

As for drinks, my husband and I each had two different drinks. Honestly, i have zero clue what they were called because we didnt exactly order off the menu. We were chatting with Bob and he just made us drinks based on what we were telling him we liked. All our drinks were absolutely over the top amazing and looked like pieces of art at the same time. No detail is left unturned. 

It was an absolute pleasure to sit at the bar and watch Bob work. Just watching him carefully stirring and mixing ingredients. You can tell that this is his passion and he puts everything he has into it. It was almost a running joke because the waitresses couldnt ever tell when we was done making a drink or not! He was very receptive to all our questions and even gave us small tastes of beverages that we were questioning. Absolutely created that ""experience"" feel. 

I definitely appreciated the fact that this place really staggers people in here. It only holds 37 people but Bob told us typically they like to keep it around 30 so that a) it keeps the feel of the place more enjoyable and b) he is able to spend enough time on each drink to really make it special. The even have a no standing policy at the bar. This is something that I really apprecaite cause, like I said earlier, we are bar people. However, the worst part about sitting at the bar is having someone reach around you, in front of you, in between you to order their drink. If I am drinking something that tastes so delicious and looks like pure art, I defintiely dont want to be interrupted by arms throughout. Great call. 

We did try the Hummus. Holy smokes. I have never tasted hummus this good in my entire life. It didnt even taste like hummus.....something that is hard to explain. That was the only food item we tried. However, based on this one item, I am sure their menu is top notch. 

It was truly an honor being able to visit this place on Saturday.",2015-08-10 19:48:23

There was a time a couple years ago that I thought it was the 704 burger from RiRa's, but they have sadly since let me down. So when we were planning a lunch catch up we decided to take the trip down to Elizabeth for bang bang burgers. Parking in the area is not easy. We arrived at 11:40 and were just barley able to grab a spot in the complex. We arrived and it was pretty empty. I ordered the special which was a blue cheese burger and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries and the dipping sauce were amazing. For the burger, I really loved all of the toppings. Everything was fresh and flavorful. They also do an amazing job not over cooking the thin patties. However, my mind was not blown. I did not love the bun. I felt they were dry and didn't complement the burger very well.

Collision repair guy gave me all sorts of reason why I got a crappy job, my car was old?! It had less then 19,000 Miles on it! $60,000 vehicle! That doesn't cut it. Then to try to smooth things out, make things better, the collusion manager said he was sending Ricks Detail service to clean up the vehicle after how it was left from the work they did. Rick detail service didn't come out it was another company, so I was lied to again. These ppl do nothing but deceive people 

Then I went to Quick lane to get an oil change, was told that my vehicle that has only 20,000 Miles on it that the tires were bad. They outfit new vehicles w/the worse tires you can put on a vehicle. Was quoted $237 per tire, buy 3 get one free. No full disclosure and no line item was given for all the extra charges I was charged for and I never asked to a warranty on the tires as they already came with a warranty. So they tacked that on as well with out even asking me. This goes against Uniform Code of ethics, the broke federal law! I'm so sick of the deception w/all these Ford dealerships that my cars won't be repaired or cared for by unethical cut throat con-artist! Then after all the BS, Jim Krutcher the GM says don't ever bring your vehicle back to Berg Ford.

""Real"" food that foodies would still flock to in Chicago, but less trying to be overinstagrammed for publicity and much much more affordable.

The most memorable thing has got to be the bread, served with a beef fat candle and whipped butter w/ sumac. By bread, I mean a pizza dough puffed in the oven - what a creative yet simple and delicious way to serve ""bread!"" At $8 it's pretty steep, but we were offered more bread multiple times, so maybe it's bottomless bread as long as your candle/butter lasts? Who knows. But totally creative with wow-factor and a great way to start your meal. 

We ended up choosing bread, a salad, 2 tasting portion pastas, and 2 mains, and it was more than enough food to be comfortably full for 2 people. The flavors were mostly delicious. My favorite was probably the broccoli with a ton of funk. Get that too. Overall, I thought everything we had was priced extremely fairly and tasted great. There were a minor missteps in the execution (like overcooked bucatini and not so crispy duck skin) but at no point did I feel like my money wasn't well spent.

Yesterday's visit rated only 2 stars because there were issues with both the service we received and with the food.  For starters, it was a bit busier than normal because of the Groupon special.  When we arrived, we were told the wait would be 15-20 mins, but it turned out to be 30+ mins.   However, we decided to wait, because by the time we got in the car to drive somewhere else, we would have burned that much time anyway.

So, when we were finally seated, the waitress came by pretty quickly to serve us coffee and take our order.  She left the carafe on the table, which is nice, but sadly, she did not check on how much coffee was in it, because when we were ready for a refill, the carafe was empty. That wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that our server disappeared and did not come back to check on us.   In fact, our food was brought to the table by someone else and then she finally reappeared.  It took her a while to fill the carafe and return it to the table.  

Now, for the food... it was a disappointment all the way around.  David ordered an omelette, which was cold and pretty flavorless. Plus, he said it was a litte runny from being undercooked. 

I ordered one of the specials - gingerbread pancakes w/side of scrambled eggs and chicken sausage. The eggs were cold. The gingerbread pancakes were cold and did not taste at all like gingerbread.  They simply tasted like whole wheat pancakes.  In fact, I asked our server if they had brought the correct plate because not only did the pancakes not taste like gingerbread, they were missing the side of cranberry compote.  Which she said they had run out of (it would have been nice to know that upfront).

I'll give them one more chance, but if its not a good experience, I may just stick to Le Peep instead.",2011-12-11 19:10:17

Had absolutely amazing service here the server made sure we were satisfied the whole time.

We ordered some cheese fries though it wasn't on the menu the chef made his own cheese sauce rather than just throwing cheddar on top it was amazing. For the entree my friend got the meltdown basically a cheeseburger on a waffle, it came with the best seasoned fries and I got the classic chicken and waffles which comes with no side because it's huge.

I could have given this place higher ratings had I not been to Mengrai Thai Restaurant. 
The food here is good but just nothing amazing. They do have a very long menu, for people who love options this is great. We started out with the share platter of appetizers and it was good. The quantity was enough for four people. There was two spring rolls, fried wontons, fresh wraps and two chicken satays. 

For the main course we had a basil lamb, the broth of which was really flavoursome but the lamb was overcooked. Next came the Massaman Chicken curry, it was a sweet pineapple coconut flavoured curry. Not bad but a bit too sweet for me. Mr. H called for the Choo Chee Salmon, trying to stay healthy and all, only to realize that it was fried. Needless to say he did not enjoy the fried salmon but our friend wiped the plate clean. So I guess that just depends on personal taste. I also had a Pina Colada and it was OK. Can't really blame them, I just got back from Cuba.

Nothing here really got me excited enough to want to come back but if I'm in the area maybe I'll give it a try.",2015-04-07 17:31:12

3yDd-5J7UtMKmiNwSgWNKg,46HhzhpBfTdTSB5ceTx_Og,VH3WA7a-OVzFj2K_SP4BIw,4,2,0,0,"We discovered the existence of King's Kitchen based on a Living Social deal a few weeks ago. After seeing the number of ratings the place had we knew it was worth making the purchase. The deal was for one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert for $25, which was quite awesome. We headed down there for dinner tonight after taking in an afternoon hockey game and spending some time at the Mint Museum.

King's Kitchen is a nice little place right amid the hustle and bustle of Charlotte. Upon entering you find a bright, clean-looking restaurant with one of the nicest bars I've ever seen. I usually opt out of sitting at a bar, but if the need arose I wouldn't have any second thoughts about popping down there. The rest of the indoor tables are a bit close to each other, giving you little privacy, but I've been smushed more by other restaurants. There were also some tables in an outdoor area, but the wind was a bit much to deal with that. We had made reservations so upon entering we were seated quickly and our server came over shortly after to take drinks and whatnot.

We were a bit limited on what to order since there was a separate menu for those using the Living Social deal (something that was not mentioned anywhere on Living Social), and I wasn't crazy about the choice of appetizers. We ended up settling on the pimiento cheese ($5) with lavash (sp), which ended up being these really light crackers. The pimiento cheese had a nice spice to it, and definitely went well with the cracker. There was definitely an excess of cheese to cracker, at least for us, since the cheese was a bit much (spicy and rich) to be spread too abundantly over the crackers. They did offer us bread to sop up the remainder of the cheese which was nice, but with two full meals coming we decided to not stuff ourselves.

For dinner I ordered the fried chicken ($13) with butter beans, sea island red peas and roasted carrots. I went with the white meat, which consisted of breast and wing. The batter is nice and light, but I wish it had come out a bit crisper. The flavor was totally there and it tasted great, but the chicken was a bit drier than other fried chicken breast I've had. The butter beans were awesome, but I wasn't a fan of the red peas. I had never had them before so I have nothing to compare them to, but I just wasn't a fan of the overall flavor. The roasted carrots were crazy good, and I never thought I'd be raving about carrots after any meal. They are char broiled so they have all the black char on them and they are so soft and flavorful...almost tasted like sweet potatoes!

The only fish on the limited menu was fried flounder ($14), but the miss' isn't a big fan of fried foods. Luckily the folks at Kings Kitchen were kind enough to substitute that for the blackened catfish ($20) at no upcharge, which I was very grateful for. This blackened catfish knocked my socks off. It had the PERFECT level of spice...I like enough spice where my nose will run, but not too hot where I have to chug a gallon of milk after each little bite. This blackening spice was right at the threshold for me, where it met the maximum but did not stray over even a little. She also got the mac & cheese, creamed corn and collard greens. The mac & cheese  was good, but a little too mushy for us. I really loved the creamed corn...it had this sweetness to it that made it the perfect side. I was not a fan of the collards, but I don't really like any greens, so don't take my word on the collards to heart.

For dessert we split the chocolate and peanut butter cake with vanilla gelato.  I don't usually rave about a dessert, but this one is definitely worthy of it. The cake is a couple of layers of chocolate, peanut butter and ganache with some crispy layers thrown in also. The contrast of the soft cake to the crispiness worked well, and the ganache was simply indulgent. Then you had the heaping scoop of vanilla bean gelato. It was soooo rich and thick and the miss' detected a hint of some spice (possibly cinnamon) that really brought the flavor out. When you combined a little spoon of gelato with a spoon of the cake, you really had the ultimate dessert.

Kings Kitchen definitely dishes out some slammin' Southern cuisine, and I love that they do it for a good cause at a great price with heaping portions. While some of the food was totally spot on, some of it was also lacking a bit. If I could dish out 4 1/2 stars I would, but I think there are a couple of things keeping it from 5 stars. Still, I totally recommend heading down to get some serious eats on.",2012-04-08 02:11:24

Great selection of food, accessories, grooming tools, beds, and other things. Plus points that they've finally stocked Feliway which has been limited in Canada so far. Staff are very friendly - it seems that they have many staff sometimes and very few at other times, yet I have never had an issue having my questions answered or receiving service. The store kinda models the dog and cat divide with half dedicated to dogs and the other half to cats, but encourages coexistence in a happy cohesive calming store.

Likely it comes with the location of the store in the St Lawrence market area, but the only minus point is that  prices are often a bit higher than other pet stores!

No, i'm not talking about % of sugar, or % of ice you can add, but your entire drink. You can mix flavors you would not be able to do so at another franchise, and add as many toppings as you'd like (from what they offer). The science lab theme of this place is also unique and makes it really cute. As a science graduate myself, the syringes, petri dishes, test tubes, sample jars etc was funny to me, but I'm sure it adds to the experience for others. 
You start off with a sterile tray, picking either a hot/cold cup for your drink. They also instruct you on how many test tube (of tea flavors) to add to your drink (2x for cold drinks, 1x for hot). You move on to a slew of test tube tray racks, where you can choose which tea flavor you'd like. The choices range from fruity flavors (peach etc) to milk tea powders (durian, red bean etc). You can also choose your level of sweetness with various types of sugar too (regular sugar syrup, brown sugar etc). Around the corner, you'll get to choose your toppings (boba - the ones that explode in your mouth, pearls - what they described as harder than tapoica, jelly etc) in petri dishes. They also have evaporated milk as an option, which they recommended based off your customized drink to enhance the flavor and add some creaminess. 
Finally, when you get to the register, you have an option of a 3 different tea bases. I found it a cute touch how each of the cups have ""DR."" printed on them, where they write your name on it (so they call you as ""DR. _____""). 

My friends and I all chose a milk tea, which we all agreed was not as spectacular as we would have expected. However, I've heard that their customized fruity teas are really enjoyable, so I'm looking forward to going back and giving those a try.

The miniputt was a bit disappointing not that we had planned to partake but it was pretty sad deal if peeps are going there solely for the puttputt.

I had fun playing the games, I also happened to have the cash to blow. I suppose a lot of these places tend to be pretty highly priced for the amount of time it takes to blow through the money on the card. I suppose renting of the space and employees cost a lot and so 1.75$ for a game helps out.

There was one game that I ended up doing pretty well on and wasn't able to play it again. Although, our second card allowed another player... Again, I guess they don't really want people to win huge time and time again...

Inside are rows of rounded booths which I also loved. For my first Dim Sum experience, I wanted to go in with an open mind and try anything that was put in front of me.

I tried so many new things, and a few (I'm embarrassed to say) I don't remember what it was, but I'll try to recap. My ultimate favourite, the special bbq pork bun, was something like I've never had before. Sweet and savoury at the same time, it really was the world's best bun! :) Beef rice noodle roll, pork and shrimp crispy spring rolls, mushroom and vegetable dumplings, chickens feet (which I never thought I'd try, less enjoy..!), pork and shrimp shumai, and some cute little deep fried pear-shaped pork dumpling thingys that were just the best! I also had my first congee which I quite enjoyed. I think it was the lobster, clam and fish. To finish, I tried the deep fried durian cake (!!). Surprisingly, it wasn't half bad!

3. They have Negro Modelo on tap, most nights.

4. The chef KNOWS what he is doing in the kitchen. He cares and this is shown with the way he plates his food and the general freshness and attention to flavors. The guacamole is fantastic. The cochinita pibil is Amazing. The steak ranchero is perfectly cooked. And the lamb chops!!! The fish tacos are very good. All the other tacos are great too.

After 3 years of eating here, we finally met Chef Antonio because we go crazy about the lamb chops special. This is only available sometimes on Wednesdays and only if you ask for it. :) (OK, now I have let the cat out of the bag)

It could have been the questionable food at the Baja Fresh we ate afterward. But, no- it really was the see-sawing of our entire lengthy transaction. 

We were due for the ""new every 2"" deal, but, wouldn't you know it- the prices for the phones we wanted that Hubby had been quoted in an e-mail expired 2 days before! Then we needed to go back out on the floor to look for more affordable models. 

Bonus point for the salesman getting Hubby a gov't employee discount on the phone plan and accessories.

Bonus point for finally having a device in house that will transfer your contacts and photos for you. Minus a point for his lame joke about it costing $10. Minus a point for his inability to transfer my pics when he could transfer Hubby's. 

Minus 2 points for screwing up the rebate process by ringing up the same phone twice, so now the UPC codes on the box and the rebate form don't match. So much for reminding us so often about the glorious $50 rebate per phone, that finally made us choose to go with the original phones we had wanted in the first place. So now I have to squeeze in a trip back to the store sometime very soon before the whole deal expires, or possibly and tragically lose my- wait for it....wait for it.... f-ing ""Verizon Debit Card."" WTF? The sales rep never said anything about a debit card. Can I only conveniently use it at a Verizon store? Shockingly, the rebate printout does not say specifically.

Zoe's is ""ok"". I popped in for lunch today as I was tying up some loose ends with my car dealer (Camelback Toyota--a review for another day).

I needed something quick and was in the mood for ""fresh"". Of course, I hopped on my Yelp app on my iPhone and immediatey saw Zoe's.

The menu is pretty basic. A bunch of salads, and sandwiches. 

Today, I chose the Steak Rollups with a side of potato salad. The rollups were good. Not great. It seemed like something I could've made at home. The carmelized onions were a nice touch.

Something seemed a bit off with the potato salad. The ingredients and concept seemed nice. No mayo, always a plus. But, it was clearly lacking salt, or maybe even some sort of a citrus element. Perhaps, even some rosemary, but then again, I am no chef. Just a hungry man.

My food came out within a few minutes, and the service was great.

You know in the east valley vicinity there is absolutely NO dim sum fare worth the money. Maybe maybe maybe the one inside me kong. 

I have visited a number of dim sum restaurants in many different states and this one by far has got to be the worst one. 

I've been here at least 10 times because people keep wanting to try it and I keep telling them no but they want dim sum. Whatever. You pay I'll come be your side kick. 

When we visited phoenix palace they came by our table many times and we got a few dishes to start and they came back mid finishing of the dishes and we declined and then they came back again but we were still working on what we had so we asked them to come by later. Well.... Maybe we should have jumped at the opportunity of getting something else but they didn't come by anymore. So after flagging down a wait staff to order rice rolls we finished that and that was it. My friend went to go pay and I had gotten up to use the restroom. Just then a lady staff member stopped me and said excuse me but tip is not included with your bill. I was so puzzled. First we hadn't officially left, second I was going to be restroom and lastly if they didn't have us go pay at the register maybe they would have known that we left the tip on the charge card. I literally paid a dollar to leave the table and go to the bathroom and didn't even go. I'm so glad I didn't cause a scene it's not worth it. I also came to the front and told the gal who sat us what happened and gave her $4 more dollars to tip the other wait staff and advised them they really shouldn't treat their patrons like this... Unfortunately, the word hasn't gotten out. I told my friend about this and they laughed bc the same thing happened to them. So maybe it's time to review this place. 

Food: 2 stars. You have to know how to mix sauces for it to taste ok.

Atmosphere: it's a Chinese restaurant that serves dim sum. I didn't make it to the bathroom so I can't tell you how clean it is. They are slow to seat you but rush you out but if you go on a slow day there's nobody there so it seems like they don't make fresh foods. 

Staff: 0 stars this place has changed hands and management. I don't worry about how great personalities are in places like this but the cross guard at the end of the meal totally  made me feel angry. I'm easily disappointed but rarely do I get pissed. I think there's a huge opportunity to have really good dim sum here that is strictly dim sum and really only needs to be open 3-4 days a week. This is how other places I've gone to operate. 

Will I recommend this place? I've been against it since the second set of owners didn't improve but every time... ""They have new owners maybe it's different."" Yep NO it hasn't improved. 

What would I change? We need to call Gordon Ramsay on this one.

But who cares! You really won't find better fries anywhere. When you walk in, walk immediately past the hot dog counter (they're okay but not important) back to the fry counter. If you are with 3 or fewer people, get a small--it'll be more than enough. I'd come in with a group of seven and get a medium (""serves 3-4"") and it was always MORE than enough. Purists will claim you don't need anything but salt on the fries, but I always liked that ersatz cheese sauce. It lent just a touch of class to the whole experience. It's basically the same thing as a Mornay, yo!

And the fries? Hot, crispy, fluffy on the inside, glistening with oil that burns your tongue when you put it in your mouth. The oil probably hasn't been changed since 1974, but that's part of the charm. Anyone who's anyone knows these fries are where it's at. Forget Five Guys, screw Point Brugge--this is the true Pittsburgh potato-based food experience.

DO NOT GET THE PIZZA WHATEVER YOU DO. I DON'T CARE HOW DRUNK YOU ARE.

  The atmosphere is warm and friendly and there's a large, square patio rammed with regulars in the summer. The first time I went to Ronnie's was in the winter and as I explored the bar, I found, to my pleasant happiness, a back room with large comfy couches and books everywhere.. Heaven? I thought. It was perfect. Small, but perfect.

 I love the wooden seating and no frills set up at Ronnie's. You go in, you drink, you socialize and then you get out. People are all there for a good time and to enjoy the night.

It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.

We walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none. 

Also, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did.

It'll say the drink is twelve bucks or so, but by the time they add whatever fees get added, it's pretty much fifteen each.  Which is still a STEAL for this show!

    Allow plenty of time before the show to turn in your coupon voucher and pay. The afternoon we went (a Tuesday) they were having computer problems, and we waited in line a long time without it moving at all. About the time we were thinking they were going to let computers make a lot of us miss the show entirely, they finally started working.  Then, with just two folks taking money...well, it took awhile.  Patience paid off, however.

   After having our pic taken, we were escorted to a table.  If you want to sit in those nifty comfy-looking round booths, be prepared to upgrade.  We were perfectly happy at our table.  The theater is small enough and we had no problem seeing.

  The bar is in the back...we took our drink tickets there and a friendly bartender fixed us right up. 

   When Mac King hits the stage it's non-stop laughs, fun, and how-the-heck-did-he-do that?

   Loved the audience participation.  You've got a better shot at getting called up if you have a kid the right age, or you are a newlywed.  

   This is a show for all ages, and everyone seemed to enjoy and appreciate it as much as we did!",2013-11-25 03:26:31

I love the atmosphere (the decor is tropical), the food is excellent, and the caribbean music (free entertainment) adds to the overall fun feel of this restaurant. It's easy to feel good in this type of restaurant. I've only been here for dinner, but about ten times. (Twice for an e-mail member event- that was fun!) The service is really good. The location (Paradise/Flamingo) is in ""Restaurant Row."" It's very easy to get there from the Strip, if you are just visiting. If you're coming for dinner, make a reservation, because this is a very popular restaurant. Outside seating is nice, if you can stand the heat during the summer months.  

My favorite appetizer is the Coconut Shrimp. It's now the best all around in Las Vegas, since Red Lobster's version has changed. I don't like a whole lot of breading- like how they do so often at chinese restaurants. It's definitely not the case here. Also, the size of the shrimp is pretty good.  

My favorite dish here is the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta. I am not usually a fan of creamy sauces, but I make the exception here. It is the perfect blend of bowtie pasta, jerk chicken (love that spice combination), mushrooms, and asparagus. It's the best thing on the menu. But that's my opinion. I've tried other things on the menu but I keep coming back to this dish. 

About the prices, it's a chain restaurant, so the prices are going to be slightly higher than some restaurants out there. Frankly, I didn't think that the Planet Hollywood restaurants are anything special, but they still remain popular today for some reason. I would rather go to Hard Rock Cafe, but now, my husband doesn't think those restaurants are anything special either.

Going to take a piss, I'd just bought a beer and, hey, I kinda like pissing with a beer.  It's fun!  Above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on, in fact I can't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy.  As I walk in, this security dude goes, ""Hey!  You can't bring your beer in there,"" and I'm like, ""Well, I'm gonna set it down right here, then..."" when I came out, fuck, my beer was gone and so was the security dude.  Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...

Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.  Lovely.

I was mixed on if this would be a great place for food based on the reviews I read. I never went to this restaurant when it was on East blvd so I can not compare it to that. 

For my first time I was pleased with the food! I ordered the 5 cheese queso and the spinach chicken enchiladas with the white sauce. The main dish was pretty good! The consistency was perfect and really good flavor. Now the queso.. I was slightly disappointed. It is difficult to disappoint me with cheese! I thought it was slightly bland. I also thought it tasted like cheese you would get at a fondue place and I'm not the biggest fan of that. I shared with others and they loved it! So it's all about preference. I was not paying for my meal and I would've been disappointed if I would've spent $9.75 of my own money on the queso. I put it in my rice though and it was good! 

Other people at my table got burritos. I have NEVER seen a burrito as big as these!! They could last you 2-3 meals probably!

It didn't. It made things worse. I'll just say overall that every girl here is really kind of introverted and droning around doing their job like it was just like any other job. And, although I don't really condone that girls should need to be extra flirtatious in order to keep the job, there's a difference to being nice and being slutty. These girls were neither. All of the girls look so serious and were very boring. Sure they looked good but I kind of thought that the whole point of 15 dollars for 10 wings wasn't just for the ""amazing"" flavors, I can now get the same at 7-11 and they aren't even a fraction of the price. Two beers and a tip and I just dropped 40 bucks. Without even a smile from a single girl. I mentioned my other review because it was kind of related and the only reason I thought I could salvage a bad night. When I used to go to Hooters long ago, my friends and I went to cheer us up. These girls were more like dominatrix type which is not what I was in the mood for. Really disappointing. To top it off, I went into the very small slot area thinking that maybe that would be a way to save my night. Another 60 that went faster then I could count it and I don't think I'll ever come back for anything here. Really nothing good here not to mention that the room prices have skyrocketed. This was my original choice for a room but their prices went from around 27 bucks a few years ago to over 100 for regular price.

He saw it on YouTube Kids, and has been patiently waiting for THIS specific toy.  Checked online once a week, until this Toys 'R Us (30 mins away) finally listed it in their inventory.  We purchased it, but waited to open it until we got home to avoid losing any small parts.  Unfortunately, we came back less than 3 hrs later for an exchange on it.  

When you pull the arm downward, it will open and close the mouth with chomping sounds, followed by roars.  Well, his toy's arm would get stuck and so the sound effects weren't working correctly or at all and I knew he hadn't played with it yet.  Went to Customer Service and they insisted that nothing was wrong with the toy.  That it's not supposed to roar.  I asked the customer service representative if she would just let me bring another one to the counter for her to compare.  We had seen the toy in action for months because of YouTube kids videos that people shared.  She was very rude to us and while I understand they're JUST TOYS, they're also JUST a TOY STORE.  Normally, I would've just dealt with the malfunctioning toy because it's still pretty cool.  It was $34.99 but my 4 yr old waited months for it and actually takes good care of his toys.  My older boys, not so much.  In the end, I went to get two more from their shelves while my husband stayed behind w/her.  I had to show her on two different Jurassic World Hybrid INDOMINUS REX how the toy is supposed to work.  She didn't say anything to us after that, just ignored us like we weren't there, looked at her computer the whole time.  She exchanged it but I think she did it because she felt at this point she had to. :(  We've had other issues at this store during the Holidays, but my review is based on this experience alone.  We felt like we were bothering her the whole time.    

As far as the store goes, they are well stocked with everything, including Toys 'R Us exclusives.  The store has always been clean and they do well moving the lines and promoting specials on their shelves.

Oh. Cool.

One of the rooms was not finished being set up when we needed it. Granted, it was 30 minutes before we needed it, however we had asked in advance to have the room ready and able for us to set up 30-60 minutes and the hotel said ""No problem!"" a few weeks in advance. We were lucky to have 5 minutes.

This is nit-picky and more of annoyance but why provide refreshments if there is not enough for the number expected? They had put out bottles of water, soda, coffee, carafes of water, cups, plates, pretzels, some dip for the pretzels (i can't remember, but maybe mustard?) At least HALF of the people didn't have plates for the pretzels - we ended up with napkins (no big deal) but the dip in paper cups. We asked for more coffee when it started and after 2.5 hours still no coffee.

The room was clean, and seemed well put together. The other rooms I saw looked equally well put together.

My other complaint is the restaurant - a colleague and I happened to stop in there, hoping to have a beer. We sat at the bar and after over 5 minutes (5 minutes from when we started paying attention) the bartender STILL had barely looked at us and definitely not asked if we wanted something.

With 1242 Reviews and a 5 Star rating, I knew that Brew Tea Bar had some serious boba game. The people of Yelp had clearly spoken. 

I stopped by today and I was throughly impressed. 

From the minute I stepped into Brew Tea I knew that I would not be let down. Of course we were greeted the second we walked in. Someone behind the counter observed me staring at the menu and handed me a handheld menu with a smile. 

As I browsed the many different options that same friendly person who handed us menus asked if we had any questions. The big question for me was if they were able to substitute the milk with soy or almond milk. The answer was yes, they could. The popular menu items were also pointed out to us. 

I settled on the Okinawa Milk Tea, at the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers. 

My Okinawa Milk milk tea was AMAZING. The tea itself was so flavorful. I didn't mess with the sweetness level and it was perfect for me. The Boba was fresh, the perfect boba texture and consistency.

In a sea of corporate taco malls, Taco Huicho stood alone as the taco spot I hadn't heard of at the Arizona Taco Festival. Their pastor tacos reminded me of my favorite street taco place in Cabo which I constantly crave and haven't been able to find a substitute for here in Phoenix. 

That all happened Sunday. As in... yesterday. 

Needless to say, lunchtime rolled around and I got that familiar craving and decided to find them on yelp since I had no clue where they were located. I would definitely describe their location as ""tucked away,"" but the dot on the yelp map was 100% spot on. 

Round two with the pastor was even better than the first. It came out super hot and the salsa bar is nothing short of amazing. There aren't 15 different types of exotic, over-thought salsas but everything tasted fresh and delicious. Located on the counter I saw a small unassuming trophy for the recent taco festival - 1st place - People's Choice. No surprise. That kind of trophy seems fitting for this place, no flash necessary when you do it like this. 

Every restaurant in the greater Phoenix area that is even thinking about serving a taco should come here first. This goes double for the Scottsdale ""luxury cantinas"" that charge $4.00+ for a taco. Now I'm not saying you have to be cheaper, but if Tacos Huicho can inspire me to write a novel about their tacos at $1.25 a pop you can put something semi tasty together for 4 times that. 

I fully expect Tacos Huicho (and the associated Carniceria) to end up in a top spot on yelp with 100+ reviews and a 4.5* + rating. It would be criminal if they don't become one of the hot taco dives of Phoenix.",2014-10-20 20:49:39

Tried the beer flight for the first time last night.  Six bucks for six four-ounce servings of what's on tap.  Best.  Deal.  Ever.  Arrives on a bone-shaped tray.  I see what you did there.  Kinda cute.

Two IPAs, both from Michigan.  Shout-out to tha home state.

Crooked Tree at 6% grapefruity, light flavor
Founders Centennial at 7%  more floral

Angels Share at a whopping 12% dark rich carmel lush yum
Witterkerkle Wit at 5% was like beer and lemonade had a baby

Angels was a seductive poison you always wanted, and Wit was the refreshing antidote.  Really good with alternating sips of these two.

Schalaflys Scotch Ale around 6.7% was decent but not as memorable as the rest of the flight.
Left Hand Milk Stout= yum rich malty coffee creamy

I usually don't groove on dark beers but both of the last two were imminently drinkable in a way that darks usually are not for me.

Food?  Oh, yeah, we had some of that.  Brilliant as it has always been, plus we got the last 2 servings of burnt ends in our party. (sorry everyone else!)

Line out tha door soon after we arrived.  Word continues to get around!  Get the beer flight.  You will not be disappointed.  And, hey, if you are, you can buy me a drink.",2010-04-09 15:13:54

 It was around noon on a Sunday and fairly empty. I walked right in, ordered and started chatting with Mike, the owners son. Good guy, I can relate, being the son of a restaurant owner. It's funny to hear someone else tell the same stories, ha. He fixed me up with 2 slices of pepperoni and a pepperoni roll. The pepperoni roll was BOMB, so good, I loved the little bit of burnt cheese around the edges, so yummy. The slices were great, too. Thin, New York style and a few shakers of goodness-crushed peppers, parmesean cheese, etc. 
The place was really clean, lots of seating in the back and plenty to drink. Beer or Soda available.

The big question: Are they better than Fiori's? Well, they are neck and neck in all honesty. I like that Fiori's is a little sweeter, but both pies are great. The pepperoni roll will bring me back for sure.

I went in today because my boyfriend had dropped his phone on some cement stairs and then fell into rocks... so the screen completely shattered. 

So we went in, looked for a someone to talked too, made eye contact and waved to one of the workers to let them know we needed help, she just waved back, so we went to her, lol. 

Told her the dealio, she checked her iPad, told us it'd be an hour to get called, which was fine. She had my number so when it gets closer they could text me that the Genius Bar is ready to see us. 

For that hour, we went to Lucille's, then I get a text that there ready for me, so I left my boyfriend at the restaurant and drove to downtown Summerlin Apple store. 

When I got there I got checked in by paulie ? I think , he took me to the back of the store. He then asked questions regarding the shattered iPhone, that I couldn't answer .. because it was regarding about passwords etc. so I couldn't get the phone fixed , I needed my boyfriend there to unlock his iCloud etc. so he set up some things and told me to come back and ask for him. 

So I did that, he set everything up. Told us it's 29$ to repair, because we have apple care, and told us to come in an hour and a half. paulie was really nice, answered all questions. We had to wait for a bit, he was doing things on the iPhone etc etc, he was sparking great convos, it was like I was talking to a friend. It was very welcoming lol.

The waitress brought over a chalkboard menu with specials and explained each one. We decided to get the oxtail fried rice off this menu. I thought this was pretty yummy fried rice as the rice was flavored well and there was plenty of chunks of oxtail in the rice. It had one egg on top, but it definitely needed more as after mixing it up into the rice, it sort've disappeared so perhaps consider getting a extra egg if you're a egg slut like me.

We also got the fried cornish hen with tomato rice. I rarely ever see cornish hen on menus, which is unfortunate as it's a more juicy,personal sized chicken. The fry on the bird was good, light crisp and it had a pleasant seasoning on it where I detected a hint of cinnamon that was lovely. If you love natural style fried chicken (no heavy kfc style breading) then this might be your jam. I was into this, it reminds me of Maxs Filipino style chicken that I grew up eating. 

Our server was pretty good about checking in on us. I like that this place is clean, modern  and has a young atmosphere with upbeat dance music.

From the upscale modern design and the quite informal atmosphere and general lack of pomposity from the staff.  I feel comfortable dining here in a black punkrock t-shirt & facial piercings.  I have never been treated as if I didn't deserve just as good service as the yupp's

Try not to go nuts on the bread & butter assortment.  The course portions are large and I know that thin seasame flat bread is pretty tasty.

The appetizers are more than adequate and the mains are what stay on my tongue.  They are all beautiful and consistently taste great regardless of which shift or chef is on duty.  That says a lot about a restaurant, when you don't have to hope it's as good as last time.

The torchon of Foie Gras is noteworthy.  Creamy with the usual garnishments.  I've tried worse at more hyped restaurants.

The Shrimp Scampi is jumbo crispy, saucy and a rather large appetizer for just 3 shrimp. I recommend. 

The oysters Rockefeller are probably my favorite anywhere.  Never over cooked.

The shrimp cocktail has the same giant prawns as the scampi but the cocktail sauce is prepared with generous horseradish or ginger.  A Vegas classic done right.

The 22 or so oz. Bone-in Prime rib of beef is a knock out with bordelaise and I swear there were stong hints of black truffle all over it.  I like it more rare than others and everyone has a different opinion of what medium rare is.  I order a cut this big as medium rare, because I have a brain, and it is going to be perfect in the middle for my tastes everytime because it is gigantic.  I usually have it with the wild mushrooms and those must be truffle laced also?  I'm sure you could request a foie gras on top but at 22oz you wouldn't be able to devour it all and I'm not sure how well Foie would hold up as a left over.

I could never get myself to order anything other than this as a main course.  It is my favorite steak.  Period.  Now I didn't give 5 stars because I am aware that all these dishes are standard steakhouse and seafood fare.  I have to honestly admit that some places can probably do a better job on some things but as a whole food experience this place wins out on the craving meter for me.

4 stars for the wings and fries. The wings were especially good. I also liked the BBQ sauces.

3 stars for the pulled beef nachos. The nachos needed way more cheese and more toppings in general. It was just chips, small amount of cheese, beef, sour cream, and some radishes. How about some guacamole, jalapeños, more cheese, beans, etc? I make better nachos at home.

We all got the ginger salad I love salads so I can't complain but the fiancé says it's a bit too bitter. We got there around 5 and so it was dinner both my fiancé and BIL got the Pork Katsu Don, fried pork cutlet over rice with an egg and mixed vegetables. I got the chicken Katsu that came with rice on the side and mixed veggies also on the side. I thought the chicken Katsu was good a bit bland but it was crispy and good with the veggies.

The food was not great and the grits were some of the worst I had in my life. The majority of servers had a pretty bad attitude and were not attentive.

It was a gorgeous spring morning and I wanted to get out of my house and go somewhere awesome for brunch, with a patio. I tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and I agreed on Harris. I checked in on the ""no wait"" app when leaving my house (a 40 minute wait was estimated), drove the 20 minute drive to Harris and was seated right away! We sat on the patio, of course, which was such gorgeous. 

The brunch at Harris is a buffet- which I had no idea about until arriving. It was only $15 and included your choice of juice, a frozen mimosa or a bloody mary. I went with the frozen mimosa (duh)! It was delicious and had a nice kick of alcohol to it, which I loved ;)! The buffet was pretty impressive! Eggs benedict, chicken tenders and waffles, omelets made to order, bacon, sausage, bagels with all of the fixings, fresh fruit, potatoes and sautéed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but everything else was AWESOME. I loved the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after. The sausage was also very good. My boyfriend and I were also in love with the potatoes. 

For $15 a person, we were stuffed and very satisfied. I didn't think I could love Harris Grill more than I already did, but coming to brunch proved me wrong!",2015-05-06 13:41:13

There's something about pho in the east that just doesn't quite cut it. With so many raving reviews, you would think that Mi Mi would be a gem but I think it's far from that.

Let's get to the basics and that means Pho. The noodles are right (traditional dry noodles), condiments all good and the beef is pretty standard stuff. The broth is what really let me down. Instead tasting the usual herbs and spices like star anise, strangely enough I was tasting fish sauce. I love fish sauce in my stir fries but in a soup it left me a little confused.

Equally confusing was the fact that there is yet another Vietnamese restaurant in the east end using the wrong spring roll wrappers for their spring rolls (Bach Yen is the other one). However, I do have to admit that the filling is pretty good.

My partner in crime ordered some seafood noodle soup and it was loaded with Pepto colour faux crab sticks (it's common to have faux crab this type of soup but just not in such an abundance). The taste is again very strange and off-putting.

All in all, both soups have a taste that I don't quite recognize and neither are good. However, as I glanced over at the other tables I did catch a glimpse of their barbeque dishes and they look delicious! Maybe, i'll come back to try it out in the future.

In the meantime, avoid Pho in the east if you can. Oh yeah, the service is impeccable and they accept cash only!",2015-10-02 20:36:02

Also, one of the best places for Pad Thai. It has great flavor, texture. The noodles aren't overly wet or too soft. This is our go-to place for Pad Thai. The chicken and shrimp comes with lots of chicken, but only 2 shrimp. So be quick if you eat family style. 

Don't get the ""Thai spicy"" anything unless you actually can handle it.

The Place itself is not bad looking and the buffet is Ehh... There are a few ups and a few downs.

Ups:
1. The the south point member club sends out $15-50 In free slot play about once a month.
2. The oyster bar has a good deal on King Crab legs.
3. The Bowling ally is awesome and is 24 hours

Downs:
1. Walking into this place is like walking into a 12x12 room full of marlboro testers on full puff status... Plan on having second hand cancer when you leave and plan on having a soar throat for a few days after leaving.
2. I understand that coctail waitresses are assigned the uniforms... So come on South Point, is it really fair for those poor girls to be forced to have a 3 inch thick piece of cloth pulled up there ass and the sides cut up to thier arm puts.... All i can say is this is not flattering. ""if you are a c octail waitress there please understand I am not talking about your lack of appeal, but the wrestling singlets that you are forced to wear just dont do any favors""
3. The slots, in my opinion are very very tight, they boast the %97 payback rate on video poker but that means nothing to me. Thats a %97 payback rate based on an infinate amount of time.

Maybe i am being a little harsh on the place, and i know my main complaint is the smoke.. And I have had 2 bad experiences at the buffet, not directly but watching managers discipline the employees by screaming at them in the middle of the dining area is not exceptable and I personally feel that type of behavior reflects upon the entire establishment.

The lunch buffet is satisfying and cheap. Since this is so close to where I work a lot of us end up here for a quick sushi fix. They seem to change around a few menu items every day for lunch so you won't be too bored if you come often.

The dinner rush is a totally different atmosphere than the daytime. Walked in to booming music, chefs and waiters cheering on sake bombs, pounding on tables, and people trying to be loud enough to have a conversation at their tables. I guess I've gotten old because it wasn't very appealing to me, I prefer sushi in a more toned down environment. The rolls themselves were cheap and some flavor combinations turned out pretty good. There seems to be a lot of fried rolls drenched in mayo and sriracha though.

The only problems that I really have is that the service is SUPER SLOW like we ate here last night and we didn't get finished with our food until like 6-7 am when we got there at like 3-4. The lady was supposed to adjust our temp and flip our meat for us but most of our brisket burned and we had to try to eat it quickly before the other half burned. Oh to also add they don't give you rice , you Have to add it which I think sucks because who normally just eats Korean meat without the rice ?! And then we asked for hot tea and never got it . We ordered and got all our food before we even got our beverages! There were only 3-4 other tables eating too but she spent the least time tending to our table. Then last she never even brings out our bean paste soup that goes with the combo, we had to request it when it was time to pay the bill. We asked for the bill she didn't even give it to us for another 30 mins. We finally left when the sun was coming up and we come out to our car with a flat tire. Great.

First round of drinks I had the sangria which the flower in it just gave it that little extra something to make you feel like you were on a tropical island somewhere...it's the little things!  2nd round was the basil martini which was delicious.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  I would have had more if I wasn't driving :)

Food was really good! My favorite was the macadamia goat cheese! Fish tacos and plantain chips were yummy too. I plan to go back and get the poke and the sliders, which others in my party said the sliders were really good, I was just too full! But always have room for dessert and when they brought out the dessert tray, had to try the creme brûlée in the pineapple.  Not only was it pretty and tropical looking but was amazing!  Never had that mix, glad we did and will definitely get it again!  We scraped the bottom!

I wouldn't have minded sitting inside because the guitar player Justin is amazing! I didn't realize he played there but saw him one day when I was passing through the restaurant.  He happen to be the musician I got to play at my sisters wedding. I saw him at a friends wedding and had to book him.  So glad I know where I can catch him play!

Even though I didn't get the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received, the guy behind the counter at about 7:30pm did eventually give me some samples of one meat and that jalapeno cream cheese too. The cream cheese and both of the salsa's at the salsa bar were all in the hot category, even the green one that normally is mild. Go for the pico de Gallo if you don't like things too hot like myself. The beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick, but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meat that the cook put back on the grill before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.
   These things stand out here:
1. Chipotle tortilla (choice of 4 others too)
2. Roasted Corn to put inside the burrito
3. Homemade Horchata
4. Free Homemade Chips with your order

This guy knows how to roll one too. The ingredients were all super fresh and the burrito was one of the better ones I have come across.

The bbq sauces though really helped and were very tasty (I mixed the spicy and the sweet). The veggies were average, nothing overly special.
But I went back today with a coworker and ordered the chopped brisket sandwich (minus the bread, since I am GF) with a side of creamy cole slaw (they also have a Carolina version, which is a vinegar slaw). I have to say I was very impressed with the brisket, it was so delicious. The slaw was pretty tasty too. Also I was served homemade pickles with this meal, whereas on my first visit I was not. The pickles were really good. I only wish they offered a GF bun for the sandwich, that would have garnered 5 stars. 
My coworker got the 2 meat plate, with the pork ribs and the brisket. He got 2 sides and one was the corn muffins, they are mini muffins but they give you 4. He really enjoyed them.

I was curious, then, about a joint that offers dairy-free soft serve and milkshakes. I decided to go with their Banana Bread soft serve, and watched as the helpful clerk mixed it up from scratch.

It's...fine. For what it is, it's probably better than average. It's got a rich banana flavor and it definitely grew on me as I was eating it. But it's a far cry from actual ice cream, ultimately. It's rather thick and chunky, and it's missing that creaminess one tends to expect from soft serve. (It's pretty expensive, too.)

If you have indecisive pals, either leave them at home or bring them with the understanding that you're doing the ordering - the menu is gargantuan. 

There's a little RuSan biting happening here what with all the orange and clubby hits pumping in the background, not to mention the insanely large menu, but they def aren't observing the cheap rule - so either come prepared or come for lunch, when everything is available in half-orders for 7 and up. Kind of odd that all the prices are base and you have to search for what your protein of choice will cost in addition - ah, there it is, up at the top of the section in small print, yeesh.

There are actually some Veg specialty rolls on the menu - omg - but they're 'spensive - Veg Tempura roll was 9 bucks and was more tempura than Veg (which, admittedly, was kinda awesome).

There's soba and udon to be had, noodle lovers! All traditional fish broth, so no soup for me.

The staff was very friendly! The food was amazing and fresh and they dont skimp at all on the portions. The price is also very reasonable especially at lunchtime. 
The grill room at night is alot of fun. If you order a saki bomb they usually will ask if its your first time.. always say yes. haha.. they have a way of doing the saki bomb in thier own Hayashi style. They pour the japanese beer in the cup and the saki in the shot glass. They then put two chopsticks on the rim of the glass and set the shot just barely on the chopsticks. They have the whole table yell.. SAKI BOMB! three times then they bang the table and the shot falls in the beer and you chug it. Although you do not have to do this it is alot of fun.. The chefs are a riot with jokes and they usually chop up small portions of food as they are cooking and try to have people catch it in thier mouths.. if your up for it. lol

Overall I have enjoyed Campo each and every time I stop by for lunch or take-out. The place is lively with a great taste in decorations and music. Service is excellent! Always kind, polite, and most of all speedy during their lunch rush. 

As for the food. Chicken is tender and perfectly cooked. Delicious seasoning however, it'squite  salty! Their fries are very good, again.. very salty! I would serve them on the side and not on the bottom of the chicken. Fries do become a bit soggy if you do not eat them fast enough. I'd make them a touch more crispy please! Just a touch! 
 Now I know that salt tolerance depends from one person to another. What might be salty to me is not salty to you. Which is understandable. I did find myself drinking quite a few glasses of water after our meal. 
Their green salad is crispy, fresh with a delicious dressing! It is missing some colour. I wish they would add another veggie or two aside from just romaine lettuce. 
Let me brag about their amazing Natas and chocolate mousse. Do make sure to leave some space in your tummy for their oh so rich, sense, silky chocolate mouse. Or their crumbly, buttery, delicious Natas.

Although I cannot attest to the beer,  as I am not a beer-drinker, the cocktails were delicious. They were tasty, flavorful and unique. Lastly, the food.  I ordered the crab burger and was pleasantly surprised.  The crab burger at Heist was massive and yummy. 

I think the small portions comments will really depend on what you give.  Some of the appetizers are going to be very small; however, the burgers are huge and come with a side. 

I do have a complaint - I am not a HUGE fan of the 'tater tots,' I appreciate the attempt to put a homemade twist on an old classic, but either the potato insides need to be more cooked, or the outside needs to be a little crispier. 

Bottom Line:  I think this is a great place for groups, hangouts and grabbing a bite -- probably not the best for an intimate date- but other than that, I got no complaints!",2013-02-04 19:47:46

It was around 11pm and we were a group of 6. It was not busy at all and we were seated almost immediately which was nice. The waitress came by quickly to take our orders. She was visibly disappointed that we did not want to order alcoholic beverages and kept trying to convince us to get Margarita's. We politely declined. As we had already had 4 rounds inside the Joint and a few prior to that and were trying to sober up to drive home. She finally gave up on drinks and took our orders. I ordered the Posole. 1 friend ordered a burrito and the rest ordered a variety of tacos. When the food came, the I got my soup and the others had plates of tacos placed in front of them. My friend picked up his plate handing it back and said he'd ordered the burrito, she took it, put it back down in front of him and said nope, you got tacos. To which his wife replied ""No, Miss, he did order a burrito I heard him"" and again she said no. She said ""I heard tacos so here's your tacos"" and walked away.  My husband wanted to call the manager but friend said no, he'd just eat the tacos and he didn't want to make a fuss. As for the food, he did enjoy those tacos, his wife loved her fish tacos, my husband did not like his tacos at all. He had the chicken, shrimp & Al pastor. He said all lacked flavor. Our other 2 friends said their tacos were just alright. My Posole. Man I was looking forward to Posole. This Posole was not good. It was super salty. I only ate half of my small bowl, took the rest home. Next day woke up with my tongue swollen (which is what always happens to me when I consume too much salt) I thought I'd heat up the left overs and let my son try it and he said same, way too salty. I don't think I'd go back here.",2017-05-07 16:35:05

We stopped in about two weeks ago and after reading the reviews here, hit it at 11:00 a.m.  And that was a lifesaver! We went right up to the register and placed our order.  

We got a Fontina Burger, a Farm Burger, a Kids cheese pizza and a side order of Onion Rings.  The burgers were very good as were the side of fries you receive.  I think the fries were some of the best I've had around Phoenix.  They were crisp but not greasy and full of flavor. 

 The kids Pizza was the only disappointment (our daughter didn't care for the sauce and I have to agree)....but the O rings were yummy too....

It was really good. I had the famous Breakfast Enchiladas. There is a reason they are famous. Just the right amount of spice. Spice for breakfast sure will wake you up. The pork with the chipotle ricotta and the beans with the eggs on top just all worked together so perfectly. Then topped with the New Mexico red chili sauce that added that spice that brought it all together.
Then there was the corned beef hash that I spilt with fellow breakfaster Scott W. I almost didn't want to share. That was amazing too. The corned beef with the country style potatos and the rosemary to set it all off. I couldn't stop eating it. It was hard to pick which I liked more the enchiladas or the hash but the enchiladas won in the end. Not that I will ever turn down the hash again.

The walnut shrimp and the sesame chicken could've fooled a carnivore performing a blind taste test! Their textures were deceptively like their naturally occurring animal counterparts. It probably helped these dishes to fry these meatless morsels in a light batter. The crispy spicy eggplant was cut into perfectly-sized strips and the sauce was spot on. Brown rice is also offered as an option, which is different from most Asian establishments.

As fans of roast duck from Chinese restaurants, my friends and I were intrigued by the pineapple duck and ordered it. Duck is difficult to replicate because of its gamey flavor and texture, so I wasn't expecting much. At first glance, it looked similar; however, at first bite, it was akin to fried tofu that was squished down. In the end, I was mostly put off by the sauce.

The establishment itself is nice and clean with very attentive service. The dishes are well-priced, since my group of four paid about $13 each (including tax and tip). I'd like to try their lunch specials and non-fried dishes too! As someone who won't convert to vegetarianism, I could be tricked into being one at Veggie House.",2013-06-06 21:30:44

BOWLING
Bowling was fun.  They had ten pins and you bowled with the little balls. I definitely think it's a great venue for a party for children and for adults.  You just have to give it a chance.  I know I wasn't too impressed when I first walked in but that soon changed once we started playing.

There are only 4 lanes and 6 people per lane.  The lanes were probably half the length and width of a typical bowling lane but it didn't stop us from having fun. They dimmed the lights and played top 40 music.  My only quip is that it got really hot in the small enclosed environment and we couldn't put our names on the screens. We had to remember what number we were.

LASER TAG
Laser tag was really fun.  There are 4 areas where you could shoot a person to gain points.  The maze was dark and had glow in the dark paint splattered everywhere.

There weren't very many different levels and the arena seemed a bit small. I guess it's good if you have a small number of people. It just wasn't very challenging.

But seriously though, they should make sure their equipment is in all working order. I had to change my gun and vest 3 times in one game b/c I couldn't shoot anyone.  Others had the same problem.

And they only displayed the record for the people who ranked in the top 10. You also had to figure out what player number you were b/c they didn't input your name.

FOOD
The food was alright. We had rice, vegetables, potatoes and some meat. It was a bit try and they probably could have used more sauce but it was still edible.

BILLARDS
They have a separate section for the private rooms to play billards.  They have 3 tables. But why don't they have a complete set of balls?  There was no 8 ball for one of the tables and some of the cues were broken.

SMELL
oh but this is the part that really got me grossed out. There is an area for people to play ball hockey. And boy did it stink. The smell was nauseating.  I don't know if it was the smell of the people playing, the arena from poor cleaning or the equipment that people wore but I had to run through that area as fast as I could otherwise I would have probably fainted.",2011-03-27 15:46:55

This was my first opportunity to try the Village Blacksmith Ale.  It's a dark (in color) beer, with a clean, refreshing, crisp taste that you don't often find in dark beers.  Even non-dark beer drinkers will like this one!  I also eyed up the selection of beer on tap, and am eager to partake in some of the other brews they carry next time I'm here.  Rogue on tap??  Yes, please!

We tried the ""pig knuckles"", which are pork ribs.  These aren't your standard dry ribs... They are saucy and MEATY! Think 2-3 times as big as a standard wing.  They are on for $0.49 on Mondays, which is a great deal.  I'd definitely recommend giving this a try if you want to go out for something other than a typical 'wing night' somewhere.

The service was attentive without being pesky.  It was a quiet night though, so I'd be interested to see if the quality is maintained on a busier Thurs/Fri/Sat night.

This weekend i went to the Punch Room for the second this year because i had such a unique experience the first time. This first time we showed up at around 6:05 pm and were informed that it would be about a 45 min wait. That was fine since our reservations for Aria across the street were not till 8. This time though i wised up and showed up at about 5:40 pm and we were seated right away. What a difference 25 minutes makes! So my advice is to show up earlier then you would normally think. They open anytime between 5:30-6 so it honestly depends on what time they end on opening. It is a large space for a place that only seats 37. Ironically I was sat in the same spot both times. This last time i was there with my parents. My mom and i decided to split the St Charles Punch which is: Port Brandy, Fresh Lemon Juice, Curacao, Sugar, Water. Let me tell you that while it is delicious and more than enough for two people, my mom and i both had 4 tea cups each, it is VERY sugary and sweet. So if you don't like that i would stay away from it. The punch of the day was the MVP and that was delicious. When you sit down they bring you a glass of the punch of the day and is a nice touch. My father got a drink that had brandy and some type of wine in it. (I can't remember the name and they have updated the menu and haven't updated their website yet) I will say all of their drinks are very liquor centered. So you have like the taste of the liquor you're ordering, but i don't normally like brandy and totally could have drank my dad's drink since the mixture of alcohol was great. We did get the pleasure of talking to Bob since we were some of the first people there. He explained some things on the menu and that was a great help. The second drink my dad got was the Boiler Mule. He loved it. I myself do not like ginger beer and couldn't even bring myself to try it. The only downside of the Punch Room is the price. It is very pricey. I would definitely say that this is a place were you go to treat yourself instead of becoming a regular.",2016-02-16 21:53:07

In terms of their pedicures, I think they do a decent job. I like coming here because they always cut my toenails so I won't get ingrown nails. The pedicure service is standard compared to other places I have been to. 

In terms of service, I do not think they have the friendliest staff. The receptionist always looks distraught every time I come in and she never smiles. Also, on most occasions I have to start the massage chair on my own and they don't really adjust the seating.

Ended up coming here after a bit of walking because we saw their new management specials! I wanted to try their fourth special, which is 1lb of fried chicken, cheese buldak (spicy fire chicken with cheese) and budaejjigae (army stew) for $34.95, but it seemed like more food than the three of us could consume at that time, so we went with their second special, which was 1lb of fried chicken, corn cheese, and toppoki (spicy rice cakes) for $24.95. We did not get popcorn, but we did see another table that did. 

The chicken was accompanied by small cubes of pickled radish, a small dish of coleslaw, and a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The chicken was crunch and juicy. Very tasty. The radish was refreshing. The coleslaw was lemony, but a tad too creamy for my liking. The cabbage was also slightly bitter. The sweet and spicy sauce was tasty, but I've had better. I'd order the chicken again though. 

The toppoki was quite tasty. It comes with rice cakes, fish cake slices, cabbage, and lots of toppoki sauce. I would have liked the sauce to soak into the rice cakes a tad more, but I didn't mind having to spoon some of the sauce into my mouth along with the rice cake too much. I actually preferred the toppoki sauce on my fried chicken more than the sauce that originally came with the chicken. At $10.95 on their regular menu, I'd order this again too.

The cheese corn came in a shallow, flat pan, and had clearly been broiled. It was very hot. I believe there was some mayo mixed into the cheese and the corn. It was also very tasty. The corn was sweet, but not peaches and cream sweet. At $5.99 on the regular menu, this is quite a decent portion as well. 

I don't know how much longer their new management special is going for, but I'd totally come again. I'm not sure about their regular chicken portions, as they come in small and large, and not in weight or pieces, so I can't say those prices are worth it, but their other food seems reasonably priced.

 Atmosphere I would rate at 3 (the smell of fried food lingering in the air just doesn't do it for me).
 Service was solid 5, our waiter was beaming with enthusiasm, was attentive and prompt. Cashier was a sweetheart and very polite. 
 Now the food- that's where everything fell short. A solid 2.
 Prime rib specials at casino coffee shops aren't a novelty, Jerry's is no exception, offering up slabs of meat ranging in size and price. 
  I went for $13.98 special 8-10 oz cut. You get garlic bread (don't eat bread, but it looked like garden variety buttered bread and my party didn't care for it), soup or salad (I went with salad minus dressing. It came out laden with cheese shavings. Doh!).
 You get a choice of rice, potatoes every which way or white rice. I wanted vegetables, so I looked through sides to see what's available, in case I could strong arm the waiter into loading my plate with broccoli instead of fries.
 No such luck. Only garden offering is listed as ""vegetable garnish"". I pictured twisted orange rind and wilted kale and deflated my hopes. 
 I inquired anyway, and waiter politely told me no vegetables were permitted to find their way to my plate in lieu of potatoes. 
 I went with fries, steak cut variety, completely unseasoned, by the taste of it. 
 The meat itself was medium rare per my request, but had more inedible gristle and fat than I've encountered in prime rib at any other coffee shop or buffet in Vegas. I had to surgically remove easily half my portion to get to edible morsels. 
 My party had steak and lobster special at $19.99 and didn't have anything outstanding to share about the meal either. 
 Sorry, Jerry's, maybe other offerings on the menu are better (like Mexican or Greek sections), but prime rib was a flop. 
 Not that I seek out coffee shop prime rib often, but Downtown Grand overs a nice cut at $9.99 with all the vegetables I want. No soup or bread, but I can deal.

Last year I went to The Used at Desert Breeze, and a guy who totally should not have been crowd surfing did, and he landed on my head, and I heard a crack in my neck, and then my jaw popped out of alignment and started clicking. NOT fun. 

With 3 trips to Dr. Reiss, all was fixed and I have not had the clicking issue since! He and his staff are extremely professional, likeable, and efficient. With the exception of the first visit (spinal scan), I haven't had a time where it has taken me more than 20 minutes in the office. He is quick, and he gets the job done, and gets you on your way. I love his philosophy of ""we are here when you need us"" as well - they have never been pushy, and I am usually able to get same-day appointments very easily. 

A couple months after the jaw issue, I got a wicked knot under my shoulder blade that if not for Dr. Reiss, I wouldn't have been able to walk let alone go back to work the very next day. Any time I roll out of bed wrong or my body is just not having a good day, I go to see him with almost magical results - I couldn't ask for a better chiropractor. 

Each time I go into the office, it feels like home or like I am seeing a long-time friend. I am so thankful that I got referred to him. The first visit he gives you a little gift bag, and if you sign up for his mailing list, he sends you other perks as well along the way. At the end of 2012 he even sent out cards to cover your co-pay! (Which I totally needed thanks to my pesky shoulder of DOOM.)

We ordered Islamic curry noodles and Chicken Pineapple Red Curry. We LOVE Islamic noodles at Salad King so we wanted to see how this restaurant would hold up. Unfortunately, this restaurant's version of Islamic noodles was eh at best. It tasted like Chinese curry noodles. Nothing special about these noodles. However, the Chicken pineapple red curry was delicious! Deep coconut and red curry flavours. The chicken was also cooked juicy and the pineapple added a nice sweet citrusy punch to the curry with rice. 

Looks like the dishes here are a hit or a miss. I think I'll try the pad Thai the next time. The service also was lacking.

The next time I went, my golfing buddies wanted to try it - so we got there on a Friday night, right before the band started..  Now none of us are country western guys, so we were there just to have a good time. One of the guys wandered off and found a TV, which the staff switched onto a football game he wanted to see. The rest of us sat and watched as the band started playing, and the dancers started dancing. 

What a great time!!  Obviously, there was a group of people that were regulars, and came just to dance.  Then there were a lot of people (like us) that just came to watch, drink, and have a good time.  There is a whole range of age groups, and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun, whether they were dancing, drinking or watching.

I hope whoever is in charge of SLS and their buffet reads into not just Yelp reviews, but any type of feedback they can access to.

Personally, I don't think it's the location that made SLS Buffet version1.0 a failure. I mean, look at the other popular buffets locations in other hotels on the strip. Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon buffet comes to mind. Isn't their location out in the boonies? Or look at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet. They, too, also have to take an escalator to get to their buffet area. All in all, it's really the  QUALITY and VARIETY of what you bring to the table (literally). 

Once entering into the buffet dining area, I noticed a change of...theming. All of a sudden....I thought I was eating at some restaurant in the cabin/woods. I thought I even saw some deer or buffalo heads mounted on the walls??? =/ What the...?! Tables looked very picnic-esque. 

Also, it felt like just because it was the last night, employees were slacking....or they simply just don't give a F%*# anymore. Case in point: soup section. Here I am....seeing two different types of chowders all dried and crusted. But my crazy ass still wanted to give it a try. Okay but um...where are the spoons?? I told the girl that was behind the counter they were out of soup spoons. She said okay and disappeared. I waited for 5-7 minutes. There was no sight of her. I'd still be there waiting if they didn't close this place down. So I drank my soup like a barbarian...basically I slurped it up. LOL! And omg...it tasted like it was STRAIGHT FROM A CAN and it was probably two days old. I was horrified.

Nothing looked fresh. They labeled some chicken to be curry chicken. I thought, great! I'm a big fan of curry. Once I got to my table, the chicken was 100%  NOT curry!!!!!! It was full on tomato sauce chicken. WTF!? Ugh...disappointed once more.


Seriously, QUALITY, QUALITY, QUALITY, SLS. I'm glad we went when they had a 2 for 1 locals special. Don't charge a general price of $40 per person for dinner when really....tourists WILL go to somewhere that's at least 3x better; even if they have to pay an additional $10.

My partner and I went last night--it was our first visit and were celebrating our anniversary--and had the best restaurant experience EVER. Very special and very memorable.


FOOD
We decided to do the 12 course tasting menu with drink pairings. The price was steep ($115 for food, $50 for drinks, $165 total per person) but absolutely worth it. I'm not going to go through and review each course we had because it would be way too much, but each and every course was simply delicious. The dishes and recipes were unique and original. Great for foodies and very chef driven. Presentation was absolutely spectacular--there is no competition.

In addition to the twelve courses, we were surprised with what's called a ""revisit"" -- we each got to choose a course that we would like to experience again. It was a wonderful surprise and something neither of us had ever heard of. 

The chef came out after completing the tasting menu. It meant a lot that he took the time to speak with us about the food and our experience. 

Highlights:
- two little balls of duck and goat cheese served on a GIANT wooden block
- beef heart tartare
- mushroom soup with the broth poured table side
- pasta with ricotta and lemon zest
- pasta with animal fat that melted and tasted like gravy
- roasted turnips with watermelon radish and salsa verde
- cranberry sorbet with yogurt and granola
- Prosecco gummies with a surprise inside...
- bread served with an edible candle - you dip your bread in it as it melts
- cappelletti spritz garnished with an Ohio-grown apple slice
- red effervescent wine


SERVICE
P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. Outstanding. Our server Sarah was the best server we have ever had. Fun, nice, personable, and most importantly, knowledgeable. The food runner was knowledgeable as well, describing every dish and explaining the ingredients and cooking techniques.


AMBIENCE
I was legitimately shocked at the size of this restaurant. It's tiny. I thought there was more seating upstairs - nope. I think there were maybe ten tables total. It's small, but cozy and intimate. Modern, classy, contemporary decor. You must check out the bathrooms - super high tech!

The presentation was good, however once you pick it up all the ingredients come out, even the meat. The bun seemed way too small for the amount of ingredients the hotdog had.
I had to scoop up the food after every bite and it was overly greasy/oily.  Not very attractive nor appetizing for a hotdog.

I got the barbacoa, Baja fish and chorizo. My girlfriend also got the Baja fish and barbacoa but got a chicken hermanos as her third taco. And side note, 3 tacos for $10 is a great deal. So I give them that. Bravo. Anyways the chorizo was ok it's a day later and I can't really remember what it tasted like lol so not memorable. My gf and I were both pleased with the barbacoa. That one was really tasty. The flavour was very stimulating, like yes this is what my tastebuds were waiting for. I couldn't finish it though. It was a very filling taco. I love fish tacos so I saved it for last but sadly it was pretty disappointing. My gf and I agreed there was something missing. Like a sauce or something? A salsa? Tomatoes in general? lol I dunno, but the slaw was not enough. The fish itself was blazing hot and juicy but the lack of sauce or something extra just made the whole taco seem dry.

With Sea Saw closing, it's definitely my favorite place for Japanese food in town and one of my very favorites regardless of type.

The last few times we'd gone, we went omakase and had a variety of of his excellent sushi and creative cooked dishes. We love the Sumibiyaki (nice to get Wagyu too) and can never get enough foie gras.  For some reason tonight, we ended up doing mostly sushi (which I also always love).  I also typically sit at the sushi bar and as I was with friends, we were at a table this night.

At Yasu, if you're not doing omakase, you've gotta start with the specials handout.  We stared there & barely left it. It's hard to resist when you know that is what the chef recommends that day.

We started with a killer red snapper carpaccio drizzled in hot sesame oil, soy sauce, and ginger. Superyum...

Then we did a series of nigiri sushi: bluefin toro, kampachi, aji, Chilean abalone, uni, live amaebi. Everything was wonderful. Super fresh. Amazing. If I had to pick favorites, would go with the uni, live amaebi and the Chilean abalone.

We also did a plate of yellowtail sashimi w/sliced jalapeno. Yummy. 

And then we finished off with a chef's special dish of seared salmon wrapped around shiso, some julienne radishes, etc. It was also topped with ponzu sauce. Wonderful dish.

FTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers, I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef. 

I read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did. 

Hand pattied, fresh burgers, flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger ""traditionalist"" I ordered the regular with bacon, lettuce, tomato's, pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much, I may go with the single next time. 

The building was busy with customers and staff, they run a tight ship. 

The prices can get a little high unless you eat smart, the frys are large, the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers, share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL 

I will go back.

I haven't golfed since I was 13 or so, so I was nervous that I'd be stuck with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.  Luckily for me, I was paired up with a couple of guys who were average at golf and understanding that I suck.  The starters got us two carts and the three of us went on with our golfing adventure a few minutes after our scheduled time.

As for the course, the course itself was well maintained.  One knock that I had was that we walked by trash on the course, but that was from the douchey golfers and isn't a sign of laziness from the staff.  There were a couple dry spots on the grass, but, hell, that happens to my front yard, too.  Let alone a huge golf course.  The greens were playing a bit fast (sh*t, I have no clue, but the golf pro told us this before we started).  Overall, not a ridiculously difficult course.  There weren't too many bunkers and traps, although bring some extra golf balls to shag in case you get close to the water traps.

Speaking of ""the drink"", the drink cart rolled by three times while we were out on the course.  And the course was packed, so that's an awesome success rate.  You can't even get that kind of service at a nightclub, let alone what you'd expect from the golf course.  And on top of that, there are awesome happy hour specials in the bar after the game.

Seems much of the lack of love comes from a perspective on price and if price  is a primary criteria for the evaluation, Phoenix Public Market probably won't feel the love tonight (yes, just like the song). However, let me, as a humble fellow Yelper, argue for the joy and wonder that is...Phoenix Public Market

Run well and lots to offer

I just went here on Wednesday night, when I visited the evening farmer's market for the first time. Just look at how many things are available, and local, in one location. You have a deli, with healthy soup, sandwich and pre-made items to go (I got me some roasted carrots to take home, and they are quite good), along with a decent selection of local items (and yes, you pay a bit more but...you are also supporting local food producers). There was also a small wine section and a selection of local Arizona wines (free tastings I guess as well, on Wednesday night). You go through another door and you have a coffee bar, and you can get to all of this from the Van Buren or Roosevelt light rail stop (I realize not everyone can ride the rail easily but I think being along the rail line is a huge plus).

Not just providing a service but an experience

Look, when you go to a place like this half the fun is feeling a part of a larger community and trying new things and it helps anchor the farmer's market where, on a Wednesday evening, there are not only local farmers but often music and a nice variety of local food trucks..it's fun!

So, once again, it depends on your criteria for evaluation but I'll argue that the Phoenix Public Market offers something unique you won't find anyplace else in Phoenix. As for those who might argue anyone who loves it has never been outside of Phoenix...I've been outside of Phoenix, a lot, and i still think it is a pretty cool place to visit. :-)",2012-02-09 23:44:48

This go around I am convinced we must frequent Beckett's Table more often.  My husband and I both ordered the short ribs because it was so good last time.  Just as good as I remember so that made me happy.  Last time we ordered the fig and pecan pie with the cream cheese and lemon zest ice cream.  This time I just wanted the ice cream.  Soooooooo good.

We sat out in the garden patio.  The heater was on making the temperature just right.  Our server was pleasant and made sure we always had bread.  That's one thing we didn't know from last visit.  Bread is given upon request so make sure you ask for some.

Service: Pretty darn good! Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the host and offered a mandatory, but free coat check (that's a rarity). There was no fuss in getting a table on the bar side of this small resto-bar. I had barely sat down when the bartender appeared before me ready to take my order (again, a rarity!). Since my date was occupied, I asked the friendly bartender turned waiter, to come back since I didn't know what said date wanted to drink. A waitress took his place a few minutes later and wasted no time in taking our order. That said, she wasn't overly friendly and I felt a little attitude. Meh. That said, throughout the evening, wait staff frequently checked in on us, and the manager stopped by to say hello. I was rather impressed with all of this attention!

Decor/People/Vibe: Pretty cool. Lots of red, dim lighting and a waterfall wall at the back. The vibe was good, though it's a pretty young crowd. For those of you who have issues with hipsters, there seemed to be a hipster convention when I was there so be warned! It was very loud, so not the ideal place if you're looking to have a conversation or go on a first date. There's a DJ from Thursday to Saturday, and I really liked his set - mainly electronic.

I didn't eat there so can't comment on the food other than to say that what I saw pass by didn't look too impressive. I'll have to try it out and update my review at a later date.",2014-02-17 00:05:50

Speaking of seating, I found the set up a little off-putting...we were seated at a two person table that butted directly against the back of a circular seating arrangement, which just so happened to contain 3-4 lovely active young children on this day.  Somehow your ability to enjoy a nice meal is a bit inhibited with a 5 year old staring at you from 1.5 feet away.  Perhaps it was our fault for not requesting one of the 50 odd other empty tables.

As other yelpsters have stated it is also a bit weird to be enjoying a $$$$ meal with Miley Cyrus cranking in the background due to the open seating overlooking/hearing the mall like Crystal Shops.  Enough nit picking though, on to the food!

Our server was very attentive and started us out promptly with ice water and tea.  Micro demerit for including a lemon in my iced tea after asking to hold the lemon, but no big deal.  Huge stars go out to the staff for keeping the beverages brimming full, a frequent problem for such an iced tea addict as myself.  The bread service came with enough to feed a small army.  Mini-loaves of sourdough, pretzel, bruschetta, and French.  

We ordered the Calamari ($15).  There was plenty for the two of us, lightly breaded and including a lemon side and a dipping sauce very similar to the Outback sauce you get with bloomin onions.  

Taking the ""go big or go home"" philosophy I decided to order the twin lobster tails ($69) AND 22 oz Ribeye ($55) for my entree.  My girlfriend ordered the sea bass ($50) and we split a side of lobster mashed potatoes ($38).  

The steak was wonderfully charred, cooked medium.   The server was nice enough to ""de-shell"" the lobster tails.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious with melted butter.  The sea bass was also excellent.  I let my date enjoy the majority of the potatoes as they were a bit soupy due to the sauce but the small portion I had did taste good.  

We got the butter cake to go, not sure on the price, it came complete with detailed instructions on how to best prepare it from our server.  Final bill with tip $325.",2014-01-06 19:07:31

I have never heard of a German pancake, until I ate here. Absolutely amazing!!

I got the triple fruit topping on the pancake and eggs scrambled. 

So imagine my dismay when my order showed up, and I had 2 eggs over easy with the lemon butter topping on the pancake. 

The staff was very apologetic when I mentioned the mistake, and within a minute I had the proper food in front of me.

Of course it was amazing.  A German Pancake is like nothing you have ever tried.  The closest I can come to describing it is  it's like a giant, more firm, crepe.  Delish.

My theatre partner and I, as part of our subscription package from the theatre, received a coupon for a coffee and dessert to follow our first performance.  We got there and ordered not regular coffees but cappuccinos.  The desserts took the form of chocolate mousse and a carrot cake, both of you've-got-to-be-kidding-that's-huge proportions.  At this point we assumed that because we seemed to have upgraded from what we assumed would be a straight-coffee-and-rice-pudding kind of offer, we were informed that the table bill, including upgrades, was zero.

We suddenly had money for single malt Scotch.

The Epicure has since moved from its original location...to right next-door from the original location.  Don't ask me why.  May have something to do with the landlord.  Whatever.

Now for the food- the food was good. It was not the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix for sure. Even among buffets it is not the best. They gave us a choice of garlic or regular naan. We went for the garlic naan and it was awesome. I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken and this beef and pea thing (I have absolutely no idea what it was called). Other things that I typically enjoy and are standard for Indian buffets-- butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer were all average. If there dinner food tasted like that, I probably wouldn't order anything listed above. The dessert here was also pretty good but standard. They had rice kheer and Gulab jamun. 

The food was a solid three stars and honestly good for $7.99. I hope they work on improving the depth of flavor that is usually found in Indian food. 

The restaurant itself also gets 3 stars. It was super clean which is awesome, but on the day we were there their AC must have been broken or really high- definitely not something you want in an AZ summer.

Aside from price, the reason this place gets 4 stars and not 3 is that the service is stellar. Our waiter was awesome and genuinely cared about our meal. The manager (I think) also came by and you could tell that he genuinely cared about the restaurant. I definitely see a lot of potential for this restaurant!",2016-08-02 00:47:33

I've been in Vegas five years now and my first week here they came to my rescue after a minor fender bender. My vehicle was undrivable due to two flat tires. They drove out to the scene with an extra spare and got me to their shop. 

In the past five years, I've tried using other garages mostly due to the location of where I was staying but for any major work I always bring my car back to the Ted Wiens on Rainbow. 

Most recently I brought my car in for some major engine repairs. They quoted me a large estimate that I approved and how nice was it that the work came in under budget? 

If you live close by and need to leave your car there overnight they do offer a ride home service(if they aren't to busy that is). They just opened a battery service/repair where you can take your electric cars in have the battery serviced and extend its life. For you tree huggers this is great news as it will save you 40-60% off of buying a whole new battery. 

Rodger, you run an awesome garage and your employees are top notch. Thank you!",2014-12-26 18:25:31

The sashimi appetizer is a lot more than we thought; it came in a bento box along with a salmon roll. It was actually pretty good (not the sake talking), however I felt that I could of gotten the same quality at almost any sushi restaurant much closer downtown. 

The main: Filet of beef teriyaki. It was also really good, cooked a little bit raw, which is just the way I like it. 

Me and my boyfriend were actually quite full from everything so definitely satisfied. If you're going on a date, make sure to get a window seat! The sunset is quite beautiful (although over buildings and highways) and sake always helps.

znaADPJ2liJ4Rs5_hGsP7w,EiP1OFgs-XGcKZux0OKWIA,0pu_8knqw4Mt9tuVD_Qhbw,3,0,0,0,"Goldsor is a Hong Kong style Western food cafe.  I have only tried the lunch specials here, and they are, in my opinion, exceptional deals.  The lunch specials are combos of your choice of entree, PLUS 1 bread roll with butter, 1 bowl of house soup and 1 cup of Hong Kong style tea/coffee. For example, chicken on rice lunch special is $6, spaghetti with black pepper beef strips lunch special is $7, etc..  Sizzling plates start from $9 but it also comes with dessert.  The portion is quite large, except for the chicken on rice which is the least expensive item.  However, I still won't complain as it is so cheap ($6).  

The food quality is a tricky aspect to rate.  The key to enjoy the food at Goldsor is to understand that this is (unapologetically) Hong Kong style Western food, not authentic Western food.  Some people may dislike the food because they don't taste like authentic Western food.  The food is rather saucy and it tastes overly strong (such as too peppery, or too salty, or too sweet, etc.); the spaghetti is not al dente; the meat is always cooked well done (please expect beef be tenderized by soda powder).  However, if you expect it to taste like Western food altered for a local Chinese clientele in Hong Kong, then the food at Goldsor is quite authentic (LOL, but I mean it) and enjoyable.  The favour is bold but not bad nor offensive; the food is saucy so it is perfect with plain white rice or a lot of pasta; the red meat is well done, because it is healthier (safer) than partially cooked meat.  Honestly, I personally like authentic Western food.  I do understand where this type of food come from; hence, I appreciate it for what it is.  

The service at Goldsor is fast and efficient.

In conclusion, the food at Goldsor is a good deal. You will be full and have leftover to take home.  It tastes okay, and you will like it if you expect it be a new type of food from another part of the world.",2012-11-19 05:42:23

It's not like they have the healthiest food in the world so deep fried chicken wings for me at least is something I have to take in as a special occasion.

I love their wings I can't lie.  They are greasy because they are buttery and I like the variety of sauces they have even though 99 times out of 100 I will end up getting the Buffalo on the hot side and even add more hot sauce to them.  

I like them breaded instead of naked because I like them crunchy and they end up just being ""bigger"".  Again not the best thing to eat but a once in a while treat. 

The deep fried pickles from here are a MUCH smaller serving size than many of the other Hooters establishments I've been to which were all in the US and even the one in Edmonton has a larger serving.  

Anyway I take it for granted I have this place so close to me but it's like one of those ""I can but I don't want to"" instead of ""I can't"" go to places.  It's nice to know they are nearby when I have the need to go but I don't very often.

Now the biggest issue of all. We didn't get all of our leftovers. We had ordered several small plates so we didn't finish all of our dinners. I had the 3-pc chicken dinner and our server decided that I only needed to take home 1 piece. I had picked at all three pieces, but did not even come close to finish my dinner. I may have eaten 1/4 of it if that. So I got 1 piece of my $20 3-piece chicken dinner to go. How does that happen? If you are boxing leftovers, put everything in the box.

The kumamotos (my fav) were sweet and not overly briny, and fresh most of all!

Their menu had plenty of delicious appetizers and side dishes to keep us satisfied while our sushi was on the way. I really liked the pepper tuna, their agedashi tofu (one of the best in Vegas), super white tuna, garlic tuna, and Cajun albacore.

However, my salmon was quite overcooked, and part of it tasted burnt.  It was definitely charred, which is a huge turn-off with fish and some meat.

The fact that the shop is situated in a historic building gives it a mystique not found in many coffee shops. The fact that it has 2 levels makes it all the more appealing. One of the really nice qualities about this place is that it is quiet. The place was probably half full of people, but everyone was talking quietly with their company and there was no loud music playing in the background. It created a truly relaxing atmosphere.

Other reasons why I find this place so great is the fact that the baristas seems to care about the coffee that they make. Take a look at the designs on top of the specialty coffee's. Also, they have a seasonal menu. Maple syrup latte; delicious. I tried a cappuccino as well and what impressed me about that drink was you could actually taste the milk in the froth.

A bowl of Cream of Mushroom Soup tasted very good but salty.  And, Sweet Potato Fries were simply excellent.

DydCZfru82z6585WkkZaEw,Jbvk_EtNS303eBobAPl6tg,tWjfgVtTD5n01Cq9dFWGsA,3,2,1,1,"Cibo offers modern Italian cuisine, with a large portion of their menu being tapas style. Now, because tapas has become quite popular in Calgary, I do have some expectations about price and quality. No problems with the quality, but I did find the price rather high. The portions are very small, some awkwardly-so for four people (mushrooms, for example).  If you plan on bringing your wallet, and take advantage of order a specific number of dishes in each category for a slight discount, it can be relatively reasonable. But again, I am comparing it to some other places that have this type of cuisine in Calgary.

I found said mushroom plate to be far too greasy, but that might be personal preference. On the other hand, while the gnocci was well crafted, I found it, too, to be fairly greasy.  The wild boar pizza was everything it was cracked up to be and was excellent. However generally, the pizza is fairly run of the mill, and does not quite stack up to its more focused counterparts such as Without Papers or Una. The desserts were interesting, but quite expensive for what you got. A Nutella calzone is certainly not novel, but was at least reasonably priced at $7.

Presentation was off-the-charts. Gorgeous plates all around. Service was beyond good. We went on Good Friday, and it was absolutely crazy in there. Our server was prompt, composed, and very friendly. She had forgot about a beer (for about 10 minutes), and I honestly wasn't concerned whatsoever. But without asking, she brought me one on the house. That's a sentiment that has become rather uncommon in Calgary and was very much appreciated. She was also very patient as the four of us deliberated over menu items. I'm sure this happens a lot given the wide selection of options.

If you enjoyed Cibo, also check out Candela!",2013-04-02 19:41:23

Joe's is situated in a unique futuristic-like building, next to a little cafe/coffee shop on the same property. Once inside Joe's, we were able to order pretty quickly despite the crowd. I had bbq chicken pizza, which was fantastic! My fiance had one of their burgers, which I had a few bites of. Both meals were very tasty, fresh, and light. Although it was a little on the spendy side, it was worth it because everything was obviously fresh and healthier than your average eatery.

We really enjoyed our lunch and checking out the grounds, and I hate to complain, but I did have 2 questions. First, the restroom set-up was strange (only 1 restroom, in which you have to wait in line for outside), and you have to go outside to get drink refills...next to the lone restroom (which was strange to me). Just a funky set-up. But otherwise, the visit was great, and we will be back for another meal and visit to their coffee shop.",2011-08-15 02:21:21

Why you say...? Well it is easy to love because first of all the Service is Amazing, and that means a lot to Yelpers like myself. There are way too many spots to visit in LV so why would we go where the service is bad? Exactly and that is why I am now a loyal and now semi regular patron of Jackson's.

The food is another reason I visit because they have a menu that is one of the best in town for a bar and grill. This last visit I had ordered the mild chicken strips appetizer because I had remembered how good it was the last time I went!

I also decided on the Jalapeno poppers to split with a friend and what a great choice that was! These were filled with cream cheese and had the best batter on them, possibly like panko fried to a golden brown! This dish also comes with a delicious sweet chili sauce which was a nice addition to the already growing mouth orgasm I was in the middle of.

I will have to try their prime rib special sometime because every time I go I am informed by other customer's that they have a very very very good prime rib din din!
I will have to try it because if I recall a customer who was sitting next to made me promise her I would try it next time lol.  I can't go back on a promise, so...lol

Ordered my sandwich, picked it up, paid for it. Head for the tables that are usually near-ish the deli. No tables. What the heck?! Ok, guess me and my 7 year old will eat in our car since we have shopping to do next door. Get to the car, open the sandwich, realize that there's no bacon (which you pay extra for) and the avocado (also paid extra) isn't pieces of avocado but rather a slightly green tint to the bread...the smallest possible amount of mashed avocado. Go inside, tell the lady I want to return my sandwich and I will just eat somewhere else. She offered to let me keep the first sandwich and make a 2nd one the right way (awesome- why this is 3 stars, not 2). I don't need two sandwiches so I just ask her to add bacon and more avocado. She does, and back to the car we go to eat when I realize there's also no mustard! Maybe it was mixed in also in the tiniest amount possible with the tiny avocado smear.

Island Flavor Express is in the Regal Colonnade plaza on Eastern and Pebble, and it's very clearly a Hawaiian restaurant given all the depictions of the islands, reggae/ska music, and typical plate lunch menu options. They also offer varying specials and some desserts, although the desserts seemed to have run out in the waning evening hours. The decor is very simple but doesn't detract from the experience. Make sure to walk to the far end of the counter to place an order, but feel free to sit down if you're not taking it to-go. They'll bring the food out to your counter (or table, if you've picked the one table).

I ordered the mixed plate ($11.25) with Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Short Ribs (+$1.00 for this particular meat). It's presented in a foam to-go box even if you're dining in. My favorite part was actually the macaroni salad, which was salted in a good way, and as creamy as you'd expect. The chicken was kinda like the ""KFC"" at Gen Korean BBQ in a not-so-good way. It has more of a dry, stringy texture than a moist, natural chicken texture, and the furikake didn't stand out as much as the sweet glaze did. Sriracha saved the day though, bestowing a little extra sweetness along with much-needed acidity and heat. I don't like having to add a condiment to make something stand out, but I'm very glad that I had the option.

As for the other parts of the dish, the white rice is cooked perfectly, and the kalbi is a great rendition with tender beef, a nice touch of ginger, and some charring. It's a little on the fatty side, but let's remember that fat = flavor, which was proven in this case. Actually, it has muted sweetness when you eat it after something as sweet as the Furikake Chicken, but I was able to taste the full flavor when I dove into my my leftovers. If I get a mixed plate again with kalbi, I'll probably have to go for something like a pork dish that's not so sweet.

My friend shared a spam musubi ($2) with me. It was a nice-sized portion, but the rice ratio was a bit high for me. Also, the seaweed was a little too mushy, which my friend pointed out may be a side-effect of the heat lamp. Although there are interesting seasonings and herbs in Island Flavor's version, I prefer the Ross J's rendition, which I'm sure is prepped to order.

I also tried my friend's oxtail soup ($10), which actually comes in a real bowl if you're dining in. Unfortunately, I can't compare it to the renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup at that one hotel downtown (because I've yet to try it), but this version tasted well-seasoned and meaty. The vegetables are a welcome sight, but watch out for the not-so-edible ginger and the inedible bay leaf. I'd consider ordering it again, especially now that we're getting soup weather daily, although I might have to make it a to-go order or otherwise bring my own soup spoon to avoid dealing with the inadequate plastic spoons.

Given that the food here is reportedly much the same as OG Island Flavor, I wasn't quite as impressed as I'd hoped. I certainly enjoyed having plenty of leftovers with the huge portions, and I'll definitely come back to try their other proteins and specials (pork chops w/ mushrooms and onions, anyone?), but I expected to experience something ""sublime"" other than the music. Maybe I'll find it in the future.",2015-11-10 07:11:52

There is no seating inside, and it can get awkward and cramped if there is a long line. They usually close off one of the doors so you can only exit and enter through the other one, which helps the line stay inside but also just crowds it more. 

Ice cream is on par with other cold stones. If you are new to the brand, you select your ice cream flavor and mix ins (candy, peanut butter, chocolate sauce, etc) and they mix it in front of you.. on a cold stone (get it?). The ice cream is pretty heavy and comes in three sizes (like it, love it, gotta have it). I can eat lots of ice cream but have only ever finished a like it from here considering it's on the heavier side of ice cream. My go to is usually the mud pie mojo (coffee ice cream, chocolate, peanut butter, nuts). Most of their pre-determined creations are good though.

The first visit, there was no one in there and one young girl, I was excited to see rolled ice cream and asked if I could film her making it and she was gracious enough to let me.

I tried the bonfire which was delicious but it took almost 30 mins to get it and to get my friend's co worker who was with me and on a break, she was like, Terry, I need to get back to work, can you get it for me and bring it over?    she works at Vons across the street.

I also ordered the almond Joy smoothie which was good but 1/2 way down it got watery...   Price wise it was good for a new experience.

Oh, my co worker friend tried Mint 2 be and said it was good.

This was in Oct of 2017, Yeah, I forgot to write a review but thats ok because I went again last week (Jan 9th, 2018)   

This time I tried the happy and I was with my sister and she tried the almond joy, I told her that I had that it was watery but maybe they improved it and she said it was not watery at all and she liked it.

:)     I loved the happy and that was all we ordered, it was faster, maybe 10 mins to get the ice cream so maybe they read the reviews and are working to tweak things so they are better for us?     :)

I do wish they had more flavors though, I have seen some pop N roll menus online where they have strawberry shortcake and potato chip and all sorts of flavors but maybe that will improve as well.

My friends and I do have a running joke with this place when we drive by, we say--Look over at Pop N roll and see if anyone is in there, I swear, each time we have been no one has been in there but us, tonight we saw 2 people in there as we drove by, lol

My coworker was raving about the blue cheese wedge for days and she convinced me I need to try it. Well, I didn't order the wedge, but I did try the blue cheese chopped salad instead. I don't know why I'm so averse to chopping up my own wedge, hah. I have to admit the salad was great. The blue cheese was tangier than most, which I love. Nothing better than blue cheese. 

My salad came with a half sandwich. I chose the prime rib dip, but I was a little disappointed that it was served on a focaccia bread instead of french bread. The meat was pretty good, but I just wasn't a fan of the bread and decided to eat around it. My coworker was just as thrilled about her wedge as before. A winner in her book again.

The service was fast and friendly and definitely a great place for a quick bite when you're limited on time. The meals were very reasonably priced as well. The lunch specials come with a soft drink and are incredibly filling for the price.",2012-02-10 05:03:17

We were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.

Make sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.

My sirloin was done perfectly to medium rare. The sides, however, were a bit lacking - the string beans were bland and the fries tasted suspiciously of the McCain variety. All in all, however, the meat was a winner - and ultimately, that's the point of eating at the Keg anyways.

Good News is that they were all accurate as Aix is the best restaurant in Charlotte that I have been to in the last 3 years. Bad news is that Aix is not closer to our home and I cannot enjoy their food as often.  

Started with a nice bottle of Bordeaux and the Charcuterie platter which featured a nice portion of pate, salami, and Prosciutto.  The best $17 you can spend in Charlotte I promise you that! We debated the menu offerings and settled on Risotto, and Bouillabaisse. Lets start with the Risotto, a creamy blend of Arborio and mushrooms which was decadently rich and perfectly cooked. The Bouillabaisse was prepared with a lobster broth to which I detected a hint of fennel and topped with mussels, clams, scallop and a perfectly pan seared filet of Corvina (drum fish).  All of the restaurant guest stared as I turned up my bowl to slurp the final drops of that broth and licked my bowl clean, well I wanted to do that but reconsidered.

During our meal we were asked if we would like to order the dark chocolate souffle for dessert as it takes 15 minutes to prepare. Wife'e eyes sparkled at the mention of Dark Chocolate so I knew the short answer was yes, order the souffle don't even ask how much it will cost just bring it on.

I know there are some haters out there about the service, and its true... some of the servers don't speak english which can be a little difficult. My best advice is to GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY -- just make sure you avoid going on the weekend or you're bound to have long waits, missing orders, and poor service! Weekdays are cheaper anyway =).
The price is a little bit steep, but if you compare it to buffets like Mandarin, you're getting a lot more bang for your buck with all the meat and seafood you're gonna be getting. After tax and tip I think its about $27 on the weekday and maybe $30 on the weekend.

The best thing about this place is that just because it's all you can eat doesn't mean they load you with fillers like rice. You can also order a wide variety of sashimi which is not limited in any way.

Highly recommended dishes:
Haikkado Scallap (not sure if its on the menu but they always have it)
Salmon Tataki
Beef Sashimi (though it comes frozen, its really delicious if you marinate it in the sauce it comes with until it softens)
Beef Spare Ribs
Green Dragon Roll

Soft Shell Crab Roll

I'm a fan of this store... It's like being a kid in a candy store for me! I mean come on who doesn't like a bargain? 

I have passed by this store several times and didn't really think twice about it, finally I made the trip on Memorial weekend. It was like a sensory overload for me hahaha, being that I don't frequent Latino markets, I was so excited to see all the goodies I could buy. As you enter the store, on the left hand side is the Panaderia where they sell all sorts of breads and pastries like Tres Leches cake, Flan and many more. Along that side as well is where you can order Tacos, Burritos etc. or pick from a whole bunch of ready to eat cooked fare. They even have chicharones! They have areas where they specialize in certain things like Tortillas, a juice bar and also pre made ceviches and cheeses.

The biggest draw for me are the meats and produce. Where else can you get chicken leg quarters for $0.49/lb? They have a ton of choices from seafood to marinated meats for all your bbq needs. Their produce is the cheapest I have seen anywhere. Yesterday I bought: 8 cucumbers for $1, nectarines and seedless grapes for $0.99/lb, Manila mangos 3 for $1, watermelon 10 lbs for $1, Pineapple $2.49, onions 2 lbs for $1 etc. They also have weekly specials that bring the prices down even lower.

We signed in our group of 5 at 3:30 and were seated at 4 on a Saturday, get there early!

My family are sort of BBQ fanatics, we had to try 3 different places in Memphis last time we were down, so seeing Black Dog rated highly on Yelp, we had to go when they came down to visit!

Most of us had some variety of beef brisket while my grandmother also got ribs and my grandfather the chicken.

We thought the brisket was tender and flavorful and not overly fatty. We tried some of the ribs too and really liked them! Very thick and meaty rather than fall-off-the bone style, which some people prefer. My grandfather said the chicken was good, but he did not like the side of cornbread that came with it. A traditional southerner, this cornbread was more muffin-style and too sweet for his preferences (I thought it was good). We also did like the twice baked casserole, French fries and sweet potato fries that were on the side, as well as the slaw that was on our sandwiches.

Service was good but at the end a little slow to take our check due to a shift change, not a big deal!

Now come my only 2 complaints. Complaint #1 would have to be that Black Dog is pretty stingy with their sauces. What came on the sandwiches was hardly anything, probably less than your average BBQ eater would like. We tried 3 different sauces I believe the hot peach, Texas and one other one, they all appeared to be good but I really cant provide an accurate taste test because we had so little of it! We also did not want to pay an extra $0.25 for extra, although my father did anyway because he's a sauce maniac! My other complaint is that the portion size was probably smaller than most BBQ places for the price. Our sandwiches were $9 and they came with one side which varied in size based on what we got. I had the casserole which was just a little cup, whereas my mom had a decent portion of sweet potato fries. I didn't leave hungry but I would probably get the combo or platter next time!

Overall Black Dog has really great food for its location and I really like how I don't have to go to Memphis to get similar quality BBQ. It's nice to know that there is a local place that is very successful and also with great food and beer to go along with it.

I'll definitely be back!",2014-10-21 19:55:02

I always heard really good things about it back when it was PH Towers from friends that were regular guests. Now I know why they liked it so much. To me Elara has the best of both worlds. It can be a low key & semi-private Las Vegas hotel resort or if you walk a little ways through the Miracle Mile shops which connect the Elara to the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, you get your standard Vegas experience. 

We stayed in a corner 2-bedroom 2 full bath suite on the 8th floor which overlooked the Elara pool. I loved the spaciousness of this suite. The kitchen was big, the living room was huge & the dining table easily sat 6-8 people. Of course, everyone knows about the drop down projector screen. It was great for watching the NBA games that weekend. It was WIDE.... I liked how we had pots, pans, utensils & dishes to cook our own breakfast in the morning. The fridge was spacious enough to hold all our groceries from Vons & Whole Foods for the weekend. The beds were comfortable. 40""+ LCD televisions in each room were pretty standard. Th pull-out sofa bed was room enough for two and the big sofa it came out of can probably sleep another 2 adults on it. The bathrooms were spacious. Double sinks in the master bath. Modern style & dark wood paneling... The showers were my favorite, especially the master bath shower. 2 big rain shower heads in a humongous space. Of course I would turn both on, having one cooler in the front & one warmer on your back. It was like a water massage.... no joke. Nice dark brown tile in the shower. Nice modern look. I really liked it... It also had this chaise lounge chair that faced the corner of the suite... all glass, tall windows that gave a 180 degree view of the strip & Harmon Ave. It was my favorite place to lounge & power nap. Never mind that it was tiger striped & orange on the side. It was the best chair!! I miss it! ha!

Master bedroom had a jacuzzi tub right outside the bathroom area near the window. It also had a separate semi-private toilet area with a bidet. Yes, I used it.. haha. It had a decent sized walk-in closet that also housed the safe. The TV in that room was on an island that house the dresser drawers.

Pool was great. More chill than your typical Vegas pool because PH guests are no longer allowed to crash. Fine by me... I can actually find a lounge chair and get in the water. Big fan of the Elara pool.

Service was friendly. Our housekeeper wanted to wash our dirty dishes but we were more than capable of washing our own plates and pans. They really try to go that extra mile at the Elara... I also liked how strict the security was at Elara as far as access to the hotel guest elevators go. I appreciate that because I don't know about you but when I'm in my room and I'm trying to sleep, I don't wanna hear any unnecessary commotion out in the hallway. Granted our suite was all the way at the end of the hall.. but still. Some quite is appreciated in hectic Las Vegas.

Valet is $15 a day. I wasn't a fan of that, so I valet'd our rental van at the Miracle Mile Shops valet. Not too many people valet there. Most go to PH valet so it's kind of like an unknown thing. All you need to do is tip... Car is brought to you in less than 1 minute. That's huge for me... They are open 24 hours Thurs-Sat, I believe... otherwise they open at 10am after closing at midnight.

The Mussels & Chorizo (crumble) is paired with fries but, I think with an order of the mussels you should be asked what you want as your side. Fries didn't cut it for me - just ask your server to sub them for brioche or sourdough bread you need something to soak up the broth. I think they're still trying to figure out the menu. Our server was pleasant, a little slow coming back to check on us, we needed that bread! Lol

The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.

Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.

I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.

My problem with Markham is the lack of diversity of food which didn't really bug me in the past, but recently, I'm finding myself getting tired of the same Chinese imitation of all other Asian cultures. These are the numerous Chinese ran thai/viet/jap restaurants that claim authenticity, but the only that is authentic is their name. Yang, was one those ayce sushi places that was far from authentic. Even their name didn't seem Japanese. I might be wrong though. My first impression was not really that good. Decor was plain, and the seat I first sat on was broken. Made me feel like I was 10 as it sunk my rear end 2 feet from the ground. Reminded me of Pai which seems to be a recurring feeling. :S 

We ordered the food and the best surprise came from the food. I have to say that I didn't have that much expectation, but after having my first taste of salmon sashimi, I was pleasantly surprised. It was glistening of freshness and quite savoury. The rolls weren't that good, but the meats were yummy. Beef short ribs(not fatty), Black Cod, Chicken kidney, Sirloin skewers, cuttle fish were all hits in my opinion. I'm still dreaming how good the sirloin were.  Beef sashimi was disappointing. Not as good as some people described it in yelp. The special scallops were ok. Nothing special. Same with eel pizza. Desserts were good. Had the red bean ice cream, mango yogurt and creme brulee. All were yummy, but I wouldn't say they are amazing.

Overall, for an ayce, Yang has some items that will make me come back over and over again. Hockey used to be my main ayce, but after having those sirloin skewers and beef short ribs, I will have to say Yang has taken over.",2015-07-11 03:53:11

I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark.

I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem. 

The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle.

Khinakli, Georgian Dumplings definitely instagram worthy for its size. Suck out the meat juice during your first bite. Khinakli is supposed to be eaten with bare hands and the top, where the pleats meet, is tough, and is not supposed to be eaten. I found that it was super filling but lacking much seasoning. 

Crepes ""Suliko"" was well seasoned and a little roll of deep fried happiness

Special of the Day: Lamb Shank ($9.90) was tender but in a soupy tomato broth. Not much flavour and seasoning is missing in action.

Khachapuri Ajarski ($10.55) was comforting when eaten fresh from the oven with load of cheese on bread but best for sharing.

We also got the butter lettuce salad andmixed greens off the regular menu and I really enjoyed the mixed greens.  And then I also tried the fava bean and corn risotto but I didn't care for it at all.  As soon as you take a bite you are overwhelmed with some sort of lemon zest.  I wasn't expecting it and I didn't think it belonged.  My friend tried it and he too was like puzzled by it.  My friends had some other stuff I can't recall.

Wing Stop, by far has some of the best wings in the state. If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. 

The wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat,  served to order piping hot.  Wing Stop offers a variety of flavors,  from Atomic to Teriyaki.  The wings at Wing Stop are crispy, moist, and of descent size.  The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious. The parmesan cheese added just the right finishing touch.  Wing Stop allows you to Mix and match your orders.  You can combine regular wings and boneless wings.  
 
In addition to wings, Wing Stop has some great side items to accompany your wings.  You have to try the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily.  If fries aren't to your tasting then maybe the homemade potato salad, cole slaw, bourbon baked beans, or fresh baked rolls are.  The rolls are fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious. 

The staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful.  There is limited seating so get there early. On this visit we got our wings to go.  If you call ahead your order will be ready for pick up when you arrive. If your craving wings give Wing Stop a try you will not be disappointed.",2014-12-05 22:00:40

Came here for ""dinner"" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro. 

Service by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny. 

We had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi. 

The pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - $5.95 - As the ""toro"" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and ""crispy"". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along $10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x 

Prime kalbi - $8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the ""prime"" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places. 

Toro Beef - $3.45 - otherwise quoted as ""Beef Brisket"". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that. 

Pork belly - $2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts. 

Overall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area. 

They have a lot of appetizers discounted during Happy Hour as well. Didn't try any though.",2014-03-20 23:28:29

Because the location is large, they have private rooms for even one large table of if you want. We opted for the two table private room so we were more comfortable as a group of 18. The head server came and introduced herself as soon as we got there, and made sure we were well looked after right up until the end of her shift, when she introduced me to the new person who would be caring for our party.

The food was delicious! I wish I had taken photos of it, but I had to care for the 3 month old pumpkin :( It was all well presented and very delicious, and even my 2.5 year old was willing to eat a lot of the dishes (she's a picky one). Because we were short a few people, we had lots of food left over, and everyone was stuffed by the time the rice and noodles came (so we took it home to enjoy the next day). 

The place is really far for me to go to on a regular basis, so I don't know how their dim sum and casual dinner is, but for a special party occasion, I would consider this place again.

Like everyone else we bought the groupon thinking we struck gold with a $10 buffet for two. Especially Mediterranean which normally has a great selection of vegetarian food for me and lots of meat for my boyfriend.  
We walked in and could instantly hear construction on the other side which was a huge turn off and it's not that the decor was tacky but it was unfinished and had that gross feeling of not wanting to touch anything. I don't know why they thought this was the perfect time to trick everyone into dining here with a groupon when they were still trying to get the place together. At least take down the Fuji Buffet signs!!

The girl who greeted us immediately stated they were having plumbing propblems and did not have fountain water and asked if bottled water was ok and that it would be no extra charge. I'm still a little confused how they were able to have fountain soda if they were having plumbing problems and unable to serve water. 

From a distance you'd think ""wow, they have a great selection of food"" but then you get closer and quickly realize it's far from impressive. Since it's a buffet and of course I wanted to get my money's worth, I filled up my plate but low and behold EVERYTHING was cold. I don't mean a couple things weren't as hot as they should be but actually cold. 

They brought pita bread that was burnt and left an awful taste in my mouth. Knowing there was nothing on the buffet I could eat I settled for watermelon which was not fresh, it was definitely last weeks produce. 

The owner gave me snide looks when she cleared our plates, I actually regret not explaining to her why I couldn't eat anything on my plate. But, honestly how could she not know? 

When the girl came back over we asked if we could just get our check for the coke he ordered, she went and asked and was told $4.00. Seriously??? You're charging me $2.00 for a 35 cent bottle of water that I had to drink because you had plumbing problems and couldn't give me tap water? I'm not trying to be cheap but I don't drink soda. 

We gave her exactly $4.00 and she handed it to the owner who again gave me dirty looks. I still left a tip but only because I'm a former server and not to commend a job well done.

I plan on contacting the health department today to inform them of this place serving food that's not at the right temperature. I can only imagine what's really going on in that kitchen!!!

My advice to everyone is to not walk foot in here. If you bought a groupon, just chalk it up to $10 down the drain and don't even bother!!",2012-07-05 15:35:52

One person ordered the fried rice - it was so strange because it came in a huge dish, all rounded out with a fried egg on top.

Seven dollars for a small bowl, eight for large. You can practically swim in the portions. The BBQ chicken and rice here is decent as well, and it pairs nicely with the seasonal vegetable in garlic oil. During the day, you may run into a highly enthusiastic waitress who is also louder than a steam whistle. She's quick to bring out your order, and refills the cup of water whenever is comes close to half empty. I said half empty because it makes more sense here...not because I'm a pessimist. 

This is a very average local restaurant, and it seems to cater to many Seneca students. The level of service declines as the time draws closer to evening. The lively waitress is replaced by a much less perky young Man, who makes sure he does no more than he is paid to. It also feels slower here at night, even when there are more tables. 
The food is consistent, never waiting more than ten minutes for your order.
The spring rolls is a bit hard to chew, I don't actually remember spring rolls being the way they are here in Vietnam. In fact, pho is completely different in Vietnam...for starters, our portions are unimaginable. But, I don't think that's something I could complain about...we must be pigs in the eyes of the Vietnamese..almost like how we look at Americans with their fast food addiction.

There's snooker tables and 8 ball tables. It seems intimidating when you first walk in, but it's friendly, and seems like a good alternative than trying to compete with people at a bar for a pool table. 

If you squint your eyes, you might be able to see the smoke clouds that used to line the ceiling. But it's nice that all that is gone. 

They have a full bar, with beers.",2012-07-09 04:33:49

Please understand when I wrote this review, not only was the staff saying Dr Tran was no longer at the practice, my insurance told me Dr Tran termed from the practice.  I actually had to go through my insurance to attempt to find out where Dr Tran was because the staff wouldn't give me any information.  If that wasn't true, I sure wish I had written down their names.

I'm guessing there was a just a bad spell of some bad employees or a confusing transition that took place.  I've moved on...

My last couple of visits with Dr Tounian have been good.  They are very understanding when I have to cancel due to work meetings popping up, life, etc.

A big plus for me is that they don't pressure me to get every service available right away.  I pay for insurance and would like to use it as much as possible.  They do offer a very comfortable environment and the TVs (though not necessary for me)  help make any wait seem miniscule.",2013-02-05 04:09:54

Needless to say I was very disappointed.  The French Toast was good, but it basically was just french toast with bananas on it, nothing special at all.  We did have a very funny waitress who made the experience good and kept refills coming, but I feel like they made a dish sound a lot fancier than it really was.

GIU5X8tx0QBZUmhDgUtzOg,aVrU8knKR3oZ9v9K8IjFbA,S-Hksc_Hh_dMEbiTWDnblQ,1,17,3,0,"My mother decided to go here with coworkers for their lunch break because the food is diverse and can suit all their dietary needs, such as gluten free, corn free, and vegetarian. This used to be a place they went to often to eat a good meal. Too bad for the owners, they have lost the business of a large department of regular customers. 

Why is this do you ask? Well the story is a very dramatic one that does not reflect kindly on the owners of this little joint. Looking at the other reviews on this page, I would say that many other customers have received the same kind of treatment. 

The owner was atrocious. I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in an industry where you serve food and you have earned a reputation, chances are you're going to get a lot of customers. If you cannot handle that, you should probably close shop or hire staff to help out in the establishment. 

Today, the owner decided to tell my mother that they were not able to serve a party of 6 or more, and if they ever wanted that, it was required that they call 24 hours in advance. No where, not on the web page or in person, is this policy displayed. It is entirely new to our knowledge. Not to mention, they were not a party, instead they were a group of coworkers who happened to go to the same place at the same time. Coincidence? Not particularly when your place of work is close by. 

Two of her coworkers were taken aback by how the owner nastily told them about this policy and decided immediately to eat elsewhere. My mother and the last three coworkers were hungry and wanted to eat immediately. Upon seeing that they were staying, the owner decided to tell them that since it was only her husband in the kitchen, the food was going to be served very slowly. It was almost as if she did not want them as customers and was trying to get them to leave. 

They decided to order anyway, there was not much time to go elsewhere after the nice long discussion with the owner. My mom was the last to order, and upon receiving the change back from her purchase, the owner decided to rip into her. She explained once more, nastily, their policy of parties. My mom explained, once again, they were not a party. They were coworkers that were coming in for lunch. 

After this, while they were sitting at the table, the food for my mom was served first. She had to get a to go box because the service was so slow. She followed the owner back to the front to get a box, to which the owner decided she was hiring my mom without pay, and asked her to take the orders back to her coworkers. Strange thing to do when you're supposed to be the server. Couldn't even do her own job. 

I don't recommend this place to anyone. My own personal experience was not good there when it was like the world was over when I didn't want cashews on my sandwich and preferred peanuts instead. They really need to work on their hospitality skills.",2015-03-11 23:58:12

The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalapeños if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had. 

At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious!

Q-76h4GFih5cGkujavm3Jg,qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,5,1,0,0,"Last month, we saw an article in the local Vegas restaurant review.  It gave it rave reviews.  So, we decided to try it out.

Since that review, we have returned 4 times!  Yes, the place is awesome.  And, we wanted to make sure that we tried all the dishes.  The food is rather unique and quality is great.

Here is our review:

1.  Service - Excellent.  I have no idea why some reviews are negative.  Every time we are there, there are usually 2-3 people waiting on us.  They properly fill our drinks, ensure that our finished plates are removed, and always ask if we need anything else.  In addition, the manager comes around and checks to see how everything is going.  Honestly, usually, services at Viet and/or Chinese restaurants are very subpar.  However, we think District One's staff and service are exceptional.

2.  Atmosphere -- it is a bar.  I think it is laid out quite nicely and not too noisy.  Only issue that I have are the steps going up to the next level.  If people don't watch their step, they can have an awful spill.  Maybe, they can install a little ramp or something... Other than that, it is fine.

3.  Food - absolutely amazing!  Here are our recommendations from our 4 visits:

a.  Appetizers -- usually, we order from the day's special.  
    
Here are the appetizers that we totally enjoyed:
 - Razor Clams -- very good, tender, and flavorful (note: this is our favorite appetizer)
 - Snails -- surprisingly, this was HUGE!  
 - Shaken Beef Salad -- is one of my favorite dishes.  Greens checked!
 - Taco Talapia
 - Roasted Squid 
    
Here are the appetizers that we think are ""okay""
 - Pork Belly cooked in coconut.. it was a little bit too ""fatty"".  :)  I enjoyed it, but the wife stayed away due to the amount of fat on the meat.  
- Pork Belly Buns (same as above)
- Scallops - I was a bit disappointed.  Scallops are usually more plump.  The sauce actually overwhelmed the scallops.
- Oxtail loco-moco something... Hawaiian style -- this was not good

b.  Entrees
- Lobster Pho -- okay.. so, it is a bit pricey.. think we paid $30.  But, oh my, this was so good and worth it.  We loved this dish.  Pho was very flavorful and one dish could be shared with 3 people!  So, it even out about $10 bucks person.  Love the presentation!!
- Lobster with Noodles.  again, this was a bit pricey -- about $70.  I think this was cooked in some tamarind sauce and served over noodles.  Personally, I thought this was good, but not great.  I rather have it served over fried rice.  
- 5 Spice Chicken w/ side of yellow rice.   Very good dish.  Love the spices and the chicken!
- Oxtail Fried Rice (unlike the Loco Moco), we enjoyed this dish. 
Note:  next time, we will try the other pho dishes...  

c.  Dessert (there is only one on the menu)
Nothing beats the Vanilla ice cream w/ peanuts served on a coconut ""meat"" shell.  It serves 2; unless, you really have a sweet tooth.  My family love this part of the meal!

Overall, we love this place.  Service is great, food is awesome, and the price is reasonable.  This is definitely now one of our favorite places.  

Cheers!",2014-10-01 15:45:29

The ingredients of both were average fresh.  The portion was average.  The pricing was middle of the road.  I have been to places where similar dishes would be cheaper or more expensive, so I suppose if you look for a deal, al carte is not the way to go here.

Reservation/Atmosphere - The hostess was very pleasant and they were prompt to seat us for our reservation. We had a table toward the back and really liked the vibe of the place. Comfortable seating.

Service - At first they gave us the sommelier as our waiter. At first I thought it was just for drinks but then he stayed to start our order. He was pushy & annoying, had to tell him to pump the brakes and let us look at the menu. Shortly later we had a regular waitress and she was very good.

Food - The food was very good but some were overpriced even by Vegas standards. The only plate(s) that I would say were not very good were the pizzas. The chicken pizza was flavorless, both the crust and toppings. The sausage has flavor but it was driven by the peppercini's they dropped on the top. Stay away from the pizzas. The Roasted Broccoli was very good but way way overpriced for what they delivered for a veggie dish. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was very good but they only give you four shrimp, again, way over priced. The Hanger Steak special was good but the marinade was over powered by citric acid. The highlight, and I'd go back just for this dish, was the Gnocchi with braised short rib. It has a ton of flavor from the short ribs & sauce. It was an outstanding dish.

It's basically a card that lets you know that Wine Bottles and Glasses are half price, Draft Beers are half price, the Plain & Simple Burger is $7, and Sides and Fries are half price.
K and I grabbed a couple seats near the bar. Our server was Botta. She was very nice, polite and attentive when needed.
K and I opted to order the Loaded Fries ($3.50hh) and the Mac & Cheese ($3.00hh). The loaded fries are topped with Applewood Smoked Bacon,
Cheese Sauce, Sour Cream & Chives. The portion size is absolutely fair and of course the happy hour pricing makes them a steal. Winner winner loaded fries dinner. 
The Mac & Cheese was equally as tasty. The noodles were cooked just right and the cheesy sauce was quite good. Portion size again was fair and the happy hour price makes this another great bargain.
K had a glass of Riesling ($3.00hh) and I had a glass of the Hey Mambo Red Blend ($4.00hh). Both our wines were fine.

The bar was super crowded and it's easy to see why. We tried a few appetizers such as their ahi poke, chimichurri sliders, calamari noodles and fish tacos. Everything was delicious! My favorites were the sliders and fish tacos. Portions are rather small - the ahi poke was like amuse bouche - but the quality of the food made up for it. Prices weren't too bad but it adds up quickly since I wanted to try pretty much everything on the happy hour menu.

The staff at the counter and in the exam room were both excellent and friendly. New faces, though.  They hire the best people!

That's amazing!  I've never had a doc with that kind of memory and I told him so. 

He skillfully conducted the exam using an ultrasound machine, showed me what was going on, and very gently gave an injection to reduce inflammation. We discussed the treatment plan moving forward and frankly, that's what I love. Sharing the plan with me is key to my recovery, right?

OK I was thinking in my head? Does Jason know pizza or does he merely think he knows pizza? Conclusion....this is one of the best pizzas I've had in a long while since my trip to Italy last year. One of my other favourite pizzas is American Flatbread in Burlington, VT.  I'd rank up there with what I'd consider some of the best pizza I've sampled. Let me explain folks.....I enjoy pizza with mega toppings. Yes....if you visit Italy you will have people squinting at you with some weird looks if you ask for an""all dressed"" (toute garnie) pizza pie. A true Napoli style pizza is very simple and the loaded pizza is more the American creation that will add extra padding below the belt line. Here (at Bottega)  as others have mentioned they keep it simple. Not crazy amounts of toppings. So I ended up going with the Capricossa. I was told by our server that this was the most loaded pizza on the menu. It was crisp yet the dough had a nice fluffiness to it also and a wonderful texture of flavour that was dancing around in my mouth. Before my pizza I had the calamari as an appetizer which is also one of my favourites when done correctly. Squid was light crispy and delicious as well. 

One note to keep in mind this is mainly a higher end pizza joint. They do have appetizers on the menu but no pasta dishes. Also some expect bring your own wine. This is not one of those places but they have a pretty well stocked bar. 

Definitely worth returning as the pizza was amazing. If you are thinking about Italian in Laval and want pizza come here rather than going to Enotecca Mozza or Portovino. For the pizza it's miles above those places.",2015-12-26 12:49:49

Menu items are priced to make AYCE a better deal. The sushi had more rice than fish. They don't have sashimi in their buffet menu and you're expected to eat all your rice. Many of the rolls were fried and/or drenched in sauce, disguising their low quality fish. Presentation was lacking. My maki rolls basically looked like kimbap with fish in it.

I had the ""Block 16"" which includes sharp cheddar. The burgers seem small compared to the gigantic versions you get at other restaurants, but they are actually the right size, I believe. The bun tasted good and didn't steal the show. The homemade potato chips were large and not over-salted. I could have eaten a larger portion of those and skipped the fries. The garlic fries were yummy but not special at all. The burger was oh, so juicy! Juicy the way my dad used to make them when I was a kid- that man is a genius in the kitchen. 

The decor of the place is pleasant, industrial chic, brightly colored but still sophisticated. The booth was comfortable. The flatscreen TVs were unobtrusive and all showed sports events. I liked that they showed a variety, including Lacrosse, instead of having all the TVs show the same channel.

The servers were friendly (although the hostess came off coldly) and added to the nice experience.  As I'm not much of a meat eater I can't say I'll be back any time soon, but I'd suggest this place to friends wanting a burger cooked nicely, in a pleasant environment.",2012-04-14 22:46:06
MYz3OmG35sx1EbEkBck4iQ,0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,4,2,0,0,"With burgers being such a polarizing topic, everyone seems to think they know they best around. So naturally everyone I know constantly recommends another place in town, half of which I dismiss because they just sound awful. Such is the case with Tommy Bahama when a contractor named David I'm working with in town mentioned it. Out of all the places people throw out there, a clothing store has not been one of them and instantly sounded awful. After much persuasion, and perhaps the offer of a free meal, I caved and went with him to check it out. Could a chain known for its clothes also sport a restaurant with a VBB-worthy burger?

The restaurant is located in Town Square which can be a pain to visit at times, but also offers great people watching in the right spots.  And Tommy's definitely has a great patio outside to do just that. The inside of the restaurant looks a lot like their clothing stores with muted colors, decorative ceiling fans and pendant lights with sea shells on them. There's also a decent sized bar which is a quick way to drop in and out for a bite even when they're busy.

I can't speak much to the menu based on my visit as David knew exactly what we were ordering and placed it right away. It is available online though, and has quite a few options. The burger selected for me was the Smokehouse Angus Burger: prime Angus, toasted brioche, roasted garlic aioli, sharp white cheddar, red onion and Nueske's bacon. Upon first bite I noticed instantly that the bun was great, almost challah-like. It was soft on the outside, grilled and crispy on the inside. The top bun had a sweet ketchup spread on it, the bottom had the garlic aioli. Both spreads were minimal and just enough for flavor without being overpowering or messy. The meat had great flavor and was cooked close to my medium-rare that was ordered. The onions were fresh and not overpowering, but I still took some off as to not hijack too much of the overall flavor. The star of this burger by far was the bacon; it was crunchy, thick and had terrific flavor.

The fries weren't awful; they had good flavor and weren't oily or stale as they have often been around town lately. I wished for a bit more, but they didn't detract from the meal as a few have. As a whole I was definitely impressed with this burger, I really wasn't expecting much coming into it and got way more than expected. And although I didn't pay for this meal (thanks David!), I would say that the $13.50 menu price might be a bit steep for this. I don't know if I would include it in my Vegas 'must have' list as this is still a bit of a chain, but if you're in Town Square and looking for a good burger you should definitely stop by.",2012-07-24 18:57:08

Noise- on a Saturday night it is very loud. I can't speak to other nights or how the noise level on the patio was but from the looks of it the patio seemed quieter and seats more spread out.  Based on other reviews I went with the expectation for a romantic night out. It was romantic but it was loud as the tables inside are close to each other and we were unfortunately seated next to an obnoxious group of four.
Ambiance - Dimly lit, seems to be a nice patio. Romantic. But close to neighbours, hard to have a personal conversation.
Food - Delicious. Well, the appetizers I really enjoyed. We got the buratta and the bone marrow. Both were delicious. I never had buratta before nor thought to roast grapes but it was creamy and mild and perfect. I thought the garlic bread with it was a bit odd combo but it's garlic bread... who doesn't love garlic bread! We also got the spaghetti and the fettuccini. Both were good but the fettuccini was Asian flavours. It was good but it wasn't what we were expecting. 
Service - staff was really nice and helpful. No complaints.

Love the atmosphere, small, and cozy, suitable for a date or with parents. Impeccable service.

The food, however, I've had better at this price. 

We started with some appetizers. The bone marrow, I expected a long, thick bone, but instead the marrow was narrow. It was also topped with braised lamb and roasted plum - which really took away from the taste of the actual bone marrow. I was a little disappointed for $14. We also got the burrata cheese, very smooth and tasty and a decent sharing plate for $15. The best deal was the bread at $4. 

For entrees, it took a really long time to get to us. Hubby got the rabbit, which he seemed to enjoy very much, and my mom got her fish which she seemed to like. The item my dad wanted that was on the website, seemed to have disappeared off the menu. He opted for the squid pasta, but he didn't want the squid ink pasta - he asked if he can have regular pasta instead , to which they agreed. 

I got the regular squid ink pasta. I don't know why this costs $22. There was 3 pieces of squid, a few pieces of chilli and pasta that was coated in squid ink. My dad's version, was also the same price, minus the squid ink pasta. 

The worst part, was that my dad's pasta was undercooked. It wasn't al dente , it was actually hard and crunchy. I sent it back to which they apologized and gave us a new one. It was better, but the texture was nothing smooth like the version that I had. I am shocked that this could happen in the restaurant of this calibre. 

Meal over all with wine was about $50-60 per person, with one dessert included, which isn't terrible - but I feel like there are better quality restaurants out there.",2014-10-01 18:05:34

The number of 5 star Yelp reviews (Jeff S included) encouraged me to get off my butt and give this place a try. I was not prepared to have my mind blown like I did.

Red Clay Cider Works has a really ""tight"", uniformly themed, streamlined tap room; it just feels warm, comfy and cohesive. You feel like you've just come off the hiking trail up in the mountains and stopped in a ""cabin like"" bar. Love the boot print logo, which is even carried through to the cider flight carriers.
 
During my visit, RCC had 4 different ciders on tap, along with a couple of local beers and wine offerings. From the moment the Cherry Bobbin' Trolls (Sour Cherry Cider) hit my taste buds, I was won over. A slight sweetness, the perfect amount of tart and a nice crisp finish. Damn this stuff is good! The South End Sweet was very tasty but a bit heavy if you're going to have more than one glass.

Because I tend to like my food a little more basic (although I'm always open to new things), I like starting out with the summer rolls as an appetizer.  The consist of  leaf lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, vermicelli,  in rice paper.  The dipping sauce is homemade, and I can really taste the difference.

I like to get the steamed chicken, which is simply  chicken breast, cilantro. cucumber slices, and ginger sauce.  If I'm in the mood for something a little spicier, I like the grilled chicken with basil.  That is  grilled chicken, sliced onions, bell peppers,  eggplant, and chili sauce and basil leaf.

For those of you with food allergies, they will custom-order anything to your needs.  The service here is very good and the prices are very reasonable.",2008-03-18 16:25:53

They gave us fresh pita bread and butter infused with all these fresh herbs. Yum! The tabbuli was fresh and the greens were crispy. The seasoning on the salad was light and delicious. They also have freshly squeezed lemonade, which I should try next time. The gyro was delicious, but not omg good. It's comparable to a lot of other gyros I have tried.

The waitress ended up getting extremely angry insisting that it was our roll. We eventually figured out which roll she was talking about apologized for not understanding, but come on. Why work at a restaurant with a ton of dirty names if you don't want to say them out loud? It wasn't our fault we thought you had a different roll!

They have a fairly good lunch selection with prices ranging from $7.95 - $11.95. The rest of the menu is quite eclectic and includes items such as spaghetti with meat sauce. Needless to say, I was a tad surprised at this one.

I was there for lunch and opted for the Teriyaki Chicken lunch special for $8.95. The dish included miso soup, salad, glass noodles, gyoza, gimbap and what looked to be, 1 1/2 chicken thighs served over sauteed onions and sweet peppers. Oh, and creamy pasta salad. (?)

The soup and salad were standard fare but I will say, the dressing on the salad was quite flavourful!

The chicken was good, a little tough and perhaps a tad over cooked but good. It was a nice change from the tenderized chicken breast that is normally served when ordering this type of meal. The gimbap, glass noodles and gyoza were all pretty standard and quite flavourful.

I don't know if it's just me but I could not connect the dots to the creamy pasta salad that was served with this meal. The flavour profile was completely different and it seemed out of place. The taste was okay but I'll admit, it confused me.

We were also served a kimchi pancake which was delicious! Not as hot as I expected but I was actually pleased about that. I would definitely get this again.

My party of 3 had the Arizona style curry, Panang Curry, and Pad Thai. 

The good:
-Panang curry
-Flavorful dishes
-Great service
-Nice ambiance (totally watched couples on first dates here)
-Nice pillows on couches

The bad:
-The rice was dry, thin, and not the kind that goes well with curry. I prefer rice that's moist, fluffy, and similar to Calrose rice.
-The Pad Thai was dry. I recall my friend saying: ""I just want to pour water over the noodles, it's that dry.""

But the meat and onions are really flavorful and I MIGHT go back again... just to make my mind up :o)  Sorry, just had to add this.

Original Review:

Stephens turn to pick again, I think?  He's been raving about this place since we met so I finally gave in.  Im not much for subs (unless its Cheeba Hut, read my review) so its never really at the top of my list for lunch.  

So we drive over, its a little shop, I've seen it before, been to the liquor store next door I think?  Anyhoodle... I had to order the cheese steak cuz I couldn't go and NOT try it right?  It was done in a couple minutes.  It was pretty big, I tried to get a halfer, but they said No Can Do.  BOO!

So yeah, it was okay... kinda just simply meat, cheese, and bread.  2 Cheese steaks, 2 waters, and a bag of chips for 17 bucks?  I prolly wont go back.  Sorry Stephen :o(

So basically its my turn to pick next time, and I've already chosen another sub place... right up the street.... on Hardy... if you know what I'm meanin...",2009-06-18 20:59:31

Shared a combination meat platter for 2. It's $14 and comes with a selection of all the specialities of the restaurant: hummus, baba ganouj, tabouleh, 4 falafels, beef/chicken shawarma, garlic paste, 4 pitas.

It was my first time at this restaurant so we asked the waitress for her suggestions. It was a good choice as the plate is large enough to share for 2. The dips all tasted great, especially the tabouleh. It was fresh, citrousy but not too herby. The chicken and beef shawarma is a little dry, but once mixed with the dips, it tasted good. The falafels are my favourite. It's crispy and hot on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 

The pitas doesn't look fresh made. It was a little dry after a couple minutes.

Also ordered the spicy chili fries and that was disappointing. The fries were soggy, dull, and the sauce and garlic paste was too salty. We didn't finish the fries.",2018-01-16 19:42:37

Since I am avid bubble tea enthusiast and love trying new places this place as was like a god send to finally be able to create your own drink without having to own a franchise or store of your own. 

After reading alot of other reviews I feel like other Yelper's are giving this place some skewed overview on what the actual business concept is suppose to be. Yes, the concept is to create your own concoction of bubble tea anyhow you wish with different kinds of flavors, powders and toppings. However, I feel that others compare this place too harshly to other bubble tea business which are obviously on a different level of taste, quality and authenticity. When people say this place make drinks tastes terrible and not strong enough or whatever, my reply is why can't y'all just enjoy the ""experience"" instead of comparing how your drink isn't up to par with other bubble teas places around the city. If your looking for a ""quality bubble tea"" then best to just go to a Chatime any other chain if you strongly feel this place isn't any good. 

Aside from all that, I actually enjoyed this place and it was pretty fun. I created myself a passion fruit, grape green tea =). The parts in picking and choosing your own flavors was really cool to see all the different flavors in syringes and lab tubes which was pretty unique and creative. The drink it self was a bit sweeter than what I normally have but the taste was there. Could really taste the grape that was mixed in with it as well as the passion fruit. Drink cost was around $5 something so average pricing. I came on a Wednesday and it was still pretty busy nearing 6 pm. Line was a bit long around 15 min wait time. Overall, fun experience and would come again to try other mixtures.",2018-03-28 16:09:36

It's like a pair of long, forgotten, but great-at-that shoes; When in season I would wear it everyday, but once the hype had passed, the shoes are stored away collecting dust, with a once-in-a-while-pull-out.

Well, Peking man is that pair of shoes. I used to come here often in my younger years (like single digit age) and the dumplings and Shanghai noodles were THE BEST. It was really the only acceptable restaurant where you could eat dumplings and white bread with condensed milk. Now, with Ding Tai Fung, Asian Legends and the variety of restaurants serving dumplings at First Markham, Peking Man has almost been forgotten. For those who have frequented here often, the dark, pink wallpaper still exists, as well as the cloth curtains collecting dust, faux plants and Christmas lights decorating the ceiling, and yes, that one Arcade machine with the motorcylce priced at an 1980's inflation rate of 25 cents. It really hasn't caught up with the times, but to its credit, it is still standing.

Food is still as good as I remember. Some of my family members came here for dinner last night and I had a craving for meat dumplings and Shanghai noodles with crunchy vegetables. However, that is the lunch menu. Dinner options are much more extensive and we had an extra large bowl of Hot and Sour Soup. Now, I normally don't like that soup, but at this place it was SO TASTY. I had 5 bowls of this jolt-in-your place liquid and the flavouring was delish.

Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings (but no meat). All good.

Reservations aren't really needed, although as soon as we came in, 3 big families came in and turned our quiet area into a zoo. 

I will always love this restaurant as a place of my childhood, but the food is great too. It's not fine dining and the service is off and on, but I hope Peking Man will stick around for my children to enjoy as well.",2011-10-15 17:55:40

That's when I made a mistake as I should of followed my instinct.  The taste was just like the the look, tasted somewhat spoiled or again, the taste of guacamole sitting out for a long time/old avocado.  The lettuce garnish was garbage, looked old and cheap.

I'm very simple - just a side part (not etched in). When I was in Miami this was not a problem, but as I have been moving around the country, getting even a simple hair cut was traumatic, lol. I had a couple of barbers that ignored instructions and do super crooked tapers, and one drew a line in the back of my head. 

Needless to say, I do not take a good barber for granted. So Figaro's looked like the type of barbershop that I was used to. As I walked in, I was greeted by Alonso who was just finishing up with a hair cut. He was polite, professional, and efficient. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes looking sharp.

They do have a kid's menu, but it's not printed. It's a laundry list of all things kids like. My kids had the mac-n-cheese and it definitely tasted like the same cheese sauce from the pretzels, though good.

Definitely the cheapest of the three I've been to -- $10 for all you can eat.  You can add $5 to your bill for nigiri, but otherwise you get a selection of 10 or so different kinds of rolls.  Rice, seaweed, and filling, very standard.  Nothing too special, but still good.  Buffet appetizers are garlic lo mein, spring rolls, and fried rice.  You can order other offerings, like special rolls, gyoza, and hibachi outside of the buffet deal.

The service was good, no complaints.  The ambiance is nice, what you'd expect out of uptown Charlotte.  All in all, the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 like the other reviews I've given is because the buffet has fewer offerings, and isn't quite as good.

Margaritas Grill just opened up about a week ago and I stopped in tonight because I was in the area and ready for a bite.  I had researched it for info and only found one review, on Urbanspoon, which said it was great and meals were priced reasonably at under $10. I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in AZ because I can get it so easily in San Diego but I'm always game to try a new place of any kind.

The menu is not extensive but has some delicious sounding choices, mostly seafood.  The prices were decidedly not under $10. Dinners were mostly $12 and up, even some of the appetizers were $12-13.  I got a dinner special that was not on the menu after my server told me about it. It was a tamales plate with rice and beans for $10. I am admittedly on somewhat of a budget since I'm just visiting, though long term, and usually just eat out once a day.  I decided to splurge a little and got a House Margarita for $5 too.

My waitress was great, very friendly and attentive, checking on me periodically to see if I needed anything.  A+ for service.

The pork tamales were really good.  They had a lime touch to them that gave them a nice tang, the meat was very tender.  They were pretty mild, which I liked, but some people might find them too bland for their taste if they like theirs spicier.  

The beans were so good I was sorry there weren't more, they disappeared too fast.  They were the thinner style so what looked like a wide portion was really a bit small since they spread out.  They would have made a fantastic bean dip.  The rice was also very good, maybe some of the best rice I've had this trip.  The amount was appropriate.  The tamales were neither huge nor puny, just average.  I would say it was a meal worth the $10.

The lettuce wasn't awful, just not cold, crisp, fresh, or seasoned in any way.  It was chopped large like a salad yet had no dressing.  There was no sauce, salsa, sour cream, guac, cilantro etc to add a little variety to the plate.

The Margarita was very good, didn't seem real strong, but I wouldn't have wanted it to be since I was driving.  It had a nice balance.

Unfortunately due to last night's experience, I'm pretty sure that will be my last visit. Upon being seated, I asked if we could order the green salsa. Apparently they don't carry that type anymore, which I was very disappointed to hear. We were not allowed to order 1 taco, but were allowed to add a taco to a taco plate...which makes no sense. Here's the kicker: that one extra taco made my $14 taco plate a $25 taco plate!! Is that not absurd? And to top off the experience, they no longer carry steak tacos, even though their menu says otherwise. Their ""steak"" tacos, which have previously been carne asada, are now shredded beef tacos...big difference. We also asked for just a little bit more cheese for our tacos, ""sure we will give you more cheese and not tell you it will be an additional $1.25 to your bill!"" I wish we were told prior to ordering the meal that their ""steak""is no longer steak and about the differences their menu contains. Sure, tourists visit the restaurant, but what about us locals?

Recently opened and suffering teething pains: Our booth lacked a floor -- coming soon, they said, so it was very uncomfortable. Bread didn't arrive until near the end of the meal -- and that meal took awhile to arrive. Waitress showed up after some time to ask if she could bring our appetizers after our dinner salads because the kitchen was running slow. We said OK. Five or 10 minutes later, she was back ... with our appetizers, not salads. 

Our favorite appetizer -- a mashed potato pizza -- lacked some of the fluffiness of the Euclid original. But one that was new to us -- artichokes stuffed with herbed cream cheese, lightly breaded with Panko crumbs and fried -- was delicious.

Mediterranean salad -- olives, sweet onions, capicolla -- tasty, too much to eat in one sitting.

I've gone here a couple times for breakfast. Not that impressed. Their standard bacon 'n eggs breakfast is your common diner variety right down to the cubed, bland, pan-fried potatoes. Pricey at $8. Tried their Huevos Rancheros, when it arrived I was so mystified as to the arrangement I had to stare at the plate of food for a good minute before I could comprehend how I was going to tackle it. The tortilla lay like a second plate with all the toppings spread out individually like side condiments. It's like the cook was too lazy to arrange it properly, which traditionally is in layers, where you can taste it all together.

There's plenty of seating which makes it popularly for large families. Expect the squeals and squawks of young children.

I used GPS to get to the convention, because I never been before. The GPS was giving me the correct directions to the entrance, but they had all of them closed, but one.. I had to circle around the block a few times to get in.. Why the hell you have so many exits and entrances and only use one? 

Parking was $4 soon as you pull in. They had no one directing traffic, so it was really hard just to get to a parking spot. You had so many cars and pedestrians in the way. I finally found a parking spot in the back of the building. 

They had two events going on at the same time. A parenting convention, which was free and also the LVL UP Expo, which wasn't. We had to pay $25 and up. There was no wall to block the different conventions. 
So get this... I bet a lot of people got in for free because all you have to do is walked through the parenting convention right into the LVL. There is not enough security to check you for your badge. That is really awful that it could of been that easy. I've seen this so many times all over Vegas though. It's never done right on the days of the shows, concerts, or conventions. There was not even a metal detector available. Just thought, you know... a lot of people with weapons walking around.. are they fake or real? Yea..anyway. 

They had some food inside and the rest were food trucks outside. The food inside was ice cream, and pretty much bar food, which was everything fried. Bathrooms were clean when I used one, so that's a big plus. 

They had free video games you could play, which was great, but you know some people don't have manners and do not care if you are waiting. They just kept hitting restart button,  after they died and continued playing, with a line behind them. 

Everyone was super friendly and allowed you to take pictures of them or with them. 

The panels were really unorganized, There was no one to guide you, to show you were lines were or answer any questions. They would tell you where you could not be, and make you move. You didn't know who worked there or who was a customer. So everyone just stood in the hallways waiting for a door to open.

Overall, my impression is that Pasta Bar was tasty but not cheap. It would be hard to get out of there for less than $20 per person. We had one glass of wine, one ""Mexican coke"" (I had to ask what it was - it's the old school sugar-cane flavored coke we used to get here in the 70s), and two pasta entrees at $15 each, and the total was $47. No dessert and no appetizer, although they give you these small tasteless bread sticks in a package gratis to snack on while waiting.  The food came out quickly, although they weren't the busiest on a Thursday night.  I had shell pasta that started with an ""O"" (can't remember the name now, but second from the bottom of the entrees menu) and sausage, and my dining companion had the gnocchi.  Both were tasty, and although I'm generally not a fan of gnocchi, it was really very good here.  

In terms of getting into the restaurant from the parking area in the back, could they make it any harder to find? I found it weird that you had to basically walk through an ASU parking lot to get to the side entrance, and then from there into the restaurant itself.

If you've always imagined finding a salon where you can go gab with some nice ladies over a manicure like in a chick-flick, this is it!  It's a pretty small spot, and I was the only customer in at the time, but there could potentially be one or two other clients.  The intimate setting is so comfortable and I really had a great time hanging out.  This is the perfect place to become a regular and establish a relationship with the staff.

Since I haven't been able to reach my toenails in a while, they needed some work.  Maria fixed them up good as new!  Although I appreciate my husband helping me paint my toes, nothing beats a professional.  My fingernails look awesome too; I opted for a gel manicure for some longevity.

We went there on all three nights we stayed at the SLS hotel. This bar is located on the way to our Lux tower, so I took the advantage to have drinks before going out each night, it seemed convenient.

It got very crowded on early Friday and Saturday nights, slow on Saturday late night and very slow on Sunday night, there was no live music on Sunday night either, but I enjoyed the quieter times much better like always. 

I tried two specialty cocktails on the menu, and decided to just stick to them, Jasmine's margarita and Passion for wine, both were very refreshing, tasty and not too strong with enough sweetness, they were perfect, got me very relaxed before or after our night out, great choices! Hubby had Vesper martini as usual, they charged different prices on Saturday and Sunday night, one was $18, one was $14, huh.... Different night or different bartender, different prices? That's interesting. 

The cocktail waitresses were very friendly and attentive, not to mention they were all eye candies too. I was surprised to see them wearing open toe shoes without stockings, never seen anything like that in Vegas, I guess SLS wanted to make everything edgy, hip and different.

My husband and I dropped in for a quick dinner the other day before grocery shopping. He can't eat much fish at all, so he ordered some gyoza and a tempura shrimp roll. He enjoyed his food, but I tasted the gyoza and it was more deep fried than pan fried, which I did not like. 

I had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie tempura. The tuna roll was fine - not bad, but not notably good. The tempura was good, and I was surprised (and pleased) to find eggplant among the veggie-ness.

2) Lots of people watching

5) Sunbathing on the cheap

2) A quieter over 21 pool
3) Staying in the water most of the time
4) Secluded spots

I came here with the Groupon on a Sunday. There wasn't much of a line to get in and there was only once a long line at the bar for the open bar drinks. Honestly, the open bar is fairly extensive; a lot of open bars in Vegas stick to specifically one type of alcohol or one drink all together. This was all well drinks. 

I've been to almost every pool party in town (I'm a local and it's free lol) so I've come to know what to expect. I think compared to Tao Beach, Azure makes a bit more sense. Both pools are TINY, so a quieter atmosphere just fits the size a little better. That and the water here is actually clear. Most of the over 21 pools don't have any free seating unless you go on a quieter weekday when it's free until they're full, and then they start bumping people.

It's a pretty small place located in the same shopping center as Lemongrass Café and the Colonade movie theater on Eastern Road.

When we walked in the lady behind the counter asked if we wanted to order dine in or to go. We decided to eat there and check the place out. It is modest, but clean. I ordered the #17 Chicken (7.95) while my friend got the #22 Meat Combo ($9.95). We were only waiting 5-10 minutes max, when she brought our food out to us! Nice!

Omg. That chicken was so scrumptious! So, so ridiculously juicy and full of flavor! The white rice and salad with vinegar oild were nice compliments, but that chicken was so frickin tasty! There was a good portion amount too! (Check out the pics)

My friends Meat combo included bulgogi with kalbi. Wow! I already know what  I'll be trying next!

IXKqZY9HpbI9gwdTIDO7_g,TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g,cxsN3mkioAXuOLKy04QpyA,3,7,2,1,"It seems that, as of late, practically every Chicago-based chain is moving their once-exclusive brands to the Phoenix area. With Lou Malnati's opening to much fanfare last summer, it comes as no surprise that Giordano's and Gino's East are also trying to claim their stake in our city. Hell, at this rate, why not just construct a replica of Wrigley Field and the Sears/Willis tower and rename our city ""Chicago Lite,"" since we seem incapable of creating a ""native flavor"" to call our own. It's kind of sad, really.

Anyway, after trying Malnati's a couple of times last summer and being mostly underwhelmed at their offerings, I was curious to see if one of their primary competitors, Giordano's, would be more to our liking. And after being open nine days, my girlfriend and I decided to give them a go-around and see how well their deep dish compares to what we're accustomed to.

It seems that a lot of initial reviews complain about poor service, which is probably the result of the location experiencing growing pains. Personally, we found no issues whatsoever with service. There was a 45 minute wait to be seated during peak hours on a Thursday evening. We pre-ordered our pizza while waiting outside, which took an additional hour once being seated. If you've ever had deep dish pizza before, you should understand that this is pretty much standard procedure and nothing to kick up a fuss over.

The layout of the restaurant, strangely enough, is very similar to Lou Malnati's - right down to the vintage-looking marquee sign. Only this one says ""EAT PIZZA"" instead of ""SAY CHEESE."" Clearly, these types of places struggle in the area of creativity. The restaurant itself is rather small. We were seated in a back hallway right next to the kitchen entrance that seemed shutoff from the rest of the restaurant. It was extremely cold and was most likely not intended to be an eating area when the place was initially constructed. It was, for lack of a better term, very weird.

Of course, I was not surprised to find the usual garlic cheesebread as a starter. However, unlike Malnati's, which serves up a long slice of frenchbread that's actually decent, Giordano's bread wasn't quite as impressive. Sliced up into small/thin pieces, the parmesan was a bit overpowering. It tasted no better than something I could obtain from any chain. Not really a good sign.

For pizza, we ordered a large deep dish with pepperoni. Served on a plate rather than a deep-dish pan, the presentation is closer to what we're familiar with. The pizza is ""stuffed,"" meaning that your toppings are baked into the middle of the pie, which is then layered with tomato sauce on top - almost like icing on a cake. After a couple of slices, which is usually all a normal person can handle in one sitting, it wasn't difficult to draw up a pretty solid opinion.

We both felt that Giordano's crust slightly exceeds Malnati's in terms of both texture and taste. It's flaky and semi-flavorful, in contrast to Malnati's crust, which is crunchy, flavorless, and typically drenched in butter on request to help compensate. The downside, however, is that we didn't feel that their actual ingredients were on par with Malnati's. The sauce and cheese just seemed pretty standard, while the pepperoni didn't really seem to pack much of a punch - almost like it wasn't even there. It's almost as if Giordano's was the polar opposite of what we experienced at Malnati's. Rather than high quality toppings with lackluster crust, we were presented with fairly decent crust and weak toppings. On the plus side, the pizza felt less ""heavy"" on the stomach and felt like something that we could probably eat more regularly than Lou's, without wreaking havoc on our digestive tracts.

Overall, I do feel that Giordano's pizza is a tad better than Malnati's, which I largely attribute to having a better crust.

When walking in no one tells you what to do, there is no servers so you have to order and pay first then you can sit down and wait till your order is done.
We did not find anyone to be overly friendly or helpful just wanted to ring you up and get the order in.
They had a special with a pizza , Garlic knots, Chicken wings and a 2 liter soda. And we would not have known unless we didn't ask if they had any specials.
We and tossed back into get them looking fresh again, were not impressed at all. The garlic knots were good with some of the sauce on them. The pizza was kinda greasy but it had a ok taste pretty generic nothing to brag about.  The wings were like pre cooked not fresh at all, small a little over cooked maybe from reheating them and nothing you would want to get on a regular basis.
Over all we sat wondering why the place was so busy.
The only thing we can think is most of the people were from out of town and wanted some in expensive food and a lot of people are Pizza fans. They have a prime spot in town easy to walk to or park near by.
Would we go back? Maybe if we wanted to give it a 2nd chance, not sure at this point since my favorite place is just up from here.
Would we recommend? If you have to have pizza you have no other choice because they are the  only place right in town.",2015-11-10 19:38:08

We ordered the queso fundido- the cheese wasn't the kind usually used in queso fundido and the chorizo tasted sweet rather than spicy. The street corn was OK- the corn was a little overcooked. The rice and beans were not good at all and the shrimp and butternut squash had only 4 small shrimp but was priced at a whopping $18.00! One would think that for that price, the tortillas would be made in house, but no, they're the same crap you get at the grocery store. The red snapper tacos were the most well received item at the table. As far as decor, the building itself is great, but the overdone Mexican kitsch is just annoying. The fake flowers in the pots on the wall in the entry could be replaced with real aloe and other succulents- that would be beautiful and actually more authentically Mexican.

The husband really wanted pollo fundido on their menu so he kept writing that on their cards and low and behold, a few months later, there it was on the menu. He likes to take credit for that one and say he is the reason they have it. Haha. I also wrote on their card that they needed new cups cause the old ones they had were looking pretty grimy and not very good. A week after writting that, I go there and there are new cups being used. Its great that they really pay attention to what their customers have to say.

There was a good amount of toppings (unlike other places where they skimp on the toppings), and the crust we all loved (especially my son who just kept asking for the crust haha). The wings sauce was good and the fry was also good however we did have a piece that seemed like it was over fried (almost too crispy and a bit dry) but 5/6 is still good in my book. Lastly, the garlic bread was probably the lowlight of the meal. The garlic sauce was good, but the bread itself seemed like it was old and dry.

I called AAWC Sunday morning and they did tell me they were booked and I could have an appt for Wednesday. I said no since I knew my buddy was in pain. Asked them what the wait would look like if I just walked in and they were honest, around 2 hours. 

My wife decided to take him but I was in constant contact with her while she was there. She told me they were very apologetic about the wait. I appreciate that, we knew the wait but it's nice to receive the acknowledgment. She was called back after they treated an emergency and handled my dog very well and kind. They did find an ear infection and got the meds we needed. Although it was around a 3 hour vet visit. I am so happy that my dog got what he needed on a busy Sunday and did not break my wallet.

Some items have been sitting out for a while, and you can't tell until it's already on your table and you dig your chopsticks into cold or stale food. That is one of my biggest turn-offs at dim sum places. They also need more carts going around when busy. Ask for hot mustard to mix with the chili oil, soy sauce, and vinegar. 

For Phoenix dim sum, my latest ranking from best to worst  is Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, Mekong, then China King. I'd go here if people didn't want to drive down to Chandler or out west to Great Wall.",2014-01-21 03:36:18

We got a booth...but it was kind of awkward to get the waiter's attention since it was walled off.

We ordered original and teriyaki sauce I believe as recommended by the waiter. There were all the different parts of the chicken like wings and thighs. I loved the original because no sauce took away from its crispy texture. I think the batter is better and less oily than other Western chain restaurants. The teriyaki...hmm...wasn't bad but I think it wasn't necessary. They also gave a small side dish of white radish to clean your palate in between but I liked it on its own too.

However, walking in here is like going to the Museum of Industrial Design where you can buy things are fairly reasonable (for this kind of stuff) prices. 

I used to love coming here and doing just that. Perusing, and making a mental note that one day, when I have lots of disposable money, I can buy things here. I used to enjoy doing just this, and daydreaming of the day - but now, no matter what I earn,I am way too practical and know that I will probably never justify something of the like. It doesn't have the same appeal anymore, and I just get upset.  

That's where the extension of Bergo Designs comes in. Up the stairs is a funkier, younger, somehow more useful, yet completely useless items can be bought. Like a phone holder that looks like a hand, or the OCD cutting board, or funny ice cub trays.  It's a great gift store - these are things that people would always want but would never buy for  themselves, and for the most part, are useful too!

Suffice it to say, that I was rather wary when my pal suggested we meet up here. More so, when I tried to find their menu online and could only find pictures of meat (this has since been remedied, and their menu is available on their website).

However, the awesome people at Charbar reached out to me via Twitter, and assured me that they would do their best to make sure I left fat and sassy. After being away from town for several weeks; I had gotten used to not only having friends that were willing to eat vegan food with me, but finding options that were great and not just entrées that had the meat removed, or sides with no sauce. 

I made a reservation on Twitter, and my friends and I were seated at a cozy table that had a great view of the dining area and open kitchen. Charbar is situated inside the Simmons building, and shares space with Sidewalk Citizen Bakery and Phil & Sebastian. On a day when it isn't hailing or snowing; you can sit on their gorgeous patio, which has a great view of Downtown and St. Patrick's Island.

Our waiter was really friendly and knew not only the menu, but the history of the building. His extensive and loving descriptions of each item made even the selections I couldn't eat, sound delicious. Because of our previous Twitter exchange, Charbar already had some amazing things they were going to prepare for me, so I just said yes to all the things. 

We started off with cocktails and wine. I had the Aerolineas: a bourbon based drink with lemon juice and earl grey syrup. It was delicately balanced and refreshing. If you check in on Yelp, you receive a free gift from the chef, which on this night; was a complimentary bowl of cancha (homemade corn nuts). They were addicting, and it was hard to stop eating them. Our appetizers came out fairly quickly. I got the pistachio and avocado bruschetta, with homemade potato chips - normally it comes with bread from Sidewalk Citizen. It was maddeningly decadent. I also got the vegetable ceviche, which had more corn nuts, cucumber curls and charred tomatoes. The chef brought these out personally, and introduced herself to us. It all made me feel ridiculously spoiled.

For dinner, they put together an entrée for me that isn't on the menu. It had quinoa, roasted almonds, beets and mint. It also came with two eggplants that had been roasted in coals and then soaked in sherry.  I don't remember what wine I had with this, but it was suggested by our waiter, and it was white and from Argentina. At first, I found the quinoa a little under seasoned, but after eating it with the eggplant; it tasted a lot better. My picky friend got an excellent cheese pizza and their beef fat French fries. My not-so-picky friend got roasted chicken that had been prepared on a Himalayan salt brick. My lady friend got their gaucho burger. My one nitpick, is that they forgot my friend's request for her burger to be sans bun; but they did apologize profusely and offer to make her a brand new one.

We were so stuffed after dinner, all we wanted was espresso (and possibly a nap). The espresso was reliably good, as they get it straight from P&S and the roaster is right in the building. It doesn't get much fresher than that. Charbar one upped themselves yet again, by giving us dessert anyway - and even having a vegan dessert. If it wasn't for the espresso, I would've happily curled up on the couch; used my jacket as a blanket & switched on the Netflix app on my phone.

Thanks for treating us so well, Charbar. Can't wait to come back and even out my farmer tan on your patio!",2015-08-11 04:28:25

Given its location I knew I would have to set a side a good day to commute here if I wanted to reward my quest with a taste of the intriguing looking cuisine that was significant of to distinct Central Asian nation.
But my quest to go there was commenced sooner that I had planned when yesterday a dining companion keenly wanted to take a look when I mentioned it to him. And so we did just that.

We were both off to a funny start when we unexpectedly discovered that the restaurant caters to both Mandarin speaking and non-Mandarin speaking customers when we were given menus with Chinese scripts in them. We both had an amusing moment when trying to figure out what each dish was while also pretending to be academic linguists in the making by trying to decipher the Chinese description. Pretend-time was cut short when I decided to ask the waiter if English menus were available, he had a brief moment of embarrassment while going to get the respective menus.
Most of the items are laid out across on a one page fold-out menu each accompanied with a picture depicting the described dish. 
There are a few noodle dishes that looked similar to one another with the beds of noodles making the distinguishing the difference, a couple of soups and stews and the more familiar kebabs with the turkic style thicker naans. 

So the two of us decided on getting the lamb kebab combo which comes with naan and an iceberg lettuce salad and also a langman noodle plate.
The kebabs came out first and having not had lamb in a while taste of the bite size pieces were dainty for me and even more so when wrapped in a piece of the naan bread. I hope that the owners start serving an Uyghur style salad at some point, it would make all the difference compared to the ice-berg salads that are served at other more distinct places.
But I definitely loved the noodles and what made it really good was the spiced-up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in. I kept alternating between the noodles and spoonfuls of the hearty liquid. The flavor in the gravy reminded me of similar flavors found in some of the curry based noodle dishes in my country so it was really enjoyable to be able to taste something familiar from the langman dish. And if naan bread was also available as a side order I would have asked for one to soak up some of that gravy, yes delicious.

But to share my experience, this is what I like about Great Clips.  I like the fact that you can check in online, and let them know that your coming.  I like the fact that they keep records on what haircut you recently had.  So by the time you get there, they know what you're looking for, at least ready for it.  Now, my haircut is pretty much simple, just a crew cut, nearly military style.  Shave the sides, finger length on top, blend it in.  Kind of simple enough to do.  Sometimes I'll take it to the bare skin, sometimes I'll take it, where its just  a clean up.  But mainly I keep it simple and just make it easy to cut.  

Now, what I don't like about some of my experiences here, is that, some of these hair dressers, who cut my hair, rather just check me in, sit me down, get it done and kick me out.  REALLY?!?!  Now, I like it when some of them actually make me feel like, they actually care.  But there are some there, that just doesn't like talking to you and want to go home.  

Now, if you need a simple haircut, yea, I'll recommend them, but don't expect much. Since it seems like there are a few that care in this place.  But $11 dollars is probably the only thing, that makes me go get a haircut at Great Clips, compared to others that charge more.",2010-12-17 01:25:59

They had my friend's (an now my) favourite wine, McManis Cab so we ordered a bottle ($55) it was sublime.

The server was friendly but somewhat inattentive. We noticed a lot of tables were being seated and having orders taken and since we arrived before them, we wanted to ensure our order was placed quickly - we were hungry!

The food was good. We ordered Fish Tostadas (($12) to start came with two so perfect to share. I ordered the buttermilk chicken burger ($17). It seemed unnecessarily hot - like it had been in a deep fryer, or had been sitting under the heat lamp too long. Was delicious and I ate it all! My friend oredered the mussels. She said they were great, but was a bit overwhelmed by the huge amount of fries on the side. I liked her fry dipping sauce, mine didn't come with one.

Unfortunately, we then went to Terminal 3 and played the hurry up and wait game yet again. When you arrive in Vegas, I don't think people like to wait to get to their hotel. I would have been better off taking Uber/Lyft at this point. So finally after we picked up more people at Terminal 3, we finally head to my hotel. Luckily, that was my their first stop.

But I was let down today when a co-worker and I took a drive for lunch.  I came in to work raving about all of the awesome food I had.  I wanted, no, needed to go back and to share in this discovery.  Upon walking in today I was hit with a strong fish smell probably from the Weeziana Gumbo, the Korean place, and the Mexican place.  Each serves fish of some sort.  I can get past the smell though.  I'm not planning on eating the fish.  But what I was planning on eating I was not able to.  Counter Cuisine was not going to open today.  That was one of my first choices for lunch.  I loved the vegetarian lasagna I had last time.  My other choice was Kaba Curry.

Wing King which does not appeal to me as I do not like wings. And Weeziana Gumbo which is very good but has limited options.  After a few minutes of deliberation with my co-worker, we decided to save Campus Commons for another day.  I still want to try it again but it is hard to tell who is going to be open and when.

They had a great little space in the back for all of us. It is a small to medium restaurant, I would call ahead if you have more than a few people in your party.

She finished it and commented that she was enjoying it, and between her and her infant, they ate it all. The cheesy bread was just that, ok bread with a lot of margarine (it just did not seem like butter to me! Or Olive oil for that matter) and a good amount of mozzarella cheese. The cheesy bread has quite a bit of room to improve. Good quality bread, butter or olive oil, and herbs (dried or fresh) would do a lot for the dish.  The antipasta salad was ok. The iceburg lettuce was shredded, which makes me think they are using this lettuce for both the sandwiches and the salads. While I appreciate the business side of that, I found the somewhat dry, shredded lettuce just didn't work to make the salad satisfying. The other parts of the salad, the meats, olives, a few sparse veggies were good, but not plentiful. Overall, we loved the service and the pizza.

I shop here about once a week and can get 95% of my groceries here because they have everything. They have a great selection of organic produce, canned goods and specialty items. Also, their plantain chips? THE BOMB. My boyfriend and I usually open up a bag and snack while we shop, they're addicting. They have a great beer and wine selection and you can usually sample some wines for ten cents! and the prices? So cheap! Everything is super reasonable and much cheaper then shopping at other stores.

I know some people can't stand TJ's because it gets really crowded, especially on the weekends. Sometimes its a madhouse.I try to go at night during the week, but if I go during the weekend I just prepare myself for the crowd and its usually not so bad. It really helps is you make a grocery list and stay organized, so you're not wandering up and down aisles trying to find things. 

The only negative thing I can say is that they do run out of things, which can be annoying. They've been out of coconut sugar, chia seeds, organic black beans and sweet potatoes....all pretty common grocery items. It's not a big deal, but it sucks that I have to go pay more for those items elsewhere when I know I could have gotten them for cheaper if TJ's had them in stock!

Sushi Muramoto and King Muramoto have different menus, and we came here for the lunch specials. Our friends specifically mentioned they wanted their food as soon as possible, while late-comers like my boyfriend and I and two other friends could eat our food at a leisurely pace. It was essential because we had a movie at the Wisconsin Film Fest and wanted to get the best seats possible.

The waiter acknowledged the request, yet after 30 minutes of wait time, the entrees have not arrived. Apparently, our request was ignored, and all entrees were served together, alongside with those for the latecomers.

The only meal that my boyfriend and I had for Sunday, and also till 4 days later (today). We shared the Black Cod Miso and the Hanger Steak. The afternoon following the meal, I experienced severe food poisoning symptoms and so did my boyfriend, the same night. I do not think it was the hanger steak as several of our other friends ordered that dish. However, one of my other friends who had the Black Cod Miso experienced mild food poisoning symptoms like being bloated and loss of appetite.

Most really nice places offer brunches on holidays that are so expensive. Not Ocean Prime....Their brunch is quality and very reasonable. 

We arrived and were greeted by a few people at the hostess desk that welcomed us and took us to our table. I noticed a reserved sign on a table that read ""Reserved For Angelina Jolie"" and for a minute I thought gosh, Is Angelina Jolie on her way to Phoenix?....NO it was sort of a joke. My table had a sign that read ""Reserved For Bette Davis.""....so funny LOL. 

Our table was nice and set with crisp linen, sparkling glassware and shiny silverware. The dining room is sort of classic and rich with leather and dark wood. But they also have modern bright features that round things out.

I ordered the Blackened Salmon Salad. I got a good sized piece of nicely spiced and crisp salmon cooked to a perfect medium. The fish seemed like it was very fresh and had a great texture that just melted in my mouth. On the side was a fresh mixed green salad adorned with creamy goat cheese, cantaloupe, candied walnuts and sweet grapes. It was just the right size for brunch.

My husband had the Crab Cakes with Poached Eggs topped with Hollandaise Sauce. His plate also came with fresh fruit and a side salad. The grilled crab cakes were very good...much better than from most places.....It's very hard to get a good crab cake outside of Baltimore. The rest of his plate was good but not perfect....The plate sat under a heat lamp and the salad and fruit were warm. Eggs and sauce seemed slightly cooked by the lamp. We might have told our waiter if he checked on us but he didn't. 

We also shared the side of Black Truffle Mac and Cheese. It was a great portion for sharing. It had nicely prepared pasta in a creamy, cheesy sauce with pieces of real truffle. We both thought if was excellent for the price point.

As we left several crew members thanked us for dining there and wished us a good day.",2018-05-15 12:39:58

xqd5KmaYvD4u7mJVTXIggQ,ujlGmFFeuS1Jdt6uda7pxw,PjlodjmfABi5dW-iek2P-w,3,8,6,4,"Honestly, we have a good mass transit system considering our city's horrifically wasteful and inefficient land use patterns. Unfortunately, we elect(ed) politicians who allow land use patterns that are not conducive to mass transit to be built. Further, we, the citizens of Calgary make the problem worse by not demanding to live in the inner city, but instead settling for the suburbs en masse. This makes it difficult to keep taxes down AND offer a good system. 

Now, about 30 years and thousands of acres too late, the dolts in city hall are beginning to realize that denser urban design is not only beneficially economically and socially long term, but that the mentality of:  ""well, duh, we're not New York City"" is just as asinine of a argument against sustainable physical design as it sounds. 

This being said, it's truly sad that the Parking Authority has more sway at city hall than our own mass transit authority. Working at the airport, I am perplexed that Calgary Transit never publicly confronted the Airport Authority as to why mass transit was not--and is not--included on their land use master plan (it's because of our very powerful taxi lobby and the $1.50 per cab that the airport gets). Worse, the transit authority itself has done little to provide denser service to non-central-white-collar-business-districts such as industrial parks, satellite commercial parks, and the airport. Sure, you don't have to build a train to the airport (and that will be impossible with the new runway and taxiways), you can just be like Boston or Seattle and run an express bus from the airport to a central transit hub every 5-15 minutes. Sorry, but a 30 minute interval (and that's on a good day) during weekday daytime off-peak is not an acceptable wait time to the airport in a loud, dirty, cold bus shelter.

Our transit system sucks in comparison to systems that exist in denser cities because of the same reason it is successful: it's cost efficient (CalTrans breaks even EVERY year, which is INCREDIBLE for any wing of the Canadian bureaucracy), and they will only establish routes once it is clear that demand prevails. Look at the Toronto Transit Commission: they run street cars every 8 minutes at all times, but they lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year and their solution to the problem is just to ask for more money, and that's after they raise fares to $3/ride (no stopovers) or $121 a month (yes, $121). But hey, there's busses that run subway routes every twenty minutes when the subway isn't running at night! I don't know what's better...

That being said, I froze my ass off waiting 14 minutes during weekday am rush hour for an outbound train. During this, I came up with some possible mottos Calgary Transit can use, as long as they pay me for the rights:
""We appreciate your patience""
""We're trying our best""
""We apologize for the inconvenience""
""It's something""
""Coming soon!""

Oh, and if you think CalTran operators are rude (they're not), ride the MUNI in San Francisco. Even the cable car guys are pricks to the tourists. I think they're charming, but many others think otherwise.",2009-11-21 13:32:18

However, once in a while I've just HAD to go here, and all in all it's not been a terrible experience.

I am personally amazed - AMAZED - at how easy it is to get in and out of this place. I've heard other people have had problems, but I always breeze in and out of the garden, then to avoid the parking garage traffic I sit and have one drink and then all is clear.  I swear some people just teleport home once they're done.

The sound is OK.  The seating's OK.  The place is pretty giant, so if you're up in the nosebleeds I really wonder why you're there at all; the one show I saw from there was almost frustrating.

Once, for a certain performer I was totally gakked out for but am not going to admit, I figured how to sneak backstage and met them.  Getting to their backstage is RIDICULOUSLY easy.  I ain't gonna tell you how, but I did it on my own at 18; if you use your noodle a bit it becomes pretty obvious.

Once, I went to see Paul McCartney here with my mother (oh my GAWD - do you KNOW how much I love the Beatles??) and Ozzy Osbourne gave me 7th row seats, swear to some evil dark god (since it's Ozzy).  That was the best show I've ever seen.  But seriously, I attribute that to Paul and Ozzy and not so much the MGM.

However, the reason for only a 3 star rating is 3 fold. With my To Go order of Cashew Chicken, Medium and Pad Thai Chicken, Medium, the orders were messed up royally. Perhaps, it was because the place was very busy (over 30 people at 12:30 on Sunday afternoon). But, the waitress confirmed my order and I took it home. But, when I got home and heated up the entrees, I had 3 Surprises. The Cashew Chicken had only 3 Cashews in it; the Pad Thai was Chicken and Shrimp (only 2; and it's a good thing that we are not allergic to sea food). Now, my family and I like Spicy, but knowing Thai cooking the way I do, I was like, ""WHOA!.  If this was Medium, what on Earth would they consider Spicy?""

She raved about the special promotion and discount they were giving me but did not ever mention a $99 fee if you cancelled service before end of contract. When the service tech came out and took a look around my house and verified that my pest problem was not bad and what we need to do. He had the contract ready for me to sign. I read it over and saw the cancellation fee. I called Karen back to question it and she stated that it was not a contract but an agreement and that she stated the cancellation fee on initial conversation and that all calls were recorded.

For the dinner price, it would depend on how much you like Asian food.  I was full after a plate and a half... a big reason I'm not such a fan of buffets in the first place.

The GOOD:
* Mongolian BBQ -- Made to order noodles?  Yes, please!!!  The ingredients were very fresh -- no brown tips on the broccoli -- and you get a whole chicken breast, not strange cut up pieces.  I even got a little show from the cook like you get at a Japanese Steakhouse. 
* Shrimp and cocktail sauce - the shrimp were fresh and tasteful, and their cocktail sauce is delicious!
* Desserts - They give you WHOLE peeled, fresh oranges and kiwi.  Delicious and so healthy!  Yum!  I also liked the almond cookies.
* The service is excellent -- friendly and attentive.  I was offered a several drink refills, and my plates were cleaned whenever I pushed them to the side.
* The interior is actually pretty nice for a buffet.  The chairs and floor are this fake leather.  It looks kinda cool.  It's very clean.

The OK:
* The Asian ""specialties"": It's typical Chinese food.  They were all pretty average.  They had General Tso, a Beef and Broccoli, you get the point...

The not-so-GOOD:
* Sushi -- I've got a pretty high bar for sushi after living in San Francisco, NY, and Chicago so although I had to try a few pieces, I was very unimpressed with this sushi.  It has no flavor.  It doesn't make you sick afterward or anything.  It just doesn't taste good.  I noticed that they put tempura in the spicy tuna rolls presumably to make them taste better.  They didn't.

There are many reviews on here that are jacked. 

The place is huge, lots of tables. All those complaining about it being small and cramped were in a different place. 

The staff wasn't warm or friendly, but they were efficient and courteous. Nothing resembling rude. Those people may have been in a different place, too. 

My seafood soup was incredible! Huge portion, lots of goodies in it, enough for two meals. I also got fresh coconut water, right out of the coconut. Yum! The soup broth was so good that I wanted to come back the next day for more. Those complaining about it being salty were in a different place. I don't like salty. This was perfect. 

The floors and tables were clean. Bathroom needs some help, but wasn't dirty. Still, no bugs or rats or Health Department warnings. Don't know what place that was. 

My only major complaint is the cash-only situation. Who carries cash? I'll be honest, that is the single reason I hadn't eaten there before, and the one that prevents me from coming back more often, because getting cash is a pain in the neck. Yes, they have a cash machine right there in the restaurant, but the fees from the machine and then your bank end up costing more than your meal.

I have long wanted to find a Vietnamese restaurant that tastes like how things were 2 decades ago.  I also like the aroma of fish sauce hitting my nostrils before I am seated.  Golden Turtle delivers on both accounts.

I ordered a BBQ Chicken on Rice, and my BF ordered a Red Curry Fish with Bamboo and Eggplant.  The BBQ chicken was actually grilled lemongrass chicken.  The Chinese name more accurately describes this entree.  The lemongrass chicken tasted *perfect*.  It was tender, sweet and with an aroma of lemongrass.  I wish there was more chicken, because there was about 2 bowls of white rice that came with the chicken.  BTW, the fish sauce that came along was undiluted, which was exactly how it is supposed to be and how I like it.

The Red Curry Fish was tasty.  I cannot attest to its Thai authenticity but it tasted bold and creamy.  There were lots of bamboo and eggplant, but it could have more fish.  It went so well with white rice that too bad you must order the rice separately.  BF solved this problem by eating half of my rice.  (And with this help, there still was just enough chicken to go with the reminding rice).

Both my BF and I were pleasantly surprised by the services.  The waiters were very polite and well spoken.  They didn't just place the plates onto the table; they tried to present the plates nice and neat in front of us.  And after we had finished, a waiter asked us how we found the food and if we liked it.  My BF and I were like ""wow"".

If only the portion of the protein (fish and chicken) was more in proportion with the overall entree and the rice, the food would be 4 stars on its own easily.

As it is now, food 3.5 stars.  Services add 0.5 stars.  Overall 4 stars.",2014-12-28 05:55:16

The ramyun itself was just ok. The broth was spicy, and the noodles were just...noodles. Pork belly seemed dry and none of that fatty goodness. Overall, the ramyun cost about $15, which did not seem worth the money.

My friend ordered two eggs over turkey hash from one of the best breakfast menus around. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash was superb. I may order it again myself.

I guess I was expecting to smell either baked bread, or the spices from the different hot sandwiches they offer, or something.

I got my sandwich and I headed back to work since I was running behind now.

I was very disappointed. The sandwich was absolutely flavorless! No tomato, or lettuce, no mayo, or malt vinegar, nothing was on it. It was just cooked chopped meat, with a little bit of onions, a few mushrooms pieces, and some cheese. This was not worth the money, not even close. I am so disappointed I wasted my money...

I definitely won't be back, I didn't think it was worth the $8 bucks by any means. I would suggest going to Forefather's Cheese Steaks off of Priest and Warner.

-Grilled Squid Appetizer: Very flavorful and huge portions! Perfect amount of chewiness and flavor. Comes with a full squid (size of two hands); tentacles included!
-Pork Belly Steamed Bun Sliders: So yummy! I wish there was more. They offer two different kinds of buns--crispy or steamed. We opted for the steamed and it was magnificent. Comes with three sliders. Pork belly was flavorful and melted in your mouth. They also have an option to add one more slider if you are planning to share this dish amongst an even number of people.
-Oxtail Pho: Very plain, but still very good. The broth for me was a bit too salty, but the oxtail melted right off the bone. The chunks are gigantic, but the texture of the oxtail makes it super easy to eat.

They start you with some corn, tomato and pepper salsa and chips which is not too spicy but is always fresh tasting. Today we augmented with some queso that was hot, cheesy and tasty with a peppery finish.

The atmosphere is funky like most NoDa places and we've always found the service to be fast and friendly. No pretentious hipster vibe here as everyone seems to be deemed cool enough to be treated well by the staff. Always a mix of clientele from the tattooed and pierced to the khaki'd and buttoned down.

The pizzas are not pies at all, but rather small and on a thin crispy crust.

I went in for lunch today and Bobby himself was there to introduce us to the place.  We started off with some very southern sweet tea.  Bobby explained the menu and had this passion that was so obvious it made you want everything(as if I didn't already), so we ordered too much :)

We started with the fried pickles and deviled eggs.  The fried pickles were perfect in every way shape and form.  Crispy, perfectly seasoned, accompanied with homemade ranch.  The deviled eggs were flavorful and perfectly cooked.

Now for the entrees.  We had a brisket sandwich, a side of fries, smothered greens and a side of wings with spicy buffalo sauce.  The brisket was tender and smoky and I liked the bun it was on, the bbq sauce was great, but the coleslaw might have been the weak point being under seasoned and there was no salt on any of the tables.  The fries were typical BBQ joint fries, not as crispy as bistro fries but flavorful and served with a great sauce.  The collard greens with pork were perfect.  Not overcooked, a little crunchy still with tons of flavor.  The wings were great, crunchy without breading which is always a feat, large and tender.  The sauce we got was a spicy buffalo sauce, I would say it isn't really spicy but very tasty.

It was a great meal, we are a bit full at the moment but we will definitely go back.  I want to try the chicken and waffles!  I have to say that the enthusiasm for ones business is so nice to watch.  He really cares about what he does there and you can taste the passion.",2012-08-23 23:07:36

There is one major thing, though, that the Pho enthusiast would take major exception to, and should know before entering.  They don't put bottles of hoisin and Sriracha on the table. They insist on bringing you tiny sauce ramekins instead with your pho.  And if you want more, you have to ask for them...one...by...one, which the server brings to you each time more begrudgingly and grouchily than the next.   I understand that perhaps the restaurant is going for a ""nicer"" look and thus doesn't want to crowd the table with condiment bottles, but it comes off as miserly portion-control (You shouldn't be trying to save money on Sriracha and plum sauce; these are MAIN staples of Pho, like ketchup to a french fry).

If you have to try something on, you are on your own. Eventually another customer left and didn't lock her door so I was able to try on the one item I wanted. 

Then when I took my item to the register it rang up full price when I picked it up off a small rack with a big SALE sign. So I politely asked why it rang up full price. He just said ""it's not on sale.""  So I explained again that it was from a small rack that had a big sign ""SALE.""  He didn't even offer to check. He responded that doesn't mean the whole rack is on sale. I said it is pretty deceptive to put merchandise on the small rack with a big SALE sign if it is not on sale.

I LOVE this location and proximity to my Summerlin home. 

I HATE how that this place is always so busy. 

I LOVE that my car always looks really good upon my departure. 

I HATE that it takes a solid 30 minutes-45 minutes of wait time in order to get your car washed.

I LOVE that they have a frequent washer program, free of charge.

Did I mention I HATE the wait time?  

I LOVE that this place is consistent with the vacuum, wash and dry and the end service is always the same.  They have options for shampooing floor mats, wax, etc....they have a lot of options when it comes to the details of keeping your car clean.  

I HATE the company motto and that every employee is always asking me to ""Have a Fabulous Day!""

I LOVE that there is a lot of places to sit and wait (inside and out) and they have a wide variety of options for drinks and snacks (even some nutritious, although you have to seek them out) in their retail store. 

I HATE that the windshield repair guy is always checking on my windshield and I feel the pressure of his presence as he is walking over to my car for an inspection.  I know there is a valid service there, but I will never be able to properly shake the ""sales pitch"" feel I get around them. 

I love-hate that Fabulous Freddy's does have a corner on the market in this area of town, I don't have to think about it too much and I have to swallow that this is my only option.  The ""Love"" actually outweighs the ""Hate"" for me and thus the Yelp rating of 4 in my mind.  In the end, they do do a good job with cleaning my car.

The layout - I read a few reviews on people complaining about the layout. Really? Do you think there's a better way of setting up a restaurant that doesn't have that much of an option? This is such an odd thing to complain about. If you can fit your ass into a place to eat, and you're not on top of each other, you'll be fine. I assure you. 

The food was good. It is like a few other places around the area. Not really sticking to a certain type of cuisine. We had-

Bangers and mash: I really don't like sausage. And I mean that all the way around. ;)

I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.

When the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.

Chicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.

Tomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.

Parmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.

Afterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).

Overall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great.",2015-03-23 02:16:25

The service was terrible, the food was meh, and did I mention the service was terrible? A waiter stood around playing on his phone and watching TV while we sat, waiting far too long for our meals, with empty glasses in front of us. At one point the manager came by, filled our glasses, and said something to the waiter. Then, later, the manager came by again and looked at our empty glasses, then followed the waiter over and watched while he refilled it. Why did we need multiple refills? Because it took so freakin' long to get the food out, that's why. Meanwhile, we're munching on the complimentary salty chickpea things they gave us.

There were only two tables to wait on. We generally only go for lunch, so maybe dinner service is always this bad and that's why there were no customers in the place at 7 pm.  An unfashionable hour to be sure, but it's the west side. 

Oh, and the best table in the place was taken - by the waiter's charging cell phone. Apparently that table is next to a convenient outlet.

This place is not the best restaurant in Toronto, but definitely not the worst either.  Looking closer at the reviews, it seems lots of reviewers with 1 or few reviews - maybe revenge reviews from a competitor? That would be a pretty crappy behavior - Yelp is not the place to settle petty competition.

This place is the former Vespa Pizzeria, and it looks much better after Paramount renovated it, very upscale look inside.  The service is a bit hectic around the Liberty Village lunch hour, but not bad at all, which makes me doubt all these reviewers below who gave it 1* for bad service.

The menu is quite extensive and has lots of variations on shish kebabs and shawarma.  The food is good, the portions are big, and the owner is always on-hand, running around and being friendly to all customers.  

My order was mistaken, they brought me Mixed Shawarma, while I actually ordered Mixed Grill, so the owner made sure I got my plate and then he also packed the wrong plate to go, as a freebie for me.  That was mighty nice, especially since it is the first time I step into the place, or see the guy.

The pricing is a bit on the high side ($23 for Mixed Grill), but for a full dining experience in LV it is not that bad.

Sweet Pea and our two neighbors rsvp'd yes right away when the invitation for a free brunch came in our mailboxes, although the invitation was scant on details, and we were not sure what to expect.  Was there a price limit?  Drinks included?  We didn't know, we didn't really care.  Always up to discover a new restaurant downtown, we took the rail and settled in to a large, cushy booth for an adventure.
This place is the place I think will give Hanny's a run for it's money.  It's not as chic as Hanny's, no.  It's got that open kitchen, central bar kind of big city vibe.  This is a restaurant that you could be at in Seattle, San Francisco, New York.  The cool thing about Fox Restaurants is that they each do have their own unique concept, and this is no different.
We all ordered our drinks and perused the menu.  Breakfast served all day, from french toast (they gave us a taste and it's incredible- I think it's coated in Panko breadcrumbs) to egg sandwiches to oatmeal.  Lunches with your burgers, sandwiches, salads.  Dinner, with your meats and your pastas.  
Let's start with the drinks: a bloody Maria with tequila instead of vodka (I'm a sucker for hot), a Bellini, a regular Bloody Mary, and a Bacon Bloody.  I loved my Maria.  You could taste the tequila in a good way, and it was spicy enough for even me.  Sweet Pea was so-so on his regular bloody although I tasted it and found it to be standard, but good standard.  K-dawg loved her Bellini which I tasted and found to be just eh, although pretty large.  And B$ liked his bacon bloody but found it to be too much bacon flavor for even him, and said he wouldn't be ordering it again.
Now, the food.  We started off with the pretzels and fondue (incredible- do order) and cheese with bread and jam, which was your standard cheese plate although the jam was fresh and delicious.  I got the egg sandwich with egg, cheese, and avocado sans the bacon on an onion bun, and regrettably, they brought it out the first time with bacon.  I chalk that up to pre-opening kinks.  K-dawg ordered the turkey reuben which I must say looked great and she absolutely raved over, with fries which I tasted and were fresh cut and tasty.  B$ had some sort of burrito which he deemed bland even after showering in tabasco.  Sweet Pea had the eggs and bacon, which he said was ""standard"".  Now, he later also had some sort of fruit and yogurt which he raved over.  
There were some additional kinks with the meal, from forgotten condiments, to forgotten side dishes, etc.  However, the manager came out and said she'd heard about the issues and gave us coupons for buy one, get one free brunch.  Which is pretty cool since it was all free.  You put up with some level of issue when you're getting a free meal, after all!  And let's get to that.  I said we didn't know what to expect.  Well, you know what?  After several alcoholic drinks and at least one bfast plus appetizers for each of us, the ENTIRE BILL WAS FREE.  $120 worth.  OK Butcher, you've got me.

First the decor - this place is beautiful. Floor to ceiling windows, rustic and beautiful light fixtures, lovely place settings, every detail in this restaurant works perfectly to create a memorable meal. On a Saturday night on the February long weekend, it was bustling but we felt 100% catered to and cared for by every member of the staff. It was quite amazing how it seems every person that worked there took care of us - whether bringing food, clearing plates, folding napkins when guests went to the (ever elusive and always appreciated upstairs Toronto) bathroom, clearing crumbs, bringing drinks, we were never neglected. 

We had a party of 6 so had an excellent chance to try a good portion of the menu. Having a home in Spain I have had a lot of Spanish food and I must say this is the most authentic Spanish food I've had in Toronto. From pan con tomate con manchego, artichoke and manchego appetizer, to the clam pasta I had that blew my mind, to the lobster a la plancha, I appreciated the authenticity of the food. My carnivore friends drooled (and ordered a second round) of the proscuitto wrapped dates, shared chorizo, serrano ham, olives, side rapini, side asparagus, and several other dishes I can't recall. Everyone was pleased and impressed with the food.

I had had the pleasure of meeting the sommelier Derek at the Midfield a couple of weeks prior so knew I was in good hands for wine choice. A very dense list with excellent descriptions, I put myself in his hands and loved both wines we had as did my companions. There is something for everyone in this list even without Derek's masterful recommendations.

While i have no criticisms of this place, my friends and I had a conversation afterwards about whether we would return and the consensus was probably not. It is an experience worth having and we're all glad we went but it's quite expensive and seems more appropriate for a special occasion than a new favourite but its definitely worth that visit. I think I'd like to take my mom there as I think she'd love its Spanish familiarity but beyond that I think it'll be more of a happy memory.",2014-03-05 18:12:56

My review gets 3 stars but I really should give it 2... I am being generous.

I will start....as always, by saying I am the pickiest person I know and although food is a preference.... I know what I like! 

We went on a Saturday around noon and it was packed!  There were several larger tables open but nothing to accomodate 2 people so being the outgoing person I am, I invited a couple people to join us so we could take a larger table.

What a great way to meet people, and they were great tablemates!

The food is good, I only have a couple CONS....

No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty!

The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy.

The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care.

If you enjoy Dim Sum...I reccomend you give it a shot and see what you think.

I saw that they had opened up a new spot here downtown, and I decided to swing by before my Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game.  

I arrived a little after 4:30 and was one of two people in the place (other guy was sitting at the bar).  There were a ton of workers hanging out prepping the restaurant and getting everything ready for the dinner rush (if there was one?).  I knew what I was going to order before I even came in, so when my waitress came over, I ordered a glass of water and a Calabrese Pizza.  A little while later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was....................

Calabrese Pizza-  This was a white pizza and it came with house-pulled mozzarella, parmesan, taleggio, caramelized onions, sweet sausage, calabrian chiles, extra virgin olive oil and some basil.  It was delicious!  The sweet sausage was fantastic!  I ate a few pieces by itself, and it was spot on...just a great sweet Italian sausage!  The caramelized onions added some more sweetness on top of the sausage.  The mozzarella was nice and rich, and the calabrian chiles added a little ""pop"" to each bite.  All these delicious flavors were thrown upon a nice thin, charred crust.  It was thin, but not so thin that your slice would droop.  You could pick up each slice and enjoy it without knife and fork.  I dusted that pizza off in no time and was ready for the bill.  About that.............

The Calabrese pizza is normally $16.00.  When my waitress brought me my bill, it rang up at only $13.00.  I am assuming that pizzas are $3.00 off during Happy Hour?  I didn't ask, I kept my mouth shut and left my waitress a $20.00.  

Service was excellent!  My waitress was very friendly and personable, and never let my water get below half full.  The space where they created this restaurant is pretty cool, too!  I'm sure I will be back at some point.  The pizza is pretty damn good and its right down near Chase Field and Talking Stick so its convenient to grab a bite to eat here before heading to a game.",2016-04-29 07:02:30

《Chilled Mango Ice Cream $7.90》The foggy cool air in the store reminded me when i was a kid, my mom would buy us ice cream cake for special occasions. But before we dig into the cake, my brother and I would pick up some dry ice with a spoon and add water to it! It was so mesmerizing and as a child that was like the coolest 'experiment' you could do at home 

Ok back to my review on the ice cream! It was not the milky/creamy type of ice cream I usually eat, flavour was very distinct and I loved how refreshing the ice cream tasted!! It was topped with some grapefruit meat (wish there was more) and there was chunks of frozen mango inside :) The white liquid in the syringe was coconut milk which you could add into your ice cream before eating it. Fiancé said he was just going to try one bite of my ice cream but ended up eating half of it,  i think this is enough say on how delicious it was 

Ohh & Anyone wonder why they have a Tiger as their logo? It is based on the Chinese name 分子虎,  which directly translated to Molecular Tiger . I didn't know they have a Chinese name until I look at the receipt haha

Next time I am going back to try their Mango Popice & Creme Brulee ice cream (maybe when it is warmer!!). I was freezing while eating the ice cream because it was so windy and the door was always opened..",2017-04-01 22:43:41

I took my dog in to get groomed.  They were understaffed (which nobody told me about when I dropped him of for his appointment.)  so I had to wait longer. Nobody told me it was going to be 2 hours longer than what I was told so I tried to be patient.  Waited.  Waited... I was ignore.....would have been nice if someone had given me an estimated wait time.... then again...they had the first time and look how that worked out.    But I was still keeping my cool.  Hey...things happen.  Then a man walks in with 2 dogs... didnt have an appointment and asks to get both his dogs a nail trim.  NO PROBLEM!!  That's what they say.  So my dog and I are waiting for a total of 5 hours to be taken care of and this guy just walks in and is helped right away.  Understaffed.  That why I had to wait so long.  More like...not a priority.  Thanks a lot.  
 OH...BUT IM NOT DONE YET..... I took him to my work to show everyone the new ""do"" and when he rolled over..his undercarrage was wayyyy uneven.   Nobody can really see it so I'm like...whatever today sucked I'm not going to worry about it... and then everyone asks why his tail is so uneven...and then my friend is petting his fur around the neck and asks why he has a dreadlock.

As for the flavors we did try- I thought the salted caramel was better than a lot of others I have tried elsewhere and the blueberry swirl was also very good. I can imagine their chocolate (they were out) is probably pretty amazing.

It was pretty spankin early for vegas standards, so my friend and I came here for breakfast.  It's set away from the casino, which makes it's a nice, relatively quiet place.  The sausages were great, but the crossiant was really greasy.  I mean it made my lips extra-shiny-greasy.  And the potato was very salty.  But the sausages were just that good that i overlooked most of the imperfections.  

It's a nice dining experience here and in the summer you can eat on the patio that overlooks one of the smaller, more private pools at the venetian (which i did last year).  One thing of note is that my friend felt uncomfortable with all the old men leering at her throughout our meal.  I think they thought i was taking my hooker to breakfast, but um, no that's not it.

Pho Bistro is the place that replaced Beijing Noodle Cafe, which was a Chinese restaurant with similarly inexpensive, casual eats. This place has actually been open for almost two years, but I've found reason after reason to keep putting off my first visit, including disbelief that we could have anything good out here and lack of reviews from familiar Yelpers. I ended the procrastination today with a lunch visit.

They offer $5.95 lunch specials daily from 11-3, and it's not just the typical fried rice and whatnot. There are 4 pho options, including vegetarian, beef meatball, chicken, and the Pho Tai that I got with rare sliced beef. The bowl came out quickly and was piping hot, which hints that they have a huge pot going in the back like all good pho restaurants do. Well, that would've been just a guess if I didn't get a spoiler because my seat was in line of sight with the kitchen door. That huge pot on the stove was a giveaway.

But that doesn't matter if it doesn't taste good, and boy was the stock surprisingly delicious. It might be a little too sweet for some, but to me that just means that it plays well with the lime juice that I ended up fully extracting after a careful squeeze into a spoon of broth and a small sip. The pho noodles are pretty standard, and the meat was tender and savory. The Thai basil was fresh, and so were the bean sprouts, which I normally skip but decided to throw into my broth this time. Value-wise, it's a small bowl that works for a lunch portion and is great for the price.

By the way, the lunch special comes with soda or tea. I went with a hot tea, which ended up being a bag of what was labeled as jasmine tea that was allowed to steep in a mug of boiling water. I was expecting a little more jasmine aroma, but it was a nice way to cleanse the palate and get a little caffeine to stave off the food coma.

Pho Bistro is home of my favorite pho east of the Strip, and it should be the first stop for pho if you're on this side of town or if you're in the immediate vicinity. Henderson is pretty mediocre, and there's one spot on Boulder Highway that I still need to look at, but this is probably the go-to place. And this rating could actually rise if their other options are as good and if the pho is consistent. I was gonna try a banh mi sandwich, but I have other dinner plans. Next time!",2016-11-01 20:19:58

This hotel is not somewhere I would choose stay, so I cannot speak to the rooms.  I have a feeling that would take a star or two away from this rating.  In looking at their site, the rooms appear to be updated.  Regardless, there are so many deals at even the top properties in Vegas that there is no reason to try a room here.  The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the Strip, across from Caesar's Palace and close to everything.

Gotta warn you though, there isn't much of a variety, but what they do have is tasty and fresh. It's more quality over quantity. Like everyone else said, they close early (2:30pm) and it's incredibly cheap (check groupon. I got 2 lunches for $15). They cater to Chinese tourists who come into town in large tour buses. You can tell that's where they really make their business from. The food was kept very clean and everything was warm. The Chinese food tastes authentic. Better than what you would find at Panda Express for sure. The star dishes for me was the curry, spicy string beans and the orange chicken (which is funny cause I don't really like orange chicken). They also had a salad bar with different Asian salads and a dessert area. When they seat you they'll take a drink order which is odd because they have an entire self serve beverage area with an assortment of sodas, coffee and tea.

Another O&B restaurant in the city, they seem to be spreading like wildfire (or poison ivy).

I'll go on record to say that I'm not the biggest fan of the O&B empire, i feel that their restaurants have become too chainy, too similar, and a bit uninspired.

Popped into Bannock for an afternoon lunch with the other half & another couple we randomly ran into while shopping. Yes, I spend Sunday afternoon of the Labour Day weekend in a mall. It's embarrassing. Let's move on.

Restaurant at 2pm was about a quarter full, were seated immediately by a helpful hostess. The dining room is nice enough, full of reclaimed wood (apparently salvaged from a sunken dock in Lake Ontario), blond wood chairs, mason jars of preserves lined along one wall (a restaurant design trend that is a bit past it's prime). The configuration & layout of tables in the space is a bit strange (due to the shape of the room), it's not super cozy, tables are packed in pretty close together.

Ordered drinks. The Bannock Ceasar.($9) is quite good, spicy, boozy & garnished with candied maple bacon (my guess is someone in the O&B empire recently dined at Barque). Good wine list and selection of beers, I had the Beau's Lager ($8.5 for a 20oz pint).

Meal: here is what we ordered:

Pickerel Tacos ($11): lightly battered and fried pickerel with caviar mayo with a side of creamy cucumber & green apple salad. Fish was tasty, as was the caviar mayo, the shell of the tacos were really good, very similar to the outside dough of a steamed BBQ pork bun. Salad was very small, maybe 4 pieces of apple and 3 pieces of cucumber in total.

Clearwater Lobster Roll with Root Veg crudite ($15): lobster salad contained hearty pieces of claw $ tail, light (a bit watery) mayo base. Side crudite was good.

Margherita Pizza ($13): meh, a poor rendition of my favorite classic pizza. Large slices of unripe tomatoes on top was a bit disappointing.

Prices for food were reasonable, but with booze the bill was punched up to about $35-$40 per person.

Overall, an okay option in the Eaton Centre area. For the prices, would rather hit The Gabardine, Teronni or Mercatto.",2011-09-05 16:10:51

This restaurant took over the Shan Dong restaurant that used to be here. Kind of hidden by a huge tree, to the right (North) of Boutique World 

NOTE: CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! !

The menu says ""Authentic Szechuan Cuisine for 50 years"". To clarify, its not the Szechuan from China. As we were told by the waitress, the chef is from Taiwan and cooks authentic Taiwanese ""Chuan Cai"" which means village food/cuisine. 

Not familiar with taiwanese style foods, and it being lunch, my friend and I ordered from the lunch specials. All lunch combos served with 1 vegetable egg roll, steamed rice (or brown rice), daily vegetable (....wait what? i just noticed that LOL) and soup. 

$4.25 combo - ma po tofu, sauteed cabbage, glass noodle with minced pork, or scrambled eggs with tomato
$5.75 combo - shredded pork with bean curd, shredded beef with bell pepper, chicken with garlic sauce, or sliced pork belly with bell peppers
$6.95 combo - shrimp with scrambled eggs, shrimp with broccoli, beef with bean curd, or beef with mushroom

Not a bad selection amount for lunch. Lots of food. Maybe restaurant isn't too known yet and it recently opened so not busy at all. Food came out pretty fast. 

The soup was a hot and sour soup. Strong on the white pepper. My friend didnt like it but i liked it. Normally dont order/get this soup. XD but it was pretty good. 

Shredded pork with bean curd - decent amount. lots of bean curd. flavored well. 

Sliced pork belly with bell peppers - lots of veggies vs pork belly. A bit on the salty side (for me). Not bad (salty wise) eaten with rice. 

Vegetable Egg Roll - not a fan of vegetable egg rolls but it was freshly fried. Hot and crispy skin. Vegetable........ yeah not a fan of that part. Lol

I saw Humble Pie was in the area and asked if they were game and yes they were. Now I have heard good sold things about Humble Pie from many friends so I was pretty excited to try them out.  

It was Sunday night around 5:30, we walked in and where greeted right away and asked how many in the party, then the host turned his back , a server walked up and asked how many in the party, I had to answer because it appeared the host had better things to do, why even ask if you didn't even care.

We were seated handed menus and drink orders were taken.  For appetizers I ordered the toasted ravioli,  they were stuffed with ricotta cheese and served with marinara sauce. To be honest this dish lacked flavor, Prego sauce has more flavor that the marinara sauce that came with it.  1/2 the raviolis were toasted perfectly, the other were just hard. Even though the dish looked great the dish didn't wow me.
 
My son ordered the lasagna, which was the winning dish of the night, everything cooked perfectly!  His date ordered the Penne with Vodka Sauce with chicken (5 buck upcharge, when it came out it looked like adding the chicken to the dish was an afterthought, it was just a chicken breast diced up lying on top of the pasta. The sauce had great color but lacked flavor. 

Since I was at Humble Pie, pie is what I am getting right?  Wood oven cooked pizza sounded amazing!  I ordered the bbq chicken pizza with smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green onions and bbq sauce, the bbq chicken is one of my favorite types of pizza, so I was pretty excited. When I got my pizza it looked pretty amazing, but when I started to eat it, I noticed it was covered with grease, even my crust was soaked in grease, I couldn't eat it all, my belly was becoming a grease pit, it was just too much for me.

I didn't even know that such an award existed until today!

This is another place that reminds me of Portland. It has a modern, yet hipster vibe as songs like ""Kids"" by MGMT and ""The Intro"" by The XX played in the background at 8 in the morning.

The Hawaiian breakfast was highly recommended by the waitress, seeing as how it also won 2nd place at a renowned breakfast competition in town. So of course, being somewhat reminiscent of an ""Islander"" myself, I figured I give it a try. After all, I'm quite the sucker for Kalua pork. It was really good. The slow cooked pork was tender and no pieces were over cooked or dried out in any way. I was very happy with this dish! My friend really enjoyed her Huevos Rancheros as well!

I'm now very intrigued about coming later in the evenings for happy hour when they have live musicians play. Oh, and of course, I'd like to see how their lunch and dinner items fare in taste.",2012-09-22 04:09:36

If I have to be on the Strip, then I much prefer walking.  The traffic can be so terrible at times when driving.  Especially in the evening, the Strip is very lively and lit up.  There is entertainment and fun everywhere.

If you are a first time visitor to Las Vegas, then you must visit the Las Vegas Strip!!  

My two favorite destinations on the Strip are the Venetian hotel and the Bellagio!  The Venetian hotel gives us just a teeny little taste of Italy.  The Bellagio hotel and their Fountain Show outside simply amazes!

From our comfortable, contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled about before our eyes in a large and tall tube-type aquarium while we dined.  The place was sleek and modern, beginning with two 6-foot hostesses in black miniskirts, appearing much like human bookends, who confirmed our reservation and gave us a friendly greeting when we arrived.  The aqua floor upon entry looked like water, which added to the sea mystique.

Our first dish was dramatic, with a nice presentation of true meaty jumbo shrimp that were shooting off steam from dry ice.  A complimentary bread basket was small, but it was ample for 2 diners, and contained good brown and white bread, as well as tasty rolls.  New England Clam Chowder was good but unusually crunchy from celery, while Diane dealt with a Lobster Bisque that was rather heavy on the brandy.  Sauteed Mushrooms were juicy, and this side was very large and lasted all the way to dessert, but the sauce on the sizzling skillet was not that tasty.  However, a lovely chopped Spinach Salad with egg, mushrooms, and red onion was.  What I particularly liked about this dish is that the various parts were presented in side by side fields of color: a column of yellow egg placed next to a column of green lettuce, and so forth.  Then it was left up to the diner to toss all ingredients and the fine dressing together as desired, which I found to be fun rather than an annoyance.

I then enjoyed a good pan-fried pink Salmon enhanced by a blanket of crisp prosciutto, while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder.  I know, because I tried it too!  But, the Flounder that was originally brought to the table had to be sent back, because the first batch was too spicy for my spouse's delicate palate.  I appreciated that the request for a less spicy breaded Flounder was cheerfully accommodated, and although it took awhile for a new entree to be cooked, the manager personally brought out the replacement, and it was made just as requested.  We also shared a side of great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and I had fine Green Beans presented on my plate.

Our dessert of a Chocolate Souffle that had properly risen was good but not what we expected to receive.  It was real airy--more like a tasty meringue than a sumptuous souffle.

Service was impeccable!  It was attentive, and there was not one service error by our very competent female server.  In fact, the worst thing that occurred happened days after the meal when all photos of the food but one were lost in a failed effort to store them in a backup drive.  Hence, the single photo that appears with this review.  But at least that photo was taken just after a slew of dishes had been placed on the table.

Caramel tea 0/5 extremely sweet and did not resemble tea. It tastes like straight up syrup. 
Customer service was 5/5. They said they would remake my drink if I didn't like it but I felt bad since the guy said he thinks I would like that tea and he is the one who recommended it. I should have just ordered the basic brewers tea as I regret not having them change my tea because it was not good at all. It was light almost watery (not thick milky creamy) and wayyyy too sweet. I got it with almond milk. It was almost $5.50 and I could not drink it, waste of money. 


I really wanted to like this place after seeing multiple yelp check-in's by yelpers, but that overboard sweetness is not good. 

I even explained I didn't want too much sugar and too much sweetness and this was recommended. I don't like syrups as powders being added to boba tea drinks which is why it's hard for me to find a good place to go. I was hoping this was my new spot, closer to home. 

Unfortunately I can't give them higher stars since what I am paying for is the tea and it was not to my liking. :(

*****Went back twice since the original time there because I really wanted to like it and give them a second chance. They were so nice to let me try a bunch of teas and I found out some I liked and some I did not. I really appreciate them doing this so I can find the perfect tea instead of making them do the whole thing over which I would feel too bad. 

I got the Okinawa Milk tea and the Black Tea Latte with Sea Salt Cream. Both were very good and I was happy with them! 

I think the problem was getting the almond milk last time. I will stick with the non dairy creamer or any other way they suggest making it. Trying to make it healthier in this case did not work.

Pros:
Hand made won tons are some of the best in town
Prices are more than fair
Food comes out lightning quick

Cons:
Maybe the broth has slipped?

JCK specializes in one thing and it's the one thing they focus everything on: won ton noodle soup.  If you don't like won ton noodle soup you have no reason to come here.  That being said, if it's won ton noodle soup you're craving, there's no better place in town.  

If you come in early enough, you can see the staff at the end table making fresh won tons every morning.  It's something of a treat to watch them alone.  They skillfully make them as if they're robotic in a way.  The won tons here are the star of the show.  Hand made, and full of shrimp.  There's no trace of fillers whatsoever!!  You can buy these separately to go to cook at home as well.  The kitchen is an open kitchen.  You see your noodle being made right before your eyes.  They have nothing to hide.  

For the amount of shrimp in the won tons, the prices are more than fair in my opinion.  2 people can easily eat here for under $20, tax and tip included.  There is self serve tea here that's basically free of charge if you order anything to eat.  This place is so efficient that your orders come out lightning quick.  You order, and within 3 minutes, it's ready.  You can be in and out easily in 20 minutes.  Need a quick, satisfying and cheap meal?  Look no further than JCK.

I've been coming here for years and sometimes my friends and I notice that the broth may have slipped a little.  It's not negligible at all really.  This place is still my go to place for won ton noodle by far.  

There you have it, as the description for 5 stars here says, JCK is as good as it gets for won ton noodle.  I am and will continue to be a regular here.",2015-06-17 11:38:35

Our service was good.  For some reason, my husband did not think our service was very good, but I thought our server was attentive even though she had a lot of tables kind of spread all over.

I'm not really sure why people drive around with Pete's Fish & Chips bumper stickers and why people rave about it, or why anyone would give this place more than 2 stars because it's awful. Absolutely awful!

First off, it's over priced for what you get and you're getting frozen food! NOTHING is made fresh. You get frozen square pieces of fish, frozen shrimp, frozen fries, frozen, frozen, frozen. You'd be better off going to your grocery store, buying it cheaper there and cooking it at home. It's sad when Long John's Silver's actually beats out someone in fish and chips. Plus even after they cook they're frozen fish squares it doesn't taste good. Its greasy and bland. Also the red sauce...yeah it's gross. I wanted tarter sauce and was told no.

Second, service is appalling! Why are they so damn rude? The people servicing are disrespectful and always love shutting the little screen door in your face. They also don't accept credit cards, or debit cards. Really? Come on, catch up! The first time I came here I had to leave and go to Wendy's because I don't carry cash. So I had to try again another time, That was my first experience. There is no excuse to not accept cards nowadays; Geez, you can accept cards on smart phones, it's that easy!!!

Lastly, hygiene. Ugh...gawd...gross. This place has got to be breaking alot of health codes. Their staff looks dirty, they constantly handle money with the same gloves they use to prepare food. Plus, I have seen staff go on cigarette breaks using the same gloves they use to prepare food.

I don't desire to try anything else, and I doubt that anything else would taste as good!  These nachos are fucking perfect!  My buddy introduced me to Cafe Rio out in CA a few years back, and ever since then, I have been addicted to their pork nachos.  Haven't found any better, and I don't think I will!  

I saw that this Cafe Rio was opened within the last few months, and I decided to drive down here to check them out.  When a nacho craving hits, one must fulfill that craving...stat!  I signed up for their eclub/app and was given a $5.00 off coupon.  Score!  I pulled up to the place, parked, and walked in.  I ordered my nachos (they didn't sing the ""nacho, nacho, man"" song like at other Cafe Rios, but that was ok...always felt it was a bit corny anyways).  The guy I placed my order with was very friendly, as was the lady who made my nachos after they exited the conveyor belt.  I was wearing my St. Louis hat, and she asked if I had watched the All Star game etc.  Real personable and I am always happy when someone wants to talk sports.  I scanned my QR code on my phone, and my total came out to just under $5.00.  Score!   I took these bad boys out to my car and dug in.  Here is how they were.................

Pork Nachos-  First of all, I would like to give props to their ""to go"" packaging.  They use lids that are incredibly tall.  It provides maximum protection for your nachos, and keeps them looking beautiful.  A lot of places just slap a flat lid on your stuff, and when you open them up, you remove cheese and sour cream etc etc.  Not here....probably the best to go lids I have ever seen.  Good job, Cafe Rio!  Anyways...........back to the food!  The pork that they use is marinated in Dr. Pepper.  It provides a super sweet taste and a nice tender pork.  I have talked to folks that think it is ""too sweet"", but I think its perfect.  These nachos come loaded with pork, shredded cheese, choice of beans (I chose black), pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole.  Everything in these nachos works well with each other!  Plenty of meat, lots of cheese, a nice sized dollop of sour cream and guacamole, and a perfect amount of beans.  I am not the biggest bean fan, but Cafe Rios black beans are delicious! All of these things are piled onto some excellent chips!  That is one of the keys to a perfect nacho.  Can't have chips that get soggy and don't hold up to all these toppings.  Cafe Rios chips are perfect!  I mowed these things down while sitting in my car listening to some tunes.  I was sad when my tin was empty.

In warmer weather, sitting outside on the benches or taking out to go al fresco are lovely options. 

In the winter though, when the (arguably) two two-tops that are available inside the wedge of a store are taken, your only option is to stand in the doorway and withhold your salivations while waiting for take away. Luckily, since they only take cash, you'll most likely have to take a jaunt over to a nearby bank which will kill some time.

My all-time favourite default order is the big juicy scallop sandwich, but every time I stare up at the laminated photos, I swear to myself that I'll try a shrimp or fish burrito next time. The potatoey clam chowder is nothing to write home about, but does the job to warm you up. 

It's really nice to have a selection of fresh fish to look at when making your decision. Take advantage of this (or just order the scallop sandwich every time and never have anything to regret).",2011-03-04 15:50:03

I will qualify that by saying I've never been to France.  They bake the stuff right behind the counter, and looks delicious when it comes out of the oven.  We got there, walked right up to the cashier and ordered, and then about 12 people walked in.  Good timing.

My rating is for the ham, cheese & egg croissant, and the Americano & cappuccino we had.  They're famous for their breads, and they don't disappoint with this dish.  While you can't get a whole lot of mileage with ham, cheese, & eggs, the bread makes this sandwich.  Crispy outside with tender & chewy inside, the croissant is scrumptious.  The coffee, while obviously high quality, isn't exactly to my taste.  I'm partial to the sweeter, caramel type beans such as Colombian, and I think theirs is more the Ethiopian type.  So this will be up to your preference, but if you like the more earthy African beans, this is a good choice.  Cappuccino is topped with perfectly frothed milk, which you don't find all the time.  4.5 stars for the sandwich, 4 for the coffee.

TaaNyN-ukuDsqY6hVdFLBw,9X_WFukTdOVHTTlgnolRKg,h-eYvP7DboaYAhNwrppp9Q,1,0,1,0,"I visited this dealer two years ago to buy an Elantra for my daughter.  You might ask why I am writing a review now?  Well they won't take me off of their call list despite me telling them numerous times it was a horrible experience and I wouldn't buy a car from them if they were the last dealer on earth.  My daughter and I went to Chapman Hyundai because they are roughly two miles from my home in Moon Valley.  It started out well enough with a test ride and review of the car.  We were looking to trade in a Cadillac SRX that certainly had issues.  I did not have high expectations for the trade but expected to be treated reasonably.  The salesman had no authority to do anything and kept running back and forth to the sales manager.  It took many trips because where they started was absurd.  Do they really think buyers don't have access to pricing information and trade in values?  I am a senior finance professional which they knew but they just kept grinding.  They showed absolutely no interest in making a reasonable deal.  Then they started being insulting.  That was it for us and we left.  This was the same car experience I had 20 years ago and one might expect the same today except I have purchased 15 cars since then and the experience has progressed so far at every dealer I have worked for.  The next morning, I sent email inquiries to the other 5 Hyundai dealers in Phoenix at 6 am.  Before 7 am, I had responses back from every one of them and every response was a far better deal than Chapman offered on the best of many attempts.  We ultimately settled on Nick Mayer Hyundai as they gave us the best price on the car and a great trade in on the SRX without even seeing it.  The salesman told us he would have to trade another dealership for the car so I had my doubts.  He called about noon and said he had the car and was going to get it cleaned and the windows tinted (something we had not included in the price).  I asked when we should come down to finalize the deal.  He said, Oh No!!, he would bring the car to us and be at our house at 5 pm.  Again, I had my doubts but thought I would let it play out.  He pulled into our drive way in exactly the same car we had tried to buy at Chapman the night before (i.e. same model, trim and options) with tinted windows we were not charged for.  I still had my doubts on how this was going to play out.  The salesman sat down and said he had brought two contracts - Here we go I thought but I was wrong.  The first contract was exactly the deal we laid out.  The second contract included an additional warranty to make the already good warranty bumper to bumper for 100,000 miles.  The cost?  Half of what Chapman wanted and if I added it, the rate on my loan was reduced by .50%.  All in, it ended up costing me a couple of hundred dollars to make sure my daughter's car was covered bumper to bumper for 100,000 miles.  We signed the docs and the salesman then spent over an hour walking my daughter around the car and explaining everything to her.  All in all, Nick Mayer Hyundai provided the absolutely BEST car buying experience I have ever had.  Way beyond any expectation I had.  This was less than 24 hours after Chapman Hyundai gave me the WORST buying experience I have ever had.  Well Chapman, you have continued to call me for the last two years and despite my objections and the fact that I told you I had a horrible experience you continue to call.  From this point forward, I will post this review on every site I can every time you call me.  Maybe this will cause you to at least purge the old information you have for people who do not want to hear from you again.",2014-08-05 19:25:38

After a vivid recollection of last year: cringing from fullness while simultaneously forcing one of Green's roasted marshmallows down my throat, being unable to stop until I'd tasted every last dish, I thought I'd learned my lesson.

This year, I managed not to completely finish any of the dishes (aside from Lon's dark chocolate-dipped salted caramel pop... sweet baby Jesus) and planned to leave feeling uncomfortably full, at most. However, on my way out, I saw that they expanded this year's lineup, setting up a handful of restaurant booths and an entire strip of dessert places inside the cafe and Great Hall. Rat bastards. I literally haven't eaten for 27 hours and am still full.

My advice for next year: save anything that comes in a bag for later, and arrive STARVING. I cannot get enough of everything about Devoured. The food is stellar, the lines are non-existent (thanks to the flocks of people that essentially just go to drink and socialize), and the selection is immense enough to cause death by gluttony if you're the kind of person who has to taste everything.

They got me through some long days of studying for boards and hitting the sweet tooth after an exhausting day at the hospital. But there is a certain charm about the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations (both 5 stars in my opinion) that this specific location lacks. The other Phoenix and Scottsdale locations are in upscale, fun areas that kind of make getting gelato a tasty event....but this location makes me feel like I'm going out to hit up a pawn shop and then donate some used batteries at a Goodwill.

I initially drove by the plaza they were located in because I looked at it and thought to myself, ""Well this area looks dead and dark, there is no way that a Gelato Spot would be in here..."" After driving for an additional 3 minutes, I realized I had gone too far and then made the sad realization that they in fact were in the grocery plaza. The Gelato Spot caters to a certain clientele and it looks like they are trying to diversify and attract new customers in this area, but I don't know how successful they will be. When I went in on a Saturday night, they were pretty dead, but I will attribute their lack of customers to a lack of awareness. The ambiance was also super bland, no color, comfort or excitement...nothing like the Scottsdale location. It just seems weird for a place (with the reputation of a Gelato Spot) to open up when things aren't in place. First impressions are everything and my first impression was I should have gone to Frost.

Here's the deal with gelato, my girlfriend and I love Stracciatella, Almond Snickers and Baccio. That's pretty much it and unfortunately this location only had Almond Snickers .......I'm not sure why they wouldn't have some of their more popular flavors on the board for their opening month. We got stuck with trying pistachio and amaretto and we were not fans. The customer service was excellent and I'm sure the flavors I love will eventually get there. I will obviously give this spot another chance in a month or so after they get their act together and will update my review.",2013-03-02 21:50:59

For about the first 30 minutes after the gates opened, they played hip hop music over the PA system.  It seemed like it was streamed directly from Pandora.  It's music that I normally listen to, but I heard older fans near me say to each other that they didn't like the music.  I thought that it was amusing that the music that they were playing was not censored at all and there were sexually explicit lyrics and lyrics with profanity blasted throughout the stadium.  At that time, the stadium was pretty empty and I didn't really see many children around.  Finally, they stopped a pretty graphic song in the middle and started playing much more tame music.

I had a good time at the game, but this isn't one of my favorite spring training parks.  The food choices are, in my opinion, the worst in the Cactus League.  I like indulging in ballpark food, but there just weren't very many options even for someone looking to spend money.",2016-05-21 23:49:21

After 8 hard hours of sleeping on my bed, he has to get up when I do, follow me around the house while I get ready and see me off to work.  Then it's outside for his sun bath, followed by 15 minutes of getting into stuff, and then a rigorous stretch.  Then a 4 hour nap, some sniffing, and then another nap.  No wonder he's so tired when I get home that he collapses on the nearest pile of laundry and proceeds to start snoring.  It's a ruff time (haha, I'm so flippin' funny.)  

So when he's stressed out and needs a break, we head on over to Cosmo Dog Park for Yappy Hour.  There is butt sniffing to do, pee mail to check, and all kinds of activities.  If the car is dirty and the weather is warm, we go in to the lake area where he can fulfill his dream of being a water dog.  After some swimming and splashing, and of course some vigorous shaking (as close to his human as possible, because the only thing hotter than lake water in your mouth is wet dog lake water hurled at the speed of light) it's off to the big dog area, for some running, ball chasing and agility fun.

They have well constructed agility equipment - yay for concrete, good watering areas, and TONS of room to run and romp.  Plenty of nasty tennis balls to throw, and most people are good about the poop scooping.  The fact they have a completely separate area for small dogs is a huge plus too.  

Overall, while this is more of a drive for us, it makes my dogs day to go out and have fun at the park, and the quality of this park makes the extra miles well worth it.

Side note:
I'd love to kick the person who voted good for kids, dog parks are NOT FOR CHILDREN of the two legged variety.  Just because your kid likes dogs doesn't mean my dog likes kids.

The staff are friendly and courteous. More importantly they actually had really good service. I'm mean fantastic. 

Ordered a pound of wings and fries. It's served with a yummy dill dip which I really enjoy and always have. About two years ago when I ate at St. Louis more often, they would only give you one dill dip. I always bought an extra one. 

After 10 mins or so, the food arrived freshly cooked. I noticed that the portion sizes are much smaller than they used to be. I also found that their portion of fries were also much smaller. On a positive note, they provided 2 dill sauces. The wings were tasty but a little over sauces in my opinion. They were definitely less meaty than they used to be. The fries were on the soggier side which I didn't enjoy very much as they are better served when fully cooked. 

What stuck out to me the most is that their pound of wings now cost $13 and change. 

They're almost 2-3 $$$ more than they were!

I'm sorry but if you're going to decrease the portion sizes and increase the price, that formula doesn't work for me, and I won't be returning.

From Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kubo, Pete's Dragon, Spider Man, and The Emoji Movie (with the kids) to The Girl on the Train, Loving, Jackie, The Big Sick, and Battle of the Sexes (with my husband and sometimes other friends/family), I guess I have spent a decent amount of $$ at this theater, and I'll likely continue to do so whenever the opportunity arises.  Who doesn't love escaping the world for a couple of hours of big screen entertainment in a comfy chair with a bucket of popcorn?",2017-10-07 06:35:57

The menu says ""roast pork"" or ""chicken stir fry"" but it's absolutely 100% meatless even though some of the dishes tastes like real meat.

I think the chef is caught in between wanting to cater to authentic Chinese tastes, & those who are used to less authentic tastes. So four stars bc while a few of the dishes were sooo awesome, a few were overly sweet like it was for a different audience. However, they are a clean restaurant. The oil they use to fry foods is changed frequently and doesn't have that old/stale taste some places have. 

The service was great, very friendly and helpful. Place was clean and quiet when my party of four went (Monday night around 6pm). I'm definitely coming back!! 

This is what we got: 
Cantonese fish: made from tofu with crispy seaweed on top that took on the role of the fish's skin. It looked more like grilled fish than it tasted, but I love tofu so I enjoyed this a lot. 

crispy beef: tofu based too, but this is the one dish that if I didn't know was vegetarian, I would've thought was a delicious beef dish. It was tasty. Perfectly crispy though a little too sweet. 

Chicken hot plate: I loved this one. It was also tofu based and delicious. You can tell it was imitation meat, but this dish wasn't overly sweet. Great smoky flavor to the fake chicken with lots of fresh crisp veggies. I love how Chinese cooking has vegetable dishes where the veggies are both crisp and saucy. My fave :) 

Scallop pan fried crispy noodle: too sweet, but the noodles were crispy and good. The scallops were a form of big mushroom (the literal Chinese to English translation of the mushrooms are chicken leg mushrooms) that was breaded and fried. This was okay, I wouldn't order it again. 

Fried eggplant: sweet eggplant sliced like French fries. Had a sticky and crispy texture which was interesting. Like caramel stickiness to it. I thought it was too sweet again but interesting. In all my 31 years of eating Chinese food I have literally never eaten a dish like this before. Wouldn't order it again but didn't regret it. 

Overall: yum!! I'm coming back for sure :)",2015-10-20 03:53:41

I had an Inca cola, which is one of my absolute favorite south american sodas.
I had the Pollo Saltado...a chicken and fries dish with rice..fantastically seasoned.
My husband had the arroz tapado,which was rice, then a layer of steak, and another layer of rice. He wasn't as excited..he felt the slices of steak were very small, which left him wanting more flavor.

_PsGxRhF0MByxnxl0EvxQQ,fTWtXca0hmdjLQFvkrNDPw,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,1,6,0,0,"Multiple trips to date for the hotel. Once last year and once this year. Visits left a variable unfavorable hotel and casino impression.

Located in the center of the Las Vegas strip. One of the original casino and hotels. Mostly remodeled rooms with dark colored hardwood floors. Beds are decently maintained.

First visit last year, we stayed during spring break. Management and counter staff were both uncoordinated to handle the volume of people in line. Wait time was about a good hour from back to front for the players line or just hotel guest line. At one point the management had pulled me to the side to try out the self check in only to say I had to go back into the line. Fortunately enough the person I was in front of let me back into the line.

My room preference (king nonsmoking) was unavailable when I got to the check in after staying at another casino hotel the night before without having my nonsmoking preference available. Offered two queens nonsmoking we gladly accepted. Room was nicely furnished with pink fur, pillows, a nice little split love seat chairs. Bathroom was properly sized and decently maintained. The room was quite nice for what I expected to  find and sitting in front of the strip. Room was kept nicely by the hotel housekeeping. Only downside to the view and room was the large Donnie and Marie advertising that was outside obstructed the view of Caesar and the strip.

We received our bill the last morning to encounter an issue with billing. We waited in the hotel line again to get the issue resolved. Another good 15 minutes to check out. We had to catch our shuttle and correcting the billing was a contributing factor for is to miss our shuttle. We asked the hotel staff regarding catching the shuttle to which we purchased a round trip to where we would go. The staff was unsure. The long line with the lack of clarity between the staff was not a good lasting impression. Although not favorable on service I was willing to give it another try recently. 

Recent visit in July, I wanted to see if I could check in before normal time of 4. I didn't want to pay the extra for the early check in (breakfast time) but willing to pay for the room upgrade. We waited in line and this time was significantly faster but still about 15 minutes. Neither of my requests could be accommodated and was told to try back a little after lunch from the clerk and her supervisor. We wait again in the line and at the time we were told to check back again. This time another half hour of my time. Again I could not check in. We had already eaten lunch and breakfast by this time. We were told to check in an hour and decided to just wait for regular check in at this point. We come back go check in at 4. Waited another 15 minutes in line to get room keys and everything settled. So for check in here expect to wait about one hour.

Room this recent trip was not nearly as maintained. It looked like the room itself was half updated and the casino hotel ran out of money to fix it up. The room was comfortable but decor appeared to be mismatched from the tables and the bed. This recent trip we cut short and checked out a day early. Again check out took about 15 minutes.

Water and room temperatures were okay. Towels and sheets were cleaned and stocked. 

The decor and upkeep on the hotel was a mixed bag. Service is incredibly slow on the hotel front desk.

Casino is also not kept well. Considering the age and the keep of the room, an update is needed on both. Machines are tight and table dealers are not friendly or helpful. 

Overall I have to drop what would be a two star for a one time visit. Second trips usually confirm assessments. In this case, one star unlikely to be out here to stay the night or gamble. I'll take my business elsewhere.",2014-09-15 08:29:56

They didn't have thai tea :(

Ordered 2spring rolls, one traditional and the other was a vegetarian something with tempura asparagus. 
The pork in the traditional was very tough. The veggie one was great. A little pricey/small compared to your typical pho joint though, as the traditional was 3.75 and the veggie 3.25 (I think I usually pay, like, 3 bucks for the same thing, but slightly bigger). They both were (described to me as) one roll cut in half. Sauces were tasty, especially the pesto stuff for the veggie one.
Ben got the combination soup with meatballs, tripe, and tendon at $10 a bowl (usually we'd pay less than 6 bucks for the same thing....) He loved it, as usual.
I got the chicken banh mi and the garlic fries. The meat in the sandwich tasted like your dark meat chicken (i describe it as a little funky. Not off-putting, just funky). And that's ok, but I'd prefer higher priced meat in my $8 sandwich.

The CMA has one of the top collections in the nation and it's a reason to visit Cleveland if you love art--CMA is on par with the Met and The Art Institute of Chicago.  The CMA is smaller (well, it's huge now that the renovations are done), but the collection and atmosphere is equally impressive.  My out-of-town friends are always shocked that the arts/culture scene in Cleveland is so well regarded and a sight to behold (be sure to check out the orchestra if you visit Cleveland to see the museum). 

The new architecture of the re-designed building is amazing.     Everything from the new atrium to the redesigned ceilings that offer non-destructive natural light really up the ambiance of this museum.  The collection is, of course, still impressive and rich with art of all forms and eras.  The change in architecture completely improves the staging of the rooms now that sections are no longer closed off.  The collections flow organically as your travel through the museum to see the different periods and styles of art.  The completed renovations alone provide reason enough to visit this museum if you haven't been in a while (or if you've never been).

If wishes were fishes we'd all eat well. As it was, we ate passably.

Like many mexican restaurants they started us off with chips and salsa, which came in two forms, standard red and corn. I hoped the latter would wow me, but it was pretty bland. But, hey, it was free.

The drinks, on the other hand, were most certainly not at $9 a piece. I know better than to order anything containing the ingredient ""margarita mix"" but i let the spirit get the best of me and ended up with a overly sweet cherry drink that may once have made the brief acquaintance of some tequila.

For our entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas Verde and he got the Fajitas de Casa. To their credit, both were so generously portioned that we ended up unable to finish. The chicken in the enchiladas was tasty, but the sauce was bland, especially when I spread the allotment of sour cream over them before realizing it was far too much (and I rarely admit such a situation exists). He enjoyed the mix of proteins in the fajitas but I tried one of the shrimp and found it unpleasant, so the seasoning is for some but not all palettes. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it was also unremarkable.

The service did meet the standard I had originally expected, with both servers that came to our table being prompt and friendly.

The Cleveland Museum is a beautiful space with a great covered atrium with trees and tables and space for kiddies to run around.  (Reminds me of the National Portrait Gallery in DC)

The food service is great - lots of colleagues from Case Western across the street come to the museum cafeteria for lunch.  

The exhibits are well displayed and curated.  I saw a number of important pieces that I was familiar with from the impressionist and surreal school and was introduced to some new artists in the modern and contemporary section.  I zipped through the historical art a little quicker - the    indigenous Americas art was quite good, though I have to say that the gallery with Central Asian/Middle Eastern textiles was one of the most memorable.

If i have one quibble, it was that the gallery seems to focus on providing  a little something from every region/school/era, without any exhibits organized outside of these  geographic and chronological selections. This approach makes it great for school groups but less so if you're looking to be challenged by new ways of looking at things or eclectic groupings.

Overall, this museum stands out as a very good middle-city museum along the lines of Richmond, Buffalo or Montreal but not quite as good as any of the former.",2014-04-27 18:46:25

I love that it's a drive thru, I love that it's fast. 

One time I got the tortilla soup, it was so good. 
I also got a children's turkey wrap which was filling and amazing. I have gotten a few different salads. Some of the salad seem like the ingredients don't sound good together so I haven't tried them. The Asian salad for example sounds good but the ingredients are weird and unlike a traditional Asian salad you would see at a restaurant. 

I got the antipasto salad today. I loved it. Idk why I added chicken when there was already Salame!! Whoops. The only thing is it literally came with 3 artichoke halves.... that's all, and I happen to love artichokes. Also I asked for my dressing on the side so they put it in my salad and carved out a spot for it which makes me feel like they skipped out on some of my toppings...

The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because I feel that for how expensive their salads are there should be free croutons or something the options are so limited, the salads I have had without meat have not filled me up at all and it feels like a waste of money for a $8 without meat, but it's like $2 to add meat. So essentially your paying almost $7-10 for a small-ish salad. So if there were a crouton option I would love that. 

All in all this place is pretty good, not the first place I would pick but it's conveniently located for me so that's a plus and it's a drive thru.

The main dishes don't come with sides so we also got a side of the Black Truffle Mac and Cheese . I personally didn't care for it. I normally love Mac and cheese but the taste was blah and it was over priced. 

Overall we enjoyed our first experience at the restaurant .. I liked that it wasn't super packed and the service was good. The price of the food is a bit over priced but was expected.",2014-01-27 02:31:53

Who would think this is possible in a bubble tea place, but i had the best service from an associate at Presotea.  I went into the tea shop not knowing what i wanted.  The associate asked me what i like usually and i told him my preference - not milk, light, refreshing, and not so sweet.  He then pointed to a poster and suggested ""Four Season Tea"".  He said it's really refreshing and light.  ""It's a new tea that just came out and people seemed to like it."" He claimed.  Lol How could i not give this tea a try!!!  And he was right!

I tend to go back to the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Southwest Burger, and BBQ Platter most often. I believe the BBQ gets shipped over from Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert. The portions are more than generous and complimented by some really good sides. No alcohol, but just eat and then walk over to 12 West for a beer, or Garage East for a glass of wine!

My husband is a bit obsessed and chopt is a good option for a quick, healthy meal if you need to get something out. We typically take our salads to go and enjoy them at home. My husband usually gets the Mexican Caesar with Mexican goddess dressing and I like to make my own, usually with the spicy red peppers, cooked onions, beets and falafel. I prefer the falafel chopped up with the salad rather than left whole. I too usually go for Mexican Ceasar, it's creamy, spicy and vegan, or the Dijon. I also love to try to specials that are inspired by different international locations. I choose well so I never feel bad about eating chopt. The small slice of fresh bread is also a nice addition.

So, what makes Urban Beans different from other local coffee spots? A few things: the staff is really nice, the plugs are plentiful (although watch your step when you're crossing an open area), and they have really good, affordable food options. (Try the pear flatbread or the quiche!). 

My biggest complaint is the music. I'm OK with emo but some sort of batshit-crazy guy doing spoken word over Enya-like strings is enough to throw me--the ultimate multitasker--into distraction land.

""What!?"" she screeched rudely, instead of ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you said."" ""Kelp noodles,"" I replied patiently. She pointed down the aisle we were in, annoyed, saying ""I really don't know but here is our selection of noodles. If we have them, they'd be here."" ""Thanks for all your help,"" I said sarcastically, feeling frustrated and disappointed to get that kind of treatment from someone who is supposed to helping their customers. ""You're welcome!"" she proudly said, with a grin on her face. Three words; terrible customer service. Wish she would have at least asked another associate if they carried them. 

Besides the kelp noodles, I could not find a few more of my products that I needed. The basil leaves were all out, until I hunted another associate down who found some in the back. Their clear plastic baggies to put various items in were all out except for one or two stations, which makes for an awkward situation when you're carrying a handful of fruits in your hand, looking for something to put them in.

Drinks: Ruby - beer, grapefruit juice and a bit of gingerale, super yummy sweet and refreshing, a girly beer drink! Ramune mojioto is alway delicious my go to drink.

On the way to go see Avengers: Age of Ultron last night (fun, fun movie , btw), we stopped by here to grab some burritos to sneak into the theater. (*Shhhhhhhh, don't tell anyone*)

We pull up, ordered 2 Del Beef Burritos and were told to pull forward. Cool. Just as we were pulling forward, the girl who took our order says, ""It's gonna be a while""

Wait. what?

We pulled forward with one vehicle in front of us. We wait.....and wait...and wait. After 12 minutes I notice that it  appears that the vehicle in front of us is not pulled up to the window. In fact, it is about 5 feet BEHIND the window. There were four twenty something males in the car. So I approached the vehicle and said, ""Hey...what's going on here?"" 

They explained that they were told to back up from the window from the girl inside and that they were as annoyed as I was because they had waited almost 15 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers. They offered to pull up if they didnt get their burgers in the next few minutes so we could get out of there. 

At the 16 minute mark of my wait, the guys in front of me get their order and pull off. I pulled up and paid for the burritos expecting to just grab the bag and go. After all, previews have now started for our movie.

The girl collects the money and closes the window and walks off. I looked at my friend and literally said, ""Are you F*cking kidding me??"" This is about 18 minutes in. 

I had had enough. I told the girl to give me my money back. This was BEYOND rediculous. By the time I pulled away it was 23 minutes. 23 MINUTES! Nothing fast about this food at all!

When I first pulled up to order, she should have said they were having issues and that there would be a long wait. I would have backed out and been on my merry little way. Slipping in a ""It'll be a while"" as you pull forward does not cut the mustard. 

THESE are the people that want $15 an hour??? Are you out of your flippin', ever loving minds??

The pad Thai had great flavor and the portion size was pretty big, but they use a different noodle to make their pad Thai, so it didn't really feel like we were eating pad Thai. The crispy panang chicken is just a deconstructed panang curry dish where everything that would go in the curry comes out on a plate with a bowl of plain panang curry and steamed veg. It was interesting and the chicken was crunchy and the veggies were steamed nicely, not too soggy, but I probably wouldn't order that again.

They have quite a few selections of magazines, videos, as well as books.  They also have kiosks for searching the online library catalog, as well as other chairs/reading areas.    

In the area by the computer terminals, they have the general help desk and check-in stations.  They also have the terminals for checking out their items.

Chicago 7 pizza: Good thing about this pizza is that it was loaded with toppings (Green peppers, Italian sausage, red onions,  Pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.) -- but the sauce was a bit too sour and it could have used additional cheese. The crust itself was tasteless and too hard to chew -- not really what you'd find in any of the great Chicago pizza restaurants.

Classic wings -- Light and crispy but really lacking in flavor and meat juciness. The dish itself is too dependent on the sauce to have any flavor.

Molten chocolate cake -- Not really a lava cake but the fudge was nice and rich and went well with the ice cream.

The big cookie -- Wasn't great, wasn't bad -- the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough was a bit on the dry side and ice cream is almost mandatory otherwise the dish is too plain.

Overall, the prices aren't bad and the portion sizes are good but the execution of the food could be improved.",2014-06-19 03:42:26

I *do* like their bar upstairs for when I'm feelin' fancy.  They have excellent champagne cocktails on their menu (and if you know me, you know how I love to indulge in one of those).

xANZ2bTeKOjryK-ojUjqNw,rRrFcSEZOTw6iZagsIwTFQ,Xg7gOJjwtzmFGBxtSfOBlA,2,12,6,7,"Despite the ""Vegetarian"" listing and name here on Yelp, Green Lotus markets itself as a vegan restaurant. Before you even enter the door, they have printed on their window-front: ""Vegan Cuisine,"" ""No Animal Product,"" ""No Dairy, No Egg."" Next door to Green Lotus is Pho Bamboo, which not a veg*n restaurant. They have the same owner and once inside, the two restaurants are only separated by a partial wall, so you can walk back and forth between the two. That being said, they share the same kitchen, which is located on Pho Bamboo's side. 

A group of us came here last Thursday for the Veg-Curious Night Out UYE.  This was my first time here. I did my research ahead of time so I knew that there were 2 vegan menus: 1 American menu; 1 Vietnamese menu.  Both menus are said to be 100% vegan, but the Vietnamese menu is more extensive. (I took photos of all pages on both menus; see photos.) If you ""appear"" to be non-Vietnamese, you will receive the American menu. (And believe me, you'll be missing out.) So I asked our waiter for both menus and he was happy to oblige, although it appeared that he may have been scolded by an older woman (owner?) for doing so.  She then came over and asked one of my buddies if he was Vietnamese, to which he replied no.  She appeared to try to take away our Vietnamese menus. I told her that I'd requested both menus. She just smiled and nodded her head (her English is limited), still holding out her hand out for the menus.  I held tightly onto mine, but she took the rest. Why do they have 2 different menus? The Vietnamese menu still has English descriptions for every entry, so that perplexes me. Upon further inspection, I did discover that some of the dishes in the Vietnamese menu were cheaper than its American counterpart. e.g. Com Chien Thap Cam (Combination fried rice), Com Chien Thai (Thai fried rice), and Com Chien Thom (Pineapple fried rice) are all $8.95 in the Vietnamese menu.  In the American menu, Thai fried rice is $9.95, Pineapple fried rice is $10.95, and Combination fried rice is $11.95. That's up to a $3 difference. Now in all fairness, there could be a reason. Maybe the American menu offers a larger portion, because...ya know, Americans?  I will dig deeper into this and report back. 

KING EGG ROLLS $5.95 - American menu. Comes with 3 large & crispy ""egg"" rolls, filled with veggies and tofu.  It came with thin light brown/yellow sauce that did not taste like sweet and sour sauce.  Another mate had ordered the crispy Pub Wontons (Vietnamese menu), which came with a red sweet & sour sauce. I think that sauce would've been better.  The egg rolls themselves were cool, but I'm a sauce person; the sauce is just as important, if not more, for me.

GA RAM $5.95 - Vietnamese menu. Fried soy chicken appetizer.  It reminded me more of vegan shrimp than faux chicken. It had a wiggly consistency. The flavor was ok, but I couldn't get pass the texture. 

CA MUOI XA CHIEN $8.95 - Vietnamese menu. Marinated soy fish deep fried with spicy lemongrass.  The dish had great flavor but the soy fish did not appear to be deep fried at all. Pan fried, maybe, but not deep fried. Also, there was no hint of the lemongrass flavor. This dish came with jalapeños, minimal broccoli (maybe 2 pieces), green bell peppers, and onions, served with jasmine rice. Again, yummy dish, just not what I expected.

RAU THAP CAM XAO GUNG $9.95 - Vietnamese menu. Fried ginger ""chicken"" with mixed vegetables.  By this dish, I've discovered that when they say fried, they mean stir fried. Served with jalapeños, green bell peppers, onions, and ginger. Served with jasmine rice. This dish was also very good and flavorful. I requested spice level 4 (on a 1-5 scale), but it was not spicy at all.

HOT & SPICY GREEN BEAN $9.95 w/ Soy Chicken + $2 - American menu. It's supposed to be sautéed in a chili paste. I requested spice level 4. It only had a hint of spice. Maybe they gave me the American spice scale instead of a real spice scale? Nonetheless, excellent dish that bursts with flavor.  It came with mushrooms, which was not mentioned in the menu description. I dislike mushrooms, so I had to pick those out, which is a shame; I hate wasting food. Served with brown rice.

VEGETABLE FRIED RICE $9.95 w/  Soy Chicken +2 - American menu. Excellent flavor in this dish as well. It comes with lots of green onions, which I love.

PROBLEMS! One of my dinner mates ordered the Vegetable Pho (Vietnamese menu) and was served REAL MEAT! How can this happen? Because as I said earlier, it shares a kitchen with its neighbor, Pho Bamboo. For this reason, I have a major problem with this establishment marketing itself as a vegan restaurant.  

When vegans see the ""vegan"" label on an eatery, we eat there knowing rest assured, we'll be served a 100% animal and animal by-product free meal. That security is false at Green Lotus. Aside from investigating further, I won't return to Green Lotus unless they become completely independent from Pho Bamboo.",2017-05-29 21:27:17

They charged us $100 to run diagnostic (our engine light went off....again) and told us we had to replace the manifold for $1000. Then they also gave us a printout suggested a total brake replacement for $1k. Well trying to see if we could get a better price we took it to three more mechanics. The manifold DID have to be replaced and the $1k was within reason (we ended up buying a new one and replacing it ourselves for about $550.) However, the brake quote was a TOTAL SCAM!!! Our third mechanic said nothing was wrong with our brakes. Even our brake pads weren't due to be replaced just yet. Sure enough, we got in there and all that maybe needed was replacing was brake pads which we did for ourselves for less than $100. We would have just shelled that out if we had the $2k to fix everything and didn't look around. I mean $1k for brake pads that didn't need to be replaced??!?! Shame on you Buddy's.

BTW, the ""Brake"" quote they gave us was for 2 brake pads at $84 each. 4 brake rotors at about $85 a piece and brake fluid. Parts $540 and labor $372.",2013-09-09 22:49:25

I've been here twice in the last month - once to celebrate my birthday, and once to celebrate my brother's. The first was a fantastic experence, full of attention to detail on the server's part. The second was a colossal disappointment.

Maybe I'm expecting a bit too much in terms of quality, but I fail to see how a restaurant can go from one polar opposite to the other in such a short amount of time.

The first time I visited was great. I had the broccoli rigatoni special, and it hit the spot just right. The server was astute enough to bring everyone their own personal bowl of salad (no having to scoop it out onto your plate, lol) and the servers were engaged and happy when they did the obligatory humiliating birthday song for me. I'm well past the point of being embarrassed. I still have a photo of myself as a kid wearing moose antlers at Jack Astor's and looking like a nerd. Those scars still haven't healed.

The most recent time I visited, it was like night and day. The place was filled with rowdy kids running around and screaming. We had an hour-plus long wait just for our salads, never mind the mains. When they did arrive, one of the Riso Italiano dishes (three of us ordered the same thing) had chicken that was burnt to a crisp. After asking it to be sent back, the second order was also burnt. It takes a special kind of person to burn chicken twice even after being told about it. We had to flag the manager down and show it, and to her credit, she immediately apologized and comp'd the dish.

But that isn't even mentioning the scatterbrained server who tried to upcharge us on an order of Buddha Bread after we gave him a coupon for it, servers walking around in a daze and a general feeling of disinterest. Maybe they were having an off day, but I have had much better service at this location in the past.

Surprisingly, this location hasn't messed up our order in the 2 years we've been hitting up the drive thru. That's great! And the drive thru associates are always very friendly. But I feel like I need to warn others that our last visit was very alarming. It was a middle of the night McDonald's run on the way home from work. The large soda we received was NOT safe. It was very clearly a cup of chemicals mixed with soda. Could be cleaner of some sort? Not sure. But it wasn't just faintly chemical-y, it was very strong. Burned my throat and my husband's throats. We were sick all night. We actually kept the drink to bring to management in case they wanted to have it tested. However, when management returned my call 2 days later, rather than trying to apologize or put us at ease, he was very defensive and proceeded to taste the Dr Pepper while I was on the phone to prove that it was fine - 2 days later. I told him, maybe the machine was cleaned with chemicals and wasn't rinsed, or maybe someone poured cleaner into a cup for some reason and then it was used for my drink. Could be anything, really. But he defended the restaurant again and said they do the cleaning in the morning, but we should come in for a free meal to try it again and see that there's nothing wrong with their Dr Pepper. I told this manager that I sincerely was NOT looking to receive anything, that a free meal is not necessary. I was only contacting them to make them aware that this happened because had I given the drink to my child who might not know not to continue drinking it if it tastes weird, things could have ended up very differently. It would be unfortunate for someone to become extremely ill or die because they refused to even try to get to the bottom of what might have happened. Check surveillance, do something to see if the employees were being careless or even by accident did something dangerous. I knew going into this that it was going to be pointless, but I knew I had to try. And furthermore, from a customer service point of view, maybe you should tell your customers, ""We apologize for the inconvenience, we will look into it and make sure this doesn't happen again"" or something like that, instead of trying to prove to me over the phone that I am wrong.

Saturday night DH and I took 5 out-of-town guests for dinner there, promising them a great meal.  Not so much.  Of course, the fried green tomatoes, (which they have or don't, depending on tomato availability) were sublime as usual.  We gobbled up two servings!  Salads were fresh and crisp and delicious---but the entrees were such a disappointment!

My lemon tilapia was very fishy tasting, unseasoned, with a hardly any detectable sauce to moisten it.  DH said his burger okay, but not memorable,  One of our party ordered the prime rib special and proclaimed it outstanding.  (I love prime rib and would have normally ordered it, but the one time I ordered it at H&S, the rub was so salty we had to return our meals and I didn't want to chance it)  Two of our party ordered the sirloin with gorgonzola sauce....one proclaimed their's was excellent---the other was served a sauce drizzled piece of gristle that had to be returned----and as accomodating as our server was, it took forever to get the replacement meal and the rest of us had finished our meals before it arrived.  He ended up carrying it off as take-away.  The fifth member of our group ordered the mahi-mahi and he said it was dry and tasteless and the small amount of pineapple salsa wasn't enough to off-set that.  He detected no BBQ seasoning.

It is because of this deal that the zombies have invited the living to their ""Z Theater"" to watch them put on a show. 

To my pleasant surprise, these performers are not your average stripper/prostitute turned actors and actresses. All of them can actually sing and dance. The show is approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes but it seemed longer than that probably because they have one act perform right after another. Basically there was never a dull moment. There is even one part of the show where they handed out free jello shots to the audience! The most impressive part of the show was that every musical piece was conducted by a live band. Live bands always makes any venue better. 

Minus the 1 star because of two main things that annoyed me. One was that the theater itself which is rather cozy, does not have a good AC system. It was pretty warm from the moment you step foot in there. I was a bit uncomfortable due to some sweating and I was already wearing just a tee shirt and shorts. Second was that since this theater is adjacent to other venues whether down stairs or on the second level, you can hear the music from those other venues. To me this puts kind of a damper on the show im trying to watch.

Some random info. Of course you have to be at least 18 to watch this. No outside drinks or food allowed. They do provide you with a cocktail waitress to take your drink orders though. For the general admission seats I recommend that you get your tickets as early as possible so that you can sit closer to the stage. Not sure about the app on your phone but on the main Yelp website you can enter the words ""Yelp50"" to get your tickets discounted by 50 percent. You can pay extra to sit in the VIP sections that are closer to the stage. You are allowed to take pics at any time during the show. Just a word of advice if you do decide to take pics. TURN OFF YOUR FLASH. The pic will come out just the same since a majority of the lighting is on stage. Plus the flash itself gets really annoying to those that are around you.

All in all, I thought it made for a great night out whether its with a loved one or with just your buddies.

This place was the best breakfast I've had in years!
The fruit tasted like it was just picked from a plant and washed and cut for my plate!
The eggs tasted like they were just picked from a farm!
The bread was just perfect!

From the minute you enter you get the cozy, little neighborhood cafe feel. The place smelled amazing, full of fresh pastries, coffee and delicious sandwhiches and salads. 

It is small so they can't seat many people inside so go early before the rush or you might end up taking it to go.  It's a fresh, unique cafe with a variety of sandwhichea, large portioned salads and thirst quenching coffees, juices and teas. 

It does seem like a spot that is utilized mostly by the employees within the business complex, huge business complex so I am sure they get plenty busy. I'll admit that's why I stopped in, it's next to my building and I needed a quick bite. Sure happy I did stop in though, I'll be going back!

The service was great as well. We were welcomed right as we walked in, the girl who took our order was incredibly friendly , the guy who dropped our food off came back to check on us and as we left everyone said thank you and good bye! Awesome!!",2015-09-03 05:27:16

Honestly I'm not kidding when I say this is the least expensive place I've ever been to. We got a couple American honey shots and they were only $2.75 each. Like what?!

The sides were also very small (and extra $).  This is unfortunate because, again, the food was actually pretty tasty.  (I'd avoid the crab mac and cheese -- it wasn't that great.) I recommend going on Thursday night when they have a ""Date Night"" menu and two people can eat for $49.  That's a much better value than the money we paid on a Friday night.

I had the opportunity of not only going to this restaurant a couple times but also going with a large group of people who are very open about passing food around for others to try. Needless to say, I've had the opportunity to try a lot of different things from the menu!

My favorite menu items? The Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites were delicious and are a great item to share. Last time I went, I split the Farmer Brown burger - simple egg, ham, cheddar, lettuce and mayo burger - and could have definitely eaten more than half. Finally, most importantly --- THE SHAKES! My favorite is the Salted Nutella Crunch followed by the Caramel Pretzel and Espresso Love. I also enjoyed Grand-Dad's Secret because the bourbon flavor is very pronounced. Plus, even though a shake may be listed on the Classic menu, Burgatory will happily spike any shake for you.

Least favorite menu items? Really, only a salad (not sure which one) that my brother-in-law and his wife ordered. They said it was positively drenched in dressing and was practically inedible. 

Not only the food but also the marketing impresses at Burgatory. I've worked in retail for the last six years, so how a retailer or restaurant attracts a consumer is always forefront in my mind. Burgatory has fantastic marketing covering the walls of the restaurant and on the tables. It's not the sort of place that you leave and can't remember a month later what the name of the restaurant was....

All that to say, I love Burgatory, would recommend it to anyone, and will be going back very soon!",2012-10-21 01:38:49

XOzuzHkR4ubn4UoC5SRZNA,_pOEDJODvaBQwr_KMdG0LQ,x0Ec6gz07SBnWrBOQLisiA,5,4,0,1,"Was fortunate enough to hear that Chopt was having a limited free lunch serving on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. I snuck into the new location around 11:30am and was greeted by a friendly (manager?) who was helping direct the first-timers and show us the lay of the land. 

A warning to newbies: expect this place to be very busy in the first upcoming weeks. Chop't has a bit of a cult following and rightfully so. Expect people to be a little bit slow in ordering until they get a hang of the layout. This is the south after all. 

After standing in a long, but quickly moving queue, you order from a well-prepared selection of salad choices, as well as a make-your-own option. They also have a pretty awesome kids menu if that's your thing.  Now let me tell you, people come to this place for the ingredients. They are plentiful and so fresh and there are really so many different choices. I chose the Mexican Caesar salad which was appointed one of the ""first time favorites"". After ordering and customizing your choice, you and your salad are then assigned to a ""chopper"". 

The ""chopper"" allows you to customize the type and amount of dressing/salt/and pepper, and then thoroughly mixes and chops it all together. Don't let the size of the bowl fool you, after they chop everything and smash it into the bowl...this is A LOT of salad. Think, hard to finish in one sitting sized salad. The guy next to me in line opted for the hot quinoa bowl option which looked totally delicious and will most certainly be one of the next choices I try when I get there. 

At the register, this time they allowed us to enjoy the meal gratis, while suggesting a donation to a cool local charity: Green Teacher Network. Don't skip the drinks, because their sweet tea and lemonade sweetened with honey is not to be missed. Their dining room is small and noisy, but has a comfortable mix of booths and regular tables. 

Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the employees were friendly and quick, and you guys will definitely be seeing me again soon.",2015-09-17 18:58:41

What I like: 

1. No ropes for kids to swing around on. 
2. This place is NOT at day care center for soccer Mom's to drop the kids off while they enjoy happy hour with their boy friends. 
3. The climbing problems are sophisticated and have been set by someone who actually know's what a V5 should feel like. 
4. The height is a little too much for a drop so it keeps posers and little kids out of the gym. You may even have to down climb a little. 
5. The employees don't act like they know more than you and they don't treat you like you're a newbie. 

What I don't like: It's a little more expensive so I hope they share memberships with the other gym in town for access. I wish they offered better deals for a full year commitment and I would like to see a retail section so they can sell Shoes, Chalk, and Apparel.

Although I did eat too much to even get to that point I did manage to devour all of my beef stroganoff. I mean the modern classy eastcoast style bar and restaurant is definitely cool. It kind of reminded me of what local bar probably looked like in New York or Boston (based on movies I've seen because I've never actually gone there. So what would I know?). My food was amazing, and delicious. I know it was stupid of me to ask if they could take out the peas in my stroganoff (what was I thinking! no peas?!), our server was kind of rude about it. ""It comes with the sauce, and you can't take it out"" is what he said. Kind of walked away with a grunt too. The server didn't even ask to refill my drink once, and wasn't very attentive either, and half of what we requested he didn't return with, if he ever even came to our table. OH!

It is worth the effort, though. When you want a quick sandwich, not many places can beat a fully loaded Italian or Wreck from this place. They run it through the oven to toast the bread, heat the meat, and melt the cheese. And, if you add bacon, it makes that nice and crispy, too. Then you add the toppings and produce at the next station. I think I've had every sandwich on the menu, including some of the specials that are no longer around. I had the simply dressed turkey with spinach and roasted red peppers this time, which was pretty tasty, despite just having basil mayo as the topping. 

The soups and chili are good, and people say their shakes are not bad, either. (I still haven't tried one of those). Their cookies are better than most places that aren't bakeries, and even some that are. They're made every day, and if you hit it right, you can sometimes get them right out of the oven!

--Concept--

RHR: Small, intimate setting wherein vinyl toy enthusiasts can browse through toys, books, clothes, knick knacks and art work. 

Other Places: Large, lawless warehouses of misery and confusion where cheap, useless toys are left strewn about aisles as unsupervised children topple displays and parents are forced to watch their childhood memories be forcibly stripped of their nostalgic dignity and peddled to their own clueless children. 

""Oh wow I bet you wish they had Transformers when you were a kid.""

Guess what, mouth-breather? THEY DID.

Winner: Red Hot Robot

--Staff & Management--

RHR: Mild-mannered owner Jason Kingingham smiles pleasantly at you as you browse the store, eager to strike up a conversation or impart his knowledge. Newbies and connoisseurs alike have a friend in Jason.

Other Places: Apathetic high schoolers and the sloppy managers who love them...inappropriately...and outside of the confines of the law.

Winner: Red Hot Robot

--Price--

Red Hot Robot: Economically reasonable, placed clearly and openly for anyone to see.

Other Places: Here, take this to a scanner and see how much this is. It's how much? Fuck it. Let's go to Wal-Mart. They probably have it for cheaper, and in undamaged packaging. Come to think of it, I need some things. Yeah, put it back, we're going to walmart.

Ordered cocktails and they came promptly. Between two of us we tried the following during the meal: 
Raisin rummy - easy to drink, vanilla notes, incredible aroma.

Old Besse - spicy with Ginger, fruity.
Black walnut Manhattan - my fave of the four, sweet aroma, medium bodied sipping cocktail. So much flavor.
Vonnegut - spicy, citrus, delicious.
Cocktails here are great and having been to parlor in the area I'd say this place is going to them a run for their money.

Food was pretty good but the prices here are all over the map. You can add cornbread to any order for $1.00 and it's delicious and muffin sized. For an appy we ordered the hush puppies which were $12.00 and classified under the ""Trays"" section of the menu. When they came out they were on a tray but in the tiniest basket and we got 8. We asked our waitress before we ate them if we had actually received what we thought we had ordered and asked if it was actually $12.00 and the waitress said yes. 

We saw a tray of chicken wings go out and there had to have been at least 10 wings on the tray and that was only $1.00 more than the hush puppies.

We also got the pulled chicken sandwich $10.00, and the 1/2 pound pulled pork $10, and the broccoli salad $4.00. All of that seemed a reasonable price to pay. Service was good but for the reaction to our question about the appy. 

We also saw the chips and queso head to another table and I'm pretty sure the menu had that listed as $13.00. I would say for what I saw that also seemed very overpriced.

Place has potential but it's getting a 3/5 for the major pricing issues on the menu. I'm hesitant to order anything else from the Trays menu. You'd be fine though if you ordered meat and sides and corn bread.",2016-09-12 01:50:21

The outside of the building is a bit deceiving and the parking is pretty tight. I wasn't quite prepared for what we stepped in to.

The white sangria was the better of the two with pineapple as the fruit while the other had apples. Ive had better sangria for a better price ($11 a glass) is steep for the small wine glass you get that's mostly filled with fruit. The chimi was delicious and comes with guac. The portion size and presentation were great. The veggie skewers were sadly just green and yellow squash, not other veggies. They come with the cotija cheese on it and  a unique sauce on the side (which isn't mentioned in the description). Quesadilla was also good (hard to mess up), the green chili was a great portion, it wasn't spicy to me but was flavorful. Some of the chicken appeared to be a little over cooked as it was very chewy but overall it is something I would order again. The chip trio was bean ceviche, guac and salsa. They only gave us one spoon so we had to pour it onto our plates so it became messy. The guac and salsa were good, the bean ceviche is different.

When we arrived we debated between sitting inside the restaurant because the decor looks so amazing, or sitting outside where we could watch the people from the casino passing by. Ultimately sitting outside won out. I enjoyed where they seated us because it was back in the corner by the wall, not right on the outside isle where people could actually walk up and touch our food. The only thing I didn't consider was that outside seating (which really is still inside the casino) has lower tables, the height of coffee tables, so you really have to lean over to eat or be proficient with your chopsticks!

Shishito Peppers ($11) and super hot, but I loved them!!
Salmon Sashimi ($10 for 2 pc.) melted like butter on the tongue
Tuna Sashimi ($11 for 2 pc.) soft and tender like you'd expect

Even though it's been a few years since I lived in this community, I make an excuse to visit everytime I go to see my friends in Bridgeland. My favourite items to snag from here are the big ol' glass bottles of Santa Cruz Lemonade, Green Cuisine tofu, and kale chips for a snack when I'm too lazy for my own. I do notice the prices for some of the items here are quite a bit higher than some other retailers in Calgary, such as specialty items like the aforementioned tofu. But I digress. 
Another thing I love are the little things that they post on their big sign on the side of the building. And the fact that they have a ""Bukowski"" sandwich which is just ham on rye. Very clever you guys. Might I suggest a vegan sandwich called ""The Morrissey?"" If you put this on the menu I'll visit ten times more.

He was nice but we could tell he wasn't familiar with everything yet. There was an issue with our best buy credit card and we didn't like the way the manager RJ handled it. He just kept saying to enter our information and just keep signing for the purchase. We just wanted to make sure we weren't going to get charged multiple times. He said we can either call the bank and have them figure out the issue or just keep trying until it declines the transaction. I finally said to just call the bank but RJ said that's going to take longer and wouldn't void the transaction right away. At this point we didn't even want the tv anymore but Adrian and another rep named Aaron said they were going to take care of the situation. 5-10 mins later we ended up leaving with the TV (such a good deal) and all because of Adrian and Aaron. Before we finished the transaction RJ finally comes around and says he voided the previous transaction and that we should expect the remaining balance on the card within 3-5 business days. I think they need to give Aaron a promotion and demote the other guy. No offense. Btw, 10-15 mins later, a different rep had asked my husband if he had seen this other customer that just walked out. Turns out that customer walked out with a free drone and no one even stopped to check if he had a receipt. -_-",2015-03-24 03:00:42

Still, I am not a self-proclaimed taco connoisseur and will not pretend to know everything there is to know about the dish. 

I will tell you that in my short-lived taco-eating career, Cabo Fish Taco definitely tops the list of delicious tacos I've eaten. And I've tried all kinds. Korean bulgogi tacos to Vietnamese pork belly tacos to traditional carne asada tacos. 

Seems to me that there are three main components  to the taco: 

1) the protein 
2) the case (wrap)
3) the garnish

While most of the tacos I've eaten have excelled in 1 and 3, few have been able to come up with an astounding 2 the way Cabo Fish Taco does. I would describe the ""case"" as a crisp soft shell. It's a light and fluffy, doughy bite with a crisp finish (literally). Reminds me of the Indian puri. Then you get this magnificent choice of beef, chicken, blackened mahi-mahi, lemon grilled shrimp...the list goes on of meat to flavor your taco up. Loved the shrimp in particular. Finally they sprinkle on an assortment of sweet, sour, tangy or creamy toppings that are powerful and enticing. Even after you inhale the taco though, you don't feel like a beached whale. You could eat these all day!

They also have some sick margaritas (see photo)

The one area that disappointed me greatly was the quality of the appetizers. Yes the guac is fresh avocado - but unseasoned and plain? The ""queso"" tasted nothing short of Moes Grill's mass-produced queso. They could've tried harder on the easy parts!

And through the month of October 2011, the AYCE price for lunch AND dinner is *******$18.95******** per person.  That includes almost all rolls (except the super fancy ones) and sides like edamame and miso soup.  However, this price is ONLY available at the Henderson location.

My favorite roll is the Spicy Tuna Crazy Roll which is a deep fried spicy tuna with jalapeno and cream cheese.  It's sooooooooo good, just the right amount of crunchiness and subtle spicy flavor.  My new favorite roll is the I.T.Y. (I Told You), also deep fried but with shrimp.  (I may or may not have a penchant for deep-fried rolls.)   

Although the menu seems overwhelming, the rolls mainly tend to be a variation of shrimp, salmon, tuna, scallops, eel, cream cheese, avocado and jalapenos. 

The space in this location is a bit odd; one-half has tables and chairs like, uh, a restaurant.  The other-half is sort of just an open space with a pool table.  It's VERY casual.  The service does tend to be slow at the tables, so its best to sit at the bar if you want quick and efficient service.  

Nonetheless, the sushi (and chefs) here are great.  They also have a frequent flier card, buy 10 AYCE and 1 free!  If that's wrong, I don't want to be right...",2011-10-14 04:43:19

We ordered the Gotham pizza which comes with pepperoni and sausage. The meat had plenty of flavor and the pepperoni was crispy and thin. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed eating the toppings lol. Cheese was abundant and delicious as well. Lots of stretchy gooey goodness with each bite! I would have given this place 5 stars, but I feel it really falls short in terms of the crust. With everything so flavorful and delicious it really contrasts the plain and burnt tasting crust. It felt like I was eating cardboard at some parts lol. If they added some garlic or cheese flavor to the crust then it would have been perfect.

One pizza was enough to fill up 2 people and it only cost about $35 which is pretty good considering it is a meal on the strip.

Overall I'd recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't don't do yet. It is easily one of my favorite pizza spots on the strip and I'll probably be back to try out their other flavors. Hopefully the crust will be better lol.",2017-11-26 03:45:28

The reason we don't frequent this neighborhood dive i because you get so little for such a high price. The food is high quality. The portions are tiny. The menu item that annoys me the most is the ravioli...you get about 6 little raviolis and are expected to make a meal of it. 

And I heard a rumor that they're raising their prices because they were just featured on the Food Network.

First of all, the presentation was very instagram-worthy. On top of the fried chicken was a monstrous amount of curly shredded carrots. An amount good enough to justify that eating fried chicken and waffles can't be too bad for you. lol. Moving on to the fried chicken, it was deliciously tasty and flavourful!

My previous visit was for quick drinks and appetizers before catching a concert and I had a blast.  I was excited for a sit down dinner experience at the high energy Sake Rok!

Service:  4/5 The hostess, our lead server and all the other servers helping out and bringing our food and keeping the drinks filled were awesome.  Everyone was very friendly and engaging and the emcee leading the sake bombs stopped by to say hi to my teenage niece and her grandmother.   Other than having to wait 30 minutes for our restaurant week mochi dessert, and 20 more minutes for the honey toast we ordered, the service was top notch.  A huge party of 60+ came in right before dessert  I found out they were Cisco employees who were coming in before going to the T-Mobile arena for their Cisco live concert. I understand service might slow down, but I'm pretty sure they knew this group was coming in and it didn't appear they were completely prepared.  This doesn't take away from the awesome staff.

Restaurant week $50 Dinner Course: 4/5
Edamame:  Fresh edmame and very tasty with the Sea Salt and Lime
Hanger Steak:  The highlight of the dinner, delicious and prepped perfectly for me at medium rare.  The Mushrooms and the Aka Miso sauce were fantastic.  Coming back for this.
Sushi: Chef chose your 4 piece Nigiri and I selected the 1/2 Kamikaze roll.  No issues considering this is a high volume fusion restaurant with sushi.
Mochi:  You get 3 assorted flavor mochi which was perfect.  Madre went with the Sata Andagi/Japanese doughnuts which were tasty.
Off the restaurant menu we ordered the squid nigiri which was fine and the Honey Toast which was excellent.  They didn't skimp on the Ice Cream and Berries well done.

Ambiance: 5/5  I love the Ultra modern Neo Japanese deco. I love that there's an emcee leading the sake bomb charge and that the servers do dance shows throughout the night. The ""Godzilla Platter"" presentation is a spectacle that's fun. The Emcee and DJ keeps the energy up vibe lively.

Value: 3.5/5 The restaurant week menu gave pretty good value in my opinion.  It's a little cheaper than what we would have paid off the menu but the in house entertainment is where the real value kicks in.

Sake Rok is a great place to grab a quick bite and drinks before seeing a concert at T-Mobile of partying on the strip.  It's loud, fun and the in house entertainment (and booze) will get you ready for a night out.  There are lots of great opportunities for Social Media pics and videos to keep your followers entertained.  I will be back for the sake rok craziness.  Enjoy.. =)",2017-07-11 16:50:24

The first time I went with girlfriends and we sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive, although the person who closed our tabs at the end messed up and overcharged me...like by a lot. She reversed it but it took several days for things to correct themselves in my bank account. The second time my sister and I went and ordered at the counter. We stood in line about 10 minutes and we finally got to the front woman behind the counter said they were on a table hold. Since they assign you a table and all the tables were full you basically just had to stand there and wait for something to open up. Luckily something did and we were seated and eating in a short amount of time. 

My issues with the concept are: 

1. Why am I waiting in line to order and not paying? There were tons of servers who could have just waited on you in a normal fashion. That way you also know the wait to get a table before standing in a really long line only to be told that you have to wait even longer. 

2. Why do the servers ask you if you need anything? What can they bring you? You've ordered your food at the counter and you've filled your own drink...maybe drinks from the bar? I don't get it. 

Despite these issues I will go back for the burgers and fries...I just wish they'd rethink the wacky concept.",2016-04-17 01:28:06

Our waiter was really sweet & accommodating, if only I could remember his name.

My friend and I order the oysters, the big ass pork shank (yes, that's the actual name), and the Bone Marrow Log with escargot and mushrooms. It doesn't seem like a lot of food but it was really filling for two people. Especially, the big ass pork shank! Everything was very flavorful and the pork shank melted in your mouth. I highly recommend it as well as the bone marrow log. I actually recommend everything we ordered. We were not disappointed at all.

Native Grill offers various wing styles and flavors. On this visit we tried the Honey BBQ and the Asiago Parmesan Strippers, chicken bacon ranch flatbread, fried zucchini, and hamburger sliders.  I didn't particularly care for the chicken strippers or the sliders. The chicken strippers with drowned in sauce and the sliders were slightly overcooked and somewhat dry. However, the chicken bacon ranch flatbread and fried zucchini were delicious

It's inconspicuously placed on green valley next to some apartments and an past a strip mall. But once you find it, it's a nice spot. On Fridays and Saturdays they have live music usually local artists or small artists and the people who play are always super nice and will take requests sometimes. I would say they have quite a few more country music acts then anything else which is fine by me! They also have a pool table which is easily accessible since this place is usually not super crowded unless they have an event going on and even then it doesn't get that crazy ANOTHER HUGE PLUS! Since I'm mostly opposed to human contact. 

Now on to the bar. There is bar seating and  table seating near the bar. The beer selection is practically non existent, they have maybe 4 or 5 beers on tap which sucks if your preference lyes with beer. However they will make you basic cocktails e.i. Whisky sour, jack and coke, vodka pineapple...but anything beyond that will prove to be too complex for most of the bar tenders here (but they are all very nice!) 

The food is pretty good. Especially if you are looking for something late and actually good. I've had the nachos which are big enough for 4 people to share. I've also had the salmon very tasty not 5 star but it's a bar so ya.

I started with the stuffed jalapeno appetizer, which was just, well, kind of boring. Ground seasoned chicken on top of a cut-in-half grilled jalapeno with marinara sauce on top, super basic ya'll.

Next I had the oxtail fried rice and omg that stuff needs to come with a warning label, ox tail tastes like dirt. It's gamey AF and I like gamey, I'm down for lamb any of the week and I order birria tacos now and again, but ox tail is another level. It's also got that sinewy fat situation going on that just makes me gag. I know some folks love it, those who order the tendon at pho places for example, would love ox tail, but not I.

Their menu has something for everyone. They offer you classic sandwiches, salads and of course burgers! Some of my favorites to order from here are the Pit Burger Combo which comes with 1/3lb burger, frys, and a soda all for $8.95! You can even add a domestic beer for  $0.70 or a import for $1.25. Sounds like the perfect combo to me. I also really like the Chef Salad. It's huge and comes loaded with ham, turkey, swiss and american cheese. If you feel like a sandwich the classic Club sandwich is always a great choice. I must mention that when ordering frys or any other fried goodies they give you a squirt bottle of Ranch and Fry Sauce!! So awesome!!!!

(The last 3 times I gotta say they were 5 star occasions too bad I forgot to update my review to reflect so) To our surprise they HAVE CHANGED THEIR MENU. I doubt Oreganos is suffering financially but it looks like the changes on their menu is to try to get an extra 20 cents off every dollar. We also noticed their quality went down(could of been a one off situation) but as you can see from my pictures their wings were horrible, the one thing I come for was horrible :-( the sauce was the same but the wings themselves seemed to be attacked by a pack of dogs or exposed to radiation because they looked  deformed and tiny. I would of not complained to the waitress but each wing is $1.00 now so you gotta get what you paid for. They ended up replacing 3 of the(I had eaten some as I was hungry) ones the manager saw but by the time they came back out we were done eating. Manager said quality had not eaten but as you can see my picture it tells otherwise.

The pizza.(Chicago pan not deep dish) had a real weird texture and seem uncooked. At that time we were done complaining so we just ate it. By the way they only have their signatures for the thin crust on the menu but if you remember your favorite from deep dish or pan they will make it for you. Seems like they are trying to promote build your own and pay for each topping individually.

I feel like Oreganos is trying to aim towards gourmet modern restaurant. Which kind of takes away from what Oreganos is.

The strategic placement of this restaurant definitely adds to the allure. I went during happy hour and got their mussels and sweet potato fries as recommended by my waitress.

Mussels - delicious, buttery goodness
Sweet Potato Fries - Good fries, weird sauce. The selling point was their homemade special sauce for the sweet potato fries which didn't really impress me at all. Too sweet and had little to no taste of anything else. 

Would I go here again? Only when waiting for Greyhound.",2014-06-18 15:19:20

The location was easy to find and the interior was very well decorated! We were greeted promptly and we'll attended to poo ur entire experience. The staff wasn't very well versed on the drink menu, but that was fine! They actually had a pretty extensive drink menu compared to other authentic thai places. 
We ordered the combination appetizer plate to share. This had some sort of chicken skewers, fried tofu, egg rolls, wontons and sweet potato pancakes with a variety of dipping sauces. Everything was pretty good, but the variety of hor dourves was really what made it great! 
I ordered the thai green curry with tofu and my fiancée had the chicken pad thai. Both hot, but not thai hot (which I always assume is code word for pain). My curry was fabulous. Creamy and flavorful only made better by the hearty serving of vegetables and steamed tofu (my fav) swimming in it. C was very pleased with his pad thai and we both cleaned our plates, even though the servings were quite generous. I would absolutely recommend it and return myself!",2015-04-06 05:00:00

Before I tell you about the mediocre food, I do want to start off by letting you know that this place is so cute and offers a very homey atmoshphere- it's like the Partridge Family meets the Brady Bunch. The décor is adorable, I'll give them that. It's total 60's/70's retro....nothing psychedelic, just orange and yellow booths  with old wood paneling on the walls and cute flowers that adorn the orange and yellow hanging lights. 

The food is nothing to do back flips over. It's not bad, but it's nothing special, no knock-your-socks-off omelets or skillets or anything like that. In fact, they don't even offer skillets, which is why I prefer Lou's Diner down the street over this place (But Lou's is a bit pricier, so we tend to go to Sunshine Café more than we'd like - cheapskates, I know). 

 They offer 3 types of potatoes. The hash browns are very plain and they don't pile 'em on your plate like I like (oink oink). So why do I continue to go here you ask? It's friggin CHEAP!!! My 2 egg breakfast is only $4.95, and my son always gets their HUGE mountain man type platter of food and it's only about $8, so it's worth it to have someone else cook your breakfast once in a while. 

I think the food at Sunshine Café is really only 2 star worthy, but because the service is always outstanding and the place is just so freakin cute I'm bumping it up to 3. Also kudos for the Trivial Pursuit cards on all the tables....hereby making any wait for our order (which usually isn't that long because they're so quick, even when they're super busy) pleasurably fly by.",2012-02-10 19:52:32

The fries are kinda small and they put it in a small cup which is not that worth it. There aren't a lot of vegetarian options and the vegetarian options that they do have come with no Patty. I would expect this to be less expensive but it's actually almost just as expensive as getting the meat option which makes no sense to me.

The hostess greeted us then seated us at a table which we didn't like (hate to be that customer but whatever) when we asked for a different table she quickly wiped down a booth and sat us there which was much better. After about 5 minutes of looking over the menu the server stops by to quickly greet us and leaves. 10 minutes later the server comes back to take drink orders, by that time it had been 15 minutes since we were seated and,  we were ready to order. The server recommended the pomegranate beet cucumber soda, so we both ordered that. Then for my main I ordered the Herb Alfredo with chicken. After about 10 minutes our drinks and water come out. The soda was not good. It just tasted like cucumber water with sugar and some club soda and red food dye. Not what I wanna pay $4.50 for (we ordered virgin). After about 15 minutes our mains come out and this is where the real disappointment starts. My herb alfredo was tasteless! The sauce had way too much cream and not enough cheese. At $24 a plate that was a huge let down. The alfredo sauce was watery and could barely get a grip on the penne (which is a weird pasta choice for alfredo, yes it makes a difference) anyways we decided to forgo dessert. Overall the server was friendly and polite it's not his fault he was busy. I'm extremely disappointed in the food and hope this place gets their act together.

Looks like street parking is your only option here. For a late night visit on a weekday there were actually quite a few people there. Plenty seated around the bar area which opens to an outdoor seating area. They didn't have any balcony seating available, they had a large party over in that area so we were seated at a table. Our server was actually really nice, he checked on us many times. They were also good about keeping the table cleared of empty glasses and plates which I like. My problem was that our table was consistently being dripped on(condensation) by the overhead a/c exposed ductwork. No, we didn't ask to be moved because honestly for most of the meal I think we though it was just moisture from the water glasses on the table . Wednesday night was $5 wines/cider/sangria night. I decided on the grilled Caesar salad and a sangria. I have to say I was very surprised when the salad came, not at all what I was expecting. I'm not saying it was a bad thing, but I believe that the menu should describe what you're getting so you aren't shocked when it comes. It was 2, what I would consider small, grilled romaine lettuce leaves with Caesar dressing, anchovies and parmesan and a huge piece of grilled bread. The bread I believe was supposed to be garlic toast and I didn't get any garlic flavor, but it was good and a nice addition to the salad. The salad was actually delicious, the crispy anchovies were fabulous. My only problem is that it was Very small and I wasn't expecting it prepared that way since the menu did not say that. The sangria was good, pretty weak, but that's what I expect these days at every restaurant with daily drink specials!

But luckily being a small group, we managed to get a small table near the front west side corner which suited us well. 

The interior is a pub meets sports bar cross over, which is a bit different and more casual than the normal gastropub vibe, but still worked. Not sure if it was because it was a Saturday night, but there was a surprising mix of music including Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Justice and other mainstream electro tunes.

The draught beer selection is rather impressive with lots of good local and import selections to choose from. $2.43 Jager shots any time of the day is an interesting value prop as well, but being the driver for the night I was unable to take advantage.

As for the food, well first thing I'll say is that we ordered too much to eat, but 3 of 4 items were deemed successes. We started with the Prosciutto Pio Tosini which is a lovely serving tray filled with prociutto, butter, a loaf of uncut tostini bread, and a pile of nuts which all worked quite well with eachother. Our other started was not such a success. We went with the Redneck Poutine and were quite disappointed by it. The lamb was good but didnt really fit the rest of the flavours, and most importantly the tater tots were a mushy mess in the bottom of the dish. A waste of $12.

The mains however were great. Wer'e talking one of the top 5 pulled pork sandwiches in the city! Not as saucy as I usually prefer but still a perfect balance of flavour with a pretty healthy amount of pork on the bun. I also got to try the Open Face Sloppy Josephine in all of its glory with the stacked pieces of lamb on top of a really thick piece of bread. I really liked it, and feel it redeemed the lamb disappointment of the redneck poutine. For sides, the DF Frites are better than Sweet Potato Frites by a long shot. The sweet potatoe fries seemed a bit too limp and greasy.

We arrived at about 10am on Saturday and were seated right away. Being a newb to the joint, it was a little bit confusing of what to do once you enter but figured out we needed to make our way to the cash register for the hostess to seat us. Ordered ice coffees which were fitting with the hot weather we have been having along with the smoked salmon omelette and focaccia bread and my boyfriend had the challah french toast. My boyfriend loved his french toast, which I had a bite of. It was deliciously sweet with a little bit of crunch and it was surprising with the brie. My smoked salmon omelette did not have any cheese as I did not opt for the goat cheese. Looking back I think it would have been wise if I had - the omelette was good with the dill and the herbs and tomato but an omelette needs some cheese! The focaccia bread was okay though there wasn't much flavor so I'm thinking I'll try the pumpernickel next time. The hostess and waitress were both nice and provided great service which is always a plus.

There are some foods in this world that are meant to be blackened, like chicken and fish.

Unfortunately, pizza isn't one of them. 

I get that some people like a ridiculously crispy crust. I get it. I still feel like they could pull the pie out a minute earlier and it would be absolutely perfect. But nooooo, they want ""well done"" bread. Hate to break it to ya, but well done bread is burnt bread. 

First visit here was weird. I think it was during opening week so the staff was overwhelmed and working out the kinks. The floor plan of tables is somewhat cramped and all the soda is only served in plastic bottles that one would get from a convenience store.

So after some hemming and hawing, I bullied him into it. The next question, Where do we go? I told him about this recent episode of Triple D and to my amazement he had seen it to and suddenly he was all happy about a birthday dinner. 

Like most places nowadays, they don't take reservations. My brother called ahead and was told it should be fine for our time for a table of 8, a Wednesday night mind you. We were seated and take everyone else's word if not mine, the restaurant is small(read:TINY). There are probably 12 tables, max. We were given menus quickly and had our drink orders taken and brought out promptly. The table started with a mixed bruschetta of a traditional tomato and basil and a pesto with tomato. Both were excellent. They have a bunch of other choices as well. We also had the caprese salad, fresh balls of mozzarella, tomatoes, and romaine covered in balsamic vinegar. This too was great. 

Dinner choices were varied. I had a fettuccine with chicken, green chilies, and sun dried tomato. It had a garlic-wine sauce. Sprinkle on a little red pepper flakes for a little extra heat and you'll be happy. Get the fresh pasta, pay the extra buck, and you'll be one smiling mother#$*&er! Fresh pasta makes a world of difference. I sampled everything at the table. The macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, the ravioli, and the penne with sausage. The regular plain old red pasta sauce they use is great! It had such a nice sweetness to it I could have had a bowl of it.  Get the mac & cheese.  It is baked to perfection!  We aren't talking Kraft mac and cheese here either people.  This has real cheese, not some powder cheese.

We also indulged in dessert and coffee. The flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato was delicious. The cappuccino was great too. I was told the key lime cheesecake was good as well. 

The dining experience was nice. I thought the prices were reasonable and the serving size ample. We spoke with the owner, Richard, for long stretches throughout the meal and he was very personable and answered any questions or gave suggestions on meals. He saw me taking a picture of my food and asked if this was going to be on Yelp! I assured him it would be. He told me I wasn't getting anything free because of it, with a smile and a laugh. Love the NY attitude.

IKeG9KgR7XB6KZxb4I4hFw,HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,DmdtVBgXWk285nAUWXfvvw,4,5,0,4,"I really dug this place. As with any hotel, especially in a town I'd never been to, I wasn't sure what to expect and I did a lot of reading beforehand to make sure I knew the pros and cons. So after a lovely stay, I can tell you that my expectations were met. I knew about the pros and cons, expected the pros and cons, and loved the pros and forgave any cons. I feel like it's only appropriate now to list them:

PROS:
Honestly, for me it's about location. You have a couple of options in downtown Montreal, and so you should choose wisely. Broadly speaking, you can stay closer to the water and in the old cobblestone old school Montreal, where you might find more tourists but obviously plenty of things to see, do, eat, shop, and so on. Then you have downtown, but a little removed from that. Hotel Zero-1 is the latter. It's perched on the edge of Chinatown, and it's right on the corner of Boulevard Saint-Laurent, which is pretty much where the action is, as far as I could tell. I walked to an incredible small plates restaurant, past a few clubs, near plenty of shopping, and actually was able to walk through Chinatown and those small, pedestrian-only side streets to the bigger downtown hotels, and just across from the old school part of town. It's near a small open space, you have very late night eats a block away at the Montreal Pool Room, and I couldn't be happier. When I have to choose between tourist and real people town, I pick real people part of town every time.

Staff was super friendly. I got checked in really quickly, they gave me the down low on the restaurant, and the housekeeping staff was really attentive and accommodating. No complaints. My room was pretty darn clean.

There's a restaurant attached, and they had a Halloween party going on one night, so you may not have to go far if you're looking for an interesting time. No idea how often there are events, but at the very least food is at your fingertips.

I liked the decor. It's not for everyone. It's very modern, a little dark (in the dark and fabulous way, not the drab way) and in pretty good shape. 

CONS
The rooms are a little bit narrow and small. I honestly didn't mind--I was prepared for it. But that shower is just too narrow. And the showerhead is mounted on the side of the ""tunnel"" and not the end, so I felt like I had to plaster myself against the wall to get far enough away that the stream could hit me right.

Parking is a beast in Montreal, so I knew I'd be paying. I don't recall how much it ended up being, something around $20? But the real con here is not that you have to valet, but that it takes 30 minutes to get your car from the valet. That's not hyperbole, either. They told me it would be 30 minutes, and that's what it took. Apparently the lot they use is up the street, it takes a while, you wait, you get the picture.


I was very happy about my stay. Those are some nitpicky cons, but if they're a big deal, you might stay elsewhere. For the price, however, I thought this was right on.",2016-11-19 06:54:51

I had the chicken and waffle which was undeniably good, and it particularly stood out from chicken and waffles at other establishments because of the cayenne butter.

I stopped in on Wednesday night for some late night enchiladas and drinks with Tara M. The drinks... fab! Mojitos were on special, I couldn't help but have three of them.

The enchildada dish we split was, just as the three star rating suggests, a-ok. In fact, it was pretty good. I'd eat it again. Our server was great, attentive and friendly.

Yesterday, I was craving some Chinese food when, lo and behold!, what should I stumble upon? The previously discarded Chopstick Express menu. Now, I don't have terribly high expectations of Chinese food outside of New York, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the price and flavor of our meal.

Jamie was coming home for lunch, so I ordered delivery--the shrimp in lobster sauce Lunch combo for me, the mongolian beef Lunch combo for him, then an order of potstickers and a quart of honey-dipped chicken.

Wow. I've been searching EVERYWHERE for boneless honey chicken, and this did not disappoint--it was slathered in this sweet sauce, yet still crispy! 

the Lunch combos come with fried rice, a cream cheese wonton, and a spring roll--all steaming hot and very flavorful. my shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious, but nothing special; it tasted pretty much just like it had at the last place, and the place before that. 

the mongolian beef, on the other hand, was phenomenal! tangy, crispy, maybe a little too salty, but still incredible...it almost tasted  like it had been cooked in teriyaki sauce.

The first time was for a little over a week.  Things seemed to go well, though they had a little bit of kennel cough.  From what I understand after some online research, this just kind of happens in boarding pets.

We again used their services for the weekend.  The dogs are always miserable to leave me, and overjoyed to see me, and it's always a nice reunion.  My littlest terrier can be difficult to handle with new people, but they handled her very professionally and gently.  When I picked the dogs up, said ""stranger unfriendly"" dog was walking well-behaved on her leash.

The place itself is reasonably priced, and they allow toys, blankets, etc. to give the dog some familiarity from being away from home.  They also have playtime, where they allow the dogs some time to stretch their legs, and offer to do grooming/washing before you pick them up. They also don't socialize your dogs with other dogs, which is greatly appreciated.

They've also been good sports about times that I've called in to check on my pups (concerned pet parent in me), and the general staff is friendly and helpful overall.

The dogs seem fine after being home.  Happy to be home, content, napping and smelling fresh.  The only thing I have an issue with (though this is through no fault of their own) is that they are a bit of a drive for me to get there.  Again, this is only a personal quibble, and doesn't reflect on them.

Food was restaurant quality on the entrees and bar quality on the appetizers.  The drink options were a little week in my opinion considering the pub-like atmosphere and location to a sporting venue haven.  

We began with the buffalo chicken appetizer.  Sauce was underwhelming, especially after the waiter hyped it up so much.  The wings themselves were dry rubbed rather than wet which I typically don't like anyways.  Tasty but not the best buffalo app I've had.  The cheese ravioli was cooked perfectly, slightly under-cooked, and huge portion size.  The scallops was an interesting dish at a pub, but considering Arrogant likes to promote their raw bar, I had to give it a go.  The entire dish was fantastic from the brussel and green side to the scallops themselves.  Big dish once again and very well presented.  We finally ordered the blueberry cheesecake.  Tasty graham cracker topping and perfect compliment dessert all around for our meal.

Drinks were limited for draft and bottle beers.  They had some nice champagne and wine by the glass, but nothing too absurd.  We ordered an incredible rose sparkling wine for $50 and it was well worth the price tag.

The infant department falls short of my interest 100% as there is just not a lot to look at in this section. I believe it should be a larger section and more options as the Arboretum is conveniently located not to far from plenty family homes and communities which would make this location ideal to pick up infant and toddler items.

Let me just start at the beginning. 

The initial greet was polite and nice. I told them I was waiting for a friend and was sat right away, given menus and water. So let's begin with the menus. One set of menus was a standard Asian menu. The wine list had suggested food pairings - this was great! I mean, the pairings didn't make a lot of sense; some were paired with appetizers, some with entrées. The second menu, although bound in leather, was handwritten. In different colored magic markers. Any misspellings were crossed out and then corrected - in magic marker. Needless to say, it was hard to decipher and that menu was tossed aside very quickly. The title of said menu was ""Winter Specials"". It's June. My friend joined me shortly after. We both ordered wine,  The server seemed very confused and had to come back and have my friend point to the exact wine she wanted. She ended up bringing the correct wines and they were delecious. The food came, and the presentation was fantastic. Lots of food (we should have shared). A few minutes after we got our entrees, the server dropped off the check. We weren't planning on leaving right away and this wasn't exactly what we were expecting. My friend asked for another glass of wine. Apparently no one has ever done that here before because both severs looked extremely confused. After a few minutes one of them came back and very abruptly said to my friend, ""no more wine!"" and just walked away. No offer for a differnce varietal, or something else to drink (a soft drink perhaps, saki, whatever). I mean, come on. We were begging to spend money. We weren't being loud or obnoxious, so I don't think we were cut off. But who knows at this point. While we were there, they seemed to have many many deliveries, so business must be booming.

I was impressed with the ad - the bar had a nice ad for the night, created 3 special cocktails to celebrate, and suggested visitors dress the part. I showed up and there was a good number of people, but none of the customers were really dressed up. The staff was somewhat dressed. I had a male bartender and he was in a white shirt with black tie. That could be 1920s, but it could be any day also. The female bartender had an outfit and looked the part. Other than that, it didn't really live up to the hype. I had a Batch 19 beer, but that was it. There was good hype for the event, but I didn't think it lived up to it.

We ordered a bunch of apps (korean chicken bites, chorizo flatbread, baked goat cheese, spinach dip) and all of them were boring and mediocre. The flatbread was probably the only thing that was actually good. The goatcheese had nice presentation but the preparation and consistency of the plated cheese was weird and unbalanced almost like it had been heated on the plate multiple times.
For a main I decided to just have a chicken sandwich with fries. BORING. Even with the coleslaw slaw on the sandwich, it was bland as any chicken sandwich I've ever eaten.

Let me first start off by saying that I have always been a fan of the Keg because in my opinion it is very god quality at its price point, especially in a city with many very high end steak houses.

I will start either drinks....as I did when I actually got there. If you have read any if my other reviews, you know that I am a fan of classic cocktails. I ordered a Negroni to start, as suggested by one of my fave peeps from Chase who was joining us. It was very good in terms of balance. Sometimes I find that it is easy to water down or add some filler to a Negroni, but such was not the case here.  Next I ordered an Old Fashioned.  It was ok, but frankly I think that there might have been some vanilla bitters added, because it had a strong taste to it that was unusual.

For good since there were a few of us, we ordered and shared.  I tried the sliders, the bacon wrapped scallops, and the tuna tacos. I have to say, all 3 were excellent and again reasonably priced!

Our Server made great recommendations and she was very attentive and personable. She said we had to try the deep fried olives that were wrapped in house made sausage, boy was she right! My other favourite was the pork chop. The rub of the pork chop was heavenly and the sauce cuts the fat perfectly with a kick from the mustard oil. Wowza, I'm salivating as I'm writing this. Cacio e Pepe pasta was the best that I've had, not overly cheesy. 

Pine nut tart was well baked and the tiramisu wasn't too sweet. We also enjoyed the amaro cart which was such a delight especially with the recommendations by the sommelier.

There was nothing exceptional about either, but I definitely liked the beef one more than the chicken one. In terms of size, the tacos were not smaller just because of the price (as my friend feared). They were reasonable servings and I'd say 3 is good for a meal (unless you're starving).

46FwmgxMPPXLpKggnlkeIw,1DsuFRjdW0gDA23Xswzoqg,Sy75QB18Sv-xNp8FoA8KvQ,2,6,4,1,"It is not often that you write 400 reviews on Yelp so I wanted to make this a special review for my 400th. 

In short (TL:dr): Geisha was shit.

I came here with my girlfriend before hitting up the rest of Old Town. In general, we are simple people. Don't let my water be empty and you'll probably get a 20% tip. Almost 75% of my reviews are 4-star or 5-star reviews. It pains me to give negative reviews - truly - but I'll break it down why Geisha was a severe disappointment.

DECOR: The decor is pretty cool and sadly was probably one of the better items of my visit.

ATMOSPHERE: Dark and kind of romantic.

FOOD/DRINKS: Pretty good. I got three rolls and the girlfriend got one. Standard Asian brew.

SERVICE: The service was some of the worst I've experienced. The girlfriend and myself actually started a timer that if we were not helped or talked to - we were going to walk out.

We sat at the bar in what I would say was the brightest lit area - we couldn't be missed. There were three bartenders behind the bar and I think that it took them a solid 3 minutes (no joke) to even come over and say hi or put down napkins. When we got the napkins dropped off she even said ""oh have we not greeted you?"" Nope, you sure haven't and that isn't why we have no menus, no napkins, and no drinks in front of us. So all we got after 3 minutes was two napkins - no water.

Another 3 minutes goes by and finally some water shows up and some menus. Well thanks - I was about to eat this napkin. I filled out what we wanted to eat on the paper and then waited. And waited. And watched all the bartenders talk to certain people at the bar for a good 5 minutes and paying no attention whatsoever to other patrons. This is when we started the timer - I mean if I have to ask people to take my money then it isn't worth it. I shouldn't have to shoot a flare gun off any time I need service.

So we are waiting. We are literally said, if they don't come in 2 minutes (after waiting for 3 already) then we are just going to bounce. I think we were 1:45 into that timer when they finally came over and took the paper. Thanks.

From the time to get the paper to get the food was also seemingly slow. I'd guess that we waited 20 minutes for our food. And of course, no attention given to see if we wanted more drinks or anything while we waited. It wasn't like the place was slammed either - nobody waiting to get in, multiple tables empty, and the bar was about 1/3 full (and half of them only drinking).

Even when I was eating the bartender just came over and without saying anything just poured the rest of my beer in the glass and took the bottle. In general I am pretty forgiving but being ignored almost the entire time I was there just to have my bottle emptied into my glass kind irked me (the bottle was keeping it colder than my glass, so I would only pour it in there a little at a time). Maybe if you asked me if you could do that... or you were being friendly with me the entire time then I wouldn't have minded. It kind of just felt like some stranger off the street came in, saw my bottle, poured it in a glass, and then walked off with my bottle without saying a word.

COST: Jeebus, I think this was my most expensive sushi bill in years - About $60 for two drinks and four basic rolls. Maybe I'm just cheap.


I read the other reviews that noted that the service was lacking and if there is anything you take from my review is that the service IS lacking. It is some of the worst service I've ever had. I've had better service at Dennys, Taco Bell, and Jack in the Box by far. I literally have no idea why some people like this place other than it is a trendy kind of cool place to hang out (and apparently have your bartender talk to you for 5 minutes while ignoring all other duties and patrons).

I'm promptly adding this place to my Yelp Blacklist.",2016-08-28 10:24:13

We walked in and the place reeked of pineapples, more than likely to set that tropical mood.  FYI: islands don't smell like pineapples, but whatever.

We were seated in a booth, which was nice, and our server took our drink orders right away.  We threw in some appetizers and 10 minutes went by before they come out luke warm.  The plantain chips, which I expected to be fresh from the fryer, were ice cold.  Oh well.

The food itself took 20 minutes to come out, which is way too long, even with refills of the bread basket.  By the time the food came out, I was full, but I tried it anyway.  The cuban is good, not great, and the other items my friends' bought: pork sandwich and jerk chicken were disgusting.  I don't eat things that look as if someone chewed it up and spat it out.  Presentation wasn't there, but it's not a 5 star restaurant.  All I ask for is good food, and the stuff they use in their sandwiches for the pork's bbq sauce and the jerk seasoning was too sweet and tasted very commercial.  Not for me, or them.

Overall, nice place to spend 12-15 bucks on a sandwich, but not worth the price tag.  I'll never eat here again, no matter how decent the appetizers were.",2011-01-15 19:33:16

Since I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll: 1) hit up website, 2) read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3) pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4) hop in car, and 5) return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table (so I have room to spread out). They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need / want $15 of food.

Since it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out:
* I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again. 
* There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better... bring it!
* I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them.
* The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for.
* You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city (seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge).

If you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal (and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon).

I visited during happy hour, so I stuck to cocktails and lite bites rather than ordering full plates of food. I certainly thought the drinks and appetizers were ok. I enjoyed my Whiskey sour and berry Cosmo quite a bit. The wings I ordered were ok: not in my top 5 as far as wings go, but tasty nonetheless. I admittedly think it took me less time to devour my wings than it took for the food to get to us, unfortunately. But sometimes things get backed up (especially on Friday); and what we got ranged from decent to good, so hey - all was well.

Then I asked for the check, and was told it couldn't be split up in large groups. ...Why not mention this when you sat us? We were a big party. You knew this when we arrived and asked how many people needed to be seated. Surely this would have been useful info to bring up then? (Simply asking if this was anyone's first time would have indicated we didn't know this policy and needed to know of it before ordering.)

Ultimately the server did end up separating all of our checks out, once we pointed this problem out and said many of us simply had no cash and no way to accommodate the unknown one check rule. But I will never forget the failure to mention this fact in the first place. I'm admittedly not happy that the waitress fussed at the request as well, but if it was restaurant policy, I can understand her balking...to a point.

Red Roll
Premium Spicy Tuna Roll
the Lamb
Bacon wrapped Scallops

I am not big into lamb, but this lamb is amazing!  It is prepared over a charcoal fire called sumibiyaki.  You can also smell it burning in the parking lot and the smell alone is enough to drive you nuts.  I did not know what sumibiyaki was prior to visiting Yasu.  It is grilled food prepared over high end Japanese charcoal called binchotan. (Who knew?!)  There is a whole menu prepared this way and I think everyone needs to try it.  

The Premium Spicy Tuna Roll is like no other I have ever had before.  I dream of the heat and texture that just melts in your mouth, making you wish there were more than 5 pieces.  The glory of sushi is you can always just order more and nobody thinks you are a piggy... it's expected. 

Yasu is a nice quaint restaurant perfect for a date or gathering with good friends, seating is intimate and the staff is attentive and friendly.  I think I need to make eating here a weekly event.",2011-10-09 00:26:26

I absolutely love this restaurant and it's ambience, it's not a big space so I wouldn't recommend for very large group. I prefer to sit in their patio in the summer and sip on a margarita. Their chicken main is so great!!! That sauce (beware it's spicy) is the best thing ever is to be tried with their homemade selection of sauces  (mild, medium and hot) with freshly made tortilla.

We went there for lunch on a Saturday, and hesitated for a moment because it was completely empty - but figured we may as well give it a shot. 

There is a huge menu consisting of pizzas, pastas, salads, paninis, entrees... and quite a few options in each. While I'm not a fan of giant menus, I think this one was at least organized, and made it easy to decide what I wanted. (They also have an insert of specials daily). 

I had the soup of the day, a sweet potato puree, and a caprese salad. Both of these were just ok. The soup was suspiciously close to my favorite Campbell soup, but I let that slide. The salad was initially delicious, but the lettuce to stuff ratio was a little high. 

My dining companions had the Atlantico Pasta (which was tasty but a little too big) and the Chicken Club, which was described to me as ""mediocre"". 

So really, this place is decent. I could probably make everything we had at home if I really put my mind to it - it just wasn't that unique or inspired. That being said, I'm sure you can come here and have a great (albeit, basic) meal!

With the large salad you get 7 toppings. I'm a fan of the beats, black beans, corn, broccoli, carrots, celery, peas and various croutons. You can add chicken, turkey, salmon or tuna and various types of cheese. They have a wide selection of dressings and you can indicate how much you want on your salad. They put all your chosen ingredients in a big mixing bowl so everything is mixed well. I have a big appetite and this is the only salad that fills me up!

Warning - the line gets very large during lunch hours so I recommend going around 11:30 or after 1:30. They are also open later in the evening so also a good late night work dinner. They also sell sandwiches but I never tried them so have no comment.

This is NOT a place for egg rolls.  Or Mongolian beef, or kung pao chicken, or any other Chinese-American food you're looking for.  The idiots that rate this place low for the lack of actual egg rolls need to expand their horizons and understand that ""Chinese"" food as they know it, does not have to conform to their narrow expectations of chow mein and sweet & sour shrimp.

This is Shannxi food.  North-central China.  Abuts Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and 4 other provinces and the food is influenced by them all.

They use Sichuan chili peppers so be forewarned and expect the numbing, tingliness that it brings.  Especially on the sliced pigs' ears.  Great texture, good heat, along with a hefty dose of sesame oil, this is an excellent dish.

Liang pi (noodles in a sesame based sauce) were awesome.  The deep nuttiness of the sesame permeated the dish and added an unexpected richness.  Shaanxi style handmade noodles were fine, I've had better noodles with better chew, but I'm not going to complain about these.  Braised chicken with potato and pepper was quite good, very filling, and a great meaty course to add to dinner.  Stir fried greens were good, just as good as anywhere else.  Biang biang noodles had a great spicy kick and the noodles had excellent chew.  Finally, I like lamb.  My wife does not.  We ordered the Shaanxi style sandwich with the lamb. I love it.  The crisp edges of the ""bun"" along with the deep meatiness of the lamb, well spiced, with some heat.  It is delicious.

On a side note, my wife, who doesn't really enjoy the Sichuan pepper feel, raves about the fried rice here.  I don't see it, but she says it's the best fried rice in the Valley.  Hmmm . . .

My visit last evening was for their $12 special, a 5 meat stuffed large pizza. The finished pizza was wrapped up with baking instructions included and carried to the front door.  At home the pizza was cooked according to instructions provided.  The sauce, what little there was, tasted sweeter than I remember.  It was very doughy and dry, especially around the outer 2 to 3 inches. Not quite sure what changed but we've been eating their pizza's for years and found this particular pizza to be very disappointing. We will probably give them another try, but it won't be for a ""stuffed"" pizza.",2017-12-08 11:14:43

I had called in advance to make an appointment for my oil change, the appointment time was confirmed (9:00) and brought in on time.
He was told that it should be done by 10:30. To me, 90 minutes for an oil change that would take 30 anywhere else seemed long, but okay. 10:30 came and went. 11:00, no update. He had now seen a number of team members come by, acknowledging other guests and saying to them unsolicited ""let me check on your vehicle for you"" and some of who had arrived after him, he went to the attendant to check on my vehicle. 
The attendant asked what he was there for, then made a ""call"". He then was told it should be just a few minutes, it was ""going thru the wash"". 11:15, he went to check again. A second ""call"" was made. He was told that they were ""just trying to find the keys"". 11:30. Still no car. He asked the attendant to please go and personally check again. 3rd time having to ask the status..... because the first time and second time should have been the last and should not even have had to happen. 
The attendant came back and yep...the car had not been washed, and the attendant told him they ""accidentally had parked it out back"". 
Almost 3 hours for an oil change! 
This is completely unacceptable and no real apology or explanation from your service department. My boyfriend also happens to be a person of color. I am hoping on EVERYTHING that this was not a factor in the 100% complete lack of customer service and consideration he was shown today. Unfortunately this is not our 1st bad experience with your service department or the Larry H Miller company. Even more unfortunately we have bought an ""oil change package"" that now in order to get our moneys worth we would have to return at least 1 more time. 
Over 2.5 hours to have an oil change done when an appointment was made and confirmed is complete and total disregard for their guests time and energy. We will not be returning for any reason and will surely not recommend either.",2018-06-28 19:18:44

We both were so excited to finally experience all the hype surrounding täkō. We arrived right on time and immediately seated at our table. I was already impressed by the vibe and decor of the restaurant. We both ordered drinks and put in our appetizer order while we tried to figure out the difficult task of which tacos to order. I ordered the Violet Pilot and she ordered the Watermelon Basil Margarita. I thoroughly enjoyed my drink. It wasn't too sweet, and I could really taste the smokiness of the mezcal at the end. (I love to try variations of drinks that have egg whites as an ingredient). She was happy with her margarita as well.

We ordered the Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was a tough decision between that or the Papa Bravas. The Queso Fundido was a great choice and I would definitely consider ordering it again. It came with four little tortillas. It was a great combination of cheese and chorizo and all the flavors were a great start to an amazing meal.

Now onto my favorite part of the meal and what I was most anticipating: the tacos. I ordered the Chorizo and she ordered the Baja. (She tends to never to be able to finish her meal, so I was excited and looking forward to trying both kinds of tacos). These tacos were hands down the best I've ever had. The Chorizo tacos blew my mind and I enjoyed every single bite! I loved how they incorporated a fried egg on the taco; the yolk added a lot of extra flavor! As anticipated, she was full and gave me her last Baja taco. It was very flavorful! I feel that the slaw on the taco brought all the flavors together and it was a nice touch. However, the Chorizo taco was definitely my favorite so far! I can't wait to come back to try all the other varieties that they have to offer!

Our bill came out to be $60 (plus tip) for two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. I felt our meal was definitely worth the cost. Yes, it can get pricey quick and I see how everyone says it can be expensive.  täkō is now one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and I look forward to returning!",2017-01-07 22:20:09

I expected a big sandwich board and walk up order situation.  And many people came in and out and ordered take-out. However, we came to eat in. And the restaurant had tables where we sat and were waited on. Not normal for a sandwich shop. But it was great.

I tried the ""fry plate"", which was a plate of French fries covered with your choice of toppings. I had steak, onions and mushrooms. It was excellent.

A friend tried the tri-tip fry plate and he claimed it was also excellent.

The prices were reasonable and the staff was kind. Food took a little longer than other sandwich shops but it was fresh , hot and crispy (I was delighted to have hot crispy fries, rather than old soggy ones)!

I will go back and try the sandwiches another time to see if the place lives up to that part of its namesake.

The chef was at our table quite a bit and he talked to us about how he wanted the food to be like.  He wants to combine all kinds of flavors into a dish instead of just filling it up with garlic.  Some dishes were made to be nostalgic but with a twist.

I can tell he does this when I was eating.  One dish was a salad with goat cheese and watermelon.  There were so many flavors to choose from to eat.  It all worked well together.

My favorite dish was the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was perfect.  The outer had a nice crunch.  The inner was soft and juicy.  The waffles were amazing.  I don't normally like waffles but this one had a nice sweet taste to it.  I loved it.

I also got a chance to speak with the owner.  He talked about how Pittsburgh is changing and segregated.  He ask what happens to the days when everyone of all nationality just get together and have fun.  So he wanted Savoy to be comfortable for everyone.

I agree Savoy is comfortable.  Everyone there is super nice.  There is a dress code.  You don't have to be super dressed up.  Just look nice.  Sometimes it's nice to NOT see people with sagging pants and butt cracks.

The lounge upstairs can be used for parties.  The patio is nice to hang out on a nice day.  There is a basement that can be reserved for small parties.

Fun fact, the designer of the place is from Penn Hill.

Overall, I love this place.  The food is good, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the people and service are super nice.  The chef is a real good guy.  This isn't your Eatn Park.  Don't come here if you want to spend $10 to feed a family mediocre food.",2011-06-13 20:37:28

I am talking about the cherry barbecue sauce that comes on the side with the short ribs (which were pretty dry on their own). I am somewhat embarrassed to share that I was plucking the cherries from the sauce and eating them straight! 

The short rib was served on cheesy grits and while usually the texture of grits doesn't work for me, these were pretty good. I credit the abundance of cheese with altering the texture. 

Dessert was also delicious: the cuppa red hot chocolate is a mug filled with two layers of dense chocolate mousse at least one of which is laced with chile that inspires a cinnamon red hot-like burn in the very back of your palette on the finish. Definitely a desert to be shared. We also split the peanut butter mousse dessert which was in a chocolate cookie shell and was much less dense - in fact, it was runny and spilled out of the sides when the shell broke but the peanut butter flavor was perfect and it was accompanied by 3 chocolate covered peanut butter cookie dough balls. One for each of us -- we didn't even have to fight over them!

Sorry, Milestones! Slamming you yet again.

We went to Milestones after a movie night (convenient location), for some appetizers and drinks. We ended up ordering 3 appetizers, as detailed below, and sangria. Can't say anything was eventful. To top the eventful date night, the server was inattentive - she took forever to bring out plain simple water. I had to ask twice. And she never really brought us refills. 

About our order:

1. Mediterranean Goat Cheese Platter - Milestones used to have a generous portion of baked goat cheese served with cranberry, herbed flatbread and fig jam, which was basically my favorite Milestones item. They basically changed this dish - sans cranberry and herbed flatbread now and half the portion; served with some red pepper relish and plain bread. 

2. Coconut Calamari - Love calamari. Not sure this fusion calamari is to everyone's taste. I think they took an experiment too far. It's a small serving and although it sounds fancy, it's not gourmet by any means. 

3. Asian Chicken Bites - What about fresh cucumbers and sweet chili sauce screams spicy? Well, it was spicy... and not that great. You get a whole lot of twisty wontons for the little amount of chicken they serve. 

4. Superfruit Red Sangria Pitcher - We had some lime and apple floating in ours, that's it. So much for seasonal fruit. Not worth the money, skip and order the cheapest cocktail instead.",2016-11-17 01:28:15

THE UP-SIDE:  The food is decent.  There is absolutely nothing unique or interesting about it.  It's standard diner breakfast stuff.  The staff seems pleasant and the place is big, with lots of room to stretch out and breathe.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Ok, I'm biased.  They advertise having a ""gluten-free menu.""  They don't.  

What they have is a crummy xeroxed listing of what is and isn't gluten-free on their regular menu.  I'm not a dumb man, but I found the process of comparing the list with every item to be monotonous and confusing.  And, while this place is big on breakfast, they do NOT offer gluten-free bread.  So, cut out french toast, toast, and all the sandwiches that you might order.  This isn't a gluten-free menu - it's a lame attempt to say, ""Hey!  You can eat gluten-free here, if you're willing to do all the work to figure it out and have almost no choices!""

Ultimately, I went with sausage, an OJ, and a fruit parfait.  It wasn't satisfying at all.  It tasted good, but no great shakes whatsoever.

So I couldn't help myself and went back 2 more times. Who could pass up their 30% off pre grand opening special!?! Not me lol 

Service was good as usual. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. There was always someone running back and forth to help clear the tables and wipe them down for new customers to sit and eat. If I were to leave a suggestion it would be to have a place for us customers to help put our own dishes and throw our trash away since it is more of a self serve restaurant. I'm sure that would help the workers when the lunch and dinner rush comes through. (IKEA has these covered stalls for us to put our dirty trays with dishes in ..maybe that is something useful that may be added to this lovely place) 

Kamatama Udon - Very good! Talk about egg porn! Udon is served hot with a raw yolk on top from eggs that are imported from Japan. Chef said these were special eggs from vegetarian fed chickens. Broth/Sauce is served on the side for you to pour over your Udon. Break that yolk and let it ooze all over Udon. Enjoy!

Carbonara Udon - Good. Nice and creamy with chunks of pork belly in it. Pork belly was a little hard and chewy for my taste tho 

Curry Udon / Rice Bowl - Good. Flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary. Curry taste like the one in the yellow golden box you make at home. 

Miso Garlic Pork Belly Bowl - Very yummy. I love how super garlicky it is. Pork belly is sliced thin and packed with flavor topped with pickled ginger

Of course we ordered the Seafood Tomato Cream & Mentai Udon again. It was as delicious as the first time. 


I posted A LOT of pictures of everything we ordered and of the restaurant. If you can't see it with my post here go find them lol Everything looks and tastes delicious. You will not be disappointed.

RLbxWdo8noK20jRts4gnFg,qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,YfsNZho-s38tB9H30Umpqg,1,6,4,1,"My wife and I decided to head out to the Galleria Mall today and visit Best Buy and Costco.  We were there early and the stores were not open yet.  So, we decided to grab a brunch.  As we drove around looking for a place to eat, we noticed a small restaurant located on a strip outside of the Sunset Casino ~ the Alohoa Kitchen.  We figure it was a mom/pop kinda restaurant and thought it would be good to try and dine here.

Here is the good.  As you walk in, it is pretty clean and spacious.  It has a ""Tiki"" type built to it.  Pretty cool.  Also, from the menu offering, everything was reasonably priced ~ about $8-10 per plate.

Now, the bad... no customers were in the restaurant (bad sign).  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with rice.  And, my wife ordered the Ribs with rice.  It was served on a styro-foam plate with soft utensils.

Oh my, okay... breathe... while eating the rice, it was like grinding pebbles.  I had to turn to my wife and tell her that we are in Bedrock.  Call me Fred Flintstones and her Wilma.  We needed Bam Bam to hammer the rice and make it edible.  

Note to the cook:  How to cook rice... Pour rice into rice cooking pot, ADD WATER (I think this step was seriously missed), make sure you measure at least a 1/3 index finger size of water at the top, press cook, and wait for 30 minutes for beep.  Damn!  How hard is it to cook rice man!  I know we live in Las Vegas, it is in a desert, and we need to conserve water; but dog, just sacrifice and add a cup of water to your rice.  

As for the Teriyaki chicken, I think they served me ""yesterday's"" chicken.  It tasted like ""over-nuked"" chicken.  Extremely rubbery and very tasteless.  In order to hide this deficiency, the cook LATHERED the chicken in Teriyaki sauce.  The end result:  It looked and tasted like eating Molasses with uncooked rice.  yuck, yuck and ga-zillion yuck.

I ate 3 spoonful too many.

As for my wife's Ribs, it was tough as hell.  Again, it was obviously nuked.

Of note, there are people in the world who think they can cook, who are good cooks, who can open a restaurant, and survive...

And, then, there are owners like the Aloha Kitchen, who think they can cook, who have no clue how bad their food is, who still ends up opening a restaurant, and who probably would not survive.

Finally, I would not recommend this place.  We definitely will NOT return.  For two of us, with drinks, and tip, it amounted to $24.  Honestly, a better deal would be to go to Chili's -- have a decent appetizer and 2 entrees for $20.... 

I wished we can rate this a ZERO or negative star...",2010-12-06 20:24:37

YZwguw9HAToSJVOnEOnnbQ,8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,xOZd6roDjtb_ILWEwUKfOQ,4,9,6,9,"JCP Portraits is an awesome photography studio!  I have been using this location since was daughter was born, so i am pretty familiar with this location.  All of my daughter milestones have been recorded on film here.  I only have good things to say!

Here are the reasons why I think this place is the bees knees:

1. The staff is super friendly!   I have dealt with several of the photographers and all have been wonderful.  The standouts would have to be Chrissy and Lani.  Since I have only done baby and toddler pictures here, the photographers have really had to work during the shoot, especially with my kiddo in full 2 year old toddler mode.  They never get frustrated or aggravated at the little ones when they are being uncooperative, unlike the parents of the kids but that is a different story for a different time!  

2. The quality of the photo shoot.  When you arrive, the whole process starts off great.  Everyone is happy and helpful.  When you go into the studio, the photographers offer fun ideas and cute props for the shoot.  They also spend a lot of time trying to get really good shots of the subject.  This can be really challenging with kiddos and the people I have worked with have the patience of Job!

3.  The beautiful portraits!  After your photo session, all of the prints are digitally uploaded for you to review.  You can look at each picture up close and really make sure you are happy.  You can even add things like borders, print patterns, and even make collages.  It is really fun to be able to be part of the creative process from the start to finish.

4. The online part of the portrait studio.  The JCP Portrait website is easy to navigate.  You can make appointments online to suit your schedule.  You can review your prints online and order additional prints or fun items like phone covers, mugs, and keychains, just to name a few.

5. The email club!  If you are interested in getting pictures, sign up for the JCP Portrait email club.  They offer great deals via email every month.  They also send you coupons regularly on all sorts of products that they offer.

6.  The prices.  I think the prices on the items you get are very reasonable.  If you use your email coupons, you can really get some great deals.  The quality is high and the prices are great.  

The only reason I didn't give them a 5th star would be the limited amount of backgrounds and props.  I say this because I have been going for such a long time that I have done a lot of the ideas that they have.  I have used almost all of the props and backgrounds over the past 2 years.  I wish they would change up the fun backgrounds a little more often.  I also would love some more fun props and ideas.  Also some of the props need to be switched out.  On a previous visit, some of the props were broken or missing pieces (The props in question were beaded necklaces).  The photographer made it work and we got some cute pictures, but we could have done so much more if the props were in better condition.

Overall though, I would recommend JCP Portraits to anyone and everyone!  They do a great job and you will be happy with your photos!",2013-11-06 04:54:52

The owners of Postino just can't go wrong I'm convinced. I'm a long time fan of both locations and was super excited when they opened up Windsor as they have a full bar and different, numerous options for food. 

Let's start with the interior, love it. Modern with some natural elements; very laid back with an awesome patio that I've actually yet to sit on as I'm usually at the bar or one of the comfy booths as soon as you walk in.

The staff is always on point and friendly without being too in your face which I really love being that I am a server and I don't really need the follow up every 4 minutes. I most recently sat at the bar solo on Wednesday or Thursday and I didn't get the bartender's name but he was really nice without being overbearing. 

Food wise? Omnomnom is all I have to say. No, the Backyard burger is awesome. I've only gotten it Classic style but it's delicious! The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least. I'm also a big fan of their fondue and the Brown Bag (??) Chicken sandwich. Everything tastes fresh and you can't go wrong with Churn next door for the dessert...best Butter Pecan I've ever had.

This area has some solid restaurants and Windsor is no different. Definitely a great spot for lunch during the day or a date at night. Check it out!",2012-12-15 18:28:58

The fluorescent lighting has been replaced with decorative halogen track lighting and modern brushed stainless accents. The paper place mats have been replaced by red and white linens. The menu has always been interesting... now, even more than ever. 

My favorite back then was Mango Chicken. It's still on the menu, but now my choices are more difficult because there are so many other equally tasty things from which to choose. My favorites now include a delightful curry chicken, anything with pan fried noodles, spring rolls, and hot and sour soup.

I decided to try the Papajoun (""Ground Beef, Onions, Garlic, Red Pepper Paste"") and added Soujouk (""All beef Armenian sausage made in house"") as a filling.

In the past, when I've eaten manakish, it's been without any toppings and all you would add is some hot sauce and a little lemon juice. But at Mamajoun, they add a number of Subway-like toppings (including lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc) and put the closed-up final product in a press. The concoction is finally eaten like a wrap, essentially.

I was skeptical to be sure, but I really enjoyed the heck out of this. The flavor of the manakish itself certainly comes through, as does the distinctive taste of the soujouk (which is probably my favorite type of sausage), while the various toppings all work quite harmoniously together.

My only complaint is that the two types of olives, coupled with the soujouk, ensured that the whole thing was often just way too salty for my liking. Next time I'd definitely omit the olives.",2018-07-12 18:36:17

My husband and I have hit up nearly every gun shop Vegas has to offer. When we drove by Guns & Ammo we immediately pulled in to take a look around. At that time they had just opened and were in the process of building their range. We were immediately impressed with their selection of weapons, their pricing, and most of all their customer service. Since that time, they have completed their range and it is a nice one! Definitely worth checking out. 

A few months ago we purchased a firearm for them and the level of service we received was amazing. There were some initial questions about the paperwork but the manager assured us he would resolve them. Sure enough, the next day he called us with a solution and we were the proud owners of a new firearm. After a negative experience with another range in town, we made it a point to stop by. The clerks there greeted us and even remembered us from our last purchase and visit.

I came around 11 and there was still a good selection of donuts. The lady behind the counter was friendly and recommended to me the popular flavors as it was obvious I had never been here before. There is a fixed price for a dozen donuts (around $14) but any fewer, you have to pay individually per donut. I went with the apple fritter, cinnamon roll, cinnamon glaze donut, coconut donut, sour cream donut, and blueberry cake donut. I was pleasantly surprised when the lady told me she'd throw in 2 original glazed and a chocolate glazed cake donut for free! Here's my ranking in order of decreasing preference:

- apple fritter: large, cinnamon-y and with the most flavor and glaze (but could do with more apple chunks) prob the best in CLT
- sour cream: very moist (sorry) and just so good
- original glaze: pillow soft, very light 
- blueberry cake donut: tastes like a blueberry muffin with glaze, really sweet
- cinnamon roll: pretty average
- coconut: good if you like coconut
- cinnamon glaze: tastes like the cinnamon roll in donut form
- chocolate glaze cake: cake donut itself was a bit too dry and icing ratio was off

Overall, for 9 donuts I paid less than $10, which is solid and much cheaper than ""trendier"" establishments. I also like that most options, especially the yeast donuts, were super light, soft, and airy so I didn't feel extremely gross and heavy after eating them.

We ordered a bunch of other stuff, and the standout by far was the grilled pork chashu. Husband is still raving about that one, even topping the stuff we had at Mizumi the following night.

I just came back from yet another brunch at Mitzi's. This place is literally a 5 second walk from my boyfriend's house, so we have been here on a few occasions, mostly when we are too lazy to venture much further for brunch. 

Some of the brunch items are truly delicious but some are lacklustre, and though the portions are HUGE, I find that some of the plates come piled with too many carbs. Sometimes I want a side of salad with my eggs and potatoes. 

Today I had the fish cakes (made with cod) with poached eggs. It came with a mountain of home fries, and 2 HUGE and THICK slices of buttered sourdough bread. It also had some fruit on the side. The fish cakes were yummy and not too greasy. My poached eggs were perfect, and the home fries had good flavour. My problem with my plate was that I could only eat half a slice of my toast and about half my home fries. By the time the waitress took my plate away, I felt embarrassed to be wasting so much food. But seriously, who can have this many carbs in one seating?


My boyfriend had the ultimate hangover sandwich, which consisted of eggs,kimchi,garlic mayo and bacon on thick cut sourdough bread. His plate also came with home fries. I had a couple of bites of his sandwich and it was delicious!!! The mixture of the kimchi and the egg and the bacon - WOW!  

When I came here last week I had their french toast (made with challah bread) and the topping of that day (their toppings change all the time) was caramelized bananas, graham crackers and whipped cream. DELICIOUS! It was just so damn good! Definitely the thing to order when they have it. My only problem was that the french toast also came with home fries. I don't know about anyone else but I don't particularly want to eat fried potatoes with my french toast. It just doesn't go. I left the home fries untouched, and once again I felt awful about wasting food. 

I will continue coming to Mitzi's because its really convenient when I am over at the boyfriend's house to just pop in here for some brunch. And the food is good, however it just isn't mind blowing amazing. They would definitely get another 1/2 star if they started adding some salad to their dishes.

My first impression of this spa was very, very bad. My friends and I decided to make appointments here day-of, knowing that it could be tricky. I called, and was pleasantly surprised when they could fit us in for 2 massages at 3:00, and a facial at 2:00. I hung up the phone, quite happy, but after a brief discussion, my friend who was doing the facial decided she'd rather do a different service at 3:00, so I called back to see what was available. 

THAT'S when I found out what the first girl failed to tell me: you have to cancel your appointments at least 4 hours in advance. Considering the fact that I didn't make my reservations until 2 hours in advance, I was shocked that I hadn't been informed of this up-front. I did my very best to explain that NO ONE HAD TOLD ME THIS, but the guy on the phone took a robot-like approach of repeating, ""I'm sorry, I cannot change or move your reservation,"" and told me they'd charge me a fee if I cancelled (as if I hadn't JUST made this reservation 10 minutes ago and was costing them business). He said it at least 5 times, after each of my (increasingly frustrated) objections, until finally I asked to speak to his supervisor. After no less than 10 minutes of hold music, he comes back on, and sweetly tells me that they've moved the facial to 3:00. 

Huh?

Why couldn't they have just scheduled the facial at 3:00 to begin with (they originally quoted me times of 2:00 and 4:00)? I think it's very sad that apparently management has not empowered their associates to handle their customers in a more efficient and professional manner. Very sad. 

However, I DID get my way in the end (after some mild tension and panic), and once we arrived at the spa, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The amenities were lovely (albeit not extensive), and my Swedish massage was wonderful...one of the better I've had in Vegas, for sure. They were perfectly nice once we got there, so I'm not sure what the disconnect is between the people that answer the phone and the individuals that actually work at the spa, but they need to figure it out. And fast, before they seriously begin losing business.",2011-03-30 01:13:03

The best thing about Sammy's for me, is all the tasty vegetarian options! While I'm not a vegetarian, I appreciate a good tofu or grilled vegetable or felafel wrap, all of which I can get at Sammy's. 

Since I can usually get lunch there at under $5 (sans drink - alas) I'm pretty satisfied to continue to go there. My only complaints are about the organization  - I don't ever understand where I'm supposed to stand until someone yells at me - and also, the staff yell a me! Not all, but there is one woman in particular that is just never friendly. 

A final suggestion - if they got more seating, that alone would move them up another star. If I buy lunch, I prefer to sit there and eat it, not bring it back to the office! 

Overall, Sammy's is a pretty decent student spot!",2011-10-13 01:42:52

It was pretty early (8ish) so the place wasn't very busy at all.  That was a good thing because this ensured we could sit wherever we wanted and there was nobody playing that shuffleboard game thing they have.  I LOVE that game!  We had a few reasonably priced drinks while we played then ordered some burgers.  Their burger selection is surprisingly good with tons of topping to choose from.  You really wouldn't expect it from a ""dive"" bar.

Our burgers were big and juicy and tasted excellent.  I don't think they were pre-made and frozen, but if they were, kudos to the defroster!

The service was excellent as our waitresses were fast and friendly.  For some reason we had 3 different waitresses during the 3 or so hours were were there, but it was ok.  I have to give a shout out to the waitress that took our food order because she brought me a pitcher of diet coke so I could refill it myself.  AWESOME!!  When I eat I somehow drink tons of diet coke and it is always a pain for the waitress to keep on refilling and a pain to wait for another one.  Anyway, we didn't even get to that point because she brought the pitcher right away.  It was like she knew me!  Very impressive!

The price was very reasonable for what we ordered and we had fun.  It seems like most of the people who hang out there are regulars so they are pretty friendly.  We even made some new friends when they challenged us to shuffleboard for drinks.  Good stuff!!",2009-11-09 20:17:23

The service was good this time around, server was friendly and attentive. The food was only OK for me. Myself and a friend each ordered the Roasted Duck poutine pizza and they both came out cold. Another ordered a burger which also had issues with the temperature. The restaurant did take them back and remade them completely.

Overall the flavour was OK, but the portion for the pizza was huge. I had to pack it to go.

Overall I was satisfied with my meal but it came out to $30 for a poutine pizza, a lot more options at that price level.",2018-04-07 14:07:28

I had the steak and it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Prices are on the expensive side, but this is to be expected from an upmarket bar/restaurant like Museum Tavern.

My friend had the tuna burger which was really good, but came too raw for our liking. They took it back without complaint, and it was more our fault for not ordering it more well done to start with.

The drinks from the bar look amazing and I will be sure to try an old fashioned the next time I go, based on the other reviews.",2014-07-03 12:44:10

MZs4GiAaHZoXlu_R5PXcAg,nO2NWsaleceG0Gw6wPjq1A,cDoo0Pf1d_P79Rq3ZNk-Mw,3,1,2,2,"I would rate Kirei 3.5 stars. This restaurant is huge!! I mean for a place in downtown core they definitely are oversized. They even have traditional Japanese style seating which I am quite excited to try out. Overall the ambience is nice. It has a very convenient location in the heart of downtown, right at Church and Adelaide.

The first time I tried this place was on a weekday night. I was working late so I got the Kirei Dinner Box. The restaurant was completely empty when I went in to get my take out order. I wanted to use my master card and the waitress immediately asked me if I could use cash instead because they have to pay fees for using a credit card. If you don't like that maybe make it a cash only place then....don't ask the customer to do something for you. 

The Dinner Box was $23 plus tax and was huge!! It came with 9 pcs of sashimi, 5 pcs sushi and 6 pcs rolls and your choice of teriyaki. I got the salmon teriyaki. The red tuna sashimi I got along with it was dry...yuck. I wonder if it was even safe to eat. The salmon was overcooked as well and overall the meal didn't taste fresh at all. I was just left wondering if they gave me left over food from the day before or something.

I decided to give this place a second chance. Also, they had a teambuy available, so at least I won't regret it that much if it turns out to be terrible and it would assure me that my first visit was not just a one off experience.

We were a group of 6 and again the only ones in the restaurant on a weekday at 12:15 pm. Service was fast and efficient. Ordered lunch special bento boxes ($10- $14) which came with salad, miso soup and a few sushi rolls. Everything tasted good and this time the salmon teriyaki was not dry and was pretty falvourful. There was enough food for the price.

We went again recently since I had a much better experience the last time. The restaurant was pretty packed probably due to Winterlicious. Even though it was very busy the service was not too slow. We got our soup and salad right away. The entrees took a little longer to come but everything tasted fresh.

1. Tuna Tataki ($$$!?) - This is an appetizer and had 6 pieces of pan seared tuna. The pieces were a decent size but it was definitely not worth the $14 you pay for it. The fish was not seasoned at all. I am not sure what an authentic Tataki is supposed to taste like but I don't think this lives up to it in any way.
We had a bad start to the meal with the Tataki but the miso soup and salad made up for it.
2. House salad ($4) - This definitely didn't have as much avocado as they show in the menu. 
3. Sushi and sashimi bento box($14) - They had a little bit of fried eggplant with 5 pcs of sushi, 6 pcs of roll (not all had fish, some were veggie rolls), and 8 pcs of fresh sashimi. The flavours were pretty good for the sushi and rolls but the sashimi was undressed. 
4. Sushi and salmon teriyaki box($12) - This had the same 5 pcs of sushi, 3 pieces of shrimp roll and delicious salmon teriyaki.
5. Pork bone soup ($10) - It was a mediocre soup and you can get much better in chinatown for a much cheaper price. 

Overall the place is a tad expensive if you don't use Teambuy/Groupon. The lunch specials are not a bad deal if you are in the area.",2014-02-17 18:48:22

Figured I would review this for those looking for night-life. Looks all Euro-trendy. We all need to go to a bass-thumping DJ driven club once in awhile. I did find it interesting that ""dressy"" for females is mini-dress. For guys it means their T shirt is tucked into their faded jeans (at least for the first half of the night). I have adjusted to the AZ relaxed dress code. Still seems weird to me, couples where female looks like a runway model, guy-with looks like he just got out of work at Home Depot. I guess I spent too much of the time thinking about this and conducting a scientific study. Anyhow, loud music, lots of glitz and glam, a necessary part of every young person's life. Lots of people looked way too young to be here. Some people looked way too old to be here. I think the thrill of standing behind the velvet ropes and waiting to be let in adds to the allure. It's just not my thing. I am sure I will be dragged back when my East coast friends come to visit.",2014-08-31 16:07:05

I've been trying every Thai joint within 20 miles of my new abode, trying to find something comparable to the authentic Thai I got in Anthem (of all places). Malees was the worst strike-out of them all.

My first clue should have been when the girl asked ""How spicy?""  I replied with ""3"", as every Thai restaurant I've been to does a scale of 1 to 5.  She responded with an awkward silence and then ""... So really hot?""   No... no... just no. 

We had the appetizer platter, which was 6 different things that all tasted the same, save for the crab rangoons, the crispy pla and the evil jungle princess. The fish candy was blah. The crispy pla, as someone already mentioned in another review, tasted like nothing whatsoever, and the sauce was overly sweet; I thought I'd need an insulin shot after 2 bites. The evil jungle princess is one of my favorite dishes, but this one was just not right. It was like they had dumped chili powder into it. Chili powder does not go in Thai food. Do not want. It did NOT mix in with the curry and just burned the s*** out of my tongue. The rice was also very dry.

The bill for this ""Oh let's just get Thai takeout"" evening came out to $49. $49 for freaking take-out for 2 people. I was kind of shell-shocked; I had added it up at home and it shouldn't have been that much.... but me not wanting to cause a scene, I just paid it. I don't know if they accidentally did ""large"" portions, but they looked normal sized to me. 
But Jesus Christ, I can pay $25 for two people and get amaaaazing Thai food, so $49 for this lame excuse for Thai was not acceptable. Yes, I realize this is Scottsdale, and I am used to paying more for everything, but this was a whole new level...

My boyfriend and I went here with a Groupon that you could get two entrees, two salads, and two cocktails.

I had a ceasar salad that was quite tasty, but his house salad had too much bitter leaves and hardly any dressing. We both opted for the ribs & chicken because it seemed the safest choice with least dissapointment. The chicken and ribs were cooked very well and were moist and flavorful! There was a good bbq-jerk flavor to them. Our cocktails were decent as well, and while I appreciate the hookup with extra liquor it kind of killed the flavor. Overall experience was good though. We ended with pineapple upside down cake that came with ice cream and it was delicious. I would check out this place if you happen to be on the strip or staying there, but not a place I would venture out to.

They have many steak options, including a tomahawk ribeye, a nice assortment of seafood, and then options such as braised short rib, vegetarian gnocchi and even meatloaf.  What an easy place to take a large group of people.  Everyone will be happy. My dinner date had the bison ribeye and LOVED it. I had plans to have steak but the blackened sea scallops caught my eye- and my heart.  The scallops are in a raspberry sauce with blue cheese, honey and pecans!!!  It was so heavenly.  They offer the typical sides that steak houses offer. We chose cream style corn and creamed spinach and we were not disappointed. That should have been enough but their dessert menu is filled with too much to just end the experience here.  So on we went with the biggest piece of moist, delicious carrot cake.  And they did not scrimp on the icing. They make it in house and it really is a huge piece so we brought most of it home.

I have a Colombian friend that told me this was the best Colombian place in the city and since I LOVE Colombian food I had to check it out!
The service was outstanding! I have nothing bad to say about them, they were nice, attentive and fast!
We ordered a guayaba juice for me that was pretty good and a limeade for my husband. 
For appetizer we had beef empanadas and for entree we both went with the carne asada that originally comes with fried plantain but we asked them to switch it for fried yucca and they did it without additional charges. 
Food came with at the same time the empanadas did. One of the waiters apologized and seriously it was not big deal the main problem was the ceiling fan, our food got cold within few minutes :(
The food was good, we loved everything! The empanas were not my favorite today, they tasted good but the dough was too rough even though they were fried as per request.
Both sauces that came with the empanadas were good, chimichurri and another one that I don't know the name, the second one was real spicy but good!

Doro wat is a spicy chicken stew, chicken simmered in spiced butter, red pepper, onion and other spices and the shiro wat is ground peas cooked with berbere, onion, garlic and ginger, and I can tell you everything was just delicious! It comes with forks, but I don't really think your supposed to use them, its served with injera, which is like   a thin dense crepe/tortilla that is a sourdough bread and you just use that for your fork . I have to say the bread is amazing, loved the sourdough.

The food has amazing flavors and smells, the taste was equal to what you smell, it just wasn't very eye pleasing, but get over that quickly because its some amazing stuff! It was a great date night, great food can't wait to go back.",2014-09-16 15:31:55

The food is highly priced. An order of shrimp cocktail is $18 and has 3 pieces of shrimp. That's $6 per shrimp. I don't care how good that shrimp is, but $6 for one? Soups are about $11 for a mediocre size bowl. I can go on and on about everything I ordered, but I think I've said enough.

I've been to the steakhouse at the Silverton, their creamed corn is to die for. Here at Anthony's, we barely touched it. The steak at Red Rock, I still can't forget how the beef melted in my mouth. Eating the steak here, I felt it was tender but I could make it myself at home. Out of all the steakhouses, this one is on the bottom. BUT it was the most expensive. We ordered 4 appetizers, 2 soups, 2 different steaks, lobster, sea bass, and 3 sides. The best thing I had on the menu was the scalloped potatoes and that's a side dish. That's sad.

Needlessly to say, I will not be back. Not worth the price at all. Service was whatever for such an upscale restaurant. Our bread came out late and was cold. I still think the M casino is beautiful and might be back for drinks and the view but will probably never eat here again. Way too overpriced. I left here angry that I spent so much and was so unsatisfied.",2017-02-13 04:59:42

Dim Sum is the alternative to the usual brunch of waffles and hash browns.  Why have a sausage link when you can suck on chicken feet? Don't worry, not everything is that exotic.  Most items they carry are very feasible and safe.

Dinner is also another epic adventure in itself! The menu is very extensive and could take you a couple of hours to finally decide on something.  Or you can make it easier for your party by asking for the family menu that contains a set of items they recommend.  This route is typically cheaper and feed more if you have a large group.  If you are adventurous, ask for the family menu that is Chinese! Can't read, server can help translate.

Seafood is always fresh as they have live tanks in the restaurant.  Service is usually quick.  It always amazes me how fast I get my food sometimes!

I used to come here a lot for wedding receptions and other festivities.  Do not be surprised if you arrive and half the dining space is occupied.

I've always equated it to being the In-N-Out of the East Coast, and in a way, it is, but it also really isn't. It has a fairly simplistic menu, at least on the burger side, but they do have some alternatives that In-N-Out does not.

For one, the 'Shroom Burger. It was actually a lot better than I was expecting. I was forewarned that it was a vegetarian burger, but even though I'm more inclined to beef on my burger, it turned out to be pretty darn tasty! Melted cheese, sandwiched between two portobello mushrooms, deep fried in batter sitting below two tomato slices and a lettuce leaf, all within my hamburger buns. Diameter-wise, it was small, like an In-N-Out burger, but also delicious. Be careful of that melted cheese though, cause it definitely oozes and explodes out on the other side of the portobello patty when you least expect it.

The Bacon Cheddar Shack looked small (again) but amazing, with a white cheese sauce threatening to takeover the entire burger. And bacon, of course. However, it seems like it looked way better than it tasted cause the hubby was less than impressed. He was rather disappointed that it wasn't actual cheese and that the bacon and cheese sauce essentially overpowered the entire burger, so much so you couldn't taste the meat (pun intended) of the burger.

Now, the damage was about $7 per burger and $3 per side of fries. So basically, you're paying restaurant prices for fast food. Worth it? Eh...I'm on the fence on that. Maybe if I tried a shake or custard, I might be more partial towards it, but with this experience alone, I think I'll stick with my usual haunts of Five Guys or In-N-Out.",2016-06-06 07:51:21

We were there Saturday night, a very cold Saturday night and it was still pretty busy, but you can tell as soon as it warms up it will be slammed. There are a ton of neat things to do (people size Jenga, Corn Hole, Pool, and several other games I can't remember now, lol) and the view is fabulous! There are a ton of TV's playing every sport you can think of and a wide range of seating options (bars, tables, group tables, comfy couches) 

Let's get to the good stuff, the food! At the moment, they are not doing the full menu but a small sampler of what they will have. I am very excited for the full menu though, as many of their offerings have some kind of beer ingredient involved which sounds very cool. Another thing I have been excited about are the prices. Everything is very reasonably priced, especially for the strip! Love that they are not going crazy on the pricing, it means we can eat more, lol!

On Saturday we had the Chile Verde Nachos, and Hummus. The Nachos were fabulous!! The chips taste homemade, the cheese sauce (made with beer) is great, and the pork was sooooo good, and I am not usually even a pork fan. It was one of those meals you keep eating after you are full just because it is so yummy! The hummus was great too and the pita chips that came with it were yummy and there was a TON of them! My husband and I shared and couldn't even finish all the food, great portion sizes!

I should mention too that the cups and dishes look like red solo cups, or plastic cups, and paper plates but are actually a sturdy hard plastic and it is just kind of neat. Gives you that outdoor bbque or tailgate feel, but is actually a sturdy option. They even have tiny red solo shot glasses! 

I'll end this with saying they also have a TON of beer (duh, beer park) I actually had margaritas (YUM!) but will have to try some of the bazillion beers they have another time.

I know it sounds crazy, but I'm still on my quest to find a great taco Tuesday in Vegas. I have been subscribing to OTB's email newsletters for months now, and I finally made it out on taco Tuesday this week 9/30/2014

When we arrived in the cantina area all of the tables that were empty were completely filled be and sticky and gross. We set up the one with the least debris on it and my friend had to go and get some disinfecting  cleaning spray off of the server's station because no one came by to check on us.

I was dismayed when I ordered a margarita at, & I found out that it was pre made from a giant slushy like machine at 7 eleven. It was overly sweet, and it came in a mug instead of a margarita glass. Our server who is obviously over worked told us that we had to order the jumbo margarita in order to get in a margarita glass. Um ok, but who serves a margarita of any size in a beer mug with only 5 ice cubes? 

So I ordered another margarita with a ""floater"" of Cazadores tequila, but I never actually got to see the ""floater."" Apparently they do it all for you. No, thank you! 

So the margaritas suck. On to the food:

The chips and salsa were nice and fresh tasting. I order the guacamole which came on a plate that was formed by two ice cream scoops. 0 stars for presentation or even trying to make it look like they made it fresh sometime in the last day or two. It wasn't pretty.
Yes, it contains more onions than a normal guacamole, but I do love onions and the flavor was actually decent. Next, we ordered the empanadas with chicken. There wasn't much chicken and they were very very Fri fried, but whatever. That's all I have to say about those

On to the tacos. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which sounded delicious. They came out and lavish presentation with lots of cheese and lettuce and cabbage like I like. Unfortunately the fish was so salty that as soon as I took a bite my heart started hurting from the sodium intake. The corn tortillas were greasy. I asked our server -when I could finally find her again- if she could have them remake the tacos with less sodium.

Finally our server brought out some more tacos, and they were made ""without salt,"" but they still had a great flavor. I guess the grill was already salty enough from all the other overly salted tacos.

If the service would have been better, then I would have been able to overlook  the discrepancies with the food. Unfortunately. All of the servers were too busy and very inattentive. Our server especially acted as if we were a burden every time we asked for something.Thank goodness for the caring busser who finally brought us the water and napkins our server forgot.

At the end of our meal, instead of thanking us, our server told us to order the fish tacos ""without salt"" next time to save the hassle. How about I avoid your section next time instead? 

I'm so disappointed!  After a year and a half of anticipation this is what I get. I might go back and give them one more try only because I really love tacos and Tuesdays.",2014-10-03 18:28:19

another soup. When a manager came around he asked if we
wanted more bread sticks, of course we said yes

to our table. Finally our server came back and we asked
for the check. We placed the cash inside and continued

that. But we are of the ages of 28 and 23 and work in

The issue that the Double Door Inn has is room.  Now if you are at the DDI and there is a light crowd it's great, but if they pack out the house, it can be a little much to deal with.

There is a nice patio and the crowd is normally a pleasure to be around.  I also think the staff is pretty good.

You see it in the open wood decor and internal brick facade and the homages to the humble pig throughout the establishment, from the little pig statues at various places and the pig themed head wrap I saw one of the chef's wearing. 

However, don't be fooled by the laid-back Southern charm, this place is one well-run eating venue. The wait staff is extremely polite and respectful and provides good service without overly hovering or checking if you like what you are eating five seconds. They don't have to, they know they food is good!

I took my parents out to brunch here on Mother's day, which they opened early for as they are usually only an evening eating establishment. Though the don't provide overly large portions what they do serve is wonderful. My mother had the chicken fried steak, which seems like it is done with panko breading and was nicely crisp and the sausage gravy was delicious. It is not as good as the chicken fried steak at Texaz grill on 16th street but that place specializes in the dish. As for my father, he had a brisket hash comprised of cube brisket mixed with sauteed peppers and onions. As for myself, I had the oven roasted shrimp and sausage that comes in a spicy tomato sauce, along with creamy grits and I had the additional two fried eggs on top. I enjoyed it though it was a small dish of the grits and would have loved more but that is more of the bistro influence, smaller amounts but what is provided, top quality.

We also had some drinks and I ordered the Pimm's cup, which was refreshing and heavy on the muddled cucumber, which I liked but might not appeal to everyone. As with the food, I would have liked to have seen a drink of a somewhat larger size (I guess it is the thematic element to my review - more, more!).

The only part where I wasn't so impressed with the quality was the dessert portion of the meal. We had the creme brulee, which was coffee flavored and well, don't mess with a classic folks, leave it plain, no coffee addition, but it was of a good size and came in this cool little cast iron pot (that down-home Southern influence). We also had the pecan and fig pie which was a little less like a pecan pie and a bit more cake-like. When you say pecan pie I tend to think it should be a bit more gooey and syrupy  and as for the coffee, it was okay but I encourage the establishment to upgrade a bit. Maybe go to providing a french press at the table versus pre-brewed coffee. Chelsea' kitchen would be a good place to benchmark against relative to this recommendation.

All in all I liked it and more of a 4.5 than a 4 in my book but I'll go back again and see if my review rises but overall an exceptional dining establishment, only enhanced by the high quality wait service provided by extremely polite employees at Beckett's Table.",2013-05-15 20:49:02

 my friends encouraged me to try it one more time- FAIL. 
The BOGO enticed me, let me tell ya, if those sushi rolls weren't bogo- I wouldve been soooo pissed off.
 Its bogo for a reason folks.
 The sushi is awful. Not much different from what I was claiming in 2012. 
I tried the cherry blossom roll and the surf n turf. YUCK.
My other 2 friends that were with me agreed that their rolls tasted old, just as mine did. My sushi had avocado where some of it was turning in color (old) and the salmon also did not look fresh....or the tuna.... DAMN! 
Like seriously guys, sushi isnt your cup of tea.... practically 3 years later....STILL, simply put, AWFUL sushi. 
I will never go back, I dont care what kind of luring special they advertise, on top of it all - believe it or not this place is pricey!  Like 14 bucks for something you wouldnt pay a dollar for.

I've gone many times for lunch and always leave very happy.  You may ask why only 4 stars if I'm always so happy? Well to be honest, I'm hooked on the Veal Parmesan sandwich to the point that I can't order anything else so I can't really speak for much else beyond that.
I have tried their pizza, pretty good but nothing out of this world. And their deli meats and cheeses are also excellent.  The only other item I've tried for an appetizer is their hot banana peppers stuffed with sausage.  So first about them. You get three huge banana peppers overstuffed with sausage covered with cheese and a tasty marinara sauce.  I find them outstanding for many reasons.  First they are overstuffed. Who doesn't like overstuffed everything?  Unless of course it is you in your pants.  The peppers have just the right spice level, a nice kick but the spice doesn't overpower everything else.
Now onto the Veal Parmesan sandwich.  While I highly recommend trying this sandwich I suggest either bringing a friend to lunch or planning on having left overs.  While at $9.99 for a sandwich you might think it is expensive, but the veal, served open face is larger than dinner plate.  Fanucce's clearly takes pride in the quality of their food as it is pounded nice and thin which makes for a great balance in crispness.  I enjoy eating the thing with just a knife and fork with the sauce on the side and just dipping into the side of sauce.  But if you want to be adventurous you can try and close it up eating it sandwich style.  If you are able to figure out how to do that please let me know, it looks next to impossible.  
While this is no gourmet restaurant it is a nice cozy spot to grab some great homemade food like mom used to make.  That is of course if your mom was Italian.",2011-02-26 20:59:35

We got their famous honeycomb pork Belly and I'm not an avid meat eater so we only ordered one order but it was more than enough for us mainly due the husband eat the meat and I ate the side dishes! One order comes with about two slabs of pork belly (super thick slabs), 5 side dishes, salad, and grilled kimchi and bean sprout. At the end with your leftover they make fried rice on the stovetop/grill.

The service was well paced, the food quality was excellent, the side dishes were always filled, the water was refilled promptly, and the pitchers of beer were nice and cold. I thought for sure there would not be enough food especially since they recommended we only order 2 of the 2 person combos even though we were are party of 6. I was fully prepared to add more food. We were pleasantly surprised that there was the perfect amount of food especially with the extras that came with each combo. The steamed egg and tofu soup that came with the combo were yummy. I've had better kimchi pancakes, but it was still a nice extra. The person cooking the meats for us was very attentive and cooked everything nicely. As she cooked, she kept an eye out for getting our side dishes refilled. She told us which meat she was cooking each time.  The variety of side dishes were great. The seasonings on the beef and pork were not overwhelming since there was no need to hide poor quality meat like some places. I didn't have to drink a ton of water like the cheap places that season heavily. The presentation of the single person dessert (kind of a snow ice) in a martini glass was cute but $7.50 is a little steep.  It tasted pretty good though..
We made reservations and it was great to walk in with the table set up with all the sides already on the table. The range hoods were not super loud and worked as best as any of the bbq places can. Yes it's a little pricey but we felt it was worth it. Maybe because it was not busy or maybe we lucked out with our server, but we had great service.

I came here a few times, and I love their food. Especially their Paradise Sampler. That right there, just fills you up. If that doesn't fill you up, most likely their big portion of food probably will. But their sampler, has everything on the Appetizer menu, plus a smoking volcano, literally, a smoking volcano. No matter how many times we asked or that our friends asked, you can't take home the volcano. The presentation of the Paradise Sampler is something you'll remember about Kahunaville. 

Usually you would probably get full from the Paradise Sampler, but there's always more, much more. One time I ordered a chicken wrap, which I would thought it would be something small. Unfortunately its a big ass chicken wrap, probably as big as your foot, or close to it. But overall, they have big portions and sure enough it will surely fill you up, if the sampler didn't. 

The place itself is very nice, very colorful. One room has the bar, and there's another room that has a mini water show. It is very roomy and spacious that you won't have a problem moving around. 

I recommend this place, for its food and its scenery. The Paradise Sampler is always my preferred Appetizer, it just amaze me on when they bring it out, that the volcano is smoking. Even though I know its just dry ice and water, but it add pizazz to the presentation. Kahunaville is truly, one of a kind restaurant.",2011-02-20 21:34:29

First there was the drink. Hand crafted tasty drink... It wasn't mine, but I drank it anyways. I shouldn't even be mentioning it anyways, because I can't even remember what it was called! Next there was the crispy chicken wings confit. What? Lin who hates chicken is eating chicken? I know strange, but I did! And I liked the flavors! It made the chicken bearable for me.  Really though, anything with jalapenos does that for me. Greenhouse was just the first place to ingeniously make me appreciate the combination. Yum. 

Then there was the entrees... Pan fried pork chop saltimbocca for the dinner date, hand ground beef filet of beef tartar for myself. The pork chop was tasty, but I am still dreaming about my beef tartar. My only thing is that I wish it came with more or bigger bread chips. The beef tartar also came with pommes frites, which we upgraded to animal style. I've never had anything poutine inspired, so I don't have much to judge this on. They were tasty enough, but I think I am more of a chili fries kind of girl. Oh well! Regardless Greenhouse tavern went above and beyond what I expected.",2015-06-25 15:30:05

Arrived around 11P.M. on a Thursday night and was helped after standing in line for less than 5 minutes. The lady at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful. I asked for a room with a view, and man oh man, she gave us a room with a breathtaking view of the strip. THANKS LADY :D

House cleaning was on point. Every time we came back to the room after a day of exploring, the place was cleaned and nicely put together. They even organized all our belongings on the table AND in the bathroom-- Brownie point because of my OCD :)

Pros: Very nice swimming pool area with a full bar.
Connected to the mall -- easy access to food/shops.

Cons: It gets a little congested near the elevators because you need to swipe cards before you can go on the elevator. I guess to keep Elara is safe from intruders...?

Will definitely come here again! HIGHLY recommend to people. This place is underrated FOR SUREEE!

My burger was extremely wet which caused the entire thing to fall apart making it impossible to eat.  I also don't understand why they tell you that you can have anything that you want on your burger, but give such skimpy amounts.  ONE mushroom on a burger does not count as a topping.  

I agree that the fry order is strange.  It's fine for two people to share, but I can't imagine going solo for lunch and ordering such a massive amount of fries.  

I don't get the whole peanuts-in-a-burger-joint thing.......peanuts and burgers?

Prices are a bit on the higher side for such typical burgers.  Can't get out of there for under $10 person.  If the burgers were fantastic, I wouldn't mind the pricing, but they aren't that great.

I'm from San Diego and I miss miss miss the taco shops I grew up eating at. I had up until this point settled on Fili B's because every taco shop in AZ I have tried has disappointed me. Until Los Taquitos! 

 I have now eaten at Los Taquitos 3 times! First time I tried Carne Asada tacos and Carnitas tacos, both were really good! The Carnitas tacos were moist and flavorful! WOW! We also had a quesadilla, and it was creamy buttery deliciousness. Have had both items a second time and I am still SOLD! Oh and their Salsa's are really good, too!

 I also tried their Pozole, which was a good size portion and very flavorful, a little too salty for my tastes, but I would order it again for my Pozole fix! 

If you are looking for a new taco shop...maybe you should find a different one because this one is mine now and I don't want to share! Just Kidding! 

Oh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home. They are always too dry and disappointing! And I don't think you can judge a TACO SHOP by an enchilada/tamale...try a taco or burrito...I truly believe that not everything at one restaurant can be great! In my opinion!",2010-01-24 01:11:59

The waitress was very prompt and nicely explained the menu, a beverage special for the day, and the day's menu and soup specials. I ordered a cup of Jewish penicillin with a matzo ball and a half smoked meat sandwich. The waitress explained Montreal smoked meat and that they do theirs in house. 

My companion ordered potato latkes and kishka, which she had never had, and I haven't since I was a kid. 

My soup came out first, as requested. A very generous crock! The broth was nicely flavored wit bits of chicken and carrots, and the good sized ball a perfect consistency by my standards (I don't like them TOO airy). Served with a side of wonton-type strips, but tastily fried in schmaltz for a change. 

After I inhaled that, my half sandwich arrived (more like a whole) with a newer half dill and a takeout carton of a good not-too-creamy coleslaw. I remember Montreal smoked meat having WAY more flavor and way less fat strips, but this wasn't awful. 

My companion's latkes came with a small side of sour cream (where's the apple sauce?).  The 3-4 CD-sized disks looked delicious, and had a good consistency, but had a very odd, unappealing flavor. Her 3-4 kishka slices had a dose of gravy, and were decent, but my memory remembers stuffed derma (kishka) being more much savory and salty, less sweet. 

So all in all, I'd order the soup in a heart (attack) beat for comfort, and might try a different sandwich, but the food didn't make me vaklempt.",2014-06-02 00:49:48

For a few years I passed by this little gem, always saying, ""I'm going to try that place"". So finally one sunny morning I ventured out to the infamous ""Happy Grill"". 

As I walked in I knew I had found a great breakfast spot. The layout is what I like to think of as ""old-fashioned"" because the kitchen runs the entire length of the place. Something you don't see anymore. A row of backed stools line the counter with a series of booths across from them along the hand painted wall. The wall depicts the theme; happy chickens and pigs running around in a grassy field with the smiling chef centered giving two thumbs up, spatula in hand ready to serve up something tasty. The restaurant reminds me of something out of a movie with it's nostalgic feel.

With only a staff of about five, this place manages to keep up with the bustling demand of grumbling bellies from all over. They all are very friendly here and the appreciation of your presence is felt.

A very clean establishment; the tables are shining and the floor is swept and tidy. Condiments are neatly organized and plentiful. Bathrooms are clean.

The food is typical breakfast food made with love and is tasty. They also do lunch, which I've yet to try. Everything I've tried here has been deliciously devoured. They uniquely bake their own bread which is light and fluffy. You can try some with your meal! Also you can order a loaf to go. They also make meringue cookies that go feat with a cup of joe. 

I think what I like most about this place is the value. You can get out of here for usually less than ten bucks with a full belly. 

I usually go early in the morning and miss the rush. I have seen quite the after-church rush here. 

Overall a wonderful kitchen with good food at a great price, good people with great attitudes, and good service that will keep you coming back makes for a Happy Grill.",2014-08-31 12:57:25

That's the only thing that kept it from 5 stars. Now we did only stay for the 1st set so the night may have gotten better. The music they played before the band went on and after there set was country music which you would expect and we were happy with that. Some of these places try to market as country music bars and play a lot of hip hop and what not. Not this place which we were happy about.

I like Thai food...more specifically, I like spicy, well made, flavorful Thai food!

That's what you get at Touch of Thai...currently holding the title of ""Best Thai Food within Walking Distance of my Home"":)

This is a lovely little spot, a little bit off the beaten path...and by ""beaten path"" I mean that it is about a block off Scottsdale Rd. and parked between a defunct gym and an ""Asian Massage"" joint, in between a bunch of offices.

It's across the corner from ""Giligin's (every now and then you can hear gales of laughter from across the street as somebody ""tosses a midget"" or something:)

The restaurant itself is lovely, with a little courtyard between its two dining areas (kind of an unusual layout), and nice open feel, a pretty little bar area...oh yeah, and the food is terrific!

A very nice Thai couple own and operate this place, and the food reflects the love and attention to detail that they put into their restaurant...the young lady that owns the place is also (apparently) the main cook and the other night when The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner, she was very concerned about over spicing the Garlic beef, and came out to see if I was going to be OK, with it (she even offered to remake the dish if I had a problem with it...but I didn't...for whatever reason, I seem to be able to metabolize capsaicin like it's candy:)

Other people try to hang with me on the hot stuff and say things ""oh my god...I think I just ate the sun"" and ""it tastes like burning"" while I ask for ""more chili oil or sriracha, please"":)

Carin doesn't like the heat so much so we had our Pad Thai (I know, seems kind of boring, but they make the dish so darn well at TOT) at medium spice and our veggie curry at low heat, all tasty and delightful!

Speaking of curries, if you are a curry fan, you could worse than to stop by TOT...they have a couple of menu pages seemingly devoted to a wide variety of yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and other rainbow colored curries (I might be exaggerating about some of the colors, but I've had some of the red and yellow curry dishes and they are as good as any I've found around here:)

They even have a whole rack of these curry dishes on their lunch special menu ($8.95 for a giant plate of lunchtime Thai:)

The next time you're in Old Town, bored by the Modern Steaks and Olive and Ivy's, get off the beaten path and give TOT a spin...they are nice people, good cooks, they seem to find both flavor and heat back in the kitchen...and if you are in the mood, you can stroll down the block after dinner or lunch and get an ""Asian Massage"" to ""settle your stomach"" :-)",2010-04-03 17:47:26

It's in a Tupperware container in the fridge.  Other than that it's burgers, chicken, fries and onion rings.  Even if there is just one person behind the bar, they will come out to see what they can get ya - drinks or otherwise.  And they'll bring it to your table.  

Sure, there are big screen tv's, pool tables and a pretty decent juke box for a spot like this.  But the real attraction is watching the regulars come and go while you enjoy your awesome burger goodness.",2006-12-29 22:38:10

We had Grilled Cheese sandwich, chicken wings, and Beef tips. They all taste great! Long Island and a mix drink (forgot the name) were tasty as well.

The service was good, the waitress checked on us several times.  I like good service because it makes the experience so much more enjoyable.  

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that we think the prices are a bit high for what you are getting. It is not crazy over priced, just a few dollars or so high on most of the food items and the drinks were $2-3 higher than other bar places.

The food comes out and I am thrown off by the injera bread.  I inferred what the concept is immediately, but didn't expect the spongy texture.  Not that the bread wasn't good, the distinct sourdough taste overwhelmed the flavor of the meat for me, so I go with picking up the meat and salad directly. I just figured it's really just the same as picking it up with the bread except more saucy.  I suppose I must have sounded crazy when I asked if any of their dishes comes without the bread, but the server did note that some come with rice.

Kohinoor's Indian beer for $10 for 22 oz costs $2 more than India oven $8 for same bottle.   Now (Aug 2017) their  Groupon is asking you to pay more than you used to pay, for less discount.   So now you only get about 33% discount, pay $16 for $24 value for two, when before you got 50%, but the requirement to buy one food item has always been the same.  Also, the lady answering the Kohinoor phone, can be very rude, sometimes.

Now I go to India Oven because for the same price for dinner $11.95, IO has both goat AND lamb dishes, as well as chicken, in their dinner buffet.

It was a perfectly warm evening, so there were plenty of people walking around the grounds and enjoying the night. There was dancing and activities. Provenance was debuting some menu items and we were able to sample some of their delicious offerings. The Friday MIX event was really nice and I plan to go to future MIX events (first Friday of the month, I believe).

The CMA is really fantastic. There's no admission fee, which is amazing considering the wealth and variety of art they have for you to see. They have a coat check which is SO nice so you don't have to lug your jacket or umbrella around with you. The atrium is really spectacular.  The museum itself, decor, etc. and grounds are all rather impressive. 

Every time I visit the CMA I ask myself why I don't come more often (see: general laziness). It's such an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon, particularly a rainy or cold one. 

CMA offers a variety of art classes for children and adults. I REALLY want to take a class there. They have tours (including stroller tours for those with little ones) as well.  
You can get a bite to eat or some coffee at the Provenance Cafe and eat at one of the tables in the atrium, or opt for a sit down meal at Provenance.

The salad bar is always packed with people who just finished their workouts. With a sushi counter and a Starbucks inside, this store is all about convenience.

I suppose I could venture to No Frills on Sherbourne, keeping in mind I may get stabbed repeatedly if I reach for the wrong apple.

There's always Valumart, but I find their name misleading and their selection sucks.

Service is great now! In the beginning they were overwhelmed, slow and orders were forgotten, but forgivable, being it was during the first week, but the staff has been very welcoming, efficient, and always smiling.

The reasons for this include: low-key atmosphere, nice bartenders, (sometimes) free jello shots served in plastic toy syringes, stiff drinks, and memories of killer karaoke with Ryan M., Ben H., and Corinne W.! 

Drinks are cheap, music isn't too terrible, and there isn't that snooty pretentiousness that some of the other bars and clubs have. Ironically, I don't think anyone in our karaoke group of 12 was gay,but it didn't matter.

She has been taking care of me for some time now and I can honestly say that she seriously is a master at her craft which I also see as an art form. Speaking of art, I also got to see Sara's Henna skills at work too on my most recent visit, So if anyone out there is looking for a great Henna Tattoo to display, they do a great job at Divine and the pictures do not lie.

Lately, I've noticed that business has picked up here and there has been an addition of a few more girls(before it was just Jasmine and Sara) they have also added new, more comfortable chairs which have added to my threading experiences here. My wait times haven't been too long and I don't mind waiting if I need to, because I already know the great results I'm already going to have.

The prices are still exorbitant for what you get (hence the reason I can't give this 5 stars), but that's the story of the entire Fox family.  Like Sauce, Flower Child is a fast casual concept.  Step in, order your food and pay at the counter, and seat yourself.  Unlike Sauce however, you're given a lot of freedom to customize your meal in a multitude of ways.  And the menu is decidedly on the healthier end.  Tonight I came with my siblings for the newest Fox experience.

The restaurant is located across the street from the Henry, on the northeast corner of 44th and Camelback just behind the Schmidt Jewelers.  When you step inside it almost feels like a health food restaurant.  I'm not sure why, but the color scheme and the setup just gives off that type of vibe.  Not a hipster or hippie vibe, more like an indoor farmers market vibe.  At any rate, we came around 6pm on a Sunday.  It was starting to get busy but there was still plenty of seating available inside.

I decided to go with a veggie & grain bowl as those are the most customizable of the menu.  You choose one of four proteins and then add 1, 2, or 3 amongst 12 possible side items.  For my protein, I went with the salmon.  For the sides, I went with the roasted veggies, organic mashed potatoes, and seasonal fruit.  They also have more exotic options like quinoa, kale, sweet potatoes, and even soba noodles.  For a drink I went with lemonade.  They actually have about a half dozen lemonades you can choose from at their lemonade dispenser (all mixed in house).  I went traditional and chose the house lemonade.  Total cost for my bowl and lemonade was $20.  Yup, its pricey, though I guess the silver lining was that I didn't have to tip anyone.

Took less than 10 minutes for them to bring the food to our table.  The presentation was impressive and the portions were adequate (I was actually expecting smaller).  In terms of taste, I was actually pretty impressed.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and had enough where it felt like a main course of the dish.  I was actually really surprised how good the veggies were.  Some of them had a good char on them but it didn't detract from the taste at all.  The potatoes were super creamy without feeling like I was scooping up a butter bomb.  And the fruit bowl was very fresh.  And maybe Sam Fox was listening to me when I said I despised all the pulp I had in my lemonade at the Henry.  Here, there wasn't a trace of pulp in my lemonade.  Thank goodness.  

The service we received was excellent.  Granted there wasn't much of it to be had since its fast casual, but the gals at the register were friendly and helpful with the menu and the woman who brought our food and took our plates was also very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  By the time we were done, the place was jam packed with Arcadia residents, but it still felt comfortable to us.

So alright Sam Fox, we haven't seen eye to eye very often, but you might actually be on to something with this concept.  For the health conscious and foodies alike, there's a lot to like about this place.  The prices are still steep for what you're doling out, but at least here you're doling out some really good quality food, quality service, and the always quintessential Fox atmosphere.  And at least here we the customers have some say over the look of our food.  And once again Sam, thank you for expelling the pulp from my lemonade.",2014-07-21 03:05:30

Between the two of us, we split the cheese plate, hummus trio, and lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were good, although the bean sprouts were missing from the platter. The meat was really flavorful though and the combo with carrots and water chestnuts made for a crunchy and fresh dish! 

The hummus trio was probably our second favorite of the three. . I believe there was a basil, rosemary, and garam masala. While we weren't in love with all of the flavors, we thought the portion was pretty generous (3 solid scoops of thick hummus + veggies and pita) and that the flavors came through well. Rosemary flavor was a bit perfumy for our tastes, but it was still great to try and a good value for the price!

Our favorite was definitely the cheese plate. It came with smoked Gouda, a wine cheese, and their house cheese, as well as candied nuts, roasted garlic head, grapes, honey, and small toasts. All of the cheeses were delicious, with the house cheese being our favorite. The portion was super generous as well, as we were expecting probably half the amount of cheese and maybe a few small pairings. 

Service was very attentive and friendly. Was always quick and easy to get the attention of a server at any time! Overall we had a great time trying out a few dishes, and left very full! Looking forward to trying more of the small plates next time and perhaps some wine :)",2018-07-31 12:49:27

This original location gets very busy very fast, weekends or not, they're always packed..this might affect your experience if you're a smaller group, as they seat you with a limit of 1.5-2hours, in order to turn tables and seat the next group.

Prices are standard across the chain I believe, with $5-$10 less on weekdays vs weekends.
They have live Brazilian samba dancers on weekends, which adds a lot of hype to the place.

Very accommodating staff, especially the general manager who was at this location, and he had moved to the Adelaide location when it first opened. For a specific reason on one of our visits, one of our guests could not have meat, only seafood, the GM simply created a whole grilled rodeo menu for seafood especially just for her, including shrimp, salmon, etc...which wasn't even on the menu for that day.
This is a recipe' for success at any business, when your staff/management go above and beyond to accommodate your guests' requests.

I knew the reviews weren't great to start with but we found a vehicle we wanted and that had a good price so we went ahead and bought it.
The process went smoothly enough.  We had had an outstanding experience at Infinity of Scottsdale (their 'sister') the year before but this is definitely your typical lower end and unimpressive dealership so be prepared to be haggled to death.  They have an absurd dealer fee which includes a bunch of hogwash about window tinting and what not.  Oh and by the way we were told this was 'standard' but got several different prices for it from several different people so I know it's a load of you know what.  They also talked us into a warranty which upon returning home and doing the math and seeing what it actually covered we decided we wanted to remove it.  We immediately called and even though they hadn't processed the papers my husband had to drive all the way back to their office to re-sign all the papers with the warranty off  what a waste of time!
The clincher really was when we realized that the driver door wasn't closing properly.  So we immediately called them and they said to bring it in since it still has the factory warranty.  2 different people said they'd fix it since we had just purchased the vehicle.  So we brought it in and they proceeded to tell us it wasn't covered.  Um, this is a car that is 1 year old and still under the factory warranty so how is this not covered?  We have tried to follow up with the customer service manager and she won't return our calls.
I think the thing that really ticks me is before we found this particular vehicle we had called the dealer inquiring about purchasing or leasing a new vehicle.  They kept calling us, kept coming up with better deals and numbers.  Then we happened upon this 1 year old vehicle that was better for our budget.  And the minute there is a problem we can't get ONE person to help us out.  It just goes to show that they truly do not care about the customer, just about making a sale.  As much as we love our car, we won't be loyal customers to this dealership.",2017-07-22 22:31:28

I couldn't find it... I ended up going to Second Cup (which is just as good and Canadian).

Turns out the reason why I couldn't find it is because it's INconveniently OUTSIDE the mall but 'attached' to the physical building.  The only way to access it is to walk out the mall and voila, order to your hearts content.  Due to the fact it's outside, it has less traffic than Second Cup so it's easy to get an espresso drink without waiting.  

Service is quick and efficient.  The cappuccino wasn't bad but certainly not the best. Average fare for mall coffee. So if you're desperate for Starbucks, trek outside.

As far as veggie dogs are considered, I really need them to be cooked split open on a grill for them to taste good. These were just heated up in some boiling water. So already, that just really turned me off to them before I even took a bite.  The dogs were alright--- semi-loaded with toppings, but they weren't anything special. I definitley needed two hotdogs to fill me up. For the price, I expected more.

Customer service there was pretty lacking. While one of the guys was pretty nice, the other guy... needed some customer service training. After browsing the menu for about 5 minutes, we started to place our orders. Hot dog server #2 gruffly  said, ""Next time you guys are going to order veggie dogs, make sure you let us know in as soon as you walk in because they take awile."" We responded we weren't in a rush, so no need to worry about the time! He responds, ""Yeah, but  we like to get 'em out fast so next time let us know."" This guy also spent a lot of time looking down at his phone, which was especially rude when he was in the middle of a coversation with another patron at the place.

I did love the lime green interior. It's quite a small place, so don't expect to take a big group there and have room to sit inside. There are a few small tables for people to sit at.

At first, you will miss it on the menu as it's listed as a buffalo chicken sandwich, but they will accommodate and make it into a wrap for you. The chicken was super (sorry I hate this word) moist and delicious! I believe it was breast meat so it was very tender. It was lightly breaded,  but didn't take away from the overall taste. I hate when all you can taste is the deep fried breading on the outside. The Rusty Bucket did it right! 

The size of the wrap was enormous and I didn't think I would finish it- but of course I did. You can also substitute ranch instead of blue cheese if that's not your cup of tea.

Lastly, you can also substitute your side for a salad for slight up-charge. I got the wedge salad instead of fries and it was just as delicious as my wrap. You can't really mess up a wedge salad, but the cilantro dressing I got with it was awesome!

The clothing choices are very limited so I wouldn't go here looking for clothes. Same with the collars, very limited.

I got my dog treats from here and she would not even touch it. She spit it out. That has not happened with any treat before. 

The employees are helpful and will answer any questions. This is not something you get at all pet stores in town so I appreciated that. They seemed knowledgable too. 

The dog grooming area in the back there were 2 employees talking and laughing really loud where I could hear them through the door, I thought maybe they could keep the noise level to a minimum when discussing personal stuff at work.",2016-01-21 15:20:11

(Sweet, fizzy/carbonated, sour, and very very very sour hard candies!) Just like the other reviewer, hard candies are low on my candy totem pole. BUT I'm a sucker for unique products and these lovely candy jars and containers are perfect for gifts (and as the candy on your office desk to entice visitors).

As mentioned by others, these are more costly than your garden-variety drug store candies. The biggest saving comes from the 280 gram jar for $25, (or if they have their promotion of three- 60 gram bags for $15).

Luckily, since hard candies are not as addictive as other sweets (seriously, are most adults likely to eat 20 hard candies in a single day?) I actually think this makes the purchase go a long way. It's great for when you just want a little sugar, but don't want to stare down an empty bag of cookies.

We decided not to drive all the way to Chinatown for pho and stopped by here. It wasn't my first choice or my second choice. I wanted to try another new one (to us) around the same general area, but it closed at 9, so we aimed the old VW and came here since they close at 10.

It's a modern looking design with street signs inside. No doubt to help those too drunkard from strong Vietnamese coffee from forgetting their table?

So the neat thing here is that you can build your own pho and choose your meats: flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, round steak. You choose 3. I like my meat rare so I ordered it on the side. Just make sure your soup is boiling hot (that darn Pho #1 used to be consistently hot and I can order beef on the side but now it's safer to just order it in the soup so it's still cooked and not raw).

The tendon was cooked till tender and the round steak was nicely cut, as in no sinews but a nice piece of tender meat. I didn't have fatty meat that you have at Pho So #1 now. They used to be lean meats but I think they thought we wouldn't be able to tell the yellow fat clinging to the beef and the fatty oil floating on their soup now. As this restaurant and No 8 proves, yes it can be lean, Mr. Pho So #1 (#2 more like it).

The broth here is pretty good but not as flavorful as it could be. I added Siracha for more flavor. I usually leave it out of the soup if it tastes good enough. BUT, to be fair, I didn't feel the need to drink my glass of water. Usually at their pho restaurants, the msg is heavy enough to make you drink like a camel (and pee like a horse). A hour later I am still not that thirsty.

Overall very friendly staff and the place is very clean (again Mr Pho So #1, your floors don't need to be sticky and neither do the tables. I can't believe I've been eating there since the late 90s). So if you don't want to drive all the way to Ctown, (phogeddaboutit? Uh oh, I've officially tried to steal it from mob movies and the dude advertising for San Gennaro Festival. He and De Niro gonna be mad. My next Yelp review may be written wearing cement shoes.) this is a nice alternative.

Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). 

As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. 

Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. 

Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. 

They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. 

Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! 

I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else.

Haji-Baba is SUPER popular as you can see by the Yelp reviews of this place.  The main reason for their popularity I think is due to their prices.  Their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other Mediterranean ~ Greek type of restaurants. 
    
I did find something I liked at Haji-Baba. I recommend you try their Gyros.  It's a really good Gyros and is one of the best in the Phoenix metro.  They don't shave their Gyros meat like at the other places.  They cut their Gyros meat off in long chunks, different sizes.  This adds another level of ""delicious-ness"" when compared to Gyros at other locations.  

They OVER STUFF their Gyros with meat, a small amount of tomatoes, red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce.  The pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve Gyros.  My Gyros needed a bit more tzatziki, but my server was slammed and forgot it, oh well.

As for everything else on their menu ~ meh, I've had better.  Their dolmades, rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked.  The shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking.

Service ~ 3 stars

Finally I got to eat here, although it was a sad occasion (Deanna's departure) it was great to meet up with so many people and just have a great time. Since we were a large party (18 in total), dishes obviously took a little longer to prepare but service remained excellent. 

I was one of the first to arrive and when seated with only 2 others our server came by a few times to ask us if we needed anything or wanted to take drink orders, she made sure our pitchers of water were filled and that we were all set. 

I loved the rustic decor. It was a little dark to see but I noticed the mismatched chairs and the bar stools and tables and the antique wooden buffet that was used as the server station. There is also a ""vault"" in which a party of max. 10 people would be able to enjoy. 

The food was great. Not spectacular but great. I didn't choose anything that was too adventurous to solidify my claim of good food. Scotty's meatball was sub par, it wasn't too special and tasted like there was not enough meat and too much filler. The rigatoni with tomato and basil was really good but don't bother getting the entree size at $14, opt for the appetizer which is half the size for is $7 and the entree size isn't even that big. 

I also tried the fried calamari and it was good, nothing special but it did come with shrimp as well which is always a bonus. I also had the creseulla, some name of that sort which is stuffed pastry with sweet potato and herbs, amazing! It's really good. When I come back, yes I said when, I will be having that for sure! 

Bathrooms are not the typical scary Toronto bathroom but only in the sense that they aren't in the basement. Is it that difficult to put a little bit of money into the nasty rundown bathrooms? Bathrooms are what I deem to be the difference between a nice hotel and a crappy motel, so why do I not have the same rating system for restaurants? Because it's a known fact that Toronto has the grossest bathrooms around. 

I would definitely come back here, regardless of the bathroom situation, it's got a great feel and decent looking servers (re: Kat F's comment of the David Arquette lookalike named Joshua or Joseph) and everyone is laid back and super unpretentious which is a nice change from the stuff I'm used to every day.

My SO and I went on a Thursday night during an Indians game, they have a tv (maybe two) at the bar but it was pretty empty, thank goodness.  We got our pick of seating, we chose one of the long booths. 
We ordered 2 cocktails and the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer.  My SO was a little apprehensive at ""cheese curds"" as an ingredient but he enjoyed the appetizer anyway!  Our server didn't take our entree orders until we were well into our app.  I was concerned about how long they would take to come out, but it wasn't a terrible wait.  We had another round of cocktails to keep us busy.  I forgot to mention the biscuits with apple berry jam and rosemary butter than they bring out.  Soooo good and they taste homemade!  He ordered the Chicken dinner ""late night"" style with a breast and thigh. They have 5 different ways to serve it available.  He said the mac and cheese and collard greens were perfect and well seasoned.  The chicken had a batter that wasn't too thick and was fried crispy, the meat was juicy.  I had pointed out that he didn't use any hot sauce (which he uses at most meals) and he replied ""there's nothing to add to this."" He's a black hole and couldn't even finish everything but was super excited for the leftovers!  I got the Lowcountry boil which was delicious.  For those who keep count, I only got 2 shrimp, but 4 crab claws.  I imagine they just scoop this out of a big pot, so everyone's serving may be different.  It was really tasty and I was glad for my ""soppin toast"" to soak up the beer broth.  I couldn't finish my meal either.  We inquired about dessert, but they only had beignets and pecan pie.  Neither of which interested me.  All in all service and food was spot on.  I'd recommend and go back in a heartbeat!",2017-10-06 21:50:35

Bartenders are cordial and make very good drinks.  When we were seated I was instantly offered a black napkin (my fave attention to detail in nicer restaurants) so they instantly won me over.  We sat in the dining room and Dave took care of us.  He had a great sense of humor. He is a consummate professional.  For starters, the Parker House rolls that arrive in a Staub mini pan (my fave cookware by the way so that made me smile) are killer good.  A thoughtfully placed pat of butter sprinkled with pink Hungarian salt and some other type of herb was incredible.  The soup was corn chowder and it was the best in a restaurant I have ever tasted.  I opted for the deviled eggs...again, delicious.  I ordered them as my entree and they accidentally brought them as an appetizer. I didn't mind, but Tim, the manager was on the scene within minutes to whisk it away and say the chef will make me a fresh plate, and bring it out with my husband's entree.  Yeah, talk about attention to detail and professionalism.  And then we were given a complimentary chef's tasting of tuna served atop a chia-sprinkled plantain with rice and with a few dots of sweet soy sauce. Yum.  The hubs ordered the ribeye and we shared the grilled asparagus.  He said it was the best ribeye he has ever had.  And I think you know where I am going with the asparagus... yep, delicious, with a nice hint of smoky char from the grill.  Top notch wine list but it also has some approachable offerings as well.  Around 8pm on a Saturday the dining room and bar were packed but the atmosphere remains very conducive to table conversation.  Such an amazing place.  The attention to detail, quality of food, creativity of the dishes...I will say this is the best place in the Cleveland area, and I am so glad we live 10 minutes from here because we will be going back many, many times.",2017-03-19 15:13:03

I was going through Yelp reviews yesterday looking for a good Indian restaurant and today a Groupon for Angara popped up. Decided with the 4 out of 5 star rating and great Groupon deal that I had to check it out. 

First off I absolutely love the decor. Elegant, clean and peaceful. Secondly the l service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, kind and knowledgable. And the food? Delicious. Been missing good Indian food since I moved out to Vegas. 

I had never heard of Handi Chicken before but I'm glad we gave it a try. Fresh onions, bell peppers and chicken mixed with a delicious ginger garlic sauce. Just yummy. We also had to get the staple Chicken Tikka Masala and it was exactly how I like it. Not too sweet like I've had at some places. The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfectly creamy. Combined with the Garlic Naan and basmati rice I was simply in heaven. Oh and the hubby got a glass of the mango lassi that I ended up drinking half of because it was too good to stop. Lol sharing is caring. 

I absolutely loved the food and can't wait to try out their lunch buffet. I hear the selection of food at their buffet is not something to pass up.",2016-02-04 03:49:29

The interior is larger than you'd expect. Counter with 2 bakery cases (chuck full of pies, muffins, cupcakes, brownies, etc.) side bar area, two seating areas (one medium with window seating, one large with couches more appropriate for longer period of sitting). 

I ordered the caramel toffee nut mocha and a gluten-free red velvet cupcake, came out to be $8. Not bad. My coffee was a large and lemme tell you, it's very large.

All of the people in my group (three of us) asked a lot of questions. The waitress was very patient and answered all of the questions with a smile. We all ordered a variation of skewers, two with boneless chicken and one had the steak and chicken combination. For starters, one of us ordered a salad, one the hummus, and I ordered the Mast o Moosir which is yogurt with dill and seasonings. The hummus and yogurt dip came with a huge piece of freshly made flat bread. It's called sangak bread. It was so amazing that a couple of us ordered another piece of it to take home. The appetizer sizes were very generous. Both were delicious. The salad covered an entire dinner size plate and was piled nearly three inches high in the middle. The dinner portions are quite large, too. You get the meat with a lot of rice. You have the option of getting half of the rice and a house salad if you prefer it. The rice has some saffron rice on top of it. It is rather bland, but after adding just a little bit of salt and this amazing seasoning that comes in a sprinkler container on the table it was fantastic. The chicken and steak are well seasoned and delicious. The chicken was all breast meat which I liked. The meal comes with a chunk of raw onion, lime, a grilled tomato, and a grilled serrano pepper. I was so glad we picked this place. We had been looking for something new to try in Yelp. Most people will have enough leftovers for another meal. If you have the chance, give this place a try.

My first experience with One Restaurant happened by accident. A few years back, after trying (unsuccessfully) to bluff my way into an Alliance Atlantis TIFF party with a pair of producer friends, someone suggested that we make our way up to Yorkville and see what was happening. Yorkville (despite being the trendy part of the city) has a strange small-town feel to it - lots of cobbled walkways and small businesses that make it a haven for tourists, celebrities and hipsters alike.

Our group soon found ourselves at the front entrance of a CBC bash being held inside the restaurant. With a little bit of exploration (and the help of a pair of programmers from the station), we walked right past security and got inside without a hassle.

We were immediately handed legs of lamb as we stepped inside. It was probably the best lamb I've ever had at a restaurant - succulent and full of flavour. We proceeded to spend the next eight hours at that party, in a whirlwind of celebrity encounters and amusement. Standing on the patio and watching Chantel Kreviazuk have a drink with her friend while ""Dreamweaver"" blasted in my head. Seeing Kiefer Sutherland shotgunning mineral water with a girl on each arm. Having a waitress give us half a bottle of vodka for no reason. Watching my friend get into a shouting match with John Lyman (The Sex Pistols) in the middle of the dance floor. Hors d'oeurves for days.

It's a party that, five years later, my friends still use as the metric for amazing parties. I've been to the restaurant twice since then (most recently a month ago, as of this writing) and the quality and consistency was still very high. The calamari was a particular highlight, and the server was very prompt and polite.

One Restaurant is definitely a place you should check out if you're in the neighborhood. If not for the ""see and be seen"" atmosphere, do it for the amazing food.",2016-04-28 18:13:08

The interior design is not only beautiful but so efficient too! Somehow a garage became an INSTA-WORTHY environment. The light fixtures and simplistic design  ultimately create the perfect spot for studying, catching up with an old friend, or relaxing on your own.

Unlike most cafes, this place has PLENTY of seating! Not only that, but there are booths in which you can adjust the lighting and have your own personal outlets!

Another bonus? FREE WI-FI! The password is posted where the trash cans, napkins, sugar and cream are.

How is the food?
The menu is perfect! Not too overwhelming nor is it limiting. The Banh Mi sandwiches are made with care and taste super fresh! You can choose among 4 types!

And the drinks?
Honestly the coffee is so good! It definitely tastes fresh and authentic, which means a lot coming from me because I'm super picky with my coffee! I got the Iced Vanilla Latte (as I was craving something sweet). You can ask for skim or whole milk. They even sell Vietnamese Drip Coffee! And they grind their beans to order! I have yet to try the bubble tea, but I have no doubt that it will be of quality as I've seen so many customers order the green tea!

The bathrooms are clean and the service is so friendly! The guy who owns the place so evidently cares for the customers and puts his heart into his work! He talks to customers to see how he can improve the experience for everyone.

I'm MOST DEFINITELY coming back! I low-key (selfishly) want to keep this place to myself, but I already know that I can't stop the buzz! And I wish the workers and the owner the best, though I'm confident they don't need luck with the overall quality of this business.

UPDATE:
They now have chicken pho on the menu! Have yet to try it myself but it sounds promising.

The manager Ben is super super cool! The service here is exceptionally patient, helpful and personable. Can't say that about most places.

I tried the bubble tea (Raspberry Green Tea with ""1"" sweetness and Pomegranate Popping Boba) and it was perfectly refreshing and fruity for a sunny day. Would get again! Excited to try other flavors and toppings. They offer non-dairy milk options (soy and almond milks), which is amazing. The raspberry flavor is sooo good especially because it's made with fresh juice (real bits of raspberry inside).

You really can't miss seeing the checkerboard racing design on the building but it comes up fast! 
Anyway, I love the pork sandwich.  The sauce is marvelous.  I like spicy, and it is hits the spot!  There are lots of choices on their menu.  They serve a whole lunch or just a sandwiche.  If you have an office party, think of Speed-D-Tees catering it!

I have talked with the owner Barbara many times.  So nice!  She takes the time to make sure you get exactly what you want for your order.

Anyway, about the sandwich.  You take 1/2 home, it's so good.  It microwaves up nicely, the bun turns into a sort of dumpling, sitting in the sauce and the meat ...oh, yum!

I ordered the Wagyu Beef skewer (~$9), Cheese Tsukune skewer (meatball with cheese ~$3) and Yaki Onigiri (char-grilled rice ball with teriyaki sauce with kelp filling $3)

It was my first time trying wagyu beef so I didn't have a point of reference, but the beef doesn't melt in your mouth, it's still pretty chewy. It's somewhat ""spongy""/ fatty because it's not overcooked, and has a slight charred taste. I don't know much about meats, but the texture and flavour is similar to tenderloin, tender and meaty. For me, the skewer was okay, I don't think I'll pay again for it, I didn't find it much different than your other cuts of beef.

The meatball and yaki were both super greasy! The cheese in the meatball was some sort of aged cheese so it has a bite to it. The rice was in an odd oblong shape, not triangular, and the texture is quite sticky. There wasn't much flavour inside, despite the kelp filling.

I'm not impressed with the greasiness of the dishes. I recommend going downstairs to the 1st floor and getting Ramen instead or go to Manpuku for better yaki

Did't even fake being concerned. "" What else were you expecting?"" - asked a bartender in a skirt barely covering  her crotch. Hmmm. ""Not being robbed?""- I wanted to say. But she was already heading with another sky vodka towards drunk accountants in VIP section. 
I am aware of the fact that life can be rather ugly on west 6th. Nevertheless this place just congregates ugliness and serves it to you along with vodka that gives you a splitting headache minutes after drinking. I do not care about bartenders doing "" pseudo-""dance of the little swans"" in stripper outfits on the stage covered with spits and bodily fluids, I do not care about strangers grabbing me. I love my shoes and my soul untouched.
I think world would have been better without bars like this. And most importantly - safer.

It took 15 minutes to get our order placed, then 5 min later we had two servers attempt to take our order. It was really annoying. Been here twice and same experience both times.

Doesn't matter if you want a veggie taco, fish taco or a pork taco they are all the same. If I had to choose my favorite it is definitely the fried fish taco.

My all time favorite dish is the bean and cheese nachos. It's super cheap and huge. Grab a few friends so you can finish it but it is absolutely delicious! Definitely worth it.

The atmosphere is usually very loud and always on the move. It can be hard to find a table especially around the evening rush. If you end up outside beware of the side by the misters. Many are broken and will just leak water all over you. 

As for parking, they have abundant metered parking outside but it is often limited. So keep that in mind.

The latest Tapas themed hipsterrific establishment from Charles Khabouth does not disappoint but rather delights and that is a huge compliment for a restaurant who on their first official day of business failed to reveal any flaws. From the ultra luxe interior to the decadent Spanish wine list and the super attentive and well educated staff, this joint is the real deal Holyfield.  But a fair warning  it is kind of hidden en route to a parkade behind Weslodge, so finding the place may be your only gripe.  Just look for the red 'P' sign just East of Weslodge and let your heart guide you to awesomeness.

So let me start off by sating that the menu is to die for, wobbly pops even more so and don't even get me started on the absolutely gorgeous finishings and art that adorn the place.  Mos def a great spot to impress a date, to meet with girlfriends or even to take clients.  Oh and I should also mention that yes they serve brunch on Saturdays.  Spanish brunch! With two kinds of (uber tasty) sangria!  Pinch me because I must be dreaming.    
Since it's day one, I'm not sure if the menu will stay the same or will be a work in progress, regardless I encourage you to try as many things as possible.  We did and I can honestly say there was not one thing we ordered that I did not enjoy.  Thoroughly.  Like lick the damn plate clean thoroughly.  The cheese selection is a dairy lovers wet dream, chickpea dish is out of this world and OMFG they have jamon iberico that they slice before your very eyes at the super stylish bar (also home to their deliciously seasoned Spanish olives).  I anticipate that this place is going to blow up (once people figure out where the f#%k it is), so if you (like me) have been yearning good Spanish nibbles I recommend going now while it is not afflicted by pretentious line ups and impossible to get reservations.

We were seated and then greeted right away. Menus were brought but, due to the crowded place, drinks weren't requested for another 10-15. We got a glass of wine, two beers, a Pellegrino and a coke. We also ordered the crudités and Peking Duck Croquettes at the same time, since it was a slow start. 

The croquettes were excellent, with savory, crunchy exteriors and flavorful interior. The crudités were average. It had beets, fennel, carrots, snap peas, asparagus and radishes with a tzaziki sauce. The veggies were just too boring with no seasoning. 

For entrées we ordered the Mushroom ramen (2), 
Chow mien, Pork ramen, Thai beef and a Seafood Hot Pot (mine).  The ramen were well received by my table mates. I tasted the chow mien and the beef was tasty but the noodles were very bland, with no saucy flavors. My hot pot was okay. It had fish, scallops and shrimp. The fish was excellent and the shrimp, aside from being over cooked, was good. The scallops were 1/4"" small so virtually no flavor there. The broth was hot but really had no body to it. Decent flavor but it missed the mark.

Great place for a date night, work dinner or special occasion meal because it is a bit fancier & quite civilized, but you still get that downtown vibe.

This place is tapas with a twist - not pure Spanish, but that is why it really reminded me of Spain, where they don't stick to pure tradition and are evolving Spanish food - very cool to see that in TO.

I am pretty sure the menu changes a lot, but the croquettes, figs and potatoes should always be there and are amazing - I would take server recommendations on food & wine as they are great and you will get good variety.

Only negatives for us were not deal breakers - 
a) too sweet - quite a few of the dishes mix sweet & savory in the same way - I found it too much of the same flavours
b) we were encouraged to over order twice - I hate that when at a small plates place...let people step in to the menu, we know you want us to order more and maybe we will, but don't push everyone to order 3 or 4 per person...too much

All of us had never been to this theatre so we were thrilled that our experience turned out so well. It was a breeze to get a ticket, order our food and get our seats. When you order your food, you pick it up at the cafe which is really the ice cream bar. We got the usual fare of hot dogs, cokes and popcorn. Three orders of food came out hot and we were surprised the hot dogs were not soggy and that the condiment bar was stocked with ketchup, mustard and relish.

As far as the theatre itself and the seats, the theatre was clean, bathroom was not only visually pleasing but very clean (everything is white in the ladie's room so it was very peaceful looking) and all three seats we got in a row in the upper part of the theatre were working just fine. I particularly love these seats as they were wide and there were many ways you can recline and almost lay flat down. Who doesn't want to be able to fully extend and put your feet up.

What was unusual about this theatre was the perfect room temperature. Almost always, I have to dress in a sweatshirt and bring a cashmere throw because of how cold the theatre is but in this case, the temp while watching the movie stayed the same.

If you have tried and loved the roti with curry appetizer, you will loveee this dish!!! It is loaded with veggies and very good faux chicken.  It is a yellow curry, more like an indian yellow curry than a thai curry.  if you are sensitive to spicy foods it might be a bit much, but for me it was just the right amount of heat.  The Brown rice here is the best brown rice ive ever had...idk what other rices they use but its got a few dif grains in it that all come together so perfectly.  Tofu soup that comes with the lunch special is simple but flavorful.  For $8 it is a great value...I brought half my plate home!

*general tzos chicken: 5 stars (tastes EXACTLY like ""regular"" general tzos
*roti with curry: 5 stars
*crispy spicy eggplant: 3 stars (this is a highly praised dish, but I personally didn't like it as much as some people seem to. I think It is pretty good as a side, just not extraordinary as a main dish)
*spicy crispy beef: 3 stars. (Another highly praised dish, but again not one of my faves. Not very convincing ""beef""...to thin and crispy...reminded me almost like fried pork skins...but not as hard/crispy as pork skin so just kind of a confusing texture for me.  It was flavorful, and would be amazing on a bahn mi!
*orange chicken: 2 stars. (Tasted more like sweet and sour than orange. Very vinegary sauce)
*sweet and sour pork: 3 stars. (Loved the ""pork"" texture)
*fried dumplings: 3 stars (would have been 5 stars, but the ones i got were overdone.  Very tasty inside tho)
*shrimp and broccoli: 4 stars (One of the ""plainer"" dishes.  No overly rich sauces, but it still has good flavor to it. it tastes very similar to shrimp with broccoli from a regular Chinese place.

FAlafel is made of fava and garbanzo grounded with spices and deep fried balls.Totally Worth it. It's not spicy at all. So you can add Hot Sauce , Black pepper- available as condiments. Trust me Its more Like Gyrco .The only difference is it comes as wrap when you order and has meat in it. However falafel comes Pita that you can wrap in lettuce, tomatoes and 1 and half falafel for I Pita and Hot sauce and pich of Black Pepper. On the other end Gyro is $ 3.99 I guess. So $2.99 Is inexpensive and when you are veggie eater. Go for Falafel. I had 2 comrades, 1 ordered Gyro, 2nd  ordered Fava Beans and Basmati Rice. it is high quality (Long Grained Rice_ It looks like it is Zafrani for sure. It was in large portions..

The first being Bourbon Steak(I'm a duck fat fry guy)  Most everything was terrific here.  Some of the hard things to accept are the wine prices..Paying $98 for a $28 bottle is not easy to swallow.  The wine is good but not worth $98.  So you can imaging what it will cost for a higher quality wine.  The pate and pop overs were nice.  The service was spotty throughout the meal and at these prices a real let down.  Several items we ordered were not even delivered.  The pacing was painful even on a slow Thursday night.  The salad was high quality and big enough to share.  The meat was cooked perfectly and full of flavor even with no sauce which they charge $3 for?  When you mark up the wine 300% it seems insulting to charge for sauce.  Sides were just OK with the Au gratin potatoes being on the small side. I did not try the deserts but the ones that did get ordered didn't survive for long.  They also have a prixe-fixe menu but out of the eight people no one tried it.

Things were great from there. The wine was delicious and for once I can say I might have liked a Merlot more than a cab. I was starving, but it was too early for real dinner, so we just had a pizza at the bartenders recommendation. It was mushroom and it was awesome (and big!). The bartender was also great, super chatty and knowledgeable.

The menu was expensive, but quality deserves that. 

I ordered a vegetarian Quesadilla, large strawberry Margarita and we shared nachos with our friends.

I asked a few questions about the nachos before ordering. She thought I just wanted to know about them and did not bring them... our meals came and still no nachos, she giggled and said oops.

The margaritas were awful. The syrup they used made my throat burn. It tasted like medicine. For $16 I drank it, too expensive to waste.

Nachoes: Plain. Actually chip was pretty good. too much tomato, not much else. Not nicely presented. No sour cream. Really small portion for $15.

Quesadilla came with fries (WHAT MEXICAN PLACE HAS FRIES????) no beans in it. Literally dripping  oil. Was on a sheet typically found in fast food restaurants. it stuck to it so i ended up eating the paper a bit...... the fries were okay. It size was one fajita folded over... for $16....

Small portions, terrible quality, went home feeling sick to my stomach with a burning throat from the drink.

When my boyfriend went inside at 1:15 PM, they were finishing up our order, he paid & came right back out. Yes, another plus!

The chicken was seasoned just right & the fajita vegetables season was spicy. And the chips...crisp & flavorful, with the lime & salt. The guacamole was fresh & not mushy.

They said they'd just finished making an appointment with my neighbor (and gestured toward his house) stating that he'd been having a problem with scorpions and black widows.  He then informed me they'd be at his house on Saturday to perform a treatment and said they were going to tent the home.  He suggested I get my home treated at the same time to avoid an infestation of my home once the pests left my neighbor's.

I told the Moxie man that I already had a pest company who I was very happy with and that the owner was a family friend.  The sales guy made another halfhearted attempt to get more information, but then politely left.

The next day I asked my neighbor Scott about his pest problem, and he laughed.  He told me that the same guy had been at his house with the same story about the neighbor on the other side of his home.  He also verified with that neighbor that there was no pest problem.  That Saturday we looked to see if the Moxie man came to treat anyone's home but neither of us saw their truck.

Moxie may very well be excellent at protecting homes from pests, however, their lack of integrity, aka LYING, would prohibit me from ever hiring them.

2. Plantains are a must here! Sweet, savory and delicious. TIP: Dip them in the green sauce- it's so good! 

3. Speaking of sauces- they have 3, but my favorite is the new red sauce. A bit of a kick, but not too overpowering. All are made from different types of Peruvian peppers! 

4. The Arroz Chaufa is awesome- plus add the chicken. Mix in the sauces and you have a dynamite meal! The ginger gives it a little bit of a kick, but it's so darn good! They usually have this as a weekly late lunch special too during the week (2-5)  so be on the look out for that!

The new ownership has advanced the evolution, and (thankfully) redone the restrooms.  Signficant upgrades within and out on the rear deck.

Menu has a couple ""nods"" to the old Pressbox menu (remember the CamelRider?), but nothing in the new lineup thrilled me. Were I better dressed I would have walked next door to Good Food on Montford.

After I left the review a few weeks ago, Wookie (store owner) reached out to me to express his concern. I often have been contacted after a less than stellar review so I figured he was just checking the box so others see he responded. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Wookie REALLY cared. I told him I'd be back in touch and I did not contact them again nor did I have any intentions to do so. About 2 days ago, he reached out to me again telling me they really wanted to make it right. So I made some time to stop in. He greeted me presently and knew who I was after I mentioned my name. I left the store and he called me about 30 seconds later to say they would expedite the repair. Additionally, my new screen protector they had given me after my first visit got a small crack. They replaced the screen protector free of charge. If I could them 8 stars I would because Wookie really cared and his interaction with me after the previous reviews showed me that dissatisfied customers are not acceptable to him. Very happy to recommend this place to others and I'll certainly use them again in the future should I need cell phone repair. Thank you Wookie!

I had a terrible experience here and it continues. Let me explain...

About two weeks ago, I was in the gym lockerroom and I dropped my belt buckle on my iPhone 6 screen. I am usually really good with phones but I guess it hit the screen just right and it shattered. Later that day, I scrubbed yelp for the best iPhone repair locations in the valley. After that, I called a handful of them to price compare and Desert Wireless had the best price so I went there. I dropped my phone off and pick it up about 90 minutes later with a new screen and a complimentary screen protector. It looked great! $86 with tax I believe. 

It only took me about an hour to realize my phone wasn't acting the same. I would try and type something and get no response from the screen. So I would lock the screen, unlock the screen, lock the screen, unlock the screen. Do that 4-5x and then I would finally get some response from the screen. I wouldn't lock the screen until I was sure I was done with the phone knowing I would have to go through a process to get it going again. Not only did the screen barely work, when I place phone calls the screen no longer turns off like it's designed to do. So when I put the phone up against my face I often put it on hold or mute or something. I knew that I would not be able to deal with this but it's very hard for me to find time to stop into the store to have it addressed.

Finally, yesterday I went into the store at about 11:30 AM. I explained to the man what my issue was. He had a bad attitude about it but I get that he wasn't happy I was essentially challenging the workmanship of his business. He told me they would call me when it's done in likely around 90 minutes. I stopped back by at 2:30 PM (3 hours later) because I had yet to hear from them. The guy told me '20 more minutes.' As I mentioned before, I have very little free time so I didn't appreciate needing to wait but I can spare 20 minutes so whatever. 45 minutes goes by and I'm still sitting there. I saw 10 people come and go in the time I was there. So I was getting pretty pissed. Once again, I asked 'how much longer?' He said '8 minutes.' About 10 minutes later he told me it was ready. 

I wanted to check to make sure that it was working while I was still standing there so I started booting up my phone. It took an unusual amount of time to boot up. Like 4x the time. That obviously made me suspicious about what they even we're doing with my phone back there that they knew a precise time such as 8 minutes... 

Anyways, it booted up and the screen sensitivity was still not like it was when it had the factory screen but it was at least manageable and doesn't require constant reboots and such. Another thing I failed to mention earlier was that the screen would think my finger was on one part of the screen when it was really on another so it would call and FaceTime people without me pressing those buttons and I would have to frantically stab around at the screen to find where it believed the end call button to be! Again, that problem seems to be fixed this time. 

However, the screen still remains on during phone calls so I will not be able to comfortably make phone calls without using an earpiece or Bluetooth device until I get a new phone (whenever the new iPhone comes out). 

If I get even decent service or a decent meal or a decent product, a place can expect 4 stars from me. But I could not with a clear conscience recommend this place to anyone after my terrible experience. 

I say find another place to get your phone repaired!",2016-07-08 20:52:16

We ordered a bottle of wine, fideo pasta with clams and chorizo, piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail, prime beef striploin with padron peppers and crispy potato (chips), and the paella patria between 3 girls.  My favourite dish was the strip loin. The steak was cut into bite sizes so it is perfect to pair with the chips and peppers that it comes with and also perfect for sharing. The piquillo peppers was really small. It only comes with two peppers so between 3 people we were basically able to have a bite each. It is flavorful but I personally think it's too expensive. It was $16 for that dish. We could've done without it. The paella was good, it takes about 45 minutes to make so if you plan on getting it then you should order that first thing and then take your time with deciding on what else to order. The paella is quite large. Perfect to share between 3 people. The fideo pasta was okay. I think they fry the pasta because it was a little crunchy. The clams in the pasta was good and it was a decent size

Of all the dishes we ordered, I would only order the strip loin again. Everything else wasn't really mind blowing and I thought it was expensive. They also charge for hot sauce, which I thought was unnecessary. Food is already expensive, they can at least provide their guests with complimentary hot sauce.",2015-07-30 20:28:25

What can I say about IC besides if you're coming here you're pretty much here for their alcohol cause the food, at least what I had, wasn't that great. The interior is very nice, I like, and the staff was friendly but slow and they have a pretty good selection of alcohol. I had a beer but don't remember what I had, I'm sure it was something that I randomly picked of the menu.

First up was the Rice Cracker Skewer Combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA I was very disappointed in the dish it was literally a few small skewed items fried in rice crackers with some ginger sauce. Maybe a few more larger skewers and not too fried I'd be nice. Even so it was too pricey and didn't taste so good.

Next was the Braised Black Pork Belly http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#RFBIBkFfkoWItCH9vJYuMg which cost about $7. I didn't care for it.  Though it was cheaper and a little more filling than the Rice Cracker Skewers it almost tasted like eating an oily shoyu chicken but with pork belly. I needed some rice with it. It was pretty much the only decent food I had there. 

Next was the Black Cod Miso http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#_uygK0YKC20X7Z0JvfRtHA which was $7.50. It was a nice small piece of black cod with a good char on didn't have much of any flavor to it.  Again I didn't care for it.

I sampled others food and pretty much the majority didn't care for IC too much. Overall I have to give them a 2 star.",2014-08-03 02:35:50

Because of my husbands reward level, we were upgraded to a suite and given access to the concierge lounge. For a weekend stay, the evening  hors d'oeuvres and breakfast were excellent! The lounge had full glass windows with gorgeous views of the north shore and lake. There was ample seating available for the guests. 

The rooms were exceptionally clean. While the size and furniture were comfortable, aesthetically the decor was strange. I know that's just a matter of taste, but it wasn't at all calming. It was busy and had oddly paired color schemes. 
The lobby contained interesting artistic pieces though and the coolest glass mosaic huge 3D guitar made by the local artist Lisa Ruschman. 

The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance to many attractions. The day was beautiful and we walked to Public Square and sat in the park with several groups and families out enjoying it as well. On the way we walked right past the convention center and in the evening hit several happening nightlife spots on foot.

fgM8r7tQP3V6UL170z_ahQ,fhNSa1szPhXYvtcGzPXLiw,4m_hApwQ054v3ue_OxFmGw,4,0,0,0,"Scanning their menu, we decided to go with their Pimientos Rellenos De Buey ($14), Jamon Iberico De Bellota ($30), Croquetas De Jamon ($8) , Datiles Con Tocino Iberico ($9) , Pulpo a la Gallega ($16)  and their signature paella, the Paella Patria ($50).

The Croquetas De Jamon were the first to arrive and it looked like three fried potatoes laid on top of one another with a piece of cheese sandwiched in the middle.  Of course that's not what it was but it was certainly something very delicious.  The middle of the croquetas were nice and soft and well-stuffed.  The outer layer was lightly breaded and not thick and heavy in oil.  What made it uniquely interesting was that there was a certain kick or spice to it.  I wasn't really sure what extra ingredient was added by it almost tasted like there was either small onion bits or jalapenos embedded inside the rolls.  This tapas was definitely very good and certainly a must have if you attend this restaurant. 

Next to arrive was the Pulpo a la Gallega.  This tapas was actually not on their main menu but on their separate specials of the day menu.  There were about eight pieces to this delicacy in which an octopus tentacle was chopped up and placed on top of small pieces of potatoes in which turn was immersed in olive oil.   Although, the octopus tentacle was very tender, it unfortuantely lacked any taste and placing it on top of a potato didn't enhance it all that much further.  The addition of red paprika on the dish also for some reason failed to provide the necessary wow factor either.  It was one of those dishes that I neither loved nor hated.  

The Jamon Iberico De Bellota arrived next and this was basically thinly sliced meat of a 36 month acorn fed black hoof jamon iberico.  It was very thin and salty tasting but not as salty as some of the other meats I have had before.  The meat was nice and dry, and the thinly sliced meat made it a wonderful light appetizer to have.  One could probably eat the entire dish on their own and not feel full at all. 

Their signature paella arrived next and it looked wonderful.  There were langoustine, shrimp, mussels, cuttlefish, monkfish, snap peas and saffron in the rice.  It smelled really good and really made one's mouth watery.  You have to remember, tapas style dishes are quite small and when you are super hungry after a long day at work, a dish like this paella sure would feel nice in one's stomach.  Having been to Barcelona twice, I do have to admit it the paella in Barcelona was a little better than the one here however it was still pretty good nonetheless.  The one thing I didn't like was the fact that mussels had no meat in them.  The meat actually shrunk to the point where there was very little mussel meat to consume.  The meat was probably about one quarter of the total size of the shell.  Had the meat been more of a normal size in appearance, I think it would have given the dish a better presentation.  The entire rice dish itself was a little bit mushy.  It didn't taste bad, in fact it was tasted actually really good but the paellas I had in Barcelona were more purer and not as sticky or mushy as the one that was served here.  I didn't have any issues with the rest of the seafood.  It was a really good dish to have, well proportion for three to four people, hot when presented.  If the overall rice was just a little less mushy, it would have been a perfect paella. 

The Datiles Con Tocino Iberico arrived next and this was my favorite tapas for the evening.  The datiles were wrapped with a piece of bacon and this dish had the distinction of allowing one to experience all of your taste buds all in one bite.  The datiles themselves were sweet in nature, the bacon were salty and smoky tasting, the shallots gave it that garlicky taste and my personal favorite, although I might be wrong, was that there seemed to be a jalapeno component to it as well that gave it a really good kick to it.  It had a mixture of a lot of extreme tasting foods and ingredients which when placed together made this dish a wonderful dish to have.  I was really impressed by this dish and would give full marks to the chefs in its presentation and in its overall taste.

The Pimientos Rellenos De Buey arrived last and this was basically an ox's tail immersed in a pepper and manchego type sauce.  The best way to describe this dish was that it actually felt like one was eating beef brisket, the ones that are served in Chinese restaurants, served with noodle soup.  My fellow Chinese friends would understand what I am talking about.  The meat was soft, juicy and had a string like texture to it.  It was pretty good and although I wasn't really a big fan of ox's tail before, I am now.  

The total bill was $200.00 total, tax and tip included.  We also order a pitcher of alcoholic sanguine to go with our dinner that evening.  The atmosphere, the waiters and the people were all very nice and relaxing.  I enjoyed my evening there and had a great time!",2017-02-15 01:37:22

I had dinner there with some friend on Sunday evening and I was very pleasantly surprised. Imadake has really come into its own. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this as the place was packed on a Sunday evening. Based on the crowd you would have thought that it was Friday night. The atmosphere was fun and lively the service was good and not overbearing and the food was terrific. As I'm writing this I'm wondering why I'm giving Imadake 4 and not 5 stars, but it feels like the right rating.  

The menu and the food has matured since I first ate there. There are many great options on the menu, the food is fresh and tasty and the presentation is good. 

Many of the reviews compare Imadake to Kazu. I guess this is a natural thing to do as they are both Japanese restaurants in the same part of town at similar price points. However, I think that this is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison as these are two very distinct restaurants with there own approach to Japanese cuisine and each offer a very different experience. They are certainly not interchangeable. Now that I've thought about Kazu (a definitive 5 star restaurant) I know why I was comfortable with a 4 star rating for Imadake. 

Imadake is a great restaurant where you'll have a fun time and enjoy some great (and reasonably priced) food.  Enjoy an evening with some friend and be sure to order the Saki Bomb.",2012-01-18 04:11:12

I got to admit the inside is uniquely decorated, but I dislike almost everything else about this restaurant.  To start, the waiters are really rude and arrogant.  They all seem to have this pompous flair to them and I don't know why.  It most certainly does not make a good server.  They seem to act disgusted almost every time you ask them for something, and are neglectful of your table way more often that not.  It's not surprising for them to forget your table completely... The owner is also very arrogant, and acts sickeningly (and fake-ly) nice as she wanders aimlessly around the restaurant.  

The food is alright, but most is very underwhelming to me.  The food is not very authentic, (aside from the sushi) and is more of an Americanized Asian restaurant (much like P.F. Changs), and I tend to hate those types of restaurants.  When I want Asian food, I want REAL Asian food.  Not crappy American creations labeled as Chinese food.  

It's pretty expensive too.  Way overpriced in my opinion.  There is a $10 lunch buffet, but there are often only 4 entrees to choose from, and not much else in the ways of other food.  Fried and white rice?  Usually two plates of generic (and really cheap) sushi?  Totally not worth $10 at all.  Order from the menu for lunch and you are looking at paying over $10.  

Dinner is even worse.  While I only went once for dinner, and usually end up here for the lunch buffet, the time I did go for dinner was terrible.  The menu is almost set up like a gourmet restaurant, as there's not a big selection at all, and most meals cost around $20.  O_O  The worst part is, the entrees come out on huge plates with the tiniest bit of food in the middle.  They call it New Age Dining but I call it ""I just got seriously ripped off""

I ordered the salmon dish.  It was $21 I think.  Ridiculous, I know.  Well, it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back, 10 minutes later it comes back, and still raw.  I had to send it back twice and even after the third time it came back it did not taste right to me.  And like I said, it was the tiniest portion ever.  It was maybe a 6oz salmon filet on a plate garnished with sauce next to like a 1/4 cup of rice.... it really is pitiful.  My friend's entrees were similarly scarce looking.  

I really don't know how this place gets so packed when it is so expensive and the food is not that good.  It's touted as a huge date spot as well, but I'm surprised most stomach up the huge entry cost.  I hear the sushi is great but I never had anything other than the stuff they put out on the lunch buffet and it was terrible.  It seems expensive too like everything else.  Some praise the $1 sushi night, but that's per piece and personally to me that seems like a high price as well....

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Great Korean food here! My bf and I have been here plenty of times for lunch and dinner. Their menu is small so we've tried most of their foods.

When you walk in, the place is very simple, clean, and casual. Unlike Korean restaurants like Seoul, Koreana, and Dae Jang Geum there are no vents over the tables or built in burners in the tables. The crowd is mixed, usually Koreans like to come here. When it's busy and only a few servers are working, the service can be quite slow and really bad... but the food makes up for it. However, when it's dead the servers are usually attentive, refilling our teapots and offering more sides if we wanted. 

I'll start with their amazing $9.99 lunch where you have a choice between beef, chicken, pork, or Kim-bab (Korean-style sushi). The meal comes with rice, mung bean cakes, kimchi, and jap-chae (Stir fried noodles with vegetables). What I love about this is the giant portion of food they give you and the ability to try different sides. The mung been cakes are always too salty for me but I still eat them. According to a friend it is one of their popular appetizers on their menu and i think it's one of the few Korean places that serves it. Their meat is really flavourful with the right amount of sweet, spicy, and salty. I suggest getting the beef or chicken with the lunch special.  The pork is a little underwhelming in flavour. 

I love spicy foods, kimchi especially and I highly suggest you try the Kimchi-Jeongol hotpot ($25.99 hot n' spicy kimchi and pork stew) for 2 people which includes a plentiful amount of pork, kimchi, and a sidedish of rice cakes and onions to put in yourself.  It's quite large and we always have trouble finishing it, but it's totally worth it. The soup has just the right amount of spice and the broth is very tasty. However when it begins to cooks down and thicken the broth can get super salty and you have to dilute it with water. Included is rice and a variety of side dishes. What I especially love about Sura is the vast amount of side dishes you can try such as Korean potato salad, bean sprouts, sweet mung beans, kimchi, korean cucumber pickles, sea plant, and pickled radishes. Sometimes they bring out new side items which you'll notice if you been here a few times.

I also tried the Gam-Ja-Tang hotpot ($28.99 fall off the bone pork and potatoes in savoury soup) which was alright, something nice to try if you don't like spicy foods. There was plenty of fall off the bone pork and the soup had a mild, salty, pork taste. Bulgoi (korean BBQ) is around $13-$15 which is served with lettuce and other condiments. It comes out in a hotplate and as mentioned before is often tasty with the exception to one time when I came with a large group of friends and the meat was bland. 

Their Yuk-Gae-Jang ($11.99 spicy beef soup) was full of spicy beef flavor and I absolutely love their Soon-Tofu ($11.99 soft tofu and seafood soup) which has the perfect amount of spiciness and deep flavour. If only that was carried over to their JJam-Bbong ($11.99 spicy seafood noodle soup) which was quite mild and kind of watered down. There is however, plenty of noodles and seafood such as shrimp, squid, and mussels. 

It wasn't until my friend mentioned trying the 'black noodles' that Koreans ate in dramas that I decided to try JJa Jang Myun ($10.99 pork and seafood in black bean sauce over a bed of noodles). There was plenty of noodles to share among 2-3 people and it had a nice black bean flavour to it. In the end we were left with a layer of black sauce with small pieces of pork on the bottom of the bowl.

Overall, this is one of the best Korean restaurants in Calgary. The flavors in their food is fantastic (with the exception to a few items) and I highly recommend at least one visit. It's run by Koreans and many Koreans come here to eat here, so I guess they are doing something right. What I find really nice of them is that when you order a spicy dish they mention that it is spicy and ask if that is okay with you. This is nice for someone who doesn't like really spicy foods and who wants to adjust the taste of their dishes.

In those days Gilleys featured not only a mechanical bull but also bikini mud wrestling. Cold Beer and Dirty Girls was the mantra and it was a trip to remember.
 So my excitement was peaked when i found out that the place had relocated to the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.  However my excitement was short lived ( as was my peak) when i found out that the dirty girls wrestling in the mud had been replaced with senior citizens line dancing the night away. The term ""titty alert"" which had been used at many a mud wrestling events to describe a fighters wardrobe malfunction had turned into a ""old bitty alert"". To add insult to injury , the only person riding a bull was a thirty something year old male misfit from Brokeback Mountain. So with a broken spirit i had the hostess find the wife and I a table.  She was nice enough to sit us in a spot that overlooked the Vegas Strip, nice, but still not mud wrestling.  Gilleys specializes in BBQ and has always done a good job at it.  After reviewing the menu Simone and I started with Sweet Potato Fries served with molasses ketchup and a maple marshmallow dipping sauce. For some odd reason the marshmallow sauce was a light green ( i dare not ask why). It worked well with the crispy fries and probably would have worked just as well with a peanut butter sandwich.  The molasses ketchup was also good and Simone and I finished it all. For our Entrees Simone tried the house chili. It was average and light on the spice, and reminded me more of spaghetti sauce then it did chili.  I probably could have made some at my own house for a fraction of the cost and it would have been much better and i at least would have served it with some chips. For my own entree,  I choose the Classic Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was a huge portion of pulled pork piled high on a garlic toasted bun topped with creamy coleslaw. The pork was smoked perfectly and had great flavor and moistness.  However this did cause the bun below to quickly get soggy which was disappointing because the bun was very good before it turned to mush.  The fries that the sandwich was served with were some of the best i have had in a long time. They were super thin and super crispy and may have been the highlight of the plate.  Overall this version of Gilleys left me a little dissapointed. It still serves great BBQ ( and good fries) but the other offerings were lacking in flavor. I still prefer the Dirty Girls and Cold Beer days of old. I hope that some day the mudd will return and Gilleys will once again be a little more country and a little more dirty",2012-03-14 13:39:09

They were sold out of their prime rib sandwiches, but I was in the mood for something a bit lighter anyway.  I ordered the steak bite salad.  For $12, you get a serving of their signature steak bites on top of a generous serving of fresh spinach, tomatoes and shaved Parmesan.  They even topped it off with some sautéed onions for me.  The steak bites were really well marinated (perhaps something including soy sauce and worcestershire?  Just a guess... Whatever it is, it's tasty!). The bites were well seasoned, and went great with the dipping sauce served on the side.  The salad was plentiful and filling, and will serve me well as leftovers for dinner.

They've got a big menu sign now, and given that they had a busy sunny lunch hour, I don't blame them too much for being out of sandwiches at 1:30pm.   It's not quite as well-oiled as the restaurant they run (Holy Grill), but they'll get there!",2012-05-08 22:36:27

We cruised with Steak Tartare, ceviche & lamb meatballs but stopped after that because we just lost interest. We felt that the Tartare was overloaded w/Worcestershire sauce & the lamb meatballs were merely a way to use leftover chops. The ceviche was thinly sliced scallops & mystery meat that lacked any spices. Sashimi fills that profile but ceviche needs character, a country if you will.

For eighty cents each!! Yes!  I then made a mental note to come back.

The supplies and kitchenware are categorized in sections so you will be able to figure out where the bakeware, server ware, kitchen utensils, beverage items, containers, pans, etc are.  Most items are tagged with their prices.  I scored a pair of elbow length oven mitts, thick cloth type, nice quality for just $7.50.  What a steal! Also they recently added a Yelp Deal...20% off your total purchase.  So be sure to check in and take advantage of it.

We tried the West Indies Chicken Curry rice bowl and it was so aggressively salted, we sent it back after 2 bites and then selected the Jerk Chicken Pasta. Unfortunately, that was also crazy salty; I couldn't get another bite in, my tastebuds and mouth were completely ruined and shriveled up.

The flavor profile of each dish was also shockingly basic - It didn't offer up any of the Caribbean flavors or seasonings that were promised. The Jamaican jerked chicken was dried out and I didn't even taste much jerk seasoning - only salt. To be fair, the dinner entree portions were gigantic. One dish is perfect for 3 people to share. 

Also, the appetizers were average. We tried the chicken empanadas and they were extremely doughy with minimal filling. The only dish that was decent was the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, however, I have to explicitly state that Elephant Bar and Yard-House makes it better. 

The manager came to talk to us at the end and was very defensive about the salt usage in both dishes.

The price is pretty high however, the meal is big & even though it didn't look like much at the beginning, I was stuffed by the end of it. 

The brisket was pretty good. It was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too spicy, it gave the meat a great flavor. The chicken, honestly, I didn't like it. I ate a bite of it before adding the mustard sauce and it wasn't very good. I added the sauce and it was better but still meh.

I have been eating at Burger King almost my entire life!  I am really disappointed at many levels.

1.  The kitchen and food prep area was a filthy floor, food all over the floor and it as well as a serious safety hazard to the staff, and very unappealing to the customer as they stand at the order area at the front counter.

2.  When I approached Burger king at 9:10 pm it looked like it was closed because chairs were up on the tables.  This was 50 minutes before the dining in area was closed.  Yes, he ""Sam, asst. Manager"" had the excuse that she was cleaning, but the chairs never came down!

3.  I ordered my food and the chairs remained up on the table giving me a bad experience in the dining area because of the closeness of the tables.

4.  I went to get my drink and the ketchup dispenser was broke and no ketchup packs given to me, ""no sign stating that the dispenser was broke"" and when I got my food, I had to go back to the front counter and ask for ketchup because no ketchup packs where at the broken ketchup dispenser.  True inconvenience! 

5.  I asked to the asst manager to have the District manager ""Chad King"" to call me, and to this day no call. 2-6-18

sfhyBNm31zmO-qzKaQy_FA,l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,5YCjoLWCANbiNZrEknJXYA,5,19,2,5,"I've met so many doctors (arrogant, disinterested, prejudiced, fixated, preoccupied, rushed... choose all that apply) who made me avoid medical care that I must look back gratefully on that day when I chose Dr. Thai's name from my health insurance database because my husband needed to go to the doctor, and Dr. Thai was nearby. 

And even though Dr. Thai has since moved to Fort Apache - Yelp's entry needs updating - I'm still loyal.

So, why is Dr. Thai's office so right for me?

Nancy, who is usually in front when I come in, has a great smile and is always so friendly. Her conversation feels genuine, never artificial or forced, and she remembers everything I happen to mention to her. She treats me like a person, not another stack of paperwork to be processed.

The waiting area is pleasant - cozy, quiet, and not too clinical. I don't like those waiting rooms where you spend the entire time staring at an awareness poster for a horrible disease, not that there's usually much of a wait at Dr. Thai's, especially if you have an appointment.

Dr. Thai himself is very funny. I don't mean that he tells jokes, but he responds to my lightheartedness with more of the same, and he has plenty of personal examples on tap. I feel comfortable, like I'm being treated as an equal. Bedside manner is huge with me. The moment I feel underestimated is the moment I begin to question the doctor's abilities. A doctor doesn't have to be funny - terse is fine so long as the physician is respectful - but it doesn't hurt to have a doctor who makes me feel like we can talk about anything. 

I appreciate the way Dr. Thai listens to my input. If I say that XYZ is making me feel better, even though it's not logical, he takes that into consideration. Sometimes we don't agree (like when I thought that I was having a reaction to ibuprofen, but he suspected other factors), but we're alwaus able to take the time to discuss any issues and come up with a mutually satisfactory plan. I've never been hustled along, and I feel like I can ask all the questions I like.

But, for all of his interest in my opinions, Dr. Thai doesn't mince around when saying what he thinks. I really like that he doesn't just go for the easy cookie-cutter solution. Although he practices Westernized medicine, he still has an Eastern, holistic approach. 

He won't write an Rx unless it's the best solution, not just the easy solution. (But he won't hesitate to write a prescription I need, either.) When a surgeon was trying to talk my husband into gallbladder removal, Dr. Thai didn't openly disagree with his colleague, but he did describe why he personally wouldn't have the surgery. Surgery would've been the easier solution (at least for the surgeon), but Dr. Thai made sure we made an informed choice.

Dr. Thai's network seems pretty solid. I like his radiology/imaging lab of choice, and my husband really likes his referral ENT physician.

I've only met one other doctor in my life who I like and trust as much, and he's at one of those crowded strip mall clinics where I try not to go unless it's after hours and I feel like I need to cover my behind for missing work. 

Surely I must have just had unusually rotten luck with doctors before I met Dr. Thai, but that doesn't change the important fact that Dr. Thai meets my high standards and has blown away my low expectations.",2011-12-17 18:04:56

They have a $10 bottomless mimosa deal, and $5 Bloody Mary's. If you're hungover the next day and believe only halfly in the ""hair of the dog"" mentality, you can buy an individual mimosa for $5. There is never anyone there, so the wait staff is always super friendly, attentive, and makes sure we are full of mimosa!

Their brunch is pretty stinking good. Their chicken and waffles plate isn't Lolo's style, but it's still pretty tasty. Their eggs Benedict always hits the spot, and their $5 (maybe $6) biscuit and gravy ""side"" is actually a monstrous plate of 4 biscuits, and their biscuits are not bad at all.

I decided on the Kung Pow Shrimp and Joel ordered the Orange Chicken. First, came the egg flower soup. Totally lacked flavor. When our lunches came out we dug in cause we were extra hungry. The look on Joel's face. His Orange Chicken tasted like someone mixed the Orange Sauce with Sweet and Sour Sauce. It was red, gloppy and had an off texture. Bad soooo bad! My Kung Pow Shrimp was ok. It seemed to mostly contain celery and a few shrimp. Not as spicy as I expected either. We both got fried rice. Ick!! Off colored and totally void of any flavor. I was thinking ok, the egg roll could be good, maybe. I was wrong!!! Talk about gross. I really think it was rotten because it had such an off taste. I quickly spit it out.

We had a lot of sushi options.  I nearly passed out when I saw the specials board read ""YUZU YELLOWTAIL BELLY"" but alas, no belly in stock.  Instead, we got salmon belly so that is a fine swap.  There is a delicious yuzu sauce similar to Monta Chaya's drizzled on sushi like tai.  We got whole scallop that was slightly seared via blowtorch also.  Eric R. was happy because he could order half rolls of many kinds of rolls to try.  I got a salmon skin handroll which was delicious.  I did not see handrolls on the menu but Chef Sai happily obliged.  I got amaebi which did not come with heads initially but were happily given upon request.  We also got the cocaine which is a super spicy sauced sashimi salad.  The sauce has habanero oil and gave my nose a nice run hehehe.  Saba is house cured and very tasty. 

Chef Dragon gave us an assortment of the freshest of the day for us to try, including, sake, escolar, maguro, and hamachi.  I also got tako with lemon (asked for sesame oil but it may have been misheard).  I ended with the super rich dessert uni with quail egg.  The quality was quite good.

We had:

The mixed platter of cured meats - the meats were fantastic, however this dish did not come with crustini which I thought was a bad choice. We had to order the crustini al la carte -- a bit off putting. 

The shaved fennel salad with crispy artichoke -- this was ok. I couldn't really taste the fennel. I would skip this. 

The butter lettuce, avocado and goat cheese salad -- OMG YUM! This is a 5 star dish!

The oxtail - tender, braised meat stuffed in a small red pepper. This was small and tasty. 

The Brocolini - Another winner! This had a nice creamy sauce on the side. and I love Rapini (or ""brocolini"".. whatever)

The crispy potatoes - I only had one potato. My friends loved this dish. It came with a fried egg on top that the server mixed in at the table.


***BTW the salads were large enough for 4 of us to have good sized portions. I am mentioning this because the server recommended 3-4 dishes per person. In my opinion that would be entirely too much food!

First off, bonus points on the adorable name. I'm not much of a drinker, but coffee is my drink of choice. 

Breakfast is traditional American. 
For me, the mark of a great restaurant is how good the eggs benedict are. These were pretty great. The eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was rich and creamy and everything you expect from hollandaise. The potatoes were seasoned well and perfectly crispy and soft inside. 

We opted for patio seating because it was a beautiful day out in early October. Our server was a tall mustachioed Kings fan. He was attentive and even offered us a to-go cup for the road, which was considerate of him. Looking back now, I wish we had taken him up on that. The drive home took 2 hours longer than usual.

Three of us went for brunch on a Saturday. An email from them said you got a Bloody Mary and entree for $25. A poster in the lobby stated you got an entree and two bloody Mary's for $25 and our server informed us the deal was an entree and two cocktails (either a Bloody Mary or mimosa) for $28. Confused?  I sure was. 

I ordered a breakfast with chicken sausage that I couldn't eat because it was so heavily salted. Another at the table felt the same about the sausage as well, inedible for both of us. The eggs were scrambled perfectly so will give them that

There were two Bloody Mary options on the menu for the same price, but we were told the classic was the only one available with the special. Not sure why since both were same price.

He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.

We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!

The accessibility is a little tough. There is plenty of street parking around, but not much in the way of a lot close by. Hardly the fault of the proprietors, but something to keep in mind when planning to dine here. 

Upon arrival we were seated rather quickly, but given the business of the restaurant, it did take awhile to get service, be it drinks or placing the order or time until the order was delivered. That said, the wait staff really worked as a team to service the tables. Normally if I wasn't aware who ""my"" server was I would be irritated but as each server there took time to check on our needs, we're gracious with requests and treated us like we were there table, I was fine with it. They also acknowledged that things were slow and took all opportunities to apologize and keep us happy. Again, since there was no rush I had no real issue with this. 

The menu was an interesting mix of seasonal choices (according to the waiter a selection of patron favorites that are pretty much always on menu) and then a chalkboard selection of items based on available fresh ingredients. For our meal as is our custom, we got an appetizer to share and then 2 entrees which we also shared. No, I don't think that's weird at all... Stop judging. We got the charcuterie, which was absolutely tremendous. Then we got the Waygu Meatloaf with Goat Cheese and Chive Mash and Potato Gnocchi. I'm not generally a fan of Meatloaf, but this was probably in my top 10 of all time dishes I have eaten. Everything about it was amazing. The meatloaf was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Salty, yes, but for this dish it completely works. The mashed potatoes where amazing. Creamy enough, but still enough substance to stick to the fork. The goat cheese and chives added the perfect flavor infusion to balance the beef and its saltiness. The gastrique I could have eaten with a spoon. The gnocchi, well, they were just ok (which contributes to 4 instead of 5 stars, along with the speed of service). I tend to prefer mine more tender and starchy, these were finished in a pan and had more camalization than I tend to like. Probably a matter of preference. The crispy pecorino added a little crunch to the bite, but not enough for a much needed change of texture or a sharp flavor to balance all the muted ones (potato, cauliflower, peas etc). This dish was not a win for me. It wasn't bad, just didn't match up with the rest of the meal.

The desert menu looked great, and they had a salted caramel popcorn ice cream that we were dying to try, especially since we had both loved a salted caramel popcorn panna cotta we had a dinner lab a few months ago.

According to them, this restaurant has authentic Taiwanese fare.I thought their beef noodle soup and tonkatsu (Japanese porc) were both fantastic. I loved that the owner suggested we share different items on the menu. 

The best part was that he mentioned they could cook family-styled Taiwanese meals that were off the menu if we were a group of 7 or more and if we gave them a 48 hr notice. We made a reservation two days ago and today, we were surprised with a series of authentic home-cooked dishes with extremely fresh ingredients. The dishes weren't too salty and the ingredients were maybe 70% vegetarian, so it was very healthy overall.  In addition, the owner wrote down the dishes we had today such that if we were to return in a month, he would make sure we would try a whole set of different dishes. How amazing is that? 

At the end, we ordered the specially made UFO cakes. You should definitely try the custard ones, they are best when freshly baked! The taro and red bean ones are good too. If they happen to have a freshly baked batch of pineapple cake, make sure to get one or two of those as well. 

The restaurant is a bit out of the way and lacks  in ambiance, but this mom and pop shop is a nice little discovery where you are sure to try out really authentic Taiwanese fare for a reasonable price. It might not be the place for a fancy date, but for a bunch of foodie friends who just want to try something new, or a Chinese family who just wants healthy home cooked food, I think this place is worth trying out.",2017-11-11 23:44:06

Inside you will find plenty of seating in your typical Italian dinner spot (Excluding violent backroom interrogations and the occasional horse head.)

When the waiter went over the menu I have to say he was not speak Italian simply because I am always in search of a truly Italian experience. That being said, he attempted so I give him a solid ""A"" for sforzo.

I chose some mushroom dish as an appetizer but lets be honest..I ordered a giant mushroom. It was really good though, no complaints on the giant mushroom. (When you are at an Italian restaurant, one must always ask themselves, What would Mario do.) 

The dinner for me was Calamari in pasta. It was delicious. It if weren't for my body rejecting it during a soccer game later that evening I have to say I may even be raving about it even more. And yes..Mario would have played soccer for all those nay sayers out there.

Pretty quiet as we came on a Sunday night, but the staff were very friendly. A cool setup with a unique bar side and lots of different televisions set up.

It may have been where we were specifically seated, but it was hard to carry a conversation between us. 

I ended up getting Chicken Tenders, and it was quite good. Nice and saucy, which great fries and coleslaw on the side! Came with 5 pieces as well, which is a plus as most place only give you 3 or 4. 

Service was quite good, but they had limited staff on a Sunday night. Our server was also the hostess, so we didn't get much attention to our table. Was okay though as we would just wave her over.

It was a slow night for them, there were only a few tables when we arrived around 7pm. We were greeted and sat  immediately, hostess was very friendly and sweet. Love the decoration of the restaurant, very modern, chic, variety of decor around the wall, very cool place to sit and have some drinks. Our server was great, very friendly, made drinks and food recommendations, came back to check up on us several time, service was on point, drinks were always re-filled, no problem with service at all. 

Now the food...they have a few interesting items, our server told us that we ordered all their signature items which are also their most popular ones. We were informed that their menu is meant to be family style so we shared everything:

Marinated Tuna Cones -  average item, very bland, not much flavors, not worth the price. 

Modern Fried Egg was very interesting to try, very small portion for $12 per egg; warm egg yolk on the bottom, corn pudding, then caviar on top served with brioche. This was the most interesting item on the menu, was not sure what I was eating at first, overall tasty but not completely satisfying. 

Braised Oxtail Crostini - the most flavorful appetizer, topped with onions, slices of radish, the sauce as very flavorful, good item to try.

Foie Gras Mousse - light foie gras flavor, topped with some kind of sweet jelly like ""sauce,"" served with slices of pear and crostini. The mouse was very smooth and creamy, not too fatty in flavors to where you get sick of it. We did ask for more crostini since the jar of mouse was pretty big for just 3 slices of crostini. 

Salt Roasted Beets - similar to other beets salad - delicious but not much different from beet salads from other places. 

Sausage board - 3 different types of sausage served with pickled peppers and sauerkraut, nothing special here either. 

Lastly we ordered their special for the night, which was Wagu steak with stroganoff sauce on top served with shitaki mushroom. This dish was delicious, the meat was tender and flavorful, cooked perfectly! 

Overall, I enjoyed the dinner but was not crazy impressed. For the price of some of the items, the food should be more impressive. I have had tastier and more interesting food at the same price point, none of items stood out to me and make me go ""WOW.""

Like all the start-up competitors to grace the east valley, they lure you in with outrageously low prices.  You get used to not looking at your bill and they all of a sudden raise the price, tack on a surcharge for tea or what not and you only notice it when you either give them your credit card or when you get home.

Crossing my fingers that this is not the case.  Or just enjoy the chaaayp ride when you can I suppose.  I wouldn't say that this is the BEST dim sum I've ever had but it's not the worse either.  Everything seems to be up to par except the chicken feet and cheng-fun (don't know the english equivalent, sorry).  I guess I prefer my chicken feet and cheng-fun to be on the softer side.  Perhaps they could steam the chicken feet and or cheng-fun for a few more minutes to eliminate the ""rubbery-ness""(?)

We took some friends from Canada here because they told us that they pay upwards of $4.50/dish in Calgary, Alberta.  That's gotta suck.  That's more than we pay for a gallon of gas (knock on wood)

I don't remember much from the previous visit - something about great chicken wings - but I was very pleased with my most recent! I was looking at the menu outside when I was invited inside by waitstaff. The waiter told me that the waitstaff had agreed to serve me without charge as the restaurant was empty and they wanted business. I said such an offer was unnecessary as wait staff (in Canada) should not be deprived from their tip. I appreciated their intention and felt welcomed so I decided to eat dinner there. 

The furnishings were spartan, but clean, and the waitstaff were incredibly welcoming. We ordered Osaka Omelette, Lobster Sashimi & Soup, Unagi-Ju (an bbq unagi don), Black Cod in Daikon Broth, Tako Wasa, Mushroom salad, and two beers. 

The Osaka Omelette was filled with BBQ pork belly. It was a thin egg shell, topped with the usual seaweed, bonito(? I can't remember and I can't see the picture while writing this), and Japanese mayo as well as a sweet, but tart brown sauce. The rich mayo balanced by the tart sauce and the flavour and texture of pork belly was a great partnership, but what else do you expect from a Japanese omelette! 

The black cod and Unagi-Ju were my favorites. The black cod had been boiled long enough that the bones were soft and edible. The daikon simmered with the black cod was SO GOOD! The Unagi-Ju is exactly what you would expect, though the portion was quite large and is best for sharing. It was very rich and the eel they used was a good balance of fat and meat. The sauce was a bit salty for the amount of rice that lay beneath, but it was well seasoned otherwise. 

The lobster was prepared as sashimi using its tail and simmered in miso soup using the remainder. The lobster sashimi had good texture and crunch, very unique to lobster sashimi in my experience, though I was disappointed as it was not as sweet as when I had it at the now defunct Tako Sushi formerly on Don Mills. Tako had their lobsters fresh from the tank, which may explain it. I think the size of the lobster was right for sweetness, but it just wasn't there. The overall flavor was also weaker. I did have this before the stronger flavored dishes.

The Tako Wasa came free as part of their instagram promotion. Hope you can benefit!  The mushroom salad was essentially a salad with sauteed beech, enoki, and (oyster? Again, I don't have the picture open) mushrooms on top. Much appreciated vegetables to balance the meal. 

Thanks Izakaya Ju. See you later!",2017-11-24 16:29:57

Over the years, I've been here many times.  It's deep fried, spicy, cauliflower goodness. So amazing, whenever we go we end up getting two plates. In terms of the main dishes - the dosa is okay, the crab curry is great, the briyani is so good, gravy, raita (yogurt), and a hard boiled egg is provided. The egg parotta/roti is also good! The curries overall - from the vegetarian and meat dishes I've sampled have been good. Their ""North Indian"" dishes are decent enough.  Mango shake the last time I tried as pretty good. 

Cons: In terms of service , it's not superb. that being said, I've had some good wait staff. and  sometimes you get someone who forgets to refill water but it's okay. It's not hard to flag down attention or walk up to the counter (do whatever you got to do).

You know when you have a favorite place and hate to try a new place this is exactly what happen the other night!!

Going in we check in and there was a 10% off with Yelp check in which was nice, As soon as we were seated I showed the guy who was going to be our waiter,

His name was Jay and he was very helpful. We told him we had never been there before and did not know what to order,
He asked what we liked and we explained we were fans of Yama Sushi and he told us he had been there before so he was aware of what we explained we liked and that we did want lot of rice to whatever we ordered.
,
It was really nice you can order 1/2 orders on the rolls. Were not big on the rolls especially if there is a lot of rice. We do not want to pay for AUCE and have tons of rice that is not why we like Sushi. I want to taste the flavors and enjoy what I am eating.
Jay did a great job picking out some items. One of my all time favorites they make here Japanese Lasagna and he brought out 1/2 roll. That was really good here. I was not crazy about the dynamite with all the corn in it. This was completely different than what I have had before,

Over all service was very good, food was really good and well worth stopping in.

This is not a bad spot by no means, because people walking in and out did not cause a stir. Some places, the door table is a dreaded spot, but I hardly noticed anyone until the staff greeted them.

The food is ok. Fresh warm bread with an olive tapanade is served right away. We started with the calamari appetizer ($11). The squid was tender and fried to a light brown. It would be perfect if it possessed some flavor. Neither the batter nor sauce tasted like much. No lemon to spruce it up either. My friend ordered the Veal Florentine ($24) and it was lackluster. For this price, it was rather skimpy. The sauteed spinach with garlic was fantastic. I got the Shrimp Fra Diavolo ($22) and was not knocked off my feet.

It is part of the Darden family of restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Long Horn Steakhouse) but this is neither Italian, seafood or steak.  Sure, they have pasta, fish and beef but that is not what they're about. 

Bahama Breeze is about the feel of the Caribbean.  The place looks like a beach resort that one may find in, say, the Bahamas. There are palm trees, torches, fruity cocktails and an overall laid back atmosphere.  The menu is substantial and has something for just about anybody.  It is a restaurant/menu I have been enjoying for over 10 years.  

I started coming here with my office for a holiday party.  Then we came back for a retirement party.  And again for a going away party.  Maybe even two.  I've come in with family a couple of times now also.  Each time I stop in I try somthing different.  Coconut shrimp (amazing and unfortunately not an option for me any more), chicken skewers and rice (not on the menu any more), West Indies curry rice bowl, jerk chicken pasta, buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  I've tried the black bean soup.  I've tried a salad.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here.

I've had some of the drinks too.  A sample of the coconut mojito which was good but very sweet.  A taste of the watermelon jalepeno margarita.  A zombie (which I seem to remember liking very much).  I did have an off pint of Guiness once.  Not sure what happened to that keg but it wasn't good.  However, I've also had a Newcastle here and it was spot on.  

Service has always been consistent and pleasent.  Even coming in on Mother's Day with a 7:00 PM reservation went off without a hitch.

- rooms were large, clean, and comfortable. Loved the couch by the window. 
- friendly and helpful front desk and housekeeping staff
- great location

I finally made it out for a mini ""Squirrel Hill Day"" (aka ""Diabetes Day"" - a trip that consisted of Rita's, Waffallonia, and bubble tea) and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles. Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype! Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside, as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft, warm interior. I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream - both of which slowly melted into the crevices (and into my heart!) Seeing as this was the first time I'd ever had Biscoff spread, I was INSTANTLY HOOKED. To this day, I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff.

We went to eat here with a groupon. Our tab came out to under $10 with two entrees and a drink. The entrees were the shrimp pasta and the bang bang shrimp. The shrimp pasta was the only thing we could get down. It could have used a lot more flavor. It wasn't bad.  I'd stay away from the bang bang shrimp. It came with rice and a very salty sauce which we could not stomach. 

Definitely try this place if you want a party bar to go to. The bar tenders are very friendly and entertaining.  Flair bar.

Friendly, if not speedy service.  I appreciate that I am immediately served poppadoms, mint chutney and tamarind sauce.  The mint chutney has an atypical consistency, but is tastey and has a nice kick to it.  The tamarind sauce is (I think) the same served at every other Indian restaurant. Poppadoms are complimentary.

I came by last week and ordered the Tandoor Fish.  Based on the description, I thought I would be getting well-seasoned pieces of fish with just a little char.  The now-closed Aasna, Melange of India restaurant in Milpitas, CA had a GREAT Tandoori fish.

There was barely any spice color (or char) on the fish.  It was perfectly cooked, but it was pretty bland.  I would not recommend it except for folks that do not tolerate spice well.

On my second trip, I tried the Fish Tikka Masala.  Great sauce makes the perfectly-cooked fish taste great.

It is easy to see why Alyssa is an award winning chef as her menu items were both innovative and delicious. So if you want some great recipes and some wonderful tasting food the night of, you are going to enjoy yourself.

Now as for the class itself:
The Good:
Alyssa and Andrew are top notch and super friendly! Alyssa gave great instruction from the steps to make the food to why she chose certain ingredients. It really helped not only understand the process but how to potentially use some of the same ingredients in other recipes.

Alyssa is very patient and if you need to go back over a step, she is right there to help. She and Andrew also take care of the little things such as making sure the ingredients are portioned out for each table, food is put in and out of the oven at the correct times and they take care of the cleaning too.

While Alyssa is demonstrating the recipe, Andrew is filming it and putting it on a projector screen so everyone can see it easily.

The recipes she came up with (and put in the cookbook you get to take home) were delicious and creative.

The bad:
I had signed up for one of the more advanced classes because I like to learn by doing but can already cook. While it was nice to have some steps taken out for time's sake, I like to measure stuff, I like to look in the oven and observe the color and consistency to know when to take it out. I'm sure if I had been assertive and asked, they would have allowed me to, but it was not built in as part of the class.

You are working in teams of 2-4. If you are a stickler for quality control like myself, this can affect things.
Because we divided up steps, I didn't get to put in all the work on all the recipes which would have been nice. I also had to trust my food to other cooks. As a result, my sliders were overcooked and very dry and the sweet potato buns were poorly formed and thus very crumbly.
Don't get me wrong, I loved my team and it was great working with them but you may have to be prepared to adjust your expectations.
But hey, that is what this is all about right? Learning. I only mention it because I went in with the expectations that I would be doing 100% of the recipes and work.

I think if you chose to take one of Alyssa's classes, you will have few regrets. It's a good time, a terrific learning environment and outstanding food.

*I'd add half a star if I could. The only variable that keeps it from being an outright 5-star is that someone else can potentially ruin part of your meal.",2014-08-18 04:17:18

It's has your regular selection of white fish, chicken, beef broccoli, sweet and sour pork I imagine (didn't try since I usually don't eat something that can't decide to be either sweet or sour), fried shrimp, etc. The soups were ok. It's basically buffet@asia at a smaller scale. There was a salad bar, sushi, desserts, etc. I did not try everything and decided not to eat sushi except for sushi restaurants so I don't know how it is. It looked okay and some guy across from me filled his plate to the brim of the next guy over. Maybe a tad greedy there.

Overall it's ok. No one would eat with me at a Chinese buffet including my Chinese friends so I Han Soloed it. Overall, it's cheaper and better than fast food for about the same price really.

Now, for the food! I think the best deal would be the family platter. You can try 4 meats and get 4 cornbread muffins, and either 2 large or 4 small sides for $36+ tax. If you get brisket or pastrami its and extra $2. We tried the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, mac and cheese, baked beans, potato salad, and waffle fries. The ribs are where it's at!!! They are hands down the best ribs I have ever had. Super tender! If you only get 1 thing this should be it! The hot links were good as well. Not overly spicy but just enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor.  The pulled pork and brisket were a little salty for me but still tasty. I think the go to brisket will always be Little Miss's fatty brisket though. Trapp Haus' brisket is more lean. The baked beans were smokey with just a hint of spice. The mac and cheese were also nice and smokey and very cheesy. The potato salad was good- mustard was the main flavor, so if you're not a fan then I'd skip this.  Lastly, the cornbread is to die for! It's super sweet but has a slight spice from the jalapeños. They are perfect and I want to eat one everyday for the rest of my life.

Sakana surpasses every AYCE sushi place in Vegas in taste, fish:rice ratio, freshness, food options, alcohol prices, service and atmosphere. I lived in Japan for 16 years- I know my sushi. (Obviously it's not Japanese style sushi, but if you don't compare it to that- it's really, really good)
1. Drive up to the Target complex on Maryland- the restaurant is on the Eastern side of Target, almost behind it. 
2. Appreciate the atmosphere. One wall looks straight off of a rustic country living DIY Pinterest board, another a Studio Ghibli and animation shrine, another a fancy teppanyaki restaurant and finally a bathroom all about Hello Kitty and everything kawaii. 
3. Start with the Baked Green Mussel appetizer. These mussels were FAT. The red sauce has a slight kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy. I could eat an entire meal of these. 
4. Fill up with nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is perfect here. The rice itself isn't necessarily smaller, but instead the slices of fish are bigger. Fresh, fresh, fresh. There's no fishy smell or the overly dyed fish you might get at other restaurant. They offered a few lake fish (non-Ocean) as nigiri, which I had not previously tried before. Interesting, but good.

Seriously, my friends from Waterloo have seen videos of the historic Asian fight/faceplate that took place here. (Oh, btw, I don't know anyone who calls this place ""Xe Lua"". It's Pho Train.)

My review might be a bit skewed, seeing as how 90% of the time I eat here it is after consuming a substantial amount of alcohol. But in my experience, the pho here never disappoints at 3am on a Friday/Saturday night, when all the post-clubbing Asians (and some non-Asians who've caught on) gather for the age-old hangover cure. The avocado smoothie is also pretty dece, as are a few of their other drinks (the 3-colour-drink with jelly, red bean, and coconut milk is really good). The curry chicken I once sampled from here was also quite tasty.

Katsu-Don $7.98
~ It's a bowl of rice topped w/ deep-fried pork cutlet, egg and fill with a yummy onion sauce/broth. 
~ This is my favorite katsu-don in Toronto and the kind of comfort food, perfect when served piping hot in the winter.
~ Love how the rice are immerse in the sauce, there's more of everything then rice.... It's such a heart-warming dish. 

Cold Soba $5.98
~ I always see people order this, so I decided to finally try it but really there's nothing special about this... def something you can easily made at home.

 We also usually drop by Sakanaya, the mini fish market next door to grab a sashimi platter.
And a hint, they discount these platter by 50% or more at the end of the day ;)

It was delicious, but we made the wrong decision of ordering too many spicy plates... all at once. For a family that doesn't eat spices very often, this was a very bad (but very good and tasty) choice. 

We ordered the famous spicy chicken bamboo, Sichuan dan dan noodles, stir fried green beans, 'husband and wife lung slices' (fuqi feipian). The tripe/beef shank came first ('husband and wife lung slices'), drowned in crimson red chili oil. My family, for the most part, were not great fans of it as they found it overly oily. It was still okay though!

The dan dan noodles came next, and they were not what I was expecting at all! It was my first time trying them, and I thought that there'd be a more prominent sesame/peanut flavour. But there was none of that! Overall, like the other dish, it was decent.

The spicy chicken bamboo, however, really stole the show! It had so much 'wok air' - and so, was quite 'hot air' (if you're Chinese, you'll understand what I mean haha). I couldn't help it though, and kept eating more and more and more. The peanuts were fried so deliciously, and the chicken was crispy and fragrant. Absolutely loved it, even though my mouth was dying from the spices!

Service was friendly.  The menu wasn't overwhelming and had good descriptions and pictures of the offerings.  Overall, the server was attentive and friendly throughout the evening.

Now for the not-so-good... Please don't get me started on the salsa.  It's just... no.  Let's talk about things canned tomatoes are OK to be in:  Spaghetti sauce.  Cans.  Velveeta queso.  Things that canned tomatoes should not be in:  Oreos.  Iced tea.  Salsa.  

The green corn tamale made me sad inside.  The masa was gritty and dry.  Maybe that's why it was smothered in some bizarre grey/green gravy.  The masa-to-filling ratio was also not great with very thick masa and the tiniest of smears of filling.  The flavor of the outside of the tamale - at least the one small part that wasn't smothered in weird grey/green gravy - was actually not bad (delicately sweet), but it definitely was not worth the near $6 ala carte price.

1. The place was busy, but we were seated immediately and the food was served incomprehensibly fast.  At the same time, we did not feel rushed.  A restaurant really has to strike at a fine line to achieve that kind of balance.

3.  The entrees were HUGE for costing under $10.  Beyond that, though, they didn't just taste like fat and salt...they had actual flavors.  Flavors of, you know, the ingredients in them.  So delicious.  I loved my fajita quesadilla.  Loved.

4. There was a huge, framed picture of Jorge Negrete by our table.  This is mostly an inside joke....or an outside joke if you're in Madison and know the band Brown Derby (the lead singer looks JUST LIKE HIM...it's like he was reincarnated as a gringo version of him).

I try to get my hair cut at least monthly and I don't mind paying money to a small local business when I can walk there from home and they'll give me a coffee and talk to me even though I'm wearing jeans I bought at Sears.

They don't have the same vibe and space that Grateful Head have - in fact they're a bit bland in terms of space and ambiance - with a boombox playing music FM radio type music... invest in a bit of wire and some speakers and use someone's iPod so I don't have to hear other people's chit chat, please. That said, everyone here is friendly, prices reasonable and they seem to do a good job. If I really need to sit in a gallery, I can walk a few doors up and sit in a gallery.

Hiko is the only person to cut my hair here and I've got no complaints. The first cut he was kind of getting a sense of what I wanted.  I didn't ask for anything in particular to see what he'd do, and my hair hadn't been cut in a couple of months. I went back after a couple of weeks, was clearer about what I wanted and got things cleaned up and a great cut for a considerable discount (that I didn't ask for) given I'd just been there. My wife got him to cut style and colour her hair and she's happy with the results.

One thing, and this is petty, but I have a kid that does everything with me and it's a pain to pick a Saturday morning or whatever for haircuts and have to get him to one place and me to another. I don't want to sound like one of 'those' parents and I don't care too much about my kid's haircut, but I don't mind sinking an extra $10-$15 in a kid's cut over barber shop or mall cuts if it means saving an hour or two of running around and not having to drive somewhere. I understand why... it's money... kid's cuts don't pay as much and if your shop is good and you're booking steady, I guess you don't need to take kids...  but I've gone elsewhere because of this, so you're losing some of my money on those days. Just sayin'... consider taking in kids of regular customers. You don't have to wash their hair, give them coffee or chat them up.

My hair looks and feels so much better and again she didn't cut off too much, cuz I'm still growing it out (trying to see how long I can get it to grow before I go insane), but she she cut off enough to make it look nice and healthy again.  She's easy to talk to and genuine... conversation doesnt seem forced for fakey, which can be awkward sometimes.  Cute personality and knows what she's doing.  She recently got a promotion and I'm happy for her, she seems to really like it at the Ulta Salon.

Certain rooms have different types of difficulties, and a set amount of min. - max. Number of people also with different themes. 

The staff are very friendly and energetic as well as helpful.

It was the 2 of us that went that day, it was our first time and we booked the only one that allowed 2 people. We had 45mins to solve it and was put into the dark the whole time. There's a short video you watch in the beginning which explains why you are in the room, what the story of the room is and how much time you have to escape. Hints were available to us when we needed. We manage to solve the puzzle in time to escape.
It was a very fun experience where you have to work with your friends in the room while exercising you brain to solve puzzles meanwhile the time is ticking out.

Smokin' Crawfish is not unlike your other seafood-boil-in-a-bag places such as Hot n Juicy or The Boiling Crab.  In fact, some of the flavors are just as good or possibly better than their rivals and at reasonable prices (about a $1 less than the latter two for a lb. of shrimp).

When we arrived one night, we were the only customers there.  It's kind of weird and unexpected but at other crawfish places you might have to wait to be seated.  The positive to this is no waiting and food in front of you as quickly as you can order!

The downside is the missing amazing aroma in the air as you walk into a busy crawfish spot.  I swear, with just one whiff of that garlicky, lemon peppery, amazing fragrance in the air and you'll have me salivating more puddles than Pavlov's dog.  That sets the tone for the rest of the night and something I like when I go to a crawfish spot.  Won't be the case here when you're the only diners at the time.

The two pounds of shrimp we ordered were nice-sized shrimp and there were plenty of shrimp in the bag.  As a tip for new customers who have never ate at these types of joints, ask for plastic gloves if you don't want to get your hands dirty because you'll be peeling the shrimp and your hands will smell like the Smokin' Crawfish sauce the next day.

I also enjoyed their own take on fried rice made with shrimp and crawfish!  It was yummy.

The service was fine but hard to rate because we were the only ones there.  As this place gets popular, we'll have to see if their staff could keep up.  I believe there was only one or maybe a second server there at that time.

To end on a cool note, they have the Lobster claw machine game here.  If you manage to catch a lobster, they will cook it for you for free!   Maybe this one instance I'll forget what my parents preached to me a long time ago while I play with my food for just a little bit.",2015-11-22 17:42:57

My first venture into Korean food in Champaign was good. We decided to stop for a quick lunch and ended up at the first restaurant that opened at 11 AM on a weekday. It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college. Overall slightly above average, I will have to find another korean restaurant to compare too.

Pro: average price korean food, large portion

Cons: long cook time, higher price than average lunch places

Your meal comes with rice, soup, and 2 korean ban chae",2014-08-15 12:53:21

I think the salon itself is adequate -- stylish but not overly-pretentious decor, a super convenient location, and a very indulgent and current selection of guilty pleasure US Weekly, OK and Vanity Fair magazines.  It's obviously very girlie-oriented and I always feel like I am treating myself when I'm there.

Boyd, however, is way more than adequate!  He is one of the only people who I will trust with my fingernails -- best manicures I have ever had!  I have natural nails and I am so protective of letting ""just anyone"" have their way with my delicate nail beds.  Boyd is a pro and is just as OCD about nails and polish as I am.  The polish selection at Carolyne's has got to be best-in-class:  all the technicians share, and I swear you can name an OPI seasonal shade from 4 years ago and someone will know exactly what you're talking about and locate it for you!

To boot, I genuinely enjoy spending time with Boyd -- just fun and a pleasure.  Sometimes I will also pop in for a pampering pedicure, and I highly suggest the new chocolate-scented scrub/mask/lotion products.  Mmmmm....

The reason is that in the years following my original review the Eastern at Warm Springs Albertson's has taken a turn for the better at the same time that the Las Vegas supermarket landscape has drastically diminished. Since this review I have witnessed a few Albertson's close, Food 4 Less abandon Las Vegas, Von's closures, all Fresh & Easy stores close, among other changes. In this review I am going to do something that I never did before. I am going to use examples from my original review to show how a business took a turn for the better and what kept me a customer.

Quote from my 2013 review :

 ""I have little love for this Albertson's. The prices are so astronomically high that they make Von's prices seem like Walmart.""

My December 2017 updated review:

 Wow things have changed! Since 2013 Albertson's and Von's parent company have merged. There are positive ramifications of the merger. When Albertson's has a special buy the prices rock. The best thing is that a card is unnecessary. Unfortunately, many of the items are high priced and if I wasn't facing a Yelp character limit, I'd list a few. Anyways, another positive of the merger is the new store brand items. Their Italian Wedding soup, sparkling flavored water, & kettle chips are a few examples.

Quote from my 2013 review.

 ""This Albertson's could use a remodel. Eastern Avenue at Warm Springs isn't Gangland central. It is unwelcoming to walk into a store with a rotating gate structure.""

My December 2017 updated review: 

""In recent times, a remodel spruced up the store. Gone was the unwelcoming rotating gate structure and up were interesting pictures of historic Las Vegas.

Quote from my 2013 review:

 ""I have little love for this Albertson's at the exact time I have love for convenience. In my situation it is in the center of a one stop errand hot spot.""

My December 2017 updated review:

 It is this convenience plus an appreciation for the updated house brand that brought me back over the years. The main convenience is the Moneygram Electronic payment. Unfortunately, Smith's has unpredictable customer service hours which on a few occasions has led me to Albertson's where their customer service hours are reliable. This is a positive reflection on Albertson's customer service. Through the past few years  convenience has taken a turn for the better. In addition to the existing US Post Office and pharmacy there is a DMV Kiosk and Amazon lockers. Convenience is also fully stocked shelves. On these fully stocked shelves are some uncommon food in Las Vegas supermarkets. Presently this includes Nathan's crinkley cut fries, Baskin Robbins ice cream, and Wise potato chips. For a while they even carried Friendly's ice cream. Changing my tune from the cumulative experience preceding the 2013 review, I am concluding the December 2017 review update by saying, ""I have an appreciation of this Albertson's at the same time I have an appreciation of the convenience, updated store brand items, fully stocked shelves that include uncommon items in Las Vegas supermarkets.""",2017-12-10 00:24:04

My BFs grandma grew up in Indonesia and that cuisine isn't really available anywhere, but Malaysia shares many similarities so we thought to bring her here. She ended up not coming, but the BF,my MIL and I went. I kinda know a bit about Malay food, but they have a picture menu binder they give people as well as a regular text menu which was helpful. 

We ordered: 

BBQ Pork fried rice - it had really nice flavor, the bbq pork was sweet and succulent and the rice was really soft and fluffy, not greasy at all. My only critique about this is that it had large slices of red onion which would have been okay well cooked, but it was a bit raw.

Rendang Ayam- I'm a big fan of the bold thick rendang and this one was definitely hitting the mark in flavor. This is a bone- in, skin on chicken so it was more flavorful with that, but it makes it a bit messy to eat. The portion was about half a chicken so they give you a sizable amount. I will be ordering this again, but with a red meat as I think that holds rendang flavors well. 

Captains Noodles - we got it w/o shrimp for the MIL but it was still good. These are saucy noodles, swimming in a sweet soy based sauce which was good but maybe a bit sweet for me. 

One thing I oddly have to rave about is their rice. Their fried rice and plain white rice was so soft and fluffy and well seasoned. It's harder to achieve than you would think to hit that mark, but I love it when I could find it. I only keep brown rice at home now, so it's a rare treat to find good white rice when eating out. 

This is a halal place and so the meats reflect that. The chicken will be more ""chicken-y"" as this isn't your big farm mass produced usual chicken. 

We ordered grandma food to-go. Chicken satay was rather small, but decent enough. It is really sweet though so we did a bit like ""thai style"" and dip a little vinegar onto them to balance it out. She wanted kari ayam curry but with fried tofu and they accommodated it for us. It was alright, rather tangy of a curry. I wasn't a fan and neither was she though, but it might just not be in our taste. 

Service was decent here. Our drinks were refilled before they got were empty.

tZnM5_vfY2kRgho5oEgeKQ,FgQCX3ztjhellw2hyRedxg,I37npEJQHTaodl8pnxp2uQ,2,5,2,3,"This review is strictly regarding a FREE Oil change which I had for purchasing a new car a few months ago. With that being said here is my review of today's service:

We had an appointment for an oil change at 11:00. I called and had to let them know we would be late and would not be there until 11:30 or 11:45. I was told that isn't a problem at all, the oil change area was slow so when we get there it shouldn't be a problem but they would let them know.

We arrived at 11:40 and pulled into the service department. My husband and I than got out and proceeded to stand there waiting for a service adviser to come over to us and check us in. We noticed that most of the advisers were typing on their computer, on the phone, or just missing in action as I say ;)

We wait almost 7 minutes before the guy in the 1st booth said ""someone will be with you shortly."" He then proceeded to walk out the other booth door and walk away. :(

Finally Christopher comes over after we waited about 13 minutes and asked what he could do for us. We explained oil change, appointment, etc... He than says it will be 1 to 1 1/2 hours and that the cafe was open and we could go in the lounge. Off we went to the cafe to grab a bite to eat. 

The review of the cafe should be another review all in itself. Let me just say talk about unprofessional people working behind the register talking about how the process server just came to serve her divorce papers is not what customers need to listen to. We won't even go into the fact that many people waited in line for the arguing to end in the back kitchen area. 

BTW Christopher came in while we were eating looked right at us as he waited to be served. He knew we were sitting there.

Finally 1 hour and 20 minutes later I suggest maybe we need to walk outside into the waiting area outside to see if there is an update on my car's oil change. We are standing there where another customer is also waiting amazed how no one seems to be helping anyone here. Than after standing out there for about 6 minutes Christopher pops his head out of his little booth and proceeds to say ""I called for you your car has been ready for about 25 minutes now."" REALLY? Are you kidding me? Wow great customer service and coming and letting us know personally, maybe because my OIL CHANGE was FREE I didn't require any customer service?!

So off to the cashiers office we head. After waiting about 3 minutes in there (no one but 1 cashier in the place) she sticks her head up and says ""are you here to pick up?"" DUH!  My husband who is so much better than me says yes and gives her our last name. Of course she hands us a $0.00 Bill and calls on the microphone for our car to be brought up front.

As we stand there for AN ADDITIONAL 8 MINUTES waiting for someone to bring me the car, a women next to me says ""the service here is horrible and her sister's car was being worked on and she too wasn't notified that her car was ready."" We stood there talking about how UN-BUSY Berge Ford service department was but yet nothing got done quickly.

I am sorry folks but I believe f Mr. Berge was standing there, things would have been MUCH DIFFERENT! Maybe I am wrong, maybe this is how they handle customers, but I don't think I will be back for any oil changes, even if they are FREE!

My rating earlier this summer was a solid 4. I am lowering it to a 3.

1. This morning half of the slides were closed.  The staff, including guest relations kept quoting different times that they would open.  Finally, a supervisor told me that 7 of the life guards (mostly high school/college kids) called in sick at the last minute.  It took them about 90 minutes to get replacements and open all the slides.  

I understand what happened but they lacked a plan for communicating this issue to the paying customers. Signs at the entrance would have helped.   Prepping the staff for how to answer guest questions also would have helped.  I think most people would be understanding.

The interior of several of their pools have greatly deteriorated over the summer.

They also seem to have a lot less inner tubes than earlier in the summer.  Many of them left are losing air.  That doesn't leave enough tubes for us to use.  Nobody want to wait 10-15 minutes for a tube.

Today alone, I saw 7 children get pummeled by rafters in the wave pool.  It is disappointing to see adults not even check to see if the kids they just hit are ok.  I suggest rafts and boogie boards get their own timeslot and not be allowed with swimmers.

Team Big Surf - you can do better than this!  After 45 years we expect more!",2014-08-02 18:44:21

Highlights of the night:
* Stir Fried Lobster with Noodle Fish & Garlic 
- This was one of my favourites! The lobster absorbed so much flavour. It was stacked up like jenga for the display. Cool display but we found it tough getting the lobster pieces.

* Japanese red snapper sashimi platter
- Loved the red snapper sashimi, sooo fresh! We would order more of this dish if we didn't order that many lol

* Steamed green bass
- I loved this fish. It was very freshly cooked. Juicy and soft in texture. 
The sauce needs improvement and more sauce would've made it taste better.

* King Crab boiled with sake 
- Very yummy. The display was also picture-worthy. The sake flavour wasn't that strong, I actually couldn't taste it in the king crab.

""Premium"" dessert of the day:
It was grass jelly and watermelons LOLL.. I was like, what premium....?!
I liked the dessert nonetheless... It wasn't exactly what I thought as what a ""premium dessert"" is though lol",2016-07-21 14:18:53

I hadn't donated blood since high school and had been meaning to for a while anyway. 

I made my appointment online and was able to get a fast pass barcode by filling out all necessary paperwork in advance. I thought I would be a shoe-in since none of the red flags came up in my questionnaire (no homosexual contact, no sleeping around, no transfusions, no drugs or needles, no traveling internationally other than locally, not sick, and no major health issues). I walked in and was promptly greeted by the receptionist. I signed in and noticed a lounge area where I parked my kids and several recliners with personal televisions. There was a separate lounge area as well with cookies, juice, and water. 

I was called to the back room by a very friendly woman who has been doing this for 8 years. She was cordial and professional and asked me some basic questions and took my blood pressure. Unbeknownst to me, my blood pressure was quite high and I did not pass the initial assessment because of it. Despite this, I was able to make a follow up appointment instead for next Sunday (despite what Yelp says, the Charleston office is actually open on Sundays). I was also still given the free giveaways of 2 for 1 pass to Adventuredome as well as a free 1 topping large pizza from Papa Murphys. My kids were offered cookies and juice by the very friendly receptionist and we left afterwards. 

All in all, I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness, staff, and professional nature of the place. I strongly recommend it to all.",2015-08-23 23:14:02

Toqued by Rob Moore, whose brief departure to open JG Steakhouse at Aria has seen it too grow into a place held in good regard,  it was at a two-top big enough for four that my friend and I were seated, the Bellagio water show visible through large windows to the right while the draped dining room decorated in fine art soon filled to capacity at our left.

Served by a team of at least six, Sommelier John Burke entertaining us with stories from Steve Wynn's reign as well as those of bottles sold in excess of $60K, it was in a four course meal that two-hours was spent talking, the ingredient sourcing, portions, and preparations all justifying prices that may turn many diners away.

Far more classical than Carnevino or Ramsay and certainly more elegant than Delmonico or CUT, the evening began with bubbles alongside a basket of bread and making quick work of salty pretzel batons as well as a nutty raisin loaf it would not be long before a starter of seared foie gras was presented, the acidic sauce of rhubarb perhaps the most interesting steakhouse pairing seen to this moment while shaved almonds worked wonders to meld flavors of fruit to the unctuous liver of duck.

Told that soups and salads at PRIME are far more fanciful that the typical broth or wedge, round two consisted of heirloom tomatoes dressed in milky burrata atop vinegar splashed arugula plus a truly inspired bowl of French Onion, the blend of cheeses lightly toasted atop a crispy brioche float while the potage beneath was beefy enough to be noticed, though the bulk of the flavor came from the caramelized namesake ingredient itself.

No doubt a place with more than just beef to offer, though the options for steaks are plentiful without going overboard on information about sourcing from several different farms, it was in the 18oz Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye cooked medium rare that $71 was invested, the quality of the product allowed to show for itself while the menu's cheapest protein shined even more brightly, the pounded half-chicken fried textbook crisp beneath a Parmesan crust as sides and sauces each proved every bit as compelling, the Soy Rice Wine and Comte Potatoes each well deserving of their server-suggested clout.

Unable to resist desserts, the menu's only service error occurring when Jean-Georges' signature molten cake was served in place of the souffle selection of the trio, suffice it to say that as good as each item was there is no doubt that those with an eye for the dramatic will be wowed by cinnamon bread pudding, the tableside saucing seeing a dome of cocoa melted into the custard soaked base as notes sweet, spiced, and salty all dance on the palate.

Trending a bit more pricey than other Steakhouses on the Strip, and somewhat limited by offering only two breeds of beef with fish and seafood not really venturing too far outside the box, PRIME is undoubtedly a place worth visiting for those looking for a 'fine dining steakhouse,' particularly those averse to loud music or looking for a more romantic night out.",2015-09-04 04:47:19

There salsa was creamier and came out of two plastic tubes.

I can't explain why, but I do know that these are just some of the things I am hypnotically attracted to. Kinda like the blue alien from the planet Baab (Escape From Planet Earth).

So after a recent Yelp Helps event followed by a group dinner at Ramen Sora, I was ready for some sweets to end the day. But it was past regular business hour at SnowFlake, so I was really drawn to the bright lights through those large windows emanating from what I soon discovered to be a new dessert spot in Chinatown.  But I was too late. the business has closed for the day, and the cashier lady was already counting the register and getting ready to leave.

So 2 days passed and another Yelp Helps event, this time benefitting the Ronald McDonald House charity, plus an amazeball CMYE in Downtown Las Vegas.  And I finally made it to this new Vietnamese dessert spot while it is still opened. The interior is very clean, brightly lit and has some comfy looking couch seating near the back. Their menu is pretty extensive.  Offering Vietnamese desserts, blended coffee, milk tea, smoothies and cold and hot beverages.

Tonight I was most interested in checking out their Vietnamese desserts (Chè). After a brief glance at their menu I settled for the trusty #1 Bambu Special, which is made with young coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seed and coconut water.  I really enjoyed the longan and slurping the basil seeds and pandan jelly, but I thought the crushed ice diluted the coconut water too much.  I barely tasted it.  What I did like is the fact that they use good ingredients and fresh when available.  

What I like:
* Use of quality ingredients.
* In Chinatown next to Hot 'n Juicy (the location closest to Decatur).
* Clean!!! Or at least the appearance of being clean.
* You can customize the desserts adding or removing ingredients to suit your taste or craving.

What I didn't like:
* Too much crushed ice diluted the flavor of the dessert drink I ordered.
* Parking lot is tiny and usually full.  Must be all the massage customers.
Street parking on the side street is usually occupied, so you can find parking but will have to do more walking.

I will definitely comeback to check out other menu items, but for now I am only going to rate them worthy of 3 stars.",2013-12-12 08:04:18

Having taken everyone from family to wealthy out-of-town guests to Hash House A Go-Go for their oversized plates of ""Twisted Farm Food"" it was early morning on Thanksgiving Day that three guests entered the Henderson location, the fifth such Restaurant and second located outside of a Casino every bit as good as the rest but without the wait that often frustrates those stuck in line at The Linq for over an hour.

Founded in 2000 and since expanding from San Diego to several cities from Coast-to-Coast, Sin City actually boasting the most by a wide margin, Hash House A Go-Go suggests that its cuisine is similar to that which one might find in the Midwest by way of states like Indiana and having spent more than thirty years as a Buckeye those claims certainly seem to be valid as everything from Sage Fried Chicken to pounded Pork and Meatloaf Sandwiches are rib-sticking hearty and served in portions large enough for two.

Spacious in design with a central bar area serving Beer and Cocktails while the Detroit Lions kicked-off another Turkey Day loss, the décor best described as Barnyard-chic with an antique tractor out front and everything from Stalks of Wheat to tattooed farmers lining the walls, it was shortly after checking in with the hostess that guests were led to a sizable four-top on the left half of the restaurant, a server soon dropping off menus with a big smile before filling water and describing the daily specials.

Not a place known for subtlety, the festive mood stoked by holiday music overhead with patrons all talking loudly as large parties continued to file in as the morning went on, it was perhaps twenty minutes after placing an order that plates arrived to completely crowd the table, share plates and bowls both delivered beforehand and everyone ready to dig in after a Pumpkin Pancake was topped with 100% Maple Syrup brought from home, the hubcap-diameter disc nearly an inch thick but cooked through with bold Cinnamon notes and quite a bit of pureed Pumpkin folded into the Batter.

Tacking on sides of Crispy Potatoes and a Buttermilk Biscuit served with Housemade Strawberry Jam, the former decent but a bit overpriced at $4.95 in the setting of a menu also offering several pounds of Fried Chicken and Waffles for just fifteen dollars, it also seems as though the Biscuit recipe has become slightly more dry since visiting The Plaza in 2015, though perhaps this has something to do with Yardbird's arrival on the scene with a vastly superior product that is actually priced slightly lower at $7 for four while Hash House a Go Go charges $1.99 each.

Continuing the Thanksgiving feast with two additional holiday specials, HHaGG's signature Snickers Bread Pudding replaced with an equally decadent version made with Pumpkin Bread but similarly decorated with Ice Cream, Whipped Cream and two types of Sauce, it was not without Turkey that the meal would take place, the decision to eschew both a half-pound Turkey Burger and plate featuring sliced Breast plus all the fixins' leaving plenty of room to work on an inverted top-hat made of Cracker-thin Biscuit Dough filled with roasted White and Dark Meat plus shaved Sweet Corn, Mushrooms, Broccoli, Carrots, Red Potatoes and Pan Gravy anchored to the bowl by a generous helping of hand-mashed Potatoes.

***:  Certainly not a gourmet restaurant, and arguably the sort of place Americans should be rallying against in the setting of an obesity epidemic, Hash House a Go-Go nonetheless provides a good meal at a fair price with service that is better than most while taking several steps that they could get away with not doing in terms of making many of their sauces, jams and gravies from scratch.",2017-11-25 15:31:22

I have been hearing about the Fuku Burger food truck for quite some time now. I am not one as to be so inclined as to chase a food truck around town for a burger. If I did ever do it though, this would be the burger.

I was over at the Linq and I heard they opened a Fuku Burger inside Fame. It is over in the right corner of Fame. I stopped in and grabbed a few burgers to-go so I could try these famous burgers I have been hearing about. I will say, I was not disappointed at all.

I ordered the Kinko Burger, Kari Burger, and the Lucky Burger. I don't know which burger was which, but they were all very good. The one with the mushrooms was kinda sweet. I think it had teriyaki sauce on it. Which ever one was spicy was my favorite. They are not really big, so I could eat two with no problem.

This cafe is actually pretty good and worth visiting. It is very nicely designed, cute decor, everything's pink and white. I love the chairs here. They are absolutely adorable. They have bunny ears on them. 

As for food. I didn't try the pasta or savoury foods but they looked pretty good and seed pretty reasonable priced. Under $15 a plate. 

I got a strawberry waffle ($12.99), the waffle was delicious. They were hot and fresh and tasted like hk eggie waffle batter. The whipped cream was really creamy with a little sweetness. The strawberries were a little sour but the ice cream made everything complement each other well. One thing that could've been better was if the strawberry ice cream on top was a little creamer. But other than that, I really liked it. 

I also got the lychee rose sparkling soda, $7.50. A little pricey but this one was also pretty good, there was strong lychee flavour with a hint of rose which gave it that rosy lychee flavour. But didn't make the flowery scent too overpowering. 

Last thing we got was the hazelnut milk tea. I also really liked this one. It came in a pot where you can pour 2-3 cups out of it. It was a pretty big portion for the price. The pot was only $5.50. The tea flavour not too strong. You can taste tea but more of the hazelnut. Sweetness level was nicely paired. 

As for service, the service was great. The staff were friendly and attentive. They came around to fill water a couple of times. Desserts came out decently fast.

Their rooftop bar is wonderful in good weather. Great experience.
The soups, service and bread is much better. 
I actually love their soup and have had a few dishes that I would return for. I have a feeling the dish I once had is now removed, but I may be incorrect. The grilled cheese is fantastic. Apparently Cleveland does grilled cheese well (Melt, Touch.)
Their drink specials are usually reliable so check those out too.

The down-side: 
Their butter for the table bread has pork in it!
I'm vegetarian (as is my husband) and we don't even want them to waste that on our plates. Let the customer know about this so they can reject this spread before it hits the table and gets wasted. Nothing is worse than being a vegetarian and feeling you've wasted an animal product.

I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks.

It's the closest location to us and located next to the Sam's club which makes it very convenient. It could be a one stop shop, but occasionally they run out of items I need.

Produce can be good and bad. Sometimes I cannot find fresh jalapenos, Italian parsley, cilantro, garlic and tomatoes, I just end up going to another market that has it all the time.

I've been shopping here for over 12yrs and haven't had any bad service or experiences that I can think of, unless you count the alleged homeless families in the parking lot around the holidays. I've been scammed once and never again.

I like that they have the self checkout lines that don't seem to be too long, and they go pretty quick. I can use my ecobags there without feeling like its a chore for the cashiers. I'm one of those people that has been using my own bags for years, because I've been in cities where plastic is banned, and who needs to bring all that plastic home? 

I don't care for the part where they brought in a security guard that checks receipts at the exit. Used to be if you had an electronic item the door greeter would check it (btw where are the greeters?) , and then I thought it was because I brought my own bags, but I'm not really sure, because lately they don't check receipts, either that or its the guy who used to do it is not there.

~Excellent location when visiting Las Vegas
~Modern rooms with beautiful views.
~People who have $$$ 

I seriously thought I had already written this, but clearly I did not do it here... I think it was their survey which means I wrote a lot of stuff I have to re-write now!

We rented a week at Elara from an owner.  Its a time share.  I have wanted to stay here for some time.  I own across the street at Marriott's Grand Chateau and I've heard really nice things about Elara and was ready to see for myself when we spent a week in Vegas for New Year.  We arrived on Saturday along with a million of our closest friends and it was a ZOO.  The valet parking was FULL and the directions of where to park sent me to a parking area that was also full so I was getting super frustrated and a little hysterical.  I'd already dropped my husband off with most of the luggage but was just going a little nuts because all we needed to do was get everything put in the room and we were leaving so a kind valet/bell employee let me leave my car at the curb for 15 minutes.  I appreciated that, but I think they could have found a better way to handle this and they should have enough parking!

The Elara is very beautiful and elegant.  Its connected to the Miracle Mile shops that are connected to the Planet Hollywood and its just south of the center of the strip, so the location is FANTASTIC.  Its probably the best thing about the place.

The rooms are just like what you see in the photos.  They are very beautiful and modern.  Our room was modern, nicely decorated and clean.  The windows are covered with shades that go up and down electronically with switches and the living room shade is hooked up to a projector so you have giant TV.  I was looking forward to surprising my husband with this because he is really into tvs and movies and all that, but we were disappointed that you can't really watch movies on the giant screen, only tv.  You can't hook up a bluray player, in fact there are no players in the rooms and we didn't bring one because i had already read a review about how it can't be done so I'd called ahead.  We were able to hook up Apple tv to the tv, but it would not work with the projector. I know, First World Problems, right?

I paid a little more than our friends so we would have the master bedroom/bathroom with the giant bathtub and the view in there was awesome.  The bedroom has the screens that go up and turn the walls into windows.  Its really cool.  It would be nice if the screens worked independently of each other, but they don't except when they get quirky on you.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was huge and had nice amenities.

In the kitchen, there were every kind of appliance you need and what I liked was the refrigerator had water and ice in the door so that was nice. We had a large dining room table, perfect for playing games.

We also used the spa at the pool one day, too.  As it was winter, they didn't have everything opened, like the bars, but we enjoyed the spa and were able to use the upper level owners spa area which was nice.

Overall, with the exception of not truly getting to enjoy the giant screen tv, it was a nice place to stay.  I'm pretty cheap, so it was likely a one time splurge, but I'm glad we did it and we had a great time.  But, I'm very happy with my home away from home across the street at Marriott's Grand Chateau.

I did reach out to the Hilton Vacations folks about having a vacation ownership meeting when we returned in March and gave them my contact info, but they never contacted me so I guess they weren't interested in selling to me.",2018-03-22 00:25:34

The place is pretty loud especially during peak times (Friday and Saturday nights) but it has a fun and funky vibe. If you plan to go during peak times, be prepared to wait. However, the plus sides are that they text you when your table is ready and there are a number shops and bars to stop in while you wait.

In my recent visits, the waitstaff has been SUPER friendly and accommodating. You automatically start off with a small-ish bowl of corn salsa and chips. Personally, I recommend getting one of their signature margaritas. I usually stick with the skinny margarita. As for the tacos, I'm a fan of the BBQ mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans.

The fries tasted like very manufactured frozen fries and the sandwich was overwhelming. The bun turned soggy fast so maybe a drier slaw or toastier bun will help. The crispy chicken skin easily detached from the meat...that's a first for me (not a good thing). I know from before their steak salad is amazing so I probably will only order that from now on.
The appetizers are lacklustre as well. They simply don't taste good. I ordered the tuna poke with fried nori chips and indo flatbread. Both of them didn't have unified composed flavours. The tuna poke was hard to eat and I would've appreciated the tomatoes and avocados to be more mixed together. They had them in layers in a super tiny jar which made it difficult to get a taste of everything. The indo flatbread was weird..a little spice, some dried pork floss and cheese, which did not sit well.

Definitely just come here for happy hour half priced apps and drinks because they are really not worth the full price!",2017-04-04 02:11:18

Being opening weekend, each person received a commemorative coin and coupon for a free item. I got a free popcorn, and friends got a free soda.
Since that night, it has become an annual tradition to go to the latest Star Wars movie here every December. Tonight I even saw the owner of Harkins Theaters, Dan Harkins, in the lobby. Apparently it is his favorite location to watch a movie.
I like the feel and look of the lobby and outdoor patio. The recliner seating is great and the screens nice and large. However, I don't usually justify the extra ticket price for the reclining chairs and go to the Harkins at Tempe Marketplace a couple miles away.",2018-01-04 10:30:42

We had a regular room on the 17th floor.  This hotel is great!  We got there really early, about 1030am and the staff allowed us to check in early.  The room was clean and nice.  Great view of the pool.  Plenty of tables to gamble, especially craps.  The pool scene was fantastic!!!!!!  Lots of hot chicks, ratios were nice.  Plus the servers were really hot.  The misters definitely helped since its was 100+ outside.  Plus the whole tropical theme was really cool, especially the flamingo habitat, it reminded me of Cancun.  Another great feature was that Caesar's was across the street, so when your ready to hit Pure (definitely worth the wait), its a pretty short walk.  Plus, Bill's is next door, which is a great place to gamble since the table limits are $5.

It was near our hotel and gave it a shot.  We arrived at 10am for Sunday brunch and were fortunate that the wait was modest (10min).  When we left, the line was out the door.

First, the dining space is very cool.  It is clean, airy, and has a loft like feel.  They really did a good job in optimizing a slightly narrow and long space.  My wife ordered the Brunch Sante and very much enjoyed it.  I got the De L'Atlantique (basically salmon three ways).  Overall, mine was pretty good although I didn't care for the salmon in the sweet potato cake.  Also, I did not think the fruit and salad were fresh.  Finally, in a city with awesome croissants, the one I had from here was easily the worst I've had.  It was stale and uninspired.

Despite some misses with the food, I definitely would come back and would recommend it to others.

First, it's hidden, so showing up here you feel as if you're slipping behind the looking glass or being invited into a secret members only club (you don't have to wear the jacket). 

Second, it's smoke-free!

Third, the furniture is beautiful. Sadly, all of the fashionable couches and tables were reserved on a Friday night, but I am sure on a weeknight, you can have your pick. Surrounding the furniture is a hip library.

Fourth, the music is fun. Although, I was convinced they were playing Men In Black, only to realize in noisy environments it's hard to distinguish the original tune form Will's rendition. Phew. That was a close call. 

Fifth, the cocktails are good, but as has been noted, expensive. $14 for a specialty cocktail, which is the same price as many Strip establishments. But, they were handing at Stella Artois like candy (free) for some promotion, including a Facebook check-in. (I want hold not having a Yelp check-in offer against them...)

After being seated for over 20 minutes and not one waiter coming by to take our tea order, my mom had to chase on down near the back of the restaurant.

The tea was too strong but most of the food was good. The haw gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), spare ribs with black bean sauce, jook (rice porridge), nor mi gai (ti leaf wrapped rice with chicken), and taro crisps were all good. The disappoints came from the sweet sesame balls and don tot (egg custard tarts) which we had to chase down a waiter again to procure.

I loved it so much, I had my daughter's baptism party here 2 years ago. After being slightly disappointed in the food then, I continued to come back thinking it was the large party that may have influenced the quality of the food that day.

My most recent visit on Feb 16th was less than stellar. After being seated, I went to choose the wine, and several bins were completely empty. Nothing I was intending to drink, but it still had a negative affect on my perception of their selection. Then, while  pondering over the cabs, a creepy type of guy who was sitting at the bar decided to give me a lessons on vineyards. I kindly asked if he was the manager and he said ""no.""  I told him i had the kid at the table, so I didn't have time to really chat. I grabbed the closest wine which was more than i intended to spend, just to cut the conversation short. 
I ordered fish and my husband ordered some type of pasta dish. The fish was rolled into some sausage type shape and was not good. I make better fish at home. It was bland. the side dish was decent but not nearly enough. My husband said his dish was ok. The wine ended up being very good, but after using my ""free"" dinner coupon I thought it was still overpriced for what we received. Our waiter left with the coupon and another server came back to tell us they were trying to figure it out. Then our original waiter came back a good 10 minutes later. Considering it took the 2 of them to work on it, I felt uncomfortable even using it. I have another but won't be coming back to use it. I may come back for wine and appetizers again since the view is nice, but I don't think i'll be back for dinner.  It's too bad, I used to really love this place.

Their most expensive item on the menu that night was a Age Steak (I believe it was 40 day aged). After our friend ordered it, I tried a bit, and it was absolutely incredible!!! According to him, it was money well paid for. 

Another dish was their roasted chicken, which the menu claims to be the best chicken in Cleveland. Once again, it was up to our standard. Although it was mostly white mean, but this is the most flavorful white meat I've ever tried! The meat was cooked just right..unlike most of the restaurants where white meat turns into dry chicken jerky half of the time.

My bf ordered the pig's head. You may not believe me but the dish was literally half of a pig's head! OMG...well don't order it if you think you'll be scared looking at it. But it was such an incredible dish!!! Cooked to perfection and a decent amount of fatty meat. If you like fatty meat, this is the one to get. For normal people, it's pretty much enough to feed two. 

I ordered the chicken fried lamb steak (I believe that was the name). It was also very amazing. Cheaper than all the other dish listed above, but I believe it was definitely worth the money I paid for. This is one of their newest item on the menu. but it didn't disappoint me. It came with a side salad which was pretty refreshing with the lamb. Since it's the first time I've ever had Friend lamb..it was great.

Our waiter was also very helpful that night. Although the menu had a lot of words that you many not understand, he was willing to explain to you what each item was.

First visit-  Got there about 2pm on Saturday afternoon.  I have never seen a line of more than 5-7 people here at Teds.  We walked in and there was a line about 30 people deep.  I don't know if everyone was getting their hot dog fix since they were closed on Easter or what,  but it was busy!  Waited in line and placed my order for a Footlong, Polish, White Hot and a Corn Dog. (This trip, I was going to eat every hot dog they had....veggie and kids hot dogs don't count ;-) lol)  Washed it down with a loganberry shake.  My wife got some fries.  

Second visit-  Got there around 10:30am and there were only 2 people in front of us.  Today I placed my order for a Bratwurst, Italian, All Beef and Regular Dog.  My wife got a hamburger and some onion rings.  Washed it down with another loganberry shake.

To add to my previous review, in my opinion, this is the order of greatness of Teds dogs/sausages.

1. Italian- My favorite.  Spiced right and always delicious. A must order every time!
2. Bratwurst- Close runner up to the Italian.  A must order every time!
3. Polish- Another great sausage. 
4. Regular Dog- The classic.
5. All Beef Dog- Huge and beefy.
6. White Hot- Wont get it again probably.  Not enough flavor.
7. Corn Dog- Foster Farms regular corn dog.  Fried proper but plain.  I can make one like that myself at home.
8. Foot Long- Tastes different than the other dogs.  Bun was stale, have not liked it the 2 times I ordered it.  Wont ever get it again.

The broth (which is the foundation of pho) tasted like it was reconstituted from a packet of powder.  In classic move of restaurant cost-effectiveness, the bowls were heaped with noodles but skimped on meat and hardly paid homage to a vegetable.  While a bowl of pho the whole world over is served with a heaping plate of bean sprouts, limes, thai basil, and perhaps an assortment of other greens, here at Bowl of Pho, they parceled-out one measly dish of sprouts for us to share between two bowls.   

But maybe the food wouldn't have been so disappointing had it not been for the atmosphere here.  We found the server to be inappropriate and sassy towards us for no apparent reason.  The winning moments were many.  At one point he took the tea cup I was drinking and poured it's contents *back* into the shared teapot on the table because he believed it ""hadn't seeped long enough."" Next he gave us a hard time for requesting bean sprouts asking, ""Are you really going to eat them?""

There's the original (tastes of cumin), the espresso (tastes of cold coffee), and the spicy (not a bbq sauce so much as a hot sauce).

The sides were mostly great. Loved the loaded sweet potato and the bacon wrapped corn.

The weakest main was unfortunately the most expensive one: the short rib. It was oversalted and dried out.

We had a wonderful time at Georges.  It's too pricey to be an everyday excursion, but I highly recommend it for special occasions.  We will return as soon as we get an excuse to splurge.",2011-02-28 14:32:02

Everything tasted fresh.  The spices and chutneys were very flavorful, with the right hit of tang and spice.  The service is stellar.  And the price is amazing for both quality and quantity!

My friend had been raving about this for the past few visits I have made to Canada. So, going into it I really wanted to like this place,  she ate (not in this location mind you) at the KGH many times before and had nothing but fantastic stories to tell about it.  We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon for their 8.95 all you can eat lunch. Right off the bat we were thrown a curve ball when we were informed if 1 person wants something, it would apply to everyone in terms of billing.  IE, my buddy wanted to add veggies, for 3 dollars, but the server said that it would apply to everyone. I can see where they don't want you to share meals,  but when someone definitely will not be using something they shouldn't be charged for it.  

The marinated Pork, Chicken and Beef were excellent, The Fish and Squid were not really worth our time.  We learned quickly that the first few items we cooked tasted excellent, then after that all we tasted was the carbon char of the grill. My friend pointed out that normally at the other location she eats at there are guys constantly scraping down the cooking surface for you in order to keep your grilling experience top notch.  After about 30 minutes, we were still hungry, but the plate was mostly black. We had to flag down one of the servers and ask them to change out the platter so we could continue. On top of not being able to flag down a server initially, they became very scarce all of a sudden. The initial person who took our orders, wasn't the one that got our drinks, and the one that got our drinks wasn't the one who changed our meat dishes, and the one that changed the meat dishes wasn't the one who took our order for milkshakes, (which btw took 15 minutes to get). It was all very confusing, almost like they didn't have any order and this was just chaos. (I mean, who gets the tip if 7 people did things for us?)

Towards the end of the meal even my friend said that she was not too thrilled about this place. The food was good, the service was subpar,  I would have liked to have what my friend wanted to give me. I don't know if it was because it was lunch time or not,  but giving people the ability to keep their grills cleaner or having someone do it for you would have made this a much tastier trip.

Alas, I waited for the busiest nights to test the newest seafood joint. (A band was playing outside.) I was surprised then when our party was greeted like part of their extended Italian family.

""Hmm. Better return for my *own* experience."" Turns out Cuttlefish offers a familial experience to everyone. (Smooches, hugs by Vincinza and Gino!) I later asked my friends how many times they had visited to warrant such fanfare. (Once.) I returned the next day for some more love. The food was that unbelievable.

Then I learned about their killer HH. (2pm-8pm!) Details at the end. Dangerous information.

FOOD
So the food. Hoh. My. Goodness. If I could cook it would be like this. But since I can't (shh) I would eat here all the time. After careful deliberation (too many mouth watering choices) I devoured the sea scallops. They're served on a delightful bed of risotto. The scallops were gingerly cooked to perfection, topped with bacon and a jam of sorts. My Instagram title for the photo is ""Orgasmic"". Yep. Paired with a simple salad of mixed greens (which was generously sized) I was stuffed. 

....and yet....Our table shared a dessert called Cassata. Sweet goat cheese was whipped into a surprising treat. I say ""our table"" but really that means I ate most of it :) Gino, who waited on us like a cousin, suggested an excellent bottle of Italian pinot noir by Candoni.

DESIGN
The exterior of the restaurant offers wonderful, refined table dining. The interior of the restaurant is designed with Italy in mind. The oyster bar is surrounded with Vespas. Yes, Vespas! Cutest thing ever. (Seriously, have a peek at my photos.) The main dining area offers plenty of seating options. Four top tables with chairs sprinkle the center area. Booths line the walls. The booths are for 1-2 adults. The bar area also offers high top seating. This is a place to impress!

CUTTLEFISH?
Oh, you have to try it. Calamari lovers will rejoice. This is better! I needed some schooling so I asked my waiter Matt for the 411. A Cephalopod is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda. (Props to Matt for being able to spell that for me.) These buggers are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head and a set of tentacles. Sometimes cuttlefish are called inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. Boom.

Cuttlefish, the restaurant, flies their speciality in *all* the way from Sicily. They weigh, on average, 23 lbs.

MUY IMPORTANT
HH is 2-8pm! (Woooot!) $3 off the bar menu. $3 off glasses of wine. $3 off specialty drinks. Bottles of wine are 30% off.

This is a new staple in my eating rotation. Come and be merry here!

I have been trying to be a supportive customer to this place multiple times and I've been disappointed with every visit. I've brought three of my cars in and gotten the Deluxe, and made sure that I told them the entire car needs to be vacuumed, including the trunk. They say okay, no problem, and ring me up my $17.99. I wait like 45 minutes (sometimes even longer) in the lobby. When they're finally done, they wave their towel and give me the keys. And each time I come in, to my dismay, there are greasy oil splotches on my car, white dust spots all over the wheel and dust that hasn't been wiped down. I'm fine because I can wipe those small things down, but I am TIRED of not getting what I specifically asked for: the trunk has to be opened and vacuumed inside! My cars still look like a piece of crap inside but now with extra frap that I have to wipe down from their sloppy job! I called in angrily and explained my situation, and he said that they will only vacuum the trunk if you asked for it. And I DID ask for it, THREE TIMES.

He just told the employee to bring my cars back and they'll redo it, which I said No, because every time I did bring it back they did NOTHING. He then offered a refund but I know, as a business owner myself, that his offers were pathetic excuses and I have had enough especially when the manager wasn't willing to speak with me himself. I told him I was done and I'm never coming back, and I did offer him a valuable piece of advice that the company should aspire to do: be detailed in your work, quality over quantity.

Reservation is recommended and  you need to do this via email and I believe it's the only way. I am ok with it since I have to use email everyday anyway. If you have any allergy or food restriction, just let them know also. The service are very friendly in my opinion.

We reserved seating at the Sushi Bar (6 seats) and I also recommend Sushi Bar seatings as well if you are planning to eat sushi - you also get to see the chef make your sushi in front of you. Based on my understanding, there are 3 timeslots for Sushi bar seating: 5:30, 7:30, and 9:30 with 2 hours each. So if this is your first time trying this restaurant like me, get the Sushi bar for the best experience and you also get to chat with the chef at the same time and ask him questions directly about the food!

We ordered the Omakase menu for $45, and I think it's what you should go for because you don't need to think about what to order. I didn't keep count, I think I get about about 6 pieces of sushi, one handroll, a sashimi dish (2 pieces), and an appetitzer. The fish are very fresh and tasty(yummy), and looks like using real wasabi. At least for the sashimi, I see the chef grated something that looks like wasabi root. As for the Sushi, not sure what wasabi is used but each sushi piece are tasty. The most memorable item for me is the handroll, the nori seaweed used is very crunchy and with very strong seaweed aroma/tastes, very like the one I tried in Zen or Shoushin. :) You gotta eat this immediately (I didn't even bother taking any pic for this handroll because I want it as crunchy as possible). And when you lightly (very lightly) dipped the end of the handroll into their homemade soy sauce before taking each byte, it's very yummy! My friend and I cannot resist and ordered another one at the end... lol!

I don't think think the Omakase portion would fill my tummy so I also ordered two more appetizers to share with my wife: Taro root with Wagyu tallow, and Maitake Salada. Both are good, For the Taro one, I really loved the sauce and the tallow, it's a really good combination and goes very well with the Taro. As for the Maitake Salada, the mushroom are organic and it is roasted so it has a very strong mushroom flavor. I find this dish is abit on the salty side but it is still very good! If I go again next time, I probably will get the Taro again - cheaper and yummier. :)

And we also tried the Wagyu beef sushi, this I would have to say it's the weakest item I have tried. It's not bad overall but for $10/piece, I would use that budget to repeat the handroll a third time (it's just me.. lol). :)

Overall, the experience is a pleasant one, good sushi, friendly service. But too bad it's  located in downtown, it is quite a long travel for me... But if I am in the area again, I will go back for sure ! Thank you chef for the yummy dinner!",2017-12-22 03:24:54

They also got barbecue pits and benches to accommodate parties.  With shaded areas do the sun isn't melting you or your cake away.

It was a hot day on a Saturday and after trying Swirl, this place was close and we all wanted to get some frozen yogurt. So when we arrived, it was pretty much close to be around 7PM so it wasn't busy at all. This is located literally behind Crocker Park so it's convenient to walk to it from the mall. 

The place is pretty cute inside with contemporary furniture. The sign would've been nice if they had added a spoon but instead it just says ""Spoon Me"". It doesn't sound appropriate for the younger audience if you know what I mean. But anyhow, there were about maybe 5 flavors to choose from so the selection isn't all that great. They had Natural Cream, Acai, Peanut Butter, Lime, and Pina Colada. I tried both of their natural cream and acai flavors and I liked the natural cream better, but I didn't end up getting anything. The prices were a bit high for a small $4.10!. The baby was I believe $3 something. They don't have much toppings either. No mango! 

My sister did end up getting their peanut butter and acai flavors with some blueberries. The peanut butter didn't taste bad either but the fact that they didn't really have much a selection and it's not self-serve disappointed me. They do however have a food menu with salads and wraps, as well as smoothies. I was hungry that day and they ran out of wraps! What kind of business runs out of wraps?

I don't know but the flavor, sauce and texture of the sandwiches are just so GOOD. The sandwiches are huge too! It's probably going to cost you a little more than sandwiches from Subway, PotBelly, Capriotti's, etc.

There's a whole lot of different sandwiches you can order (even vegetarian and gluten free) written on the chalkboard but make sure you get the Dutch Crunch bread.

The food was good, although not the best or most authentic Indian food I've ever had.  He didn't ask how spicy I wanted it and when it arrived it could've used a little more flavor or spice.

Although this place is hidden in between business centers and is a little confusing to find at first - their customer service and food makes everything worthwhile. 

When I first walked in, it was a quiet cafe (reminded me of Starbucks for a moment). As soon as I looked at the menu, Oliver came and introduced himself and is quiet the charmer I must say!

Very observant and easy going, he was eager to introduce me to the menu and what they were making that day. Although I only ordered their croissants and their black iced tea I was impressed with the enthusiam and how fresh their food was. 

The croissants were crispy and warm on the inside. I had their chocolate croissant and their cranberry with vanilla croissant. The chocolate croissant was not too strong and very filling. Their cranberry with vanilla croissant was sweet but had a sour kick to it. 

If you need a pick me up and want to go to an atmosphere where they will make you smile and want to start your day right - it's Baguette Cafe!

I actually like the challenge of finding good deals.  It's just sometimes it seems too cluttered and bunched to go through all of the sale items.

I snack more than I eat meals!)

Ted goes by the same breakfast order every week. I ask him why? He says those are his top favourites... the items are delicious, portions are huge, get his money's worth and possibly healthier than other breakfast joints... so why change? And he is absolutely right! I eventually fell in love with those items myself too lol.

Peameal bacon sandwich on Tuesdays. This sandwich is monstrous! The 3 thick-cut peameal bacons are SO juicy and delicious. And dunk it into a bit of ketchup, OMG, I can't seem to stop eating this one ^^

I believe it is a Western Omelette sandwich on Wednesdays. I love Westerns. The sandwich is so 'meaty'... filled with green pepper, onions, ham and cheese!

Thursdays are French Toast Day with fresh fruits and whipped cream + a side of sausages. Ted says it is his cheat day ^^ I love how Bam! packs the fruits, whipped cream, and syrup all separately... you just have to DIY everything together when you eat :)

Some might say these are just ordinary items... but I say being able to keep the same quality and consistency every day is something I truly admire. I highly recommend these 3 items and I would love to visit Bam! when I'm in the Beaches area again :)",2016-10-19 04:11:35

1.) Not just serve good food but delightfully great food!
2.) Server is fast, attentive to the needs of the customers  and has a cheerful attitude 
3.)the overall appearance of the restaurant is clean
4.)restrooms that are clean.

Let's start with the high points:
1) Simple yet artful decor. At first I was taken aback, but I've come to grow to love the close-up cacti wallpaper (think, electron microscope close) in my room. 
2) Large rooms. The closet space is a tad cramped for my liking, but it works. Although I don't totally get the arm hole in the glass wall of the shower (presumably so you don't get wet when turning it on), it's cool to look at. 
3) Pretty tasty breakfasts, actually. A group of us bombarded the kitchen with a mass order this morning, and they cooked everything up reasonably fast and delivered it to our conference room. So, thumbs up for the croissant breakfast sando. 

And the lowlights:
1) I love Aveda products but what is up with the scent of the hand lotion? Sniff the bottle: bliss. Slather it on your body: smell like industrial cleaning product.
2) Although I like the look of the wooden floor (or faux wood) in the guest rooms, the person above me is up promptly at 6 a.m. every day stomping around in stilettos and it's pretty loud and clear. 
3) Drinks at the bar are expensive. $8 for a short vodka soda? $10 for a glass of wine? Are you sure we are in Scottsdale and not some ritzy bar in Vegas?

When all is said and done, I'd most likely stay at this hotel again when I'm in the area. Not bad. Not bad at all!",2011-01-28 01:52:52

What's the deal? All of their 1 oz (1.5 oz?) margaritas are $5 (normally $8 - $9ish), bottles of beer are $5 (normally $7 - $9), tacos are half price for $2.50 (normally $5) and tequila is half price (usually $10ish and up). And if you want to double your margarita it's $10. I asked.

The margaritas are delicious. My favourites were the Mezcalarita (smokey) and the Classic (yep, no need to mess with this one by adding any other flavours). The Chilli Coconut was pretty tasty too, although actually quite spicy!

The tacos are pretty good, I recommend getting them with the more authentic corn tortillas. The server recommended the wild boar, and this was a good choice! Definitely a good deal at $2.50 each.

I came here on a Friday afternoon just before 4:30pm and the place was PACKED. And loud. We couldn't have much of a conversation but a fun atmosphere. I managed to get a table for two that was free til 6pm just by turning up, but I'd highly recommend booking ahead of time on their website (http://anejo.ca/home/#reserve).

The atmosphere was very glassy but there was no dress code - some people came in with t-shirt and short while others came in nice dresses. Basically anything goes.

To start, we ordered a salmon crudo (raw fish, kind of like sashimi). The mix of raw salmon mixed with other items (onion, orange slice, etc.) is just perfect. For main course, we got a whole roasted chicken and a beef tongue.  Our food took FOREVER to come..and when it finally came out, the waitress told us she messed up our order and ordered a completely different chicken dish. It was pretty disappointing after such a long wait, but she was really nice about it. She gave us the choice to either wait for the kitchen to make the right dish OR to keep the current chicken entree and she'll pay for it. Since we've waited so long, we decided to just take the dish that's already there.

Beef tongue was pretty tasty and it was very tender, and they were not shy about using oil. The outter layer is crunch while the inside is soft. Overall, definitely a good dish to try. The chicken dish was decent, but it was on the dry side. To apologize, the waitress also bought us a free desert - chocolate hazelnut mousse cake - which was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. There's a little surprise in the center of the cake too.

By the end of the meal, we only had to pay for the ceviche and the beef tongue. She didn't charge us for the beer, chicken entree or the dessert. Since she was so nice about this whole mess up, we tipped her 50% and decided we'll be BACK to give it another try. The food overall was pretty amazing.

I get that bar foods are typically salty to go with beer but this was just a bit too salty, especially since my friend and I were mostly there to try the food. 

This is a small place with less than 20 spots to sit. You order over the counter and the food will be delivered to where you're sitting. You don't get a number or anything so it's simply based on the waiter's memory or calling out your name. The staff was very attentive to remove any empty plates off as soon as we were done with them since the tables were quite narrow. My friend is allergic to peanuts and they were able to remove the nuts from the chicken wings. They forgot to remove the peanut from the green papaya salad the first time, but was happy to take it back and make a new batch.

The flavors of the dishes here are very different from the other more typical Viet places. Maybe it was the unfamiliarity, but I didn't quite enjoy it as much. The green papaya salad was very different from what I was expecting. I was expecting a refreshing salad lightly dressed with lime and fish sauce mixture, but their version here was mixed with a soy based, strong dark sauce. It was very salty, and the freshness was drown out. The cucumber in there was able to stand out against the sauce, but the papaya was completely lost. The beef jerky was chewy and didn't really have a flavor of its own. 

The first bite of the wings was really good, loved the fried bits of garlic and fresh chili and green onion on top. Then it got a bit too salty. For the fresh roll, you can really taste the prawn and the crispy rice crepe gives a nice crunch, but the pork belly was a little lost on me.

Also whatever bread they used was reeeeally good - it was kind of like a baguette but not overly hard or anything, and really delicious. Some kind of Italian bread? On a second occasion I ordered the fungocrema pasta, which was mostly mushroom and cheese and pasta. I thought it was a good pasta, a good lunch portion, not too heavy despite the sauce being cream-based, and enjoyable and delicious despite not having any meat in it.

I am so not a morning person, otherwise I would brunch more often.  Since this was a special occasion, I rolled out of bed and met our group at The Venetian for breakfast.

There were 15 of us!  You'd think that the service might be lacking because of this, but that wasn't the case.  Our server was awesome, our drinks were always full and everything was great.  No easy feat with a large group.

The restaurant is very cute.  It's pretty big, and they also have a patio.  Next time I want to sit out there.

I found the food prices to be very reasonable, especially for the quality of the ingredients and the portion sizes.  However, I do think their beverages are overpriced.  $12.50 for a small bloody mary? I know this is the Strip, but that's crazy.  My waffles were only $12!

That aside, the food was fantastic! We started out by sharing some of the pastries and the beignets du jour (choice between raspberry or cinnamon sugar).  The beignets were larger than I expected and very good.  They came served with a thick chocolate dipping sauce and jam on the side.  Definitely worth the $7!

The special of the day was crab hash with summer vegetables and topped with 2 eggs.  Quite a few people in our party ordered this, and it seemed like everyone enjoyed it. I had the ""Gaufres au Levain,"" which was sourdough waffles topped with fresh strawberries and served with maple syrup and Tahitian vanilla bean butter (OMG!).  These were quite possibly the best waffles I've ever had - and only $12! There were 4 small(ish) waffles and it was plenty of food.  I would definitely order these again.

I had to fill out a short registration form and sat in the waiting area very briefly. There is a cute dog in the office, Buttercup:) The complete eye exam took about 30 minutes and was very thorough since it was my first time there. I was seen by Dr. David Wilkinson, who is really friendly and professional. We're both from Mississauga so we traded 'ssauga stories. I chose not to have my pupils dilated because I had to go back to work and didn't want to have blurry vision. It's nice that they give you the choice. 

The exam cost $110 and they bill directly for a few insurance providers, otherwise they'll just give you a receipt that you can take to have reimbursed if you have coverage from your school or employer.

Toronto Eaton Centre is the latter.  The only stores that I have any use for are the Apple Store, Aveda, and Crabtree & Evelyn.

Once upon a time I had a huge collection of quirky shirts and then noticed how un-unique they were starting to become.  Then one glorious day I found Commonwealth Press while walking Carson Street on the SouthSide.

To say I was overwhelmed is an understatement.  I stood there in their shop alternating between the shelves trying my hardest to decide what Pittsburgh themed shirt I wanted more.  It seriously took me a half hour to figure out which one was more appealing to me.  In the end I decided they were all equally to my standards.  I just have to go back multiple times to be able to buy each one I want.  Or, for my convenience, just order them online.

The staff in the shop were very polite and knowledgeable about their clothing and didn't hesitate to help me when it came to sizing.  The girl manning the store at that time was very enthusiastic about the particular shirt I picked out and so excited that I chose it that it made me feel that I was buying it for her and not me.  

I was happy to see that they represent more than just Pittsburgh too and kind of branch out to western PA as well.  Also there are shirts there that are aimed at helping raise money for certain causes.  Some shirts have a little blurb to explain the meaning behind the shirts, or just ask and the staff are happy to tell you.

So, I tried Gypsie Bar at City Scape recently and I was pleasantly surprised. After hearing (and Yelp reading) a few reviews about it, I have formulated my very own take on the place:

GORGEOUS! The views from this bar are amazing. Especially on the Lucky Strikes Bowling side. I drank my Redbull Vodka happily as I stared into the vast array of buildings at night. The seats/bar/layout are very modern and comfortable. The decor is posh. The lighting was not too dark, but not too bright. It was perfect! 

FUN- There is a bar, a dance floor, lounge, arcade and a bowling alley. I went with a few friends and had a blast. I could dance it up for a while, then stroll on over the lounge and relax. I am surprised that so many are not raving about this place! 

ENVIRONMENT- I enjoyed the environment here. The people were very relaxed, not too dressed up but not too dressed down ect. There was not the ""I'm here to get laid"" vibe which was amazing! Everyone seemed very chill and there genuinely to enjoy a night out.

STAFF- The staff was very professional and sweet. They were not overly pretentious or rude which is rare for the nicer bars. The drinks were priced about the same price as they are on Mill Ave, however they are bigger and not served a plastic dixie cup (lol).

Overall, I LOVED this place! I will be definitely  heading there once again in the future. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!",2013-05-18 19:58:50

The servers are basic, no suggestions for 1st timers to their establishment and no small talk that generally increases tips.

Oh and we ordered a few things that never came out but I'm thankful for the mistake since the nigiri pieces are thin, the rolls are drenched in one sauce or another so the rice is soggy and most of the hot food was over cooked (popcorn lobster & baked aka crispy mussels).

Great way to get around and stay warm and dry in the bad weather. Also fun to people watch all the fancy dressed financial district employees. I really should wear heels more often..,but then my feet hurt...ah forget it.

So this Nadege is underground 120 Adelaide in the path. Open until 6pm on weekdays.

I can't say how impressed I am with this place and the management. Yes it takes 2x the people to make my salad than really needed. But the selection, quality and flavors makes the process totally worth it. They have a wide variety of flavor profiles and I love that they detail all calorie counts regardless if you have an add-on chicken, walnuts or Caesar dressing. I love the Mexicali Vegan Salad (360 cal) with add-on chicken breast and Sweet and Smoky Chipotle! 

But what particularly impressed me is their attention to detail. I had asked my salad maker if the falafel had coriander or cilantro in it and she asked the manager. The manager came over and figured out immediately that I was allergic and started warning me about a bunch of different ingredients (avoid tabbouleh and southwestern quinoa) and even had my ""chopper"" (which reminds me of fluffer - heh heh) remove his whole chopping station equipment and bring in new because the middle-eastern chicken is marinated in coriander and he was worried about the juices. That is an unnecessarily detailed boring story but I was blown away by the precautions they took for little ol' me- it was totally unprecedented.

My love for Anthony Bourdain turned me into an Flay-hater for no reason. Everyone has seen that episode of No Reservations--yes? Well, sorry for all the mean words Bobby. I'm the newest fan of Mesa Grill!

FIRST: The Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is a signature Bobby Flay dish. I think my server saw me drool a little. I tried to be casual as I scraped every last bit of sweet masa from the corn husk and scooped up every last bit of that buttery sauce. This is the tamale of my dreams.

SECOND: This is the way a Green Chile burger is supposed to taste: juicy and flavorful. The burger was cooked exactly to my specifications and had the most wonderful flavor. It was huge and a little difficult to eat. But I made it work. Little to no heat, but more sweet and savory which was definitely up my alley.

DESSERT: If you've ever eaten a spoon full of shaving cream, you'll know how the key lime sorbet tasted. Not that I regularly eat shaving cream, but every time I took the spoon to my mouth that's all I could think about. The fruit compote spiked with chili was not my cup of tea. I'll be direct and say it was awful. I would've traded this for another tamale.

I downed a few of those White Peach Bellinis, but I stopped at 3 to avoid looking like a drunk at 11:30am on a Sunday. Adds up at $12 a glass, but quite refreshing. My server was polite, formal, and attentive. CELEBRITY DOPPELGANGER: he looked just like Robert Irvine from Dinner: Impossible!

I got the chicken sandwich. It came on a really tasty, toasted roll and had pesto and other yummy stuff. Lisa got the salad and had steak with it instead of the shrimp that came with it. It was fantastic.

At this price, I'm looking to have an experience like no other. The blue corn waffles, tasted like, um, waffles. The quesadillas stuffed with cheese and bacon with an egg on top, tasted like something I could make at home. Then there was this dish that had steak, tortillas, guacamole and scrambled eggs. All of them were well prepared, but nothing different to make it stand out to match the price they charged for it.

The only thing I could not make at home was the tiger shrimp with tamales. That one had the wow factor and the uniqueness to justify the price. Reminded me of shrimp and grits with tamales in place of grits.

The side of mango-glazed bacon was not crispy. Bacon that is not crispy is simply wrong.

After reading some great Yelp reviews, I trekked out to Queen West and was greeted by a funky atmosphere and a super friendly, chill server. The menus were hip (like a record) and the content sounded delicious.

Fast forward 20 minutes of waiting for food (and being tempted by the mac-and-cheese at the table next to me in the meantime, and thus ordering one for myself), I finally met the Nice Lady (aka my wrap). The first bite was delicious but it got progressively worse as I couldnt find the other ingredients such as plantain, and all I could taste was the goat cheese. Bleh, Too much for me! My girlfriend got the Harlem sandwich with black forest ham, jerk chicken and havarti. I thought this was deeeelicious (minus the triple decker bread) but she found the spice of the jerk chicken too much. So, all you Weak Spices, stay away. Lastly, please don't be a fool like me and get suckered into the mac-and-cheese. You could probably make a better KD.

Shit really went downhill after this as the swarm of fruitflies over us became unbearable as we waited 20 or so minutes for our server. Such a sweet guy, but a really untimely smoke break.

I was a fan of the calamari mixed with fried veggies mixed in. However, the sauce was pretty mediocre and its appearance was literally the closest resemblance to vomit as anything I've ever seen.  Really, the calamari sauce looks like pure vomit.  I can't emphasize enough how much the chef needs to change this.  It's appearance is disgusting.

The Brussel Sprouts weren't bad, but they were very oily.  My mother, who is a fan of Pizza Hut pan Pizza, complained about how oily they were.  That should tell you something.  Tasty, but extremely oily. 

The free garlic bread with Yelp check in was good.  I was a fan. No complaints other than the fact it was left on our bill even though it was supposed to be free. A small mishap, but if you're reading this, be sure to make sure at the end of the meal that they aren't accidentally charging you for items that are supposed to be free via promotions.  

Things were good enough so far to merit a maybe 4-Star review. But then came the Pizza.  

I'm a Pizza fan.  It might be my favorite food.  I've gone above and beyond to find and appreciate good pizza, but I'm also guilty of loving trashy pizzas.  I'll scarf down papa johns and Pizza Hut no problem.  And if I want a late night fix at home, for some reason, Tombstone Pepperoni Pizza really understands me.  Maybe I should be embarrassed by this. I'm not. I love tombstone pepperoni pizza for some reason.  The little pepperoni nuggets hidden in the sauce are magic for me. I digress. 

This pizza was not good and not terrible. I got the calabrese.  The waiter said, for him, it was by far the best pizza on the menu.  It was ok, I guess.  Slightly bland.  Which is impressive in a bad way because it lists quite a number of not-bland ingredients.  Peppers, meatballs, what appeared to be some kind of chimichurri sauce laced over the toppings.  It looked really good. It wasn't.  It was meh. I'd rather eat a tombstone oven pizza with Tabasco on it.  The price is outrageous.  $17 for this 11-inch tasteless Pizza.  But I suppose it is the strip.  

I was pretty irritated by the waiter at one point. When I told him that I wanted a porter or stout.  He pointed to the appropriate section on the menu. There were 5 options.  After looking for 10 seconds, I made a choice.  

""Sorry, we're no longer serving that one""

Another 10 seconds of deliberation. A choice is made. 

""Sorry, we're out of that one too""

Yo, waiter.  I've made it clear that I want a porter or stout. And now I've tried to order 40% of your options and at least 40% of what your menu supposedly offers is not available. Instead of allowing us to waste our time, maybe let me know that 2 or 3 of the 5 beers that I'm selecting from aren't available.  Would be really helpful.  Seems like a no brainer.  Can you imagine if 4 beers was unavailable and I just proceed to name all 5 beers before getting to the 1 available choice?  No.  How dumb is that?  So irritating.  Let people in the future know what 3 are available please.  Thank you. 

Place is called Flour and Barley.  Should be Flour and Barely.  As in they ""barely"" have any dark beers to choose from.  Or there is ""barely"" any flavor in the food.  Or this place barely gets 3-stars.

I shouldn't be so harsh. Waiter was good for the most part and Management was nice too.  Just tilted from the recent recollection of the attempted beer order.  Appetizers were pretty good.  Pizza wasn't great, but not atrocious.  Bad...idk, it's pushing it.  Somewhere between average and not quite bad.  We'll just call the place 2.75-stars and round up.",2018-02-07 20:22:50

Seriously...I can't believe no on mentioned this. 

Be prepared to get RILL cozy with your neighbors. Actually, you may as well just call them table mates, given how close in proximity we were sitting. 

I'm also not a big fan of being able to see into the kitchen and know exactly how they're handling my food. Luckily my back was to the whole open glassed-in open kitchen thing, but if you're into watching people make your food, then this is a great spot. 

Okay, rant over. 

Onto the positives:

Extremely pleasant hostess and waitress. They were very very very helpful answering all of my questions, and very patient with me when I took forever to decide. 

The milk bubble tea stuff I had was good. I believe I had the mango milk tea, and it was sweet without being too overbearing. I'm not a ginormous bubble tea fan, but this one was certainly better than others I've had. 

I heart dumplings, and the soup ones here were divine. So good, so yum-tastic, and enough to share. My only qualm is that the table we were at was so ridiculously small for how big the container of dumplings was, but as soon as I tried them I quickly stopped giving a damn about lack of table space. 

I also tried the pork belly slider and it was OVERLFLOWING WITH DELICIOUS MEATY PORK BELLY NOMS. Between this and the dumplings I was pretty full, but I was also hell bent on trying their noodles. 

I hurriedly made a stupid decision and got some sort of vinegar based noodle dish. It was prepared well, but I hated it because I hate the strong taste of vinegar w/ peanut sauce. My fault for ordering it, but I'm confident that I'd go back and choose something less sucky for my taste buds.",2013-11-27 12:16:58

They have sake, beer and wine here as well.  The place is small, but bright.  I would probably do a sushi drive by and take out instead of stay.

I tried the chocolate twist soft serve (the swirl is like mcD's), but I still prefer the vanilla (the swirl is like Dairy Queen's, round). The waffle was alright but I probably wouldn't get it again.

I tend to dine there at least once a week and so I feel very qualified not only to speak to the quality of the food but also the consistency.  

Chef Sawyer believes strongly in sourcing as much of their ingredients locally as possible and as a result butchers their animals in-house as much as possible.  Due to these philosophies their menu changes fairly frequently a few items at a time based on the availability of certain items.  Large menu changes occur usually around the change in the seasons.  The last thing to remember about the menu is that it is French inspired so while it may sound intimidating upon first glance, don't let that scare you away.  

As you may have learned from reading my other reviews I'm a very adventurous eater. I have yet to find something on a menu that would scare most people out the door, that I wouldn't be willing to try.  How does this relate to Greenhouse?  In their quest to use as much of the animal as possible they end up with some very creative, tasty dishes. While there isn't typically anything on the menu at first glance that may scare you away except for pig's head there is a hidden treasure amongst the deliciousness that many don't even notice. That item is the ""Fifth Quarter"" changing just about daily, this is my favorite menu item and a large reason that Greenhouse is my favorite restaurant.  You may ask, how can it be your favorite dish if it changes daily?  The fact that it changes and is always something new, creative and delicious available makes it a perfect choice for me.  So what exactly is the fifth quarter? It is traditionally offal that is kept by the butcher to cook at home.  I've had everything from beef or pork tongue, to chicken necks and Ox heart.  All of which you would surely find delicious if you didn't know what it was ahead of time.

I could go on about everything I've had at Greenhouse but considering I virtually try every menu item at every change of the menu I could write a book.  Instead I'll hit up the staples that typically don't change a whole lot.  

First I'll start with.....Starters, after all it is the logical place to start right? Foie Gras Steamed Clams and Devils on Horseback (Bacon wrapped and chocolate stuffed dates) are always fan favorites of not just myself but all those I know who have gone. The salads are always very fresh and delicious. The taste makes it evident that the ingredients didn't have to travel far to get to your plate.  

Time for the entrees.  While there is sometimes a pasta on other parts of the menu, such as seconds all of the pastas I've had are excellent, try them. You may not think of it as a place to get great pasta, but I've had some of the best pasta dishes EVER here, don't discount that. The roasted half chicken is a very popular item but ""buyer beware"" the thing is huge, it could easily be shared between two people, it is unlike any roasted chicken you will ever have.  The Pig's head is another great choice. Don't think pig's head though. Think the most tender, juicy pulled pork of your life.  That's basically what we are talking about here.  If you are in the mood to splurge and it is still on the menu (it is a fairly new item not sure if it will change or not yet) you must try the 40 Day Dry Aged Steak Frites. This is the Certified Angus Beef from Niman Ranch, super tender and flavorful but don't bother if you are going to order it any more done than medium, you are just wasting your money. (I feel that way about any steak, order something else before you order it medium well or well.)

Another can't miss item that is great to share with your meal or as something to munch on over a few drinks is the Frites aka French Fries. Whether you get the ones with garlic and rosemary, which are great, or go all out for the Animal Style Frites, complete with fried egg, cheese curd, gravy, whole grain mustard, fried eggs and bacon, you'll leave a happy man or woman, guaranteed. 

As for desserts, there is always a Jeni's ice cream flavor which if you've never tried Jeni's Ice Cream out of Columbus, OH it is a great choice.  The dessert menu changes as frequently as the dinner menu so the current item that I'm in love with is the Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding. I typically am not a huge bread pudding fan and I LOVE this. So if you are a fan of bread pudding there probably isn't much more I need to say about it.

If you haven't been to Greenhouse Tavern, you must try it. The staff is always very friendly, the bartenders make great classic and creative drinks.",2011-03-30 15:14:51

It was a very lovely Victoria Day (roughly 20℃) which definitely called for a treat.

As I was feeling a little full, I opted for the junior swirl soft serve. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend their vanilla soft serve; the flavour definitely pales in comparison to other vanilla soft serves. For that reason, I'm glad I got it mixed with the chocolate! 

My mother and sister both got the small vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate. I had a bite of it and it was so good! The chocolate dip really accentuated the flavour and was something special to have on an otherwise normal soft serve cone. 

My dad got the single scoop cappuccino flavour in a waffle cone. Despite being just a single scoop, I was surprised at its generous size! It was quite large. I did find the ice cream slightly too sweet, but very rich in coffee flavour. The waffle cone cost $1 more but was very delicious.

Having lived in the area I knew my way around Las Sendas but had never eaten at The Patio - so I gave the restaurant a call while sitting in my car outside of Bogey's to ask for directions, my specific questions was, ""Where are you in relation to Bogey's?"". The sweet girl on the phone said she couldn't help me with that and she would need to get me a manager. The manager hopped on and I repeated my question - she told me they were right behind Bogey's, I just needed to walk down the path and I would see their door. (Your hostess should really have been able to answer that question...) Anyway, we arrived for our reservations at 5:30 and were quickly seated at a dirty table (when there were multiple, clean, set tables around us) and I asked if she could wipe the table down. The sweet girl (same one on the phone) said she would need to check if that was OK. Someone must have told her we could just sit at a clean table so we were settled in and ready to order. Our waiter arrived promptly and let us know we had 10 minutes left for happy hour (even though the menu and website stated it was supposed to go on for another hour) so we quickly ordered our drinks and munchies and said we would look at the menu to order our entrees. 45 minutes later we were finally able to flag our waiter down to place our meal order. :/  While we were eating we watched other tables around us receive bread/butter/have cloth napkins placed on their laps....basically receive the kind of service we expected from Las Sendas Patio.

I came on my lunch break after all the great reviews I saw, I just had to try it. The lady who took my order was very helpful. She even let me taste the soups of the day because I couldn't decide which one to order. I went with the half Mushroom soup and half Chicken Chipotle grilled sandwich. 

You can tell that the soup was just made and wasn't sitting around all morning. It wasn't too creamy and had good bold flavors. I am NOT a mushroom lover but this soup was really good. The sandwich was amazing. It is a pretty small half sandwich but it was a perfect size for me. But I think most of you should order a full sandwich. The bread was made from scratch.

The owner, Olivier, was great! I went to talk to him about getting a menu to take with me but unfortunately he doesn't have any yet. He did grab my e-mail and he sent me a copy of the menu. When costumers would walk in he would automatically address them by their name. Now that's good customer service and it shows that he has regulars that come in for his amazing food.

I ordered the vegan slice with vegan garlic knots. The Mr got a spinach/white slice. 
The pizza was OK, not the best but not the worst. It was a little bit soggy and not flavorful enough. 
The garlic knots were really just mini round rolls and were over cooked. They were not garlicky at all, and they were dry. Definitely would not order the garlic knots there again. 
Also, the marinara sauce that came with it was cold and kind of just tasted like ketchup - no seasonings at all.
Side note- my absolute favorite garlic knots in this town are the ones at Pizza Company, those are life-changing! 
Also, since we weren't staying at the hotel they don't validate your parking. So we had to spend $10 on parking in addition to $20 for two slices, two sodas, and a small order of knots ...w parking it all came out to a $30 adventure.

This place operates much like chipotle or Yafo in that you walk through the line and tell the servers what you want to add to your dish. 

Moe's has burritos, quesadillas, and taco salads, as well as bowls which can be created to your preference. I typically go with the bowl as it tends to be the healthiest and most filling.  Unfortunately, Moe's transitioned from free guac to now charging for guac.

I have noticed that the last few times I have been to Moe's they have started skimping on the chips. Chips are free so that's understandable. Overall, Moe's is a solid option for lunch but there is nothing unique about it. I have no real complaints: the food is always fresh and has good flavor.

The place had no a/c and I happen to go on the most humid day of the year making my eating experience just slightly worse.  Nothing much to say about the veal parm sandwich. It was average and I believe their oil had been overused as evident by the browner colour of the fried breading rather than a nice golden colour. On top of that, service was mediocre. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt that it was the most humid day of the year and thus making it an uncomfortable working environment.

The part that made up for all of this was the Arancini which brings my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  It was my first time trying this Italian staple, but it actually blew my mind. It is a simple dish consisting of a deep fried rice ball with cheese, ground beef, and peas in the centre and then smothered in Marinara sauce. The way these ingredients are combined together is wonderful and it brings out the best in each ingredient.

Barrio has truly been a gift to the East 4th area. It's only been open for a few weeks, but I've been there enough to call myself a regular. You can't beat margs and tacos!

I opted to create my own tacos, which turned out to be fantastic. The green goddess shell was my favorite taco shell. I filled it with all sorts of delicious things - shredded chicken, chihuahua cheese, mango salsa, and onions and cilantro. Try it...I would not lead you astray. I am also a big fan of fish tacos in a soft shell with onions, cilantro and the crema sauce.

Chris got the recommended tacos and was a big fan of the dirty taco, which surprisingly enough is a vegetarian option. Being the meat-eater he is, he opted to add some chorizo to it. If you like spicy, you'll like this.

As far as drinks go, I tried the sangria and was a huge fan. I also had a pear margarita, but found it to be a little too sweet. I'll be trying one of the other margarita flavors next time I go though!

The service was only so-so. We went on opening night and the server, while really friendly, was a little slow and forgot quite a few things. I think she was overwhelmed. Our second trip out, the waitress wasn't really sure of any of the specials.

Im probably going to run out of adjectives pretty quickly! First off I have to start with our server Brian. This guy provided us pretty flawless service and is a fantastic server. Friendly, professional, knowledgeable with the menu and preparations, and just the right amount of checking on us. 

We arrived around 5:30 and were one of the first ones to be seated. By the time we left the restaurant was packed full, however our level of service never changed. Brian had many full tables but we never had to look for him or ask for our drinks to be refilled. 

As first timers Brian went over the menu and as always we asked for suggestions which he was happy to provide. The complimentary duck fat fries were soon delivered. Served with three different dips a great start to the dinner. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi appetizer. Although the fish was fresh and flavors were good it was our least favorite dish of the night. For $24 I was expecting a lot more than five small bites. 

For our steaks we ordered the 16 oz prime bone in ribeye and the 10 oz prime filet. Brian said it was the best filet he's ever had and I would have to agree. Both steaks were cooked perfectly as ordered. My NY had great flavor and was served with melted butter on top. The filet was phenomenal, so juicy and tender. For our sides we chose the jalapeño corn and potato gratin. The corn was really good but the gratin...out of this world! Thin soft layers of potato covered in melted smoked gouda. 

To finish we had to order Strip Steaks famous beignets. A staple on the menu since they opened they come in an order of 3 or 6. If you order 6 you get a trio of ""sauces"" which of course we did :-)  The beignets were incredibly soft, served warm and cooked to perfection and then dusted with powder sugar. Two of the sauces, the mocha and the vanilla were actually a creme brûlée style and not a sauce. The third one, a butterscotch you could pour on the beignets. A perfect ending to a fabulous dinner that I will not soon forget. 

Thank you Brian and Strip Steak for such a fantastic meal.",2016-09-12 19:11:10

They do have some growing pains to work out. 

1. They do need to remodel. I believe from what I saw they are working on that. I don't go to a buffet for ambiance anyways so I didn't have any major issue with this. If you like a buffet with ambiance Las Vegas is about 5 hours away.

2. Their food is good, I liked the grape leaves, chicken schwarma, and I enjoyed the hummus and fresh made pita bread. Thoughts, have a Pita Bread Station that someone can work, instead of the owner running around trying to do everything (To the owner, you were fantastic, I wanted to give you a hug when I left!). There are some tweaks that need to happen to some of the food, mostly the American like the Pasta Alfredo, chicken nuggets etc. I would love it if they would give my chef friend a job he could turn the OK to fabulous as he is amazing with Eastern Food, and American at that.

It appears to be a family run place, Husband, Wife and Two Daughters. I will tell you this, their two girls are some of the most respectful well mannered girls I have ever met. They were amazingly attentive.

If the owners read your reviews, and from the service I am pretty sure you do, because I saw major changes from some of the reviews, you have a great thing going for you. Focus on the American food making it better, or even better then that taking that out and adding more Mediterranean food (or Thai even...curries are awesome and relatively easy to make and unlike some people I am OK with that kind of food here.)

While looking for good seafood in Mississauga came across this restaurant that is right next to the GO station and close to my home - and read the reviews. Decided to give it a shot despite the rather interesting location for a fish and seafood place. Went there on a Friday night with my gf.

Was very pleased with the experience! Place was packed so having a reservation was a good idea. The place did empty out though around 9PM so reservation needed only if you go before that time. 

Service was excellent - fastest service I had in a while, very polite. Started with the deep fried calamari and then we went with our mains - I went with the pecan crusted Northern Ontario rainbow trout, and my gf went with the Icelandic Actic Char filet. 

The calamari was disappointing. $9 for a tiny little plate. Could tell that the calamari was made in larger portions and simply kept warm before serving. Kinda soggy, not crispy at all. The spicy mayo was nice though.

Despite the calamari disappointment, the fish was excellent. Both fishes really well made, not overcooked so the flavour was still there. Nice sauces to go with them, not too overpowering so could still taste the fish (this is big for me, as sometimes restaurants use so much sauce that you cannot feel the original fish taste). Solid side of sweet potato fries and veggies. Truly filled me up. Did not even get a chance to have dessert as the main was so good.

The place is far from perfect. It has a dining room that is rather average looking but cozy and tables far apart to have private conversations. There is a lounge next door with drinks and TVs but did not go in there. The drinks list is OK with some decent wines and cocktails. 

I give it a 5 start but I wish I could do 4 and a half because it has some small problems. The experience was excellent hence pushed it to 5.

Positives: some of the best fish I had in while. Very fast courteous service and very prompt. Despite being in a packed place the food arrived relatively fast so didn't feel like I had to wait for hours. Nice vibe, nice crowd. 

Negatives: calamari was soggy and made a while back. Portion was tiny for $9. The prices are not too friendly, as most fish is $20 give or take and the pasta/seafood starts at $17. Throw some wine with this and a dinner for two can push towards $100 with taxes, tip and everything. These are more downtown prices rather than your local Mississauga establishment. 

Despite the negatives, I still give this place 5 stars because at the end of the day had a wonderful time.",2014-04-27 16:26:02

It was what I would expect from a Caesar salad, nothing more and nothing less.  The rest of the food came out and my dishes looked underwhelming. The fried pickles were ok. Not too battered, there was something a little off about them but I can't put my finger on it. The sandwich looked super sad. The bread was crispy as though it at one point been toasted but was very soft, and the ingredients sort of just meshed together and were indiscernible.

In the past I have had mini makeovers by a few of the girls there that are excellent, full of patience, or really just know their inventory.  As a person who buys makeup rarely and just wants something that looks pretty natural with a few accents ( and of course something special for the evening), for me its super important that a sephora employee knows what they have and maybe where its been placed since i last visited.  
For example, I have a beloved eyebrow pencil.  I had the misfortune of utterly losing it and subsequently visited sephora for a replacement.  I circled the store looking for it.  Drat... it had changed locations since the last time I was here.  I circled some more because no one was free to assist.  Finally these two girls with super thick makeup done in the latest fashion trend etc ( including a nude lip color, which i found interesting since it kind of made her look like a barbie) asked super perkily .... ""can i help you?""  So I explained my situation.. they didn't really let me finish my query for the pencil before they started looking at me like deer in headlights and told me to wait in the SUPER LONG MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND LINE.  They said that the cashier could look up my pencil on the sephora card (which again... its not that i didnt know what i needed.. just needed to know the location).  Anyway, I looked at them with my patent ""i'm not so pleased and are you kidding me face"" and they just turned their gaze skyward.  Whatever, I waited in line.  Got up to the counter, cant remember her name, but one of the full time employees who is always super nice helped me out (and also let me know that they defs could have looked me up without me waiting in line).  From this super helpful gal, I also got a blush rec... and overall i rate her a 5/5 and it is because of her alone that this review is three stars instead of 2.  
In terms of the store itself,  vast selection and you will defs find something you didnt even think you needed (if you can get someone appropriate to help).",2016-06-07 02:40:01

The fried mandoo had a lot of stuffing inside. You can also order pre-cooked frozen mandoo, so you can enjoy it at home. 30 piece for $20. Speaking of mandoo, their mandoo soup had a lot of nonfried mandoo and noodles. Their broth was flavorful and it also had pieces of egg.  The beef and vegetable soup was yummy, but it was majority vegetables. The 3 meats we got was chicken Katsu, meat jun and bulgogi. The plate was huge and the meat was all flavorful.

The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, (at least the ones that come between 9-12). They'll give you tastes of the beers and recommendations, and hook you up if they're out of something with the coffee drinks.

Getting back to the food,  we ordered the garlic shrimp, plantains, empanadas, potatoes bravas and jamon croquettes. First off, the garlic shrimp were smaller than the last time, not as good quality and swimming in oil. We sent hem back. The potatoes bravas came out smothered in so much sauce that you could barely identify what they were. They were not the same potatoes we had three months ago. The empanadas were good but were only served one and a half, not cool. They couldn't give us two??? The croquettes tasted like puréed spam and it came with what can only be described as mayonnaise without a flavor. They were very generous with our wine and topped off my glasses very nicely. A friend of mine had A chicken dish and wasn't impressed at all.

Five of us went in and before any orders were placed we told our waiter we wanted separate checks (one couple, plus three individual checks).  We were told ""we're not allowed to do separate checks anymore"".  I've been to restaurants that won't allow separate checks for parties over a certain size, but we were a group of five asking for four checks.  Separate checks were never a problem in the past.  Not allowing a small group to have separate checks suggests a willingness to inconvenience the customer for the convenience of the restaurant.

Came in and spoke with Marc about my concern. He advised that maybe the tire pressor reader at Chevron wasn't accurate and we can check and put air in it today and if it comes back on again they can lift it up and check for any leaks. 

My back passenger tire was at 16lbs when they put air in to make it 33lbs. Well, the next day the Tire Pressure light came on once again. I got real nervous and put air in it at Chevron and checked the pressure, it was at 20lbs. I brought it in and spoke with Marc. He said it was pretty busy today & if I can come back in an hour and a half. 
 
I came back they took my car and few minutes later they said nothing was wrong with my tire and it had adequate amount of pressure on all tires. I advised them that I had put in air in it not to long ago and was at 20lbs when I checked it. They still insisted nothing was wrong. Ok? 

The next day my Tire pressure light came on again. I took it to Discount tires and they found a large nail in my tire.

The hotel had huge movable air conditioning units throughout the lobby and breakfast area. It's too bad we didn't have them in the room because the A/C absolutely could not keep up with the Charlotte heat. The room was sweltering for our entire stay, and the mattress seemed to retain heat so it was even worse at night.

There are only two elevators for the entire building, and in the last day of our stay one went down. As a result, people had to line up to use the elevator. At one point we waited ten minutes to get back up to our room.

Like most Uptown hotels in Charlotte, Fairfield Inn & Suites does not offer any free parking. There is a parking garage that charges $10 for daily parking (no overnight) and $15 for overnight parking. The entryway of the hotel is pretty much a clusterfudge...there is no place to park without going into the paid parking garage, and if you leave your car to go check-in you are blocking cars from entering the garage. It is not a convenient set-up.

The breakfast offerings are extensive: oatmeal, waffles, fruit (even fresh pears!), a hot bar with a preparation of eggs and a breakfast meat, muffins and bagels, etc. There is also an on-site restaurant so you can order room-service.

Fairfield Inn & Suites was more than adequate, but the parking, elevator, and A/C issues made things inconvenient. Add a crappy bed to the mix, and you get a 3 star review (really a 2.5 but I usually round up). Forgettable.",2017-06-01 14:02:37

So I got some piercings done - single forward helix (left ear only) and *NSFW* my nipples.  Since I knew in advance I wanted these done I did a LOT of research to make sure I found the best place for what I wanted.  I'm kind of anal like that.

Initially, I wanted a triple forward helix.  When I called to ask if they even do this (you'd be surprised), the gentleman on the phone said, ""We CAN but do NOT recommend it because it will not set right and can look crooked.""  Wow.  I called a ton of places before and they just quoted me a price or didn't even know what it was.

Honesty like that goes a long, long way with me.  I called back, asked if I needed an appointment, then drove on over.

It was a little tricky to navigate in the parking lot, but if you see the Baskin Robbins you're pretty much there.  It is next to the Auto Zone.

The inside is actually really cool!  They've got a pool table, digital darts, couches, Ms. Pac Man, and a soda machine.  One ENTIRE long wall is dedicated to tattoo designs, and they even have a little table halfway in that has pictures of real artwork.  By far, this was one of the nicest set up tattoo & piercing places I'd been to.  (For a point of reference, before last night I have 8 tattoos and 10 piercings.)

Jeremy is the main tattoo & body piercing artist, and is a rad dude.  He's great at what he does and marked everything before even clamping.  He is very honest and very real, and told me that the triple forward helix picture everyone sees is actually a girl who glued on jewelry to her ear, which is why it looks so perfect.  Everyone's ears are shaped differently, so if you get a triple helix it can actually point in different directions or not set right simply because of the ear's natural design.

I had my fiance and two friends there and they asked if they could hang out and watch and Jeremy was totally chill about it.  They all had conversations about piercing and whatnot while I clenched my fists and thought about puppies.  Haha.  We DID chat about the negative review listed about the laws - which was actually another reason I chose this place - and I felt the same exact way Jeremy did.  He owns a business, he has children, and he wants to uphold the law.  Last time I checked that seems legit.

3 piercings in one night is totally insane but I did it.  And they have a kickass special of get 3 pay for 2!  Helix was $45 with jewelry and nipple was $35 with jewelry - other one PLUS jewelry was free.

IF YOU WANT A BODY PIERCING, GO HERE.  It's a little off the beaten path but it's worth it.  All 3 people that went with me said they'd come back to this shop before anywhere else.  I don't think I'm getting any more piercings anytime soon, but they also have a Yelp check-in for tattoos.  =)!",2013-03-06 05:23:29

We purchased a voucher from Living Social worth 50$ so when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the restaurant had a fair amount of people.

We ordered the non-vegetarian platter as an appetizer, the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. It took 40 minutes for us to receive the appetizer. We both thought the appetizer was average but nothing relatively special. We received our meals at 9PM, one hour after our arrival. The curry dish my friend ordered was warm but not fresh, the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like I was eating butter. I ate about 1/4 of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming.

The service was below average, we had ordered water and when we wanted more there was no one to ask. Upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. I noticed there were only 2 chefs in the kitchen, 2 waiters and a manager on a Friday evening.

When we received our bill, usually when we have a voucher worth 50$ and we did not spend our maximum we would not need to pay tip or the taxes. But in this situation the waiter told us we had to and it was not included with the voucher. So I had to pay the taxes when the voucher would have covered the overall amount, this has never occurred to me as I have used vouchers in the past and if I have not used over the amount given it would be counted as tip. SO I gave the waiter 10$ and on top of that the remainder of the voucher which is 8$ equals 18$ tip which is completely ridiculous for the service we received.

Excellent pre-dinner dirty martini in the bar.  They had blue cheese olives, which just elevates the drink for me.

Once seated, we were talked in to the Chilled Seafood Platter.  Our waitress told us they were out of the raw oysters and lobster cocktail that are normally on the platter, but they would substitute more of the other items.  Three tiered, excellent presentation.  Top tier had a small portion of seared tuna slices.  Middle tier was only sauces.  Bottom tier consisted of about 15 large shrimp and a medium sized pile of small Alaskan king crablegs with the tops sliced off.  $100  Now, we didn't know the cost of this dish (Market Price, after all), but I would kill someone if I had to pay this kind of money for such a disappointing app.

The 'being out of X' was a common theme the Thursday we were there.  Two people at our table literally had to fight over who'd get the last piece of salmon.  I cannot remember what steak the customer next to me first wanted, but they didn't have any left for the evening.  That was also disappointing.

I went with the Sea & Shore, a three-course prix fixe for $45.  My choice of any of their signature salads (I went with their Wedge, which they are supposedly known for) and desserts (I had them wrap up the Key Lime pie to take back to my hotel room).  The main course was a 7oz filet with your choice of crabcakes, scallops or shrimp scampi.  I went with the crabcakes, which were fine.  I appreciated how many choices I had with this menu option, and I would recommend it for the amount of good food you get for the price.

How could I forget about this majestic hole-in-the-wall spot? I figure because I'd only get pizza after getting loaded at the PT's close by. Nonetheless, after seeing a Living Social deal for $7 for $14 worth of food, I was back on the wagon. While I remembered the pizza being delicious, I was kinda bummed that the deal excluded pizza. So I opted out for calzones. These babies were huge! Think 4 big slices of pizza with another pizza fold on top of it and you have their calzones. My man and I got 2 calzones, which was the prefect amount for the LS deal. He got the meat and I got the veggie calzone. I finished two of those deliciously cheesy and veggie stuffed pies and I was spent. 

Just to be clear, this isn't a restaurant or sit down restaurant. You come, you order and you leave happy, because you just got pizza or a yummy calzone. 

The guys behind the counter were super nice as well. So ultimately, if you are feigning for pizza and you're too lazy to get off your bum, call these guys! Your stomach and taste buds will thank me later.",2013-02-08 20:25:45

He tried the Reuben Melt with Lobster Bisque soup and I got the Country Fried Chicken, Eggs and Biscuits. The Lobster Bisque was surprisingly creamy and full of flavor for a diner soup. I'll admit, the Country Fried Chicken was a bit heavy for brunch but it was so amazing; every bite was worth the gazillion calories that I consumed. The chicken was well seasoned and moist, the batter was crispy and the creamy gravy made it all the more comforting. I could tell the biscuits were homemade or made very well bc they were so moist and great alongside everything else.

I am not that familiar with this area as don't venture out here much. This place is nestled in an odd mixture of workshops , industrial warehouse (I think I even heard a few lathe machines at work on a Saturday as well) and an odd park on what seems like a back road. I think they have done well with the space they got as they kept the industrial structure and added neat touches that somehow bring character to this place. 
The restaurant was packed for starters. The ordering system seems straightforward. One orders at the cashier and gets a buzzer and food is brought over. 
We ordered the following:
Labneh: I am neutral to this dish. This one is a better take on the one's I have tried. Seasoned well with nice olive oil and sweet roasted garlic and tomatoes to boot. Comes with a pita which was very hefty. 
Shashuka: this dish seems to have become the norm as I see it almost everywhere. A better take on this dish as not as oily as the one I tried recently at the other place. 
Arais: I am a big fan of this dish and almost seek out the places that serve it so was looking forward to it. Hmm plated nicely it wasn't the version I am used to as way heftier owing to the pita bread they have here. Spiced well though a bit oily again due to the thick pita. The yam on the side was good. Decent take on this dish.

We arrived early on a Saturday evening for dinner. The weather was still pleasant, so we chose to sit on the patio. During the quick walk though the dining room to get to the patio, I couldn't help but notice the eclectic decor which seemed to fit the ""mod-mex"" theme perfectly. 

The patio was nice. Wrought Iron tables and chairs aligned the brick patio which was well landscaped. From the patio, it was hard to tell we were even in suburban Ohio City. It was private, quiet and secluded from the rest of the world.

To start off, we ordered the Guacamole with goat cheese, tomato, chile and poblano to nibble on. My beverage of choice was the Cucumber Margarita with red pepper lime salt. Both were very tasty. Especially the Cucumber Margarita! By far, the tastiest Tequila based cocktail I've ever sipped on. The flavors worked so well together.

For an appetizer, we shared the Grilled Corn on the Cob with chipotle + lime butter and cotija + pico. I have recently discovered ""Cuban Style Corn on the Cob"" and make it all the time at home. Momocho's version was mighty tasty too. My only complaint was that the kernels on the corn were a bit too well done for my likening. I prefer my corn more al-dente. 

For the main course, I chose the Machaca Taquitos with coffee + ancho braised beef brisket and guacamole tradicional. I thought this dish was well seasoned with just the right amount of heat. 

Overall, the Momocho experience was everything I had hoped. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We asked his opinion on a few menu items and he was well prepared to answer everything to our satisfaction. The atmosphere was relaxing and the food was excellent. There's so much more I'd like to try on this menu, so another visit in the near future is definitely in store.  In the meantime, I can't stop thinking about those Cucumber Margarita's!

Complimentary limo rides to and from the house was a wonderful bonus.  They even send you home with a parting gift.  And the Mansion was a once in a lifetime magnificent sight!

Had the 16 Course Degustation menu and ordered a nice Rose from Cortes De Provence.  With an initial glass of Champagne when we arrived + 2 Bottles of flat water = just a little over $1000 for 2, before tip. 

Although I felt the dinner was impressive, I would suggest several things.

1. 16 Courses was WAYYYYYYYYYYY too much food.   Yes, the portions are small but they are extremely rich and heavy.  The table next to us chose to pair their meals w/ wine and they were dying by the 4th course!  Next time I'll just do 3-4 courses. You want to enjoy the most expensive meal of your life and not have to fight through it! 

2. When you get seated they will ask if you would like a cocktail or glass of Champs. Take your time and request a wine and champagne menu and order water for the moment. I then would suggest ordering a bottle of wine or champagne for the entire night because by the glass is almost the same price as one bottle. Choose your alcohol wisely and you can easily shave $200-300 off your bill. My single glass of champagne cost almost as much as our bottle of wine. 

3. Go easy on the bread cart.  Though it is impressive and has some wonderful options, it can easily creep up on you later while you struggle to finish the rest of your meals. It shows up first so exercise restraint and just choose a few. 

I really did enjoy the experience at Joel Robuchon.  The Michelin Star restaurant really lives up to that promise of excellent service and an ultra plush dining experience.  I did feel that the food was good and some very delicious but not EXTRAORDINARY.  The price is a little too steep for the food but I think the value lies more in the limo pick up, sneak peak of the Mansion, impeccable service and sensational ambiance. I would suggest dining on the faux terrace with the gorgeous floors of flowers and the beautiful IVY WALL. It was extremely romantic and cozy.

When we went in we saw many empty tables...so I'm not sure why they made us wait so long...and other people were still waiting outside when we were seated...and there was clearly a few good open tables. Now our waitress was a sweet old lady though...I overheard her trying to help a customer warm up their food because they were gone for a long time and the food was sitting there for awhile...the waitress insisted on warming it up for her and I thought that was really nice. 

I couldn't decide rather to get the Chicken Fried Steak with Eggs or the Homemade Corn Beef Hash with Eggs...since they both sound so yummy when you're starving...hehe So my bf ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and I ordered the Corn Beef Hash.

We were escorted directly to a comfty booth.  The place was nice and cool and had the end of the Panthers game on tv.

Shortly after being seated, a gentleman promptly came and took our food and drink orders.  Shortly thereafter, our drinks arrived and we placed our orders.  I ordered the ""Diamond Dog"" and a ""Small bloc"" all-the-way with pepper-jack cheese.  My girlfriend ordered a side salad and the spaghetti (which I would have never ordered by the way...I mean its not like we were at Mamma Ricattas!).

The salad arrived almost immediately.  As for the rest of our order, well lets just say, if we would have held our breaths while waiting for our order, our bodies would've decayed and turned back to ashes and dirt.  It def didn't seem crowded, and they certainly seemed to have plenty of staffing on hand.  So its anyone's guess as to what was going on back there...??

WHEN the food finally arrived, myself and the four other people I was with, were less than satisfied.  My girlfriend was disappointed with her spaghetti.  She said it didn't have any real flavor, was bland and a bit runny; yuck!  I can't say as the burger was THAT bad.  The pepper-jack cheese added a nice touch.  As for the hot dog , well it was a hot dog.  It was good, not great.  It was about what I would've EXPECTED it to be, but not what I would've HOPED it would be.    

I am not gonna get into whether the Diamond is better than the Penguin or not, because to be honest, I've had less than steller experiences there as well.  Everything about this place is average to me.  Our waiter was a nice bro, but our food took forever to arrive.  My food was decent, but my gf hated her food.

They have cute booths and really wide chairs. The waiter was so kind, answered any and all questions. My friend ordered the french toast and I ordered ramen, without spam, which I guess I should have known better. 

The wait was not long at all. Our food came out in good time. Just as he set the bowl down, my thoughts came to life. There is my bowl looked as if it was a .28 pack of ramen. I have nothing against them, as I buy them. I was just upset I had to pay $10 for it. Not like you get in an authentic place. Like I said, I should have known better. Took a bite. Sure enough.

The guy there was great! He felt bad I didn't enjoy my food. I didn't say it, my friend did. And he asked if I wanted anything else. Of course I said no. Needless to say I don't plan on coming back. If someone convinces me, which I doubt, I will order something different.",2016-04-17 01:12:19

To be fair, this isn't really my style of food (a bit fancy for my taste) but we were trying to keep up with our friends and be refined...my mistake :-) lol

My fiance and I both ordered the same thing, Steak and Frites. I don't do lamb, or fish, or chicken with bone, etc. so really, the steak was my only choice...and I love fries.

The dish was fine, but I've had MUCH better steak at a lot of different places, and the fries were just fries. I ordered the vanilla creme brulee for dessert and while it was quite good, it didn't have anything with it. Usually vanilla creme brulee is served with some sore of fruit compote or cream on top...something. My fiance orderd the eggnog custard, he said it was REALLY good, but it was TINY for $9. It should have been AT LEAST twice the size. Overall, for portion size, I think it was overpriced, but I was kind of expecting that.

I did like the ambiance of the place..very nice/cute. The service was excellent and the champagne that was recommended to us after we told our waiter what we liked was fantastic...an excellent suggestion! Our friends liked their dishes (chicken, and monk fish) and they were plated very nicely. 

We went because our friend is a big fan of the chef and being a cook himself he wanted to go, but this was not a place I would have chosen myself & I probably wouldn't return, but I wouldn't say I regret going.",2011-12-22 06:04:45

The salt bagel tasted more like blueberry, the everything bagel might as well be an onion bagel, and the cinnamon raisin bagels are basically a plain bagel with a faint hint of flavor. They're dense and chewy. If these are fresh, they probably need to figure out a better plan because they seem stale compared to a truly fresh bagel.

After several days of eating Italian and American food, we decided to go ""Asian"" and chose Malee's based on the high average Yelp rating.

My first impression was good.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the service is pretty good.  But I was shocked when I saw the menu.   The prices are outrageous.  It ended up costing $62 for 3 people.  I'm pretty sure I could've gotten the same amount of food for half the price at any Thai restaurant in LA.

We ordered Crab Rangoon, Tom Ga Kai soup, Calamari salad, and Roasted Duck Curry.  The Crab Rangoon lacked crab and the sauce did not go well with the fried dumpling.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant defaults to white meat chicken without asking me for my opinion. News Flash! There are many of us out there who prefer the juiciness and tenderness of dark meat chicken.  Anyway, the Tom Ga Kai had all white meat chicken and it tasted dry and flavorless. Furthermore, the soup was too thick and was more like a stew.  The soup base itself was far too sweet.  I order this soup at every Thai restaurant I go to so I think I've had it enough times to be able to say that this one was the worst.   I am also a huge fan of Roasted Duck Curry and this was the worst Roasted Duck Curry I've had at a Thai restaurant anywhere.

Next we got the short ribs cooked medium rare which we loved! It was tender and our server cooked it perfectly. The skirt steak was my favorite! It was tender and cooked medium rare (I would suggest you get it like that), but what really made me enjoy it was the taste! It was juicy and with every bite you would want more.

A friend and I sat at the bar for happy hour here at what was fated to be a tour of sliders in downtown... but that part of the story comes later. The place was busy, as I imagine it is typically for happy hour. Their happy hour drink menu leaves much to be desired... it only has 4 simple cocktails that don't really show off what this place is all about (elaborate and creative cocktails). We both tried the Tea cocktail that was on special for 6$. It was alright, very strong tea flavor which covered the vodka taste very well... in fact, it didn't taste much like alcohol at all... oh, but it had alcohol. These puppies were strong (haha unintentional pun), and both of us felt it. Here is when the problem arose. We sat at the bar for another 30-40 minutes and couldn't get the attention of any of the bartenders. We tried making eye contact to no avail. We really wanted to order food and I wanted to get another drink. Finally, about 1 minute before happy hour ended we slid in an order of happy hour sliders (heh) and I got a caribe drink of sorts (it had tequila, pineapple, other delish things...). The food and drink got to us quickly, so we were happy. I must say, the sliders were some of the most delicious sliders I have ever tasted... the pork belly was perfectly cooked and not overly fatty, they were delicate and all of the flavors worked together (pork, kimchi, hawaiian roll.... pure bliss). Oh ya, my drink was good too. So my tip is... do come for happy hour, get the snacks, but skip the weak happy hour drink specials and cough up the dough for one of their specialty drinks.

The Yorkshire pudding is good for soaking up the steak juices, but other than that not very flavorful (which might be normal for this dish, as I have not had it anywhere else.) The creamed spinach side was wonderful! We also had the creamed corn, which was also quite good. The second time (and every time since) I ordered the rib eye. Let me just say that this will not disappoint! It is grilled over rosemary sprigs and is infused with it's flavor. The outside of the steak is perfectly crisp and the inside is nice and tender (as well as blood rare like I order it.) The rib eye comes with scalloped potatoes which are heavenly. The spinning salad that comes with all of the dishes is quite tasty although my husband doesn't like the beets in it.

One of my dinner groups met here tonight.  The staff was very accommodating and from some of the things they did, like bring you clean utensils after the appetizer, salad and so forth, you'd think you were in a 4-star restaurant.

The food is outstanding.  I ordered the plantains for an appetizers. They were delicious although not the best I've had in Charlotte.  The rolls that came with dinner were very good as well as the butter.  I ordered the Halibut which came with 2 shrimp and a tomato chorizo sauce.  This was delicious....very savory but still light.

The staff is really on the ball here.  There are very few restaurants that are this attentive in Charlotte.

The food was ok, nothing spectacular but worthy of a second try. The new Vig is pretty cool, very similar set up to the Arcadia one, nice open patio and Bocci ball court. 

2nd experience at the Vig was awful!! The service was horrendous, but let me back up... I arrived just before 6 and attempted to pull in to the parking lot.. I saw the valet guys making wild hand gestures to cars, but wasn't really sure how to interpret them. Cars were honking trying to get past me on 16th street, I pull in and they tell me the valet is full and I have to park across the street, another valet has parked a car in front of me and there were already 2 cars that pulled up behind me. Where was I going to go? I finally was able to get out and park across the street, and when I walked over I saw about 3 other cars going trough the same ordeal. Here is a tip - Put a sign out saying Lot Full. It's not brain surgery, its Valet parking.

I got in and joined our table of about 20. We had one server for our table, he was flustered and had a really bad attitude. He seemed to be only serving half of our table. It took him 25 minutes to make his way over to us and take our order.. Well partially, he took my order an then ignored everyone sitting next to me. He actually ignored Nathan for about half an hour.. At one point he turned to some one and said ""You'll have to wait because everyone is yelling at me at once"" Sorry buddy, maybe you should have more than one person serving us if you can't handle it. Yes my food is getting cold and no you still haven't brought me that fork I asked for 10 minutes ago. Better yet why don't you take it out on the customers here. What an ass.  

In addition to the service, they ran a charge for $348.00 on my card. It didn't actually post as a charge because they caught it, but it took away from my available credit in my checking account for about 6 days. 

I will go back, because the food is decent and the décor and ambiance are great. I'll just make sure to park across the street and get a different server.",2010-04-06 17:56:15

- Upon parking our vehicle, a young man service rep walked toward our vehicle with clip board in hand ready for a work order.
- Upon presenting the other location's documented list of services and discounts, Dave accepted to match the pricing AND give an  additional discount for one of the filters.
- Order is written up, Salena enters the data and new customer info and within 10 minutes we're set. We wait.
- Service time approximately 2.5 hours average for the work required.

I had to leave to return to work while Ness waited for her car. She brought home the completed work order and receipt- for me to discover they applied yet another discount.

- Want their customer to return
- Want to retain their clientele

It's a tiny, dingy stripmall place with a drink fountain on one side, couple of bench seats, couple of tables, and a counter up the back. They've got the usual huge menu - all sorts of chicken, pork and beef dishes. Doesn't sound like much, but it gets four stars based on the following. It's excellent value, it's fresh, tasty and filling food, and you don't wait more than five minutes for it to be prepared. As we all know, regular Chinese take-away isn't terribly spectacular at the best of times, but this place has bowls, combos and dinner specials for extremely reasonable prices, and you get a LOT of food. Today, for example, I got the lunch combo for take-out. Were I to have stayed, it would have been unlimited soda refills (of course). The meal included the mongolian chicken, rice fried in soy sauce, an eggroll, two small containers of sauce, a fortune cookie, two sachets of soy sauce, fork, napkins and they even threw piece of cardboard at the bottom of the take-out bag so the whole shebang wouldn't tilt and spill while being carried.

Big deal, you say? It was $5.75. Yeah, it IS a big deal to me. The rice was piping hot and fresh out of the wok, the rest of the meal was delicious, I've been several times and I haven't gotten food poisoning (UNLIKE several Mexican crapholes scattered around town), and you're stuffed for under six bucks.

We need a place like this in Toronto. Afternoon tea is typically a snotty, pretentious experience - which, I mean, I enjoy sometimes, there's a time and place for that - but there are no down-to-earth tea places that serve great, homemade food, like the Gryphon d'Or.

There's a nice selection of teas, and this place is run by the nicest people.

The highlight for me is the food. I LOVE the food. And there is a lot of it! I left stuffed, and I am a very big eater. 

The scones were deliciously buttery, and served with house made, delicious gourmet jams, which is the way it should be done (I'm side-eyeing you, Le Roselys, with your poor-tasting, jarred jams!). The best part by FAR is their exquisite caramel sauce. My god, I daydream about that caramel sauce more than I'd care to admit. Unlike every other caramel I've ever tasted, it's not too sweet. It's buttery and unctuous and just so, so good. I mean, the fact that they thought of serving caramel sauce with scones is just genius. 

Their sandwiches are generously served - some in cute cut-out shapes, really nicely presented.

The desserts are also worth raving about. Everything's homemade and they clearly use the best ingredients. I loved the tart, the cookie, the cake...it's the perfect end to tea there.

In March 2007 I had the privilege to see back to back shows of one of my favorite bands at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. It is state of the art and has a great sound system. When the shows started you felt the energy of the crowd and it has a great setting (inside one of the best hotel casinos on the strip), so I feel that you can not go wrong with this arena when seeing  a show in Sin City.",2008-06-14 12:04:16

When I was a kid and we'd come to town on vacation (and I had a huge crush on Thunder Dan), we'd always go to the downtown location.  Now that I live in the West Valley and Majerle's is a 5 minute drive...I'm there often!

As mentioned in a few other reviews, the Gorilla Wings live up to their name! They're huge in size and in flavor.  The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer is freakin' phenomenal as well! You can get any of their sauces on the shrimp, so you can try something different each time.  Their fries are awesome, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  

As for entrees, they have a killer Ruben sandwich and their pastas are really good as well.  

A full bar and wall to wall tv's makes this a great place to catch a game any night of the week.

Great friendly service and delicious Korean and Hawaiian food that just screams out home-cooking. They provide boiled peanuts in the beginning on top of the regular banchan! There's also barley tea at times. 

This place is pretty nostalgic for me. It popped my soon dubu cherry and I've been a fan of the dish ever since I tried it here! The owner is super friendly and unique with his Hawaiian-style hospitality. I haven't seen the son around recently but he used to work there and would pimp out my mul naengmyun with greens and spices! Good 'ol days.

Lately I've been going there for the mul naengmyun. My boyfriend loves the jjajangmyun there. They expanded as well, taking over the Hawaiian souvenier store next door. Some of the tables have become a cafeteria style where you may end up sitting next to strangers. I think it's kind of cute and nostalgic. 

Island style is definitely a local favorite, having been here for so long and providing consistently awesome service and delicious food.

I had a college reunion with my girlfriends (and their spouses) -- and we all decided to stay at Trump for the wknd. There was a good deal of only $124 per night (does not include resort fees). 

Complimentary valet parking - prompt service, efficient, we can drop off our car and pick up our car smoothly. Just pay them some tip. :) I don't believe the hotel offers self-parking, since we weren't able to find the lot.

FREE wi-fi comes with the stay, since you are paying for the resort fee. You can log in multiple devices to the wi-fi, such as laptop and phone (or tablets). 

Upon entering the hotel, there was a long line to check-in. However, a lady hostess would walk up to you to offer you some Trump bottled water. It made the line less daunting, since they seem so busy on Friday afternoon. When we checked-in, we requested a higher floor, and they were nice enough to accommodate. We got the 35th floor! :) I think the highest floor is 56 or something in the 50s.

Rooms were nice and spacious; no complaints there. I went to check out the pool downstairs too, and it was a huge rectangle. Nice night-time views of Encore from a distance. and good lighting too if you want to go at dusk. The pool water is heated as well; so even thought it was winter -- you can still swim or dip your feet. I chose the latter.

Nice cushions / seating in the pool area too. There's a gym (free to use w/ resort fee), but I didn't get to use it. I can see how this hotel would qualify as a 5-star hotel. It definitely had many ""kids"" at the hotel this past wknd; so Trump is not necessarily adult-only. Maybe the prices were just so affordable this wknd, so we had many families staying here.

Overall, we had a good stay w/ the Trump Hotel and wouldn't mind coming back in the future if the room rates are reasonable. :) It's a easy breezy walk from the strip.

We loved the ""courtesy shuttle"" they offered, where it drops you off at either Wynn or Caesars Palace. So convenient, especially when we wanted to go to Caesars for the buffet and the Celine concert! :) The shuttle leaves every 15-20 min to these 2 destinations. They also pick-up from those hotels and drop you back off at Trump.",2014-01-23 03:10:35

The servers do a great job at packing in heaping paddle-fulls of gelato into the tub.  And you can mix up to four flavours in a tub.  Be sure to ask for a few samples before you decide on your mix.

Personal favourite is the Limoncello (lemon liqueur).  MMMm!

It's right next to a community pool and soccer field so it can get quite busy on a hot summer evening.  I've found that there's usually no line-up when I'm in there on the way to a dinner party (6 p.m. ish -  regular dinner time for the locals).

This restaurant in particular was at the top of my radar because of all the five star ratings.  Located in Chinatown, where quality and sanitation can be - you know - ''sketch'', I was even more excited to find a diamond in the rough.

The restaurant is very clean.  This is true even when they are busy with hoards of diners, many of whom have to line up outside for at least 10 minutes. This resonated well with my germaphobic soul.

My bf got the original broth and I got the spicy-sour peppered broth. Both were very flavourful, though I preferred the original, which felt lighter to boot. You can up the ante in flavour with some additional sauces on the side, though the broths are completely fine without them.  Also, I wouldn't say the 11 free ingredients were exciting additions and I honestly wished it was possible to get free refills of meat.  However, the free refills of noodles was differently the gimmick for me.  They only have medium-thick round rice noodles, which are not my preference and they softened too quickly for my liking, but if you're a hungry hippo, you're just damn happy to get more noodles for zero cost!

Overall, we like the free noodle refills, affordable pricing, and level of sanitation. That's saying a lot because my bf usually reels at Chinese noodle soups. Will we be coming back? Yes.

We generally don't patronize restaurants that require us to go through a line to order and receive food then serve our own drinks and get our utensils. Increasing the minimum wage increases self serve restaurants.  If we had been by ourselves we would have moved on but we were with another couple who wanted to try it. 
The people ""on the line"" were friendly and helpful.  When paying, I was offered a tip option. No table service was offered but how do you walk away from a minimum tip. I probably would have if I had realized it would take ten minutes to get my beer served and when I received it that it would have a head taking up 1/4 of the $6 plastic cup.  
The food varied in quality. The beef brisket was great and it is now available sliced. I enjoyed it.  My wife did not enjoy the dry chicken. I liked the sauce choices. The potato salad was ok according to my wife. The cole slaw was bland..,certainly unexceptional. The beans were uninteresting: spice or sweet sauce or something would have been nice. The muffins were definitely a waste of space.  Our friends had sandwiches which had minimal meat on maximum buns.

I have been before, but only for drinks a couple times, and a quick brunch another. This was my first visit for dinner. 

First off, can we talk about decor? I love the look and fee of the inside. Very '50s done tastefully. It's like a classy throwback. They've really done a great job with the aesthetics. 

My group started with the cheese curds. WOW. They are light and fluffy, perfectly cheesy, and the ranch dipping sauce that accompanied them was flavorful and robust as far as ranch dressings go. It was not squeeze from a bottle ranch, for sure.  

For my meal I ordered the salmon. I love salmon. It came with a side of seasonal veggies (green beans) and crispy smashed potatoes. When the plate arrived it was beautiful! The first few bites of the salmon were very good. The dill creme sauce that it was paired with was perfect. HOWEVER, as I got to the interior of the salmon filet, I realized it had been very under cooked. Now I get it that some people enjoy their various fishes rare. Tuna I myself enjoy quite rare. But this to me was just strange. In all my years of salmon eating, I've never been specifically asked how I wanted my salmon cooked, it has always just come out cooked completely. I don't feel like I should have needed to specify that I wanted my salmon fully cooked. It was really disappointing. I ended up not eating the majority of it. The veggies and potatoes were very good, though. I did finish those.

THE MOST ANNOYING thing of this particular restaurant is that they have a Lunch SPECIALS MENU but never say anything and don't tell you about it. They keep it hidden and you have to ask for it every time and when you do they seem upset you asked. It's as if they make commission on lunch sales or something. It make me feel like they would rather have you pay full price for your meal.

We had an All American Burger, Beer & Brat (I think that's what it was called) and Crispy Chickpeas. Everything was pretty good, the only complaint that I'd make if anything was the bread for the brat was dry, flavorless and fell apart, otherwise it was good. My hubs says they need more TVs since we don't really have an organic meats eatery sports bar. We have something back in San Diego called Bareback Grill that's a sports bar/organic meats restaurant that this place reminds me of, miss it!

We enjoyed our visit, laid back atmosphere, organic meats, friendly staff-- def a repeat visit in the future. Hopefully they have beer next time ;)",2013-08-23 21:46:23

We sat right next to the fireplace and if it had been light out, I think our view would've been great too.  There are old paintings all around and it just has that ""old timey"" feel.

The main issue I have is the pricing and the food. It's not trying to be cutting edge or appeal to my foodie taste buds. The food was fine but I wouldn't go without a coupon of some kind.

I appreciated the vegetable crudité and the fresh bread. I ordered the caprese salad.  I think it could've been dressed with something to add more flavor but the mozzarella was fresh.  I also had eggplant parmesan appetizer - cheesy and a nice fried coating. Nothing extraordinary but it was what I expected it to be.  I will say that the baked Alaska we had for dessert was tasty, especially with a little ice cream on top.

Fran's is best known for their breakfast and diner type food items, though there is nothing spectacular. 

Fran's Fish & Chips - Poorly executed. It was thin and tough to eat. It seemed over deep-fried as the fish appeared dark brown, more than what it should look like - golden brown. Coleslaw wasn't any better.

Fran's Philly Beef Sandwich - Cooked medium rare. This was a decent sandwich, but I had better.

Fran's Onion Soup - Melted cheese, large  garlic croutons, beefy broth and sweet onion. It was a nice starter on a cold night. Not bad, not great.

ok, I said it. I actually got REALLY lucky finding her/this salon. I moved to Vegas about 1.5 years ago and was having trouble finding a stylist who understood what I was looking for and was consistently leaving salons unsatisfied with my cut (even brought me to tears once!). So...I found the salon that Jenna used to work at (which I won't name!) and looked at their website and decided I would pick the stylist who's personal style was closest to mine...and thus I found Jenna. When I went in for my appointment she gave me EXACTLY what I asked for PLUS I got bangs for the first time as an adult! She gave me her card before I left and advised me that bang trims were free. So, about 3 weeks later I was ready for a trim and called the salon. I was told that Jenna had left THREE WEEKS ago and they wouldn't tell me where she went. I was DESTROYED (I mean, not really, but I was really unhappy). Then I flipped over the card and realized she wrote her cell on the back...SCORE! Turns out Jenna actually left the salon the day after I had my appointment!  It was FATE (or something..)

So anywho, ever since then (it's been probably close to a year now, I think?) I've been going to Jenna at Tony Moreno for Cut, Color, & Brows. We've changed up my style a few times. Every single time she gives me EXACTLY what I've asked her for. I've NEVER had a stylist who could do that for me in the past. 

The salon is super clean, really cute, and I can't imagine even thinking about trying out a different salon. Not only is she a great stylist, but she gives RIDICULOUS scalp massages, and it's always fun to chat with her. 

Once I stopped by for a bang trim, and Jenna wasn't in so Tony shaped me up. Turned out perfect! I've never had a full cut done by him, but every client I've seen him do has been amazing as well!

PROS
Pig face dumplings! Juicy, crispy on the bottom and the table was a fan of the spicy kimchi.
The Kobe app - very tasty with the mushrooms, super buttery protein and cooked just right.
My friend liked her forbidden rice dish, she didn't get any protein with it just veggies, she esp liked the bok choy
I ordered the crispy duck, delish rice cake and pineapple puree as the sauce, veggies were just how I liked that all charred but still crunchy

CONS
I ordered a glass of the Tempranillo, server came back and gave me other options. 
Banana fritters were not really fritters, they were more donut holes/beignet style, it could have been cooked a little more, too gooey for me

My good friend Jamie took me here for my belated birthday dinner, during Restaurant Week. Even it being a ""special"" week, the service was just as good as a regular night. 

Our waiter was ""Bren"" (I believe) & he was very friendly & knew his ""Melting Pot"" speak. He was very comfortable in his job & wasn't rushed.

We had the Wisconsin cheese trio, I had the spinach salad, the Piedmont (for the main course; seasoned choice Angus sirloin, filet mignon, herb-crusted all natural chicken breast, Pacific white shrimp, and wild mushroom sacchettis) & for dessert, we got the chocolate turtle.

Everything was perfect! The accommodating fruit, vegetables, bread, protein, desserts were fresh. Bren wasn't overbearing at all. Our drink glasses stayed filled. The manager came to greet us & chatted with us a while.

I'd even go as far as to put Chima up there with the Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil locations that I've visited in Dallas and Orlando.

The dining experience starts off really well as the hostess opens the door for you and gives an inviting welcome.  The waiting area is very clean and if you're in a hurry to get a drink while you wait, there's a very nice bar at the top of the staircase for you.

There are two elements to the food here:  The first being the buffet which features an assortment of salads, veggies, beans, rice and soup.  The second element are the meat runners or ""gauchos"".  The gauchos go from table to table serving meats, poultry and fish.  The meats and poultry are served from skewers, you simply tell the gauchos your portion size and wellness preference and they'll cut the meat off the skewer for you.

My only suggestion for improvement at Chima, would be to add a few traditional Brazilian desserts to the dessert menu.  I would love to see Brazilian nut short bread or maybe Brigadeiro on the menu.

I recommend giving this place a try at least once.  It can be a little pricey (usually dinner for 2 will run around $200 if you get a bottle of wine), but the quality and variety of the food makes it worth the price.",2013-07-22 03:33:36

I'd heard about the Arcadia Farms Cafe in the museum, and thought this was the perfect opportunity to give it a try.

It was a quaint cafe -- not too big, not too small, and if it was a lovely fall or spring day, I could see myself really enjoying the outdoor patio.  Nevertheless, the floor to ceiling windows offered a lovely view of the unusual and quirky sculptures spotting the museum grounds. 

My mom and I were seated promptly, but it seemed to take a bit longer than usual before our waitress finally arrived to take our drink order.  After that it was a bit more of a wait before we received our simple water order and placed our meal order.  And then, again, we waited what seemed a bit too long for our simple sandwiches to arrive. It wasn't that big of a deal, since it gave me time to chat with my mom about the photography we just viewed.

I had the tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich and my mom (if I remember correctly) had their signature strawberry and chicken salad. I do remember distinctly my mom telling me she LOVED the vinaigrette, and my sandwich was quite delicious, although I have to say I could have done with a little less mozzarella -- it kind of overpowered the sandwich and left me feeling over-cheesed.

Despite it being a bit pricey for a lunch spot ($14 for a salad?!) and the slightly long wait, I had a nice experience at Arcadia Farms, and I would love to try some of their other dishes on my next visit. Plus, I would love to take advantage of their Sunday brunch and a mimosa or two with some girlfriend.",2010-07-25 18:06:19
pKCsVRgpDmkWullW-u-EbA,OJDOFhFlUdYLsKLeXL2ulg,DmdtVBgXWk285nAUWXfvvw,4,2,1,2,"I was really impressed with this hotel. I wasn't sure I'd be happy here because it has been described as being small and 'boutique' which can be code for other things, but it was great.  I stayed in the Hip room, which had an extremely comfy bed, a ton of storage, a kitchenette (complete with cutlery, dishes, a sink, coffee/tea maker, empty mini fridge and microwave), a small table with two chairs, lots of lighting via lamps, and a very clean bathroom with a shower.  The toiletries are from Philosophy which was a nice a surprise because their products are really gentle on most skin types, and  even though I hadn't finished all of mine each day, my products were restocked daily as if everyday was my first. Also there is free, fast wifi in each room. 

I didn't give this hotel 5 stars for a few reasons, but I'd still recommend staying here if you can over look some things: 

- the first round of room service is very early (9am)! I'm sorry but when I'm on vaca.....I find it hard to appreciate the sound of vacuums and door knocking that early. Be sure to put out your do not disturb sign if you're not up for the morning round. A second round will come back a few hours later. 

- no soundproof windows. Thankfully I was tired enough each night to fall asleep, but at times it was a challenge trying to sleep after 12:30pm because the street noise pours into the room....and I was on the 8th floor. The neighbourhood is live...what can I say.

- no in-hotel room service. Their website should remove the pics they have of a tray of food resting on a bed because unless you prep that stuff yourself, its not gonna happen. On the plus side, the hotel resto (ptghotel1) is attached to the building and guests get free continental breakfast each morning when you visit.",2014-06-20 02:10:53

I've searched Sharetea on Yelp and was happy to find out that you'd get 10% discount if you check in. Which made me want to come to Sharetea with my friends.

Sharetea menu was on the corner of their counter which she grabbed for us to look. Their menu, imo, is pretty small. They don't have my usual lychee or grape green tea - which has led me to try something new. They do have some cool items like oreo related items and ""crema"" category of some sort - even though I've seen oreo related drinks elsewhere too, but they're not that common. They also have personal customizations of level of ice and sugar. 

I ended up getting the Okinawa milk tea. I don't usually drink milk teas because I'm not sure if my body can take the milk (lactose intolerant but not really...). But my friend said the Okinawa was good so I got that. 

Server was good - he speaks Mandarin and English. All the workers here spoke Mandarin to one another. As he punched in our orders, you can see it on the screen facing you. He also made sure for us to check our orders before we paid for it. 

When I tried to redeem the 10% Yelp discount, I showed him about it and he said ""we don't take that here"". And I was confused but shrugged it off because it's not like I can force him to take off 10% our order... So yuuuup - disappointed about that.

The place itself is actually pretty bloody tiny - there wasn't alot of space to sit and chill. Even lining up seemed very tight because of the limited space.

We had 5 orders, so it took about 10-15 minutes for them to make it all. Server also then asked if we wanted a bag, which he provided and put all of our drinks in. He also packed the straws for us - which was nice because I went to takeout at Chatime before and you had to grab your own straws despite the fact that both these stores had the straws out by the bar. The fact that he made the effort to count 5 straws and place it in the bag for us made a difference in customer service for me. 

The Okinawa Milk Tea tasted better than I thought. The tea tasted like those Asian milk teas you get in combo sets but only iced and definitely a stronger taste in this one.

All in all, I might try here again. Maybe one of their fruit teas next time as I like sweeter stuff. But really wished they took the 10% discount with Yelp!",2016-04-30 02:53:26

The restaurant is family-friendly, located out in a stripmall and filled with massive tables and booths.   But the garrish decor is not the only reason why you'll note this is not a fancy restaurant.  Nor is the troth of peanuts at the entrance. 
The booth seats are deeply broken in, the chopsticks are cheap and will splinter, and the electric burner in the table won't heat evenly.  

Nevertheless, we enjoyed adding a dozen tasty meats, noodles, and veggies to our pot.  Be adventurous and try out some of the less familiar items.  Just be careful, it IS possible to create an unappetizing mess.  Be sure keep an eye on you additions as they take only a minute to cook through, especially the meats.   Remember that the sauces are for dipping. 

I would order these again: balls of fish (caution: they get very hot), taro, cabbage, black mushroom, lotus root, chinese lettuce, bean sprouts, tong hao cai, tofu skin, turnip, enoki, watercress, and wood ear.  

I would definitely not reorder bamboo shoot (its from a can), the corn cob (popular, but too starchy), frozen tofu, or whole shrimp (not worth the mess of shelling them at the table).  Many of the items come to you frozen: clumps of noodles, seafood, and some vegetables with ice on them. It would be nice if they even went to the trouble to defrost them first!  Anywhere else it would be scandalous to serve frozen food where it was meant to be fresh, but at Kintaro that seems to be the norm.  

Lastly, the soup-base was very disappointing.  The six options are made of the same powdered mix, which is also available in crystallized form at the sauce station. 

I recommend eating here at least once, just be sure to keep your expectations reasonably low.",2018-02-07 06:07:50

Had some friends in town and brought them through the Arts Factory to show them a good time hitting First Friday. 

I like to start at the southern part of First Friday near the Stratosphere and work my way up past the music stages, locals artists, beef jerky stands and organic food trucks through the chaos and sea of punks, hipsters, goths, emos, gangsters, hippies and granolas. (I'm a big people watcher!) 

I like to stop at Artifice for a Stella, then with my plastic cup in hand, head over to The Arts Factory to see what's new!

I love how the spaces are dynamic and changing every time that I visit for a First Friday! I have so much fun! I'm originally from Seattle and we have a 1st Thursday, ut its much more spread out (and rainy) in Seattle, so we always end up staying in the same building. 

I love exploring all the nooks and crannies and finding new artists posted up. I love walking though the Graffiti/Japanese inspired doll stores, checking out the new stencil art, wandering outside to listen to some live jams, and check out all the cool tents with always different artists hocking their wares. I really enjoy the diversity of people, and the uber-relaxed ability to drink on the go and have a good time in general. I'm never bored and almost never end up where I think I'm going to. 

I like how the other building involved are just a stone's throw away. The drink prices are about the same as a bar, and in some cases in teeny tiny plastic cups not worth the price. Some of the food is expensive so make sure to bring some cash with you for those spur of the moment purchases. 

I spent a lot of time dancing in the Captial Arts Center to the DJ spinning Electro, a lot of the night, donating to the donation Champagne (that gave me heartburn), but definitely had a blast as always, and my friends get a taster of non-strip Vegas. I almost try to sway my friends into coming the weekends of first Fridays just so I have more excuse to come out. 

I'm definitely going to bring more money with me next time and snag some of the dope original T-shirts on display, and some of those cool figurines in the Anime Shop. 

After I've had my art fill, I usually walk across the street to the Artifice and dance to the DJ's spinning late 90's hip hop, rap, feelgood and EDM to round out the night. 

Cheers!

The hostess was on the phone and did not acknowledge us, but Nicolette stopped by and noticed it, she offered to assist us and answered our questions. We were specifically looking for a ribeye, and they did not have any, so we left. We were looking for a place within walking distance of Hilton Garden Inn Downtown.
We did not find a good option for ribeye, but since Nicolette had mentioned a New York strip special they had, we decided to go back. 
(I quickly made a reservation through my phone and we were seated right away, earlier we had been told the main dining area was quite busy and we were encouraged to sit at the bar, but with the reservation we were able to sit at the dining area... In a very weird corner and they were not even busy)
As it turns out Nicolette was our server and she took really good care of us, from the brief interaction earlier we already knew she was going to be great.
Hubby had a Long Island Iced Tea that was served in a super skinny tall glass with of course big ice cubes, so the portion was very small (not so happy about that detail), but then our dinner arrived and it was amazing. Hubby had the flat iron steak and he enjoyed it very much, I had the New York strip special and it was delicious. I had asked Nicolette to request a very fatty cut and it was just what I was needing (I am doing pseudo keto diet and had a marathon to run the next day).
My steak came with loaded mashed potatoes (hubby enjoyed those), green beans, and some sort of squash, I asked for extra butter for the green beans and everything was delicious. 
Hubby had the pineapple upside down for dessert, it came with pineapple gelato, I had a microscopic sample of each and it was good, the gelato was very tasty without being overly sweet.
Over all a very good experience.",2018-01-15 03:47:11

Parking space is a little tight sometimes though I've never had trouble with finding parking space. If you want to avoid the possibility of it being hard to find seats, go earlier for lunch and dinner. 

Entering in, Izakaya Ju was a small restaurant with a limited amount of seats. Nevertheless, we were able to get seats without waiting.  Like the name states, this is an izakaya, where little servings of food are served. My favourite dishes were the Takoyaki balls, sashimi lunch and unagi don. Their prices are fair priced - takoyaki balls are $5, sashimi lunch was $17 (this was a very large plate compared to the rest). Other small selections are a few dollars. Have to warn you, the bill CAN add up, so have an idea of what you order! The sashimi was very fresh, I loved the salmon.

This is my first time in Vegas, and you enter the hotel through the casino (shocker) which smells like smoke and lots of it. Even the hallways smell very much like cigarette smoke. I was given a room on the 11th floor and when I returned late from the wedding, I heard a roaring applause as I opened my door. ""Odd,"" I thought, ""Applause when I open my door? Okay, whatever."" Then I heard it again after the door had long been shut; then it clicked, my room is located next to a meeting room apparently. Even though it was after 11pm, I had to put my earbuds in to avoid hearing cheering and clapping all night. Secondly, outlets are slim in my room. There isn't one by the nightstand or on it. I looked for one by my bed to plug in my laptop--no dice. So I had to plug in my laptop and phone at the table.

Okay now for the good. For the price I booked this hotel for, I was impressed by the accommodations. You need your room key to ride the elevators which is nice in a city such as Vegas. Even though the hallways smell like smoke, my room interestingly did not. My room was very modern and clean. The bathroom is beautiful and very clean. Can you tell I just love a clean hotel room?

If you're not covered in tattoos and piercings, you may have to be a little proactive in the beginning and initiate a conversation with a sales staff in order to get some help, but I've received eager help each time I asked for it.

I had a piercing done here and I'm happy to report it was a pleasant experience. I won a gift certificate at a Pride event one year which entitled me to one piercing worth up to $60 (what a sweet deal!). I didn't make an appointment but was able to get a female piercer right away, which was awesome. My piercing cost a little more than $60 but they processed this gift certificate without a problem and I just paid the difference. Super satisfied with the service.

The piercer herself was super friendly and made sure I was satisfied with the potential placement of the piercing, the jewelry and the equipment before we got started. She made me feel at ease and kept me from getting anxious over the long needle. Super satisfied with her as well.

Since then, I went back a couple of times to consult on my piercing and replacement jewelry and were really given good treatment. One time, the piercer on shift even took a look at my piercing to see about my concern for infection/rejection. When they didn't have the titanium barbell I was looking for, they gave me a bunch of alternate stores I could try.

The only con I see with piercings here is that they overcharge. I say if you are getting a complex piercing, it may be worth it to come here where you know there is clean, sterilized equipment and experienced staff. However, if you're getting any boring ol' piercing, you could probably save some money by going elsewhere.

Interior décor is modern rustic, and the employees are genuine and friendly. The bowl-building beauties behind the counter are happy to walk you through the menu or make a suggestion based on what you like. My pick is the original acai bowl, which is topped with bananas, strawberries, and honey. Delicious!

Only suggestion is to implement a loyalty card deal- pricing is pretty fair for the value, but I can see myself coming back pretty regularly and would love to be able to earn a discount of some sort.

EDIT: They now have a punch card! Five bowls gets you a freebie. Cards are at the register, you have to ask for them to sign. Now if they can just upgrade to the sturdier cardboard containers and clear bubble lids (like at a froyo joint), so that you don't have to cram your fruit toppings to take the order to go!

EDIT #2: They now offer poke bowls exclusively at this location. I was really disappointed with mine. For the price, it was less than half of what I receive elsewhere and lacked flavor.

We were here for a week and hoped this place was good enough to eat here twice. I had a Vegas Insider card with a special deal, 2 for 1 margaritas and a free appetizer with 2 entrees. Also had a gift certificate from restaurant.com but did not got a chance to use it during this visit.

At first I thought they made a mistake, but they indeed honored the card. We got the 2 for 1 margaritas and they knocked the price of an appetizer off of the bill. They were pushing a steak dinner special, maybe we should have spent a few more bucks for that. We decided on tacos instead. I had the steak tacos, my wife had the chicken tacos. Hers were greasy. Mine were dry. They weren't very good that day. Each taco dish also came with a small cup of beans and rice that were just ok.

They do give you free chips and 2 cups of salsa to start off but the mild salsa that was so mild we could barely taste it (looked kinda like balsamic vinegar) and the hot salsa was HOT but had the consistency of watered down ketchup. It was not salsa, it was hot sauce. We got a side of guacamole as our free appetizer. The guacamole was good and fresh, with chunks of avocado. So good we put it on our tacos.

The margaritas were good and strong. They were served in a 12 oz beer glass filled with ice. The Mariachi Band wasn't playing when we were here, but I hear they are just too loud, so we were just fine with the music playing through the sound system. Service was good.

The Waffle and crepes had great balance of toppings and the scoop size was a good portion for the waffle size, they definitely make sure you have enough ice cream to fill it up.

They also serve a mung bean ""soup"" to accompany the delicious fire water that we were about to eat. Sichuan peppercorns really numb you up. They probably lowkey use it when you're at the dentist probably. While that sensation is going on, the noodles were good, and so was he broth. I highly recommend the sweet savory dumplings. Whatever sauce they had I would get lost in the sauce real quick.  Overall I was dying and I felt like I could breathe fire.

In the interest of a totally honest review, I have never stepped foot in the store. But, my husband did stop by here last weekend and brought me back a pretty delicious bag of baked goods. 

The macarons were absolutely beautiful, first of all. (Which made me sad - usually the most beautiful macarons are the worst tasting or have terrible textures.) But these beautiful macarons didn't suck! It was a miracle! They were fresh, had perfect texture for a macaron, and came in some delicious flavors. They didn't have my favorite, rose, but I'd be really interested to try more.

I also had an almond croissant that was so flaky, flavorful and delicious that it promptly made me feel like I was cheating on my other favorite bakery. I would probably never go back to the other bakery for their (now sub-par) croissants, but unfortunately this place is only open on the weekends.",2016-06-13 23:13:38

The food compared to their sister shop Neko just isn't the same. When my boyfriend and I went for lunch there we were greeted with a bunch of no's. We asked for a bigger table and they said no because they were expecting a lunch rush (never came). We wanted to pay more for the dinner so we could order the salmon belly (no because they don't prepare it early) we had two pieces of sushi left and the busser was hesitant to take it because he wanted to check with the AYCE. Idk it's just never a good experience the last few times I've been there and I probably won't ever again. Sushi Neko is way better. We only came here since they were remodeling.

I was booked to fly out of Pittsburgh on the 29th on December. Giving me just enough time to pack in some sleep and errands before New Years. I'd been building up New Years for weeks now. (I do every year and I am always sorely disappointed). This year was different though. I just had a feeling.

So much for feelings.

When I arrived at the Pittsburgh airport - there was a crazy long line for the US Airways check-in, despite me arriving two hours ahead. The line just inched along. After nearly 40 minutes - I finally checked in. I rushed over to my gate to fly out to Las Vegas (eventually SF) Once at my gate - I was greeted with a line of about 40 angry people - waiting for news on their delayed Philadelphia flight. Everything was a mess.  Las Vegas passengers looked dazed as well. Those with questions were at the very end of the line, despite our flight leaving fairly soon. I noticed that I didn't have a seat number on my seat. I politely asked one of the airport staff walking by - what it meant. She looked at my boarding pass quickly - and shot back.

""Just sit down. It means you're on the plane. Don't worry. They'll call your name later on - and let you know where you're sitting.""

Ah - if only things went down like that. When they finally called to board everyone for the flight - I rushed into line. The woman checking passes - looked at mine and sent me back to my seat - saying i had to wait to get my seat assignment. I saw person and after person run up to the Las Vegas boarding area - and get on. I was beginning to get worried. What was going on?!

I noticed a handful of others around me - looking just as pained. Finally around last boarding call for my flight, me and the rest of my confused posse - hurriedly assembled a line in front of the check-in desk. Frantically skimming our boarding passes for any clues on what was happening. Just as we stood at attention - an announcement came across the speaker.

""The flight to Vegas is full. If you do not have a seat number,  we will not be able to accommodate you."" 

What?!

I wasn't on stand-by. I'd bought my ticket in advance. I had come to the airport early to check in. What was going on?!

I could hear expletives all around me. People were throwing jackets on the floor. We were all in the same miserable boat.

Apparently US Airways had overbooked the flight by 20 people. 20 people over the limit - right around New Years. Smart. Very smart. 20 people who had bought their tickets - expecting to be back to run businesses, see family, and get ready for the New Years - were just bumped off their flight without explanation (though round-trip tickets were given out as a consolation).

And so - my flight left without me - with my luggage on it.

The next flight they could offer up was two days later -  - the 31st - New Years eve. My heart sank. My fabulous New Years plan was going nowhere fast. I had no luggage. No sleep. And I was sick of smelling the stale smell of airport. I was just glad to have a flight back though - so reluctantly took my new boarding passes, called my brother to pick me up, and went to his place.

The day of the 31st - I woke up at 3am - to make sure I made my 7am flight. The airport was busy. Long lines - disarray. I made sure to check in early - and find my gate. Once there - I decided to err on the side of caution, make sure everything was set with my ticket. I found out  - once there - that someone had canceled my spot on my connecting flight. Great.

Luckily a helpful US Airways rep was able to salvage my spot, but was just short of being helpful enough - to let me know. She just instructed me to get on the plane - saying she would sort it out. Sitting on the plane with anxious leg twitches - I manged to find a flight attendant who was willing to check on my connecting flight status. Gruffly - she told me everything would be fine.

Once at Charlotte for my connecting flight - I checked in about my flight status back to SF. Turns out -  - my ticket hadn't been sorted out properly- and they needed to quickly find a new seat for me. The US Airways attendee managed to do so - but not without last moment panic.

We finally boarded.

Only to wait 2 1/2 hours on the plane due to plane issues.

There was no movie on board. You had to pay for water. Coffee. Tea. 

It was one of the longest  - most sleepless flight i have ever endured. We got into San Francisco over 2 1/2 hours late.

By the time I got back to San Francisco I was exhausted.

I tried to party it up on New Years - but bailed at 12:15 am. Dancing on 2 hours of sleep just isn't practical - after being in air for most of the day. My legs were buckling under me.

I blame you - US Airways for ruining my bullt up fabulous New Years plans.
Boooo

THey always try to get you a seat as quickly as they can and the staff is above friendly. 
We came here on Saturday night for a quick dinner.  We were seated very quickly.
We got a booth in a very loud room. There were a lot of teenagers there so the noise was unreal. We could not hear the waitress, we had to yell and so did she.
Our waitress was a sweet girl named Megan. She was very sorry about all the noise and said it should end soon. 
2 of the tables finally left but, the one that stayed had 7 of the loudest teens I have ever experianced in a Public place. 
Anyway,never mind all that.        The Food!!  So many choices to be had, We ended up by getting a mixed plate of stuffed shells and Cantonolis, It is called Quattro al Forno. 
Plus we had bread first with vinegar and Olive Oil. We were not too hungry this day, so it was really a lot of food. 

They have really great starters, the Calamari is fantastic.
We did not have dessert but, we saw some of the desserts being brought to other tables.  The Ice Cream Sundae is huge,all served in a giant Maritini glass. 

Everything is family style so keep that in mind when you order. There is a lot of food here. Great place to have a party or family get together.
 The staff works really hard here, I do not know how the can do it everyday. The noise is just over the top.

Another thing that is a little differant is you walk through the Kitchen to get to the dining area. You can even make reservations to get a table in the kitchen.

Compared to when I eat butter chicken at other Indian restaurants. Would I order from them again? Absolutely.. but I would have to be in the mood for a real heavy Indian meal. The naan was good, the chicken biryani was goon, the lamb shaash (I think that's what it's called).. Was really good it was in a green minty seasoning sauce, I enjoyed it a lot. Since I live closer to the Bombay Grill $10 dollar all you can eat lunch, can't go wrong.. So I guess I will stick with them and only order from here when I am in the mood for some 'Heavy Indian' food. The customer service was a 5 out of 5. Food 3 out of 5. I still enjoyed it though..

The menu was huge so we had a little trouble deciding.  We finally narrowed it down to:
-Steamed Soup Dumpling with Pork, Luffa and Scallop (Very beautiful to look at but not enough soup inside and the flavor was average)
-House Special Crispy Chicken (The bf liked this a lot; I thought it was a little bland)
-Beef Noodle Soup (The noodles were ok, the soup was good and the beef was fabulous)
-Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef (Wow! This was so good. We ordered it to take it to go but ended up devouring the whole thing half way through the meal. It was definitely the best thing we got).

Cuttlefish tentacles with salted spice- the tentacles are nicely fried and had great flavours

Honey pan fried short rib- quite delicious. The beef was very flavourful, albeit a tad too chewy.

Har gow- nicely executed with plump and juicy shrimp. The dumpling skin was delicate and moist. 

Deep fried taro dumpling- one of my dim sum staples. This version had an interesting filling.

Deep fried shrimp dumpling with salad dressing- once again, the shrimp was very plump and juicy.

Deep fried dough with rice noodle roll- refined with the addition of conpoy, but I thought the peanut dip was not nutty enough. 

Milk and papaya puff- lovely with a rich, luscious filing. The puff pastry itself was delicate with a nice and flaky texture. 

Crispy mango and taro roll- the sweet taro filling was wonderfully fragrant, punctuated by the addition of mango. This dessert was neither light nor healthy, but it was very tasty and satisfying.",2011-09-02 21:00:38

With the help of Yelp, I found Le Cartet.

The space is long and thin, going way, way back. There is lots of space if you are coming with a bigger group, but it was pretty busy. If they take reservations (I'm not sure, the three of us walked in) it would be a good idea to make some for a larger group. You walk through a small market on your way in where you could grab pre-packaged sandwiches, salads and the like if you're in a hurry

Part of what attracted us to this place was the really nice brunch options -  they're definitely unique. I really liked that you could order dishes that included a little bit of everything, perfect for someone like me who often has angst about what we're forgoing to order our meal. I had the Brunch Cartet, he had the Burnch Toscan and his mum had the Brunch de l'Atlantique. Everyone really enjoyed everything, though my scrambled eggs were cooked harder than I prefer and the croissant wasn't as flakey as you can sometimes get in Montreal, the variety made up for it. Go with an appetite, though, because all of these brunches are a lot of food!

The fresh Illy coffee was also tasty and especially appreciated because it was a chilly morning, and I liked that coffee and fresh squeezed juice were included with brunch (or a mimosa! but none of us partook) It was a little pricey for breakfast, but not too bad for brunch (around $17 each) I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch or breakfast in Old Montreal, which is an area that can be really hit and miss for food.",2012-12-14 16:13:48

All the dumplings are good, I like the pork in chili oil varietals but the savory broth versions are great as well, portions are very large. 
Entree highlights were cold Szechuan noodle, bone broth soup with noodle and pickled beef noodle. 
If it was more expensive it would be three stars as in the large scheme of Szechuan flavors it was mild and one dimensional. But value for the cost is good and the service team was kind and attentive. (Also msg usage was mild).",2017-09-01 20:51:25

If you've ever wondered how a stray dog is treated then El Furniture is the place to go. The waitresses are dressed in scantily clad clothing and within the first two minutes upon entering the restaurant you will notice that the restaurant's patrons are probably more pleasant to talk to than the waitresses.

Food -3/5: the food is decent/not great, but for $5 you cant expect too much. The burgers we ordered were obviously from Costco, as it had the same texture, look and taste. The mac and cheese was only good after adding about $5 worth of add-ons. Overall i would only go here again if I wanted to have a variety of mediocre foods.

Service - 2/5: waitresses were swearing all the time, made inappropriate comments and/or remarks and failed to fulfill simple requests (such as when asked for a glass of water). I also saw waitress sitting/eating/flirting with a patron for over 5 min where originally I thought she was his friend. I guess this is just the vibe or culture of the warehouse.

Price - 4/5: $5 for everything on the menu is good, but upon receiving the items it is obvious how they have come to the price. I think there was as much effort used to make the dishes as an 8 year old opening a can of Chef Boyardee and microwaving it. However, there are some select items on the menu that are actually worth the $5 and do not require add-ons to make them bearable.

So let me start with the parking.....you should really enter off of Scottsdale RD.....enter the garage entrance....make the first left and then look right for an empty spot. This area is the best place to park if your going to this venue because it is right near the elevator and escalators. Once you enter the mall and decide whether to take the escalator or the elevator up you will see the theater right away. You can either get you tickets via a fandango kiosk or walk up the customer service counters and buy your tickets directly. When you purchase your tickets you can select the seats you want on a touch screen right there in front of the customer service agent. You pay your $14.00 bucks and your in....however this is what you get: 

There is a restaurant/Bar setup (you have to pay)
There are the concession stands (you have to pay)
There is a very nice balcony to sit and wait on your movie I guess (it's free)
There is floor lighting right near the entrance to the theater....nice touch I guess
Every theater has RECLINING seats and plenty of legroom (included in the price)
The bathrooms....at least for the men.....are very nice. (they are free as well...LOL)
The screens are large however they don't come with DOLBY ATMOS like the CINE CAPRI theaters however the ambiance is pretty good all things considered.

Here is my real issue though....the seats share armrests.....which are wide and very nice.....but imagine sharing that with an irritating kid or irritating adult for that matter.  I can't see paying 14 bucks for that so I HIGHLY recommend selecting the seats next to the handicap because usually someone will be with them and they would have to select the seat next to them. Example being.....we had seats C-6 and C-7 which were part of a 4 seat section. There was a seat on each end of us for a handicap person so since we knew no one would be sitting there we chose these seats because again they would be for a companion.

The theater also has seating issues seems like on a regular basis.....in fact we got free passes to this theater because of a seating and a power surge issue within the mall my wife had when she went to see a movie here last week. (NOTE: The power outage issue happened 20 minutes into my wife's movie for theaters 6-14 but not 1-5 so I found that odd myself). All in all if you just want to spend 14 bucks because you are at the mall.....have nothing else to do.....and want to see a movie....then this is your place. I won't be returning unless there is more offered for my hard earned 14 bucks. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!


EDIT of this post: I forgot to add this little note because I know people are going to have issues with this review but here is one more important fact. The Scottsdale 101 Harkins in North Scottsdale offers the CINE CAPRI like I mentioned earlier but you can go to a Matinee for 8 bucks or less and the regular shows are only 11.50. More importantly if you are a member of the loyalty program you can get your a Drink and medium popcorn for $1.50 total. There are no reclining seats of course but you decide: 13 bucks for large screen experience.....popcorn....and a soda VS. 14 bucks with just reclining seats......hmmmmm.....seems to be a no-brainer to me.",2016-06-04 19:10:22

We were seated in the bar area last night and it was Happy Hour! The house margarita was incredibly delish & it was $4! The taquitos were also 1/2 off. We smiled a whole lot last night!!!

We started with one of their incredible guacamoles. We had sampled several on our last visit and decided to go with the jicama, pineapple, habanero & mint this time. Spicy & loaded with flavor. I laughed when my husband said he found it too sweet - honey, there is fresh pineapple in there - if it wasn't a little sweet, I'd be worried! It had enough heat to keep him happy & I noticed he cleaned the bowl. Their fresh made chips are stellar!

We ended up ordering 3 varieties of the taquitos - carnitas (red chili adobo braised pork), machaca (coffee & chili ancho braised beef brisket) and chancho (adobo braised wild boar). All were served with mini corn tortillas and 2 different sauces for you to assemble at the table. The best of those sauces was the honey-chili chipotle mojo that came with the carnitas. We both couldn't get enough of this delightful sauce & literally used it on everything - nothing short of SPECTACULAR!!! Our server told us if we call 2 days in advance we could get a bottle of it!

They're clearly a young team, so it's quite impressive what they've done here. They have such creativeness, such energy, such...lack of coordination. Still, I think it's very easy to see their positives first. 

- Unique desserts: There really aren't a lot of places that serve souffle, Baked Alaskas, or raindrop cakes. For those that don't know, raindrop cake (Raindrop Duet) is basically a big, clear jello blob which looks like a giant raindrop. You mix it with things like red bean and a sweet nutty powder. I thought it'd be bland, but even on its own, it was quite sweet. The flavour didn't blow my mind, but still very cool. Friends tried the raspberry and hazelnut cupcakes and the Baked Alaska with Bailey's ice cream. They also had good things to say. 

- Fresh from the oven: If you're down for waiting 30-45 minutes, you can enjoy some of their baked desserts in their full fresh-baked glory. 

- Cute space: This place screams Instagram. From the bright colours, to the Parisienne pastry style display, to the lollipop centerpieces. It's not a big space but there are a good number of tables. I can see it filling up really quickly. 

With all these good things going for it though, the service just isn't at the right level. The people there were nice, but there seems to be lack of proper training. I know they're busy and possibly understaffed but some things are just really...really inefficient. For example: 

1) 15-20 minutes waiting at the door to get seated, though there is an empty table right next to us where customers just left. There's one person at the cash, one person behind the display, and one person taking orders. Nobody so much as looked at us. Finally, we wave a server down. 

2) Server says she'll clean the table for us but gets distracted about it and goes to take other orders and serve food for another 5-10 minutes.

3) We decide to just sit down because we're tired of standing around. 5-10 minutes later, she comes to finish the cleaning job and grab menus. 

4) So total about 30 minutes to sit down and get menus, even though there were free tables. We were informed of the souffle baking time but not of the Baked Alaska so when my friend ordered that, she ended up watching all of us finish our desserts before she got hers (about 40 minutes). 

So no, Sweet Notes Desserts is not quite there yet. They've got the passion, and I think they're trying, but they need a better game plan. However, if you like unique sweets and have LOTS of patience, then give them a try. Or don't go on a Saturday night as they can't seem to handle a full house yet.

I had Angel hair pasta with shrimp with a cup of New England clam chowder soup, my mom ordered the grilled catfish, and my sister got the seabass. They also had sides of fries,  spinach, and corn (see pictures). We were also served some bread at beginning of our meal.

None of these dishes quite stood out. Clam chowder was yummy and not overly salty - just how I like it. My pasta dish and my mom's catfish were just A-Ok.. but the seabass was the biggest let down.  Lacked flavor and had a very tough texture.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Check the weekly flyer online (google Shopper's Drug Mart flyer) and pick up all the cheap food you can. It's a gold rush. Well, more likely it's a soup rush. But seriously, Chunky soup for $1?! Dr Oetker pizza's for $3.99?!

Ordered the Frenchy Flock salad. A bunch of mixed greens, lentils, roasted cauliflower, yummy onions, an egg and a whole bunch of other goodies.

The Carpaccio was served traditional with shaved parmesan and topped with Arugula and balsamic vinegar, perfect! The pasta dish was served with nice sized shrimp, pasta and a spicy cream sauce that was plate licking good. The dish has heat, but it was the kind that made you keep going back for more and more. 
Only downside is that it would have been nice to eat on their patio, however there was a live band playing inside the park and the music was so loud, you would have not been able to hear yourself talk.

For our entrees; my hubby got the rubin's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & I got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello, asparagus, potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce. Hubs loved his sandwich & salad, everything tasted extremely fresh. I also loved my fish & every single side, I cleaned my plate which means I was hungry & it was delicious! Even though I was stuffed, I had to get dessert. I got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go. We dug in later that night & it was pretty good, big enough for 2-3 people.

I find it to be a good spot if you are just with one other person or are out with a group. The outside patio is my favorite place to lounge with a drink. This past Saturday night when we were there with friends, the fireplace was on which gave a cozy vibe as we relaxed on the oversize beds with our drinks. I have never had a problem going to the inside bar and getting drinks...in fact, service has always been quick for me and the bartenders are really friendly. Rum and cokes cost about $9 and beers are $6. So if you are out for a night of drinking, you can expect to drop a pretty penny. If you arrive before 10 pm (I think), there is no cover. Red Bar isn't a place I could go every weekend, but every once in a while it's a nice destination.

My one negative about Red Bar is that the bathrooms are outside the lounge in the hotel. If you have to go to the bathroom, you need to get a hand stamp so you can get back in. Normally this is something I could probably overlook, but this past Saturday, we arrived before anyone was even checking IDs at the door, so we walked right in. I opened a tab at the bar and was required to leave my ID with my debit card. When I tried to leave to go to the bathroom and asked for a handstamp, I was told I had to show them my ID. I explained I arrived before they started IDing at the door and that my license was currently at the bar with my tab. They wouldn't give me a hand stamp!!!! So I was stuck not going to the bathroom the whole evening. It didn't ruin my evening but left a slightly bad taste in my mouth.

Despite that, I'll go back to Red Bar. You can't beat the upscale relaxed atmosphere and the people watching that abounds!",2008-10-14 17:12:06

It definitely has this `sneaky big` thing going on another Yelper had wrote.  One of those in the know bits of info that is certainly a make or break in choosing a place.  ``What? It has a patio? An upstairs patio? And it's got more space than the few tables I just see?`   In that way, this has some perks.

I have to give this place a solid 3.0  

It's clear after going that the meat dishes may not have been the right choice. Another reviewer seems to have  found the same problem. From all the reviews, the pastas and pizzas maybe  the lists I should have chosen from.  Oh, well.  If it's offered it should be fabulous but instead the Osso Bucco I had was slightly over cooked while the  red wine jus was passable but necessarily memorable.   

I always find it problematic when a restaurant has so much variety. I wonder how the chef can stay focused on making the best if the  best means pages and pages to cook from everyday.

That being said I would go here for several reasons. Groups! Epicure definitely caters to a large variety of people (except the gluten free folk).  Brunch.  If it serves brunch why not?  One of the biggest things this place has going for it is the vibe.  It's a very comfortable space.   If you can get a table past the bar, you'll have a better experience.

Actually, one of the reasons I had such a strange time was the crazy conversations going on around me. A couple was talking to no end about her pap smear.  The table behind was talking about attractiveness and acne.  All in all quite the conversation to enjoy over dinner.",2010-12-12 02:33:51

When I came in, I saw a handful of people sitting around with their laptops so when I ordered my cookie, I asked about if they had wi-fi. The guy behind the counter says ""Yah we do, sort of.  Well...Starbucks is right beside us so we can use their wi-fi through the wall!""  Awesome, thanks, I'll use it!

Sitting area is pretty comfy and laid-back. They sell what seems to be imported European goods so it was interesting to just browse through their shop.  

So I got their chocolate chip cookie, which is about the size of my palm and pretty thick.  First couple nibbles were really good, I like the crispy parts along the outside so I eat all of that first.  Then I start nibbling into the cookie and after a while, I'm getting kind of sick of it. There's nothing really wrong with it, but there is A LOT of chocolate chips (I know I know it's a chocolate chip cookie) but the batter inside still has that uncooked cookie dough mushy texture.

First up, I hit up P.A. &amp; Gargantua from some grill-cheese sandwiches. Gargantua is all about gourmet grill-cheese using local Quebec cheese, unique breads and adding some extra goodies to make an awesome sandwich. On this day, they were using cheddar from L'Ile-aux-Grues and a Mie au lait bread. I decided to try the bacon sandwich - which adds bacon, shallot confit and smoked butter.

Off the bat, the bread is grilled perfectly. Nice colour and crunch while keeping the interior a little soft to go with the melted cheese. The bacon, to my pleasant surprise, was actually thick-cut bacon and not overly crispy so it added a nice fattiness to the sandwich. The cheese was warm and melted all the way through but maintained some thickness to it so it wouldn't just fall out of the sandwich. Great richness came out of that cheddar. This wasn't some cheap Velvetta cheese here. The shallots and the smoked butter added a nice notes as well but thankfully didn't overpower the flavour of the cheese and the bacon.

It took us a little while to find it because there is no big lit up sign at the moment with the name of the restaurant but to make it easier for everyone, it's right by the dollar store. 

We arrived pretty late, at around 8:20pm. 2 tables were occupied but ready to leave. We ordered at the cashier. The lady was very helpful and answered all my questions. She also let us know that because they cook everything to order, it'll take about 10 minute for the food to be ready. We ordered only one plate which is a mix of half a chicken and half pound of meat (beef). It is served with a side of guacamole, pico, beans (cooked without lard), tortillas (corn and flour) and a sauce that goes with the food. It also is served with quite a bit of toppings such as charred jalapeños, charred green onion, pickled onions, and radishes. We also ordered 1 Jamaica which is less sweeter than the other Jamaicas that I've tried. 

The food came out fresh and it smelled great. The flour tortillas were pretty large and the corn were the regular small size. I made a chicken wrap for myself and then a beef wrap with all the toppings. Everything tasted delicious. The chicken was juicy and the meat was tender. 

The service was excellent too. The owners are warm and friendly and very welcoming. They shared with us that they run specials on Tuesdays and Thursday's.

What a unique name for a restaurant. This casual neighborhood restaurant offers all of the normal tavern type foods, like burgers, sandwiches and wings, but also some not so typical, like sirloin, pasta, and chicken parmesan.

Dora here. With their robust menu, Rusty Bucket has a little something for everyone. In case you're like us and not a huge fan of brunch, they also offer their regular menu on the weekends, one aspect we really appreciated! I really liked the cozy, casual vibes of this place, and no fretting over parking, either. There's a free parking garage practically right next door. Bonus! 

For our appetizer, we chose the Warm Cinnamon Sugar Donut Holes with a caramel dipping sauce. These donut holes were great, light and had great favor although not particularly sweet. I was not a fan of the dipping sauce, but if you rolled them around in a plate of sugar, the sweetness level was perfect. Dora here. Cinnamon heaven! The doughnut holes were light and airy, and I was a bit relieved that Ernie didn't care for the buttery warm sauce because that left more for me! lol. Oh. My. Yum! 

I chose the Breakfast Burrito from the Brunch menu. Scrambled eggs, sausage, peppers and onions, pepper jack and cheddar cheese wrapped in a tortilla then topped with ranchero sauce and sour cream and served with red skin breakfast potatoes. Now I have had breakfast burritos all over the world but I have to say this one was in the top three of the best I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage not spicy, the shell soft, and the ranchero sauce added just enough heat to finish off this dish. I would definitely order this burrito again.

Dora here. What can I say about the Codwich? Oh my word, y'all! The picture doesn't even do it justice. I could hardly get that giant chunk of cod in my mouth. lol. Huge. Meaty. Delicious! Oh yeah, I would order this again. My iced tea glass never ran dry, always a plus, and service was attentive and friendly. Rusty Bucket definitely made it on our repeat list!

Unfortunately, their lunch AYCE is a tad bit limited, but the price isn't too bad for what you get. 

Overall a pretty good experience. but not too likely I will return.

This salon is near my work so it was convenient to get there right after work.  I was slightly expecting it to be busy on a Monday afternoon at 5:00 pm. I also did not make an appointment and thought I would have a little bit of a wait. The parking lot only had 3 cars and when I walked in, there were only 3 customers being worked on.  I was promptly greeted and rushed to a chair for a pedicure after picking out my color.  The girl I had was nice but not overly chatty. I shared that I wanted art on my big toe and said I wanted flowers.

She worked well and fast and I greatly appreciated the massage chairs. When the time came for her to put flowers on my toes, she didn't ask what kind I wanted or what they should look like.  She drew 3 petal flowers on my toes and while they look ok, I wish I would have been able to pick a design.  I discovered that they have fake mannequin hands that have designs on them that I could have chosen from.

I was done by about 5:45 pm. I was charged $19 for the pedicure that included a sugar scrub and nail art. There was also a $2 charge for using a debit card, which I knew from reading the other Yelp reviews. I decided to pay $25 total and am pleased with the overall service and quality of the pedicure.

I will recommend this place to others as $25 is hard to beat!",2013-07-02 22:51:37

You have to wear closed toed shoes or they will rent you shoes and sell you a pair of socks. So dress accordingly. They give you a head sock to wear under tour helmet and a neck brace. Cars can get shut down remotely in the event people are too aggressive or reckless. The decor is pretty cool and staff professional and safety conscious. Definitely consider going again. Normal price is $25 for first race 20 after that. Military gets $5 Off first race. Found a Groupon for an even sweeter deal.,2017-08-21 03:14:10

As well as 3 slices of salmon sashimi and a kimchi appetizer (very generous portion size). My appetizer was free for doing a check-in on my Yelp app (value $2.50). 
Salmon Sashimi quality seemed fine. 

Really like how they automatically give the option of regular or low sodium soy sauce. Other places you have to ask for it. Good job.

My party of 3 ordered the Gyros Plate and the Gyros Sandwich. I still can't get over how cheap and delicious the food was! The Gyros Plate totaled to $7.49 and the Gyros Sandwich was only $3.69. Splitting the Gyros Plate is a fantastic idea since the portions are huge enough to feed two people. What I absolutely love about the place is the lamb was so soft and tender. The plate also came with the salad with a unique dressing--It was the first thing I gobbled down! Adding siracha gives the food an extra kick, but its not necessary to add since each bite is so savory! The hummus was A-OK, and I would suggest passing on that.

First off, the restaurant was packed, and there was a wait when we got there. It probably helps it's a sister restaurant to the upscale Tomaso's, right next door.

The crowd was mixed, but it was definitely dominated by older people-middle-aged and senior citizens. It was nice to see fans of Tomaso's be loyal and check out his newer eatery. There were also lots of families, and some young couples.

The dining experience didn't feel rushed at all, despite the bustling atmosphere. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, with tables throughout the rooms, making for an especially home-y feel.

We started with a huge bottle of Malbec wine ($30) that provided more than four glasses of the delicious red wine. For appetizers, we had vegetarian Pasta E Fagioli ($7), a brand new item that was chock full of white beans. It was a great meal starter, and it rocks it was meat-free.

Then we split a pizza with olives ($12). The pizzas are wood fired, just like at Pizzeria Bianco and Cibo. It wasn't burnt like Bianco's, but it wasn't as thin and doughy like Cibo's.  It was a generous portion with huge chunks of mozzarella, but I would have loved for the pizza to be a little less crispy.

For dessert, we had tiramisu ($5), one of the best tiramisus I've ever had. It was the perfect creamy consistency, and it melted in your mouth. I would say go to Tommy V's just for the tiramisu alone.

It makes sense why Tommy V's is so popular. The staff is excellent, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. It reminded me of a  big city restaurant, like one in New York and San Francisco.",2012-07-10 06:42:02

*Perfect* falafel every time - crispy outside and just the right density on the inside. The chef here is a master of the falafel - this is not a simple achievement. One bite and you will be spoiled. The *only* other falafel in town that holds a candle to these are Amena Bakery's - and even so, you would never take a date to Amena. The Hummus Factory is the Total Wine of Mediterranean, and Amena is a downtown liquor store with a much smaller menu and barred windows (not really, but you know what I mean?) I can't think of anything that Amena does that The Hummus Factory can't do better.

Crazy good fresh hot pitas. Like should accompany your last-meal-on-Earth good. If you're going to cheat on your no-carb diet, you might as well do it here with absolutely no regrets.

They've also concocted the *best* Greek salad dressing of all time. And I was never one to be like, ""Hmm, for lunch I'm feeling like a Greek salad..."" But now I totally am. This Greek salad changes everything (see my Yelp photo) and it's a once-a-week choice for me when I'm in town.

All three items I've mentioned (the falafel, pitas, and Greek salad) are best-in-class in Las Vegas, and will set you up for disappointment when you order these things anywhere else. It's happened to me several times in the last month on the East Coast. Even my favorite Mediterranean place in Atlanta (where I lived for 7 years) is no longer good to me.

First let me say that the drinks and the atmosphere are excellent. I love having a nice sit here and ordering one caesar too many at 11am ($5 Caesars?! I'M ALL IN). I bet this joint is bangin' in the summertime.  Also the scones. The scones are definitely worth devouring.

And now back to the food. Meh meh meh. My brunch was better (scrambled eggs with a really nice accompanying salad, and I'm feelin the ricotta-topped toast), but overall I'm not racing back for more. The fish & chips were lackluster, but I shoulda known not to order them when not two days earlier I was eating fish & chips fresh off the boat in Nova Scotia. Yuh, I'm a total fish snob, so there.

cgy0w9ulsfezxCmDH4tDOA,soc2J5OHH7V6JQ7t211Icg,swX3Vj3dQsz1YlCRmwNQEQ,2,3,4,0,"Took my parents here for heir last night's dinner in Arizona and wanted them to have a good time, well, i didn't think it was the right choice.

Upon arrival, the restaurant called me to confirm my reservation i made through Opentable.com, which was very nice, and I specifically asked to be seated at a table that's quiet and has less traffic going through. As soon as we entered the restaurant, the loud music and open bar gave us a bit of shock, had only I know the atmosphere was like this, we would have gone somewhere else... at 6:30pm, this place was packed, again, not as I expected. We were taken to a bit of inner area of the restaurant, it was far enough to avoid the bar crowd, still the loud live music could not be ignored. Overall the restaurant is very dark, not sure what they were trying to have for this kind of moment, can't be romantic or cozy, simply because the music is way too loud. Decor is just, let's say, interesting...

Our server was very nice, he offered us some water and warm bread immediately, and went us through the specials for the night. Both my parents liked the bread a lot so we asked for a second after placing our appetizer order. The bread came out very quickly, nice and warm outside, after splitting a piece, we found out it was ice cold inside, I'm not even joking, it was like ice in the middle, I was immediately turned down, WTF?? Did my bread just came out of the freezer and went through the microwave before arriving to my table?? It was very unpleasant... it's okay if you don't have them in-house made, but don't fake it like you did and try to serve it nice and warm when you failed to defrost the middle,  such a disappointment.

Our shrimp cocktail came right after placing the dinner order. Yes, they were some nice and big shrimps, but there were only four of them, yes, I paid $14 to have FOUR shrimps, I admitted they were tasty, but really? The entrees come out pretty fast and they were all very good, thank god the food was good. We had the Scallops, Chilean Sea Bass and the Lobster tail along with some steamed asparagus. All the dishes had some very nice presentations, and all very tasty, especially loved the scallops with the hint of almonds and citrus fruit (grapefruit and orange), the slightly bitter taste of the grapefruit was such a good complement to the rich scallops. 

We came out feeling very good about the food (minus the bread), but not so much about the restaurant itself. Like I said, had I know the atmosphere, I'd go to Ruth Chris. I can't really tell what kind of occasion would make me come back for more, it's so dark and so loud that it doesn't seem to fit for any, well, at least not for me...

Overall, entrees are a 4-star rating, definitely not the bread (maybe because it was free??). Decent service. Interesting crowds. And I do not like how dark it is, way too dark... so yeah, not a family gathering kind of place, no romantic cells, no classy, not trendy, upscale (?), huge selection of wine, oh right, expense accounts, anyone?",2012-08-25 06:51:29

In fact before coming to this post office my last experience with the postal service was tagging along with my mom as she ran errands when I was little. There really hasn't been a need for me to use a post office until I decided to de-clutter my life and sold all my old text books on Amazon. 

When I sold my first book I went to the post office and the worker there explained that books can ship under a special rate to keep prices down. Great! He walked me through all the options and I quickly became an old pro as I made a few bucks selling books I hadn't needed in years. 

Fast forward to only a couple months ago when I needed to send certified funds. I was on a ridiculously tight deadline (I don't exactly check my mail daily and assume everything can be done online). I was panicked trying to find a way to get a money order as well as to the post office before it closed. I then realized the post office handles money orders too.

I wish some of the pork belly options had a more strong flavor from the marination. It's very subtle and a stronger sense of flavor would be awesome. 

I can't wait to see what new options they'll be adding to their menu! A spicy squid option would be pretty dank... Whatever they choose to add, I'm sure it won't disappoint!

I'll keep the review brief in that this place could easily get 4 stars if they had a better recipe for their pancakes. There's a lot of toppings for the pancakes, everything's fresh there, but the pancakes themselves are fairly average. They're just a bit too spongy and they lack flavour. I would still tell anyone to try it out however, because other people clearly feel differently.
I wonder if their 'Norval By Night' restaurant they were doing on weekends is still open. I went a couple years ago, and it was very solid 4 stars and terrific value.

The location of the former Maru Korean BBQ restaurant, the site has been transformed into one with ample seating.  I arrived this Saturday morning around 10:30am expecting to wait since the parking lot was packed.  However, my friend was already seated, which was a good thing since we were both starving.  Our waitress, Nohemi, was very friendly and attentive.  As with the other Egg Works restaurants, their menu comes in newspaper format and you'll find the same crepes, omelets, pancakes, waffles, and scrambles.  I was craving pancakes, but also just wanted eggs and bacon, but that simple combo is not available, for some odd reason.  I ended up ordering the Blueberry and Cashew pancake short stack, which is three smaller pancakes (you can also get one huge pancake instead of the short stack), a side of turkey bacon (3 strips), and a side of 2 egg whites.  My friend got the huevos rancheros, which came with breakfast potatoes.  Our food came out in a timely manner considering the place was packed and it's brand new.  For a ""short stack,"" the pancakes were bigger than I expected them to be so I ended up eating only half of them.  Blueberry and cashews together sounded interesting, but I didn't love it; I would probably order a different kind the next time around.  I don't remember what the side order of eggs cost, but the turkey bacon was $3.50.  My meal came to about $14, which is more than I like to spend for what I had, so I don't think I'll be coming here too often.

It was a cold Wednesday night so the restaurant was quite empty but I recall it being packed on a Saturday night.

The menu looks handwritten and there was probably 10 specials between appetizers, pastas, and meat/fish, which provides nice variety in addition to the standard menu.  Our server was very accommodating (and also had a good sense of humour) and suggested modifications to the specials.  I liked that for the three pasta specials (I think they have three pasta specials every day) that there is a small size for $12 or a large size for $20, which allowed me to enjoy both a starter and small pasta.  I ordered the beet soup and gnocchi with tomato sauce.  I wouldn't order the soup again having found the flavour a bit bland (I also omitted the sour cream) but with some dipped bread, it satisfied my craving for a warm dish.  The gnocchi was unreal.

The server mentioned the specials when he first came, which was good, so we were able to order the specials right away, which is what we came for.

I ordered one beef and one shrimp taco plus a modelo beer. The tacos came pretty fast -- this should've been a warning sign (red lights flashing)! The tacos were cold, and it wasn't just because of the coleslaw. Even the beef on the beef taco was cold! Where did this beef come from? The shrimp, which was fried, wasn't exactly hot as well as it should be when freshly fried.

The portions were sad too. There was only one small piece of shrimp on the taco, which pretty much covers 1/3 the taco. Great, now I get to eat wrapper and veggies for the 2/3 of the taco. The same goes for the beef. I would much rather pay $3.50 for El Caballito's taco tuesday special where I know my money is going somewhere.

When the tacos came, the server asked if we wanted to order something else. We decided to split a Lamb Rogan Josh. Guess what? It came out so fast again! What's good is they split the dish for us into two plates and the portions divided evenly in two. But you can tell it's not freshly made as it came out in a matter of minutes from when we ordered.

Probably shouldn't have gone with plain wings. They were super crispy but seemed like a lot of skin, not much meat. They did give us 3 sauces each of ranch, bbq and hot which was generous. The favorite for me was the four cheese. The ricotta was really thick. Unfortunately the crust was just mediocre. Very floury and there were big pockets of air. I'd say for the price, this wasn't worth it. If it was a little cheaper I would probably eat this more regularly but I'll keep looking for a neighborhood pizza spot.",2017-10-07 17:56:44

The conference room they have is quite nice and holds up well to many other venues. There were issues with the wireless mic working properly for a bit at the beginning however. The food was probably the lowest point and they may wish to consider stepping up their options for groups like the one we had, depending on how serious they are to have corporate groups come in.

With that said, Rinx has nearly a dozen separate activities and they deserve credit for pulling that off. The bumper cars/whiffle-ball game was almost universally regarded as one of the favourites. I hadn't played laser tag in nearly two decades, but it was fun doing it again and the arena they had for it was up there with most I played in back in the day. Everyone loves bowling, and the games room is an easy crowd pleaser with: air hockey, fussball, pool etc...There's a few others as well, and about the only one that was a bit poor was the mini golf which felt like they designed it as a bit of an afterthought. There is also a roller rink, though it was not used for the event. 

The staff did their job, but could do better at smiling and showing better customer service than just the basic level.

There's a few things Rinx could improve upon, but they still deserve a lot of credit for offering so much, and surely something for everyone. It's worth checking out for sure.",2017-02-16 18:57:27

Poke Guys offer 3 options to pick your bowl: signature bowls with their recipes, poke (just the protein), and build you own bowl. You can choose salad, white rice, or brown rice for carbs. Regular size is good portion for one person and large can feed up to 2 people if they don't eat a lot.

And then the hummus arrived. I think I can safely say this was the worst hummus I've ever eaten. The presentation was fine but the taste... I think they had blended chickpeas and tahini and that was the extent of their preparation. It was essentially completely tasteless. It didn't have that garlicky, lemony bite that one expects out of a decent hummus. It had also been sprinkled with what looked like a spicy seasoning, but it too was devoid of taste.

After having some rough experiences at other Madison sushi spots, we've finally found our go to sushi restaurant. Muramoto delivers on atmosphere, style, and food. 

We started off with the calamari, which was to die for.  The dipping sauce was unlike any other sauce I've tasted.  We ordered the dragon roll and some salmon sashimi and we were not disappointed. We also ordered some hot honey ginger sake and it was super tastey. 

To finish our date night dinner, we ordered the Basil Creme Brulee which was strangely delicious. The custard was rich and creamy with a nice, earthy basil flavor. All I can say is, thank you Sushi Muramoto, you will see us again soon.",2018-08-20 21:24:41

I was really looking forward to a new Italian restaurant but truth be told, I wish I had saved my money. They were very very nice, but the food was honestly terrible and the server was having a rough day. 

Food...

 The salad dressing is bottled and not a very good brand unfortunately. No one finished their salad. The breadsticks tasted old, they weren't fresh, warm, or soft and the marinara served on the side was insanely sweet tasting. I  know you're suppose to add a bit of a sugar to your sauce to balance out the acid, but they way-overdid it. This is assuming the sauce is freshly-made, which is debatable. 

I made the poor decision of ordering the Chicken Parmesan. I ordered before we tasted the breadstick sauce and immediately regretted it. My dinner was so sweet I could not eat it. The chicken was cooked nicely though. I tried a taste of my husband's lasagna and that did not taste quite as sweet, I'm not sure why?

They did let me switch the dish to the Franchaise which was way better, but still not something I would order again. Again, the sauce just didn't taste homemade to me. They were nice and offered the Chicken Parm to us for free. I personally would not eat it, but my husband hasn't met a meal he didn't like so in full disclosure he took it home....

Service..

Our server was a young woman who was very kind though perhaps having an off-day. She forgot silverware several times, left drinks empty for long stretches, and then filled them with incorrect beverages. She brought the breadsticks over to us late ...just lots of little things.  I served for several years in college, and so as long as you're friendly and make a basic effort you'll get your 20%, but I am hoping this was not the norm for her. 

I will say prices are extremely reasonable...which is why I had hoped it would be better. 

Lastly just a note, I noticed two desserts on the menu were labeled imported which I thought was very strange. It does not sound tasty to eat Tiramisu that was made and transported from Italy, just a customers opinion. When it comes to dessert fresh is always the best :) 

While I am all for second chances, I think this has to be our last trip to Rizzos.",2015-11-30 15:05:49

So I have to say I'm not impressed here. Did I mention that they don't serve Tofu Pudding?! WHY!

Sesame Paste - ugh, it's worse than the packaged ones I buy from T&T. One look and you know it's not going to be good. Why? Because it's not black enough and it looks glossy. Meaning there's actually probably, most likely very little sesame in it. The sesame aroma is nowhere to be found and all I taste is paste. Not even sweetened paste. Just.. watery paste. If you've ever made sesame paste at home from scratch, you'll know that good black sesame paste dessert will look really black and the black sesame aroma should be strong. And I prefer my black sesame not completely grinded until the point where you can't taste the sesame.

Steamed egg with milk - This is one of my favourite desserts. It was decent. Just not sweet enough and not smooth enough.  
 
I wouldn't come back for desserts, I'll just make my own. But I will come back for one thing. The assorted herbal tea mixed with sweet herbal tea. Perfect after eating too much fried food. It's actually one of the most bitter ones I've had and I like that. It seems to work wonders for my sore throat every time. I also like the fact that they open late and they're cheaper than the other Chinese dessert places.",2016-01-27 16:19:07

Slices here range from $2.75 for a plain slice to about $4.50 for some of the fancier cuts.  You get your money's worth though.  The cuts are so large that a slice doesn't fit on a single paper plate--I received my huge slice laid across two overlapping plates.

chocolate hazelnut: who doesn't love a nutella-esque macaron?

salted caramel: my FAVORITE. Perfect balance between salty & sweet! I could probably eat 94574987549 of these things, but i'll share with the world, i guess.

Now, we did plan our trip during one of the busiest weekends of the year, Labor Day weekend. That said, I booked my schedule more than a month in advance on Chris' website. Since you are required to party at the Palms on the first night, I signed us up for Rain and Moon for Friday. I also selected Tryst for Saturday and XS for Sunday. I knew that these clubs were among the most popular but they were listed as options at the time and I received a confirmation shortly after submitting my request. 

The confirmation did state that the info might change but I didn't hear anything in the following days that would indicate that it had. One week before the trip, I received emails that said the lists for Tryst and XS had been canceled, and we were now on a list for Cathouse at the Luxor for both of those nights. I appreciated the back-up plan, but we already had our hearts set on the other clubs, not to mention dinner reservations at the Wynn for Saturday night since we thought it was where we were going to party later in the evening.

Since there was no way in hell I was going to let my girls down, I quickly contacted another friend who was going on the trip to explain the situation. She worked her own contacts and got us on VIP lists for Tryst and XS on the same nights we originally wanted. 

We did stick with our Friday night plans regardless and went to Rain since DJ Pauly D was spinning. It was a GREAT time.

So will I use the service again or recommend it to friends? Perhaps. Probably. On non-holiday weekends, it's probably a great service. But I'd definitely be wary that things may not work out, so I'd probably come up with my own back-up plan just in case.",2011-09-15 13:42:19

There was no wait since it was so early and my drink and food was prepared  immediately.  The barista there was very polite and smiling the entire time.  I was able to sit quietly and enjoy my drink and breakfast.  Absolutely no complaints and love the fact that it is conveniently located right across from the hotel.  I'd definitely stop by here again when staying in the area.,2012-07-12 03:18:24

We order drinks and a few appetizers, but we were surprised to find that many of their beers were not available. Apparently, they were installing a new walk-in cooler. So, I was served a beer in a can... no glass. The appetizers (fried pickles) finally came (and a frosty glass for my half gone beer) and I was bummed. They were pickle spears caked with a ton of fried batter. First, fried pickle spears are not very easy or convenient to share (which was my intention), so I ended up eating them all myself. Second, the copious amount of over-fried, hard batter tore my mouth up. I enjoy the fried pickle slices much more.

I didn't have dinner, so I will update my review when I return.

Think typical stadium style movie theater and you've got Movies at Franklin Square. They have all of the new releases & a good amount of theaters so you get plenty of options, from shows to showtimes. It can get pretty packed at times, especially on weekends when all the little kiddies come out of the woodwork to go watch a movie. I would say this is the only negative to this place, being the crowd can be your middle/high school kids that think they are super cool. But other than that, it's your normal movie going crowd.

I never order anything at a movie theater in the way of food or drink so I won't talk about those prices, but a ticket is freaking $9.50. Wow...it's getting really ridiculous to go to the movies nowadays. Once inside, the place is pretty clean, from the bathrooms to the theater itself. They do have stadium style as I said before, with some pretty comfortable seats with cup holders.

At the Movies at Franklin you can usually find a great seat without many people around you unless you hit up the popular movie on release weekend. After that though, the crowds slim out & you can have a peaceful movie experience. There's nothing too fancy here so don't expect anything thrilling when you walk through the doors. You will pay a hefty price to get in though so I suggest staying away from the concessions once inside.",2008-10-09 20:13:04

Typically my parents would go to Outback or Olive Garden but I asked if we could please switch it up & my mom told me to pick a place. I had received a postcard from Ocean Prime for $25 off & thought why not? It must have been meant to be because my mom got one too & said she was thinking about trying it out also. I called & made reservations for Saturday the 26th at 7pm. 

The place was packed when we arrived, literally every table was filled. The design was very sleek & modern, with neon blue lighting. We were seated at a table near the bar & Rebecca was our server, she was awesome! 

Fresh bread & butter were immediately brought out, yummy. We started off with the colossal shrimp cocktail & half order of oysters. My hubby & I shared the shrimp cocktail, 3 HUGE pieces of shrimp with dry ice underneath, very cool & very tasty. My parents shared the oysters & loved them. My dad is a scotch man so he ordered a couple johnnie walker's with club soda. I am a vodka girl so I decided to try the berries & bubbles cocktail. OMG was this cocktail delicious, the pieces of fruit & dry ice sent it over the top, I loved it so much I had 2. My hubby went with the tequila cocktail & thought it was just ok, I knew he should have stuck with his usual captain & coke. 

On to the entrees. My dad ordered the 7oz filet mignon (med-rare), my mom ordered the salt n pepper tuna (WELL DONE! WTF, WHO DOES THAT? I TOLD HER NOT TO BUT SHE INSISTED, UGH.), my hubby ordered the sea scallops & I ordered the twin lobster tails. For sides we all shared the sauteed wild mushrooms & jumbo asparagus with hollandaise. We all sampled each others entrees & everything was amazing, except my mom's tuna since she ruined it by ordering it well freakin done, but my lobster tails were the crowd favorite. Both side dishes were delicious as well. We were all so full but decided to get dessert since we were celebrating. We chose the chocolate peanut butter pie. Damn was it good, somehow we all managed to make room & had to keep ourselves from licking the plate clean. 

I brought that $25 off postcard I mentioned earlier & so did my mom. I thought they wouldn't except both at one table, but since we were paying with 2 cards they let us use 1 on each card, awesome! So with the promotional $50 off our total came to about $230 (not including tip). A tad overpriced, (which is why I only gave 4 stars) so I don't see us coming often, but we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner so for a special occasion it's worth the splurge!",2011-03-02 23:53:54

I knew I wanted something different so I opted for a number 5 from the desserts section: Avocado, coffee dark brick jelly, boba & combo jelly. The concept reminded me of Halo-Halo, a Filipino dessert. I stirred that ice around like a boss and slurped the yummy concoction. Mmm, so creamy and love that it didn't taste artificially sweet. There wasn't one sip where I didn't have any of the toppings cause the dessert drink is filled with what seemed like an endless amount of toppings. The boyfriend ordered Mango Dazzle with boba and his was yummy as well. But we were blown away by #5!

GOTHAM: sausage, pepperoni, salami, mozzarella, grana padano

THE FORAGER: mushrooms, spinach, rosemary, and whipped ricotta

Both were very delicious, and the crust was perfectly crunchy with a nice chewiness, and tons better than Secret(ly pathetic)Pizza across the street. Other offerings they will have-

MARGHERITA: tomato, basil, and mozzarella

NORTH BEACH: clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano

FARMSTEAD: country ham, crème fraiche, farm egg, olives

SICILIAN: pancetta, broccoli rabe, pepper flakes, and white anchovies

TRUFFLE: potato, truffle salami, béchamel, fresh thyme, truffles

BLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar

550- The ideal oven temperature for Chef McClain's pizzas, and 5:50pm....the start of Happy Hour!

All rooms are suites, there is a complimentary breakfast, free internet, a small work-out room, and several computers that are available to guests.

Located in downtown Scottsdale near the many clubs, the Hyatt House is a great place to be if you want to be close to the action.  It is far enough away to where the noise is minmal.

There are no elevators in the hotel, so guests with a lot of luggage may want a ground floor room.

When entering the hotel, the registration desk is tiny, and there is no signage whatsoever.  There were no employees at the front desk.  The front desk is ""attached"" to the bar area.  There were two employees at the bar area, and when asked where the front desk was, they pointed over a couple of feet.

The front desk staff was not professional, but they were efficient in checking me in.

I was given a room in the back of the hotel, which is laid out more like a motel.  There are several different buildings of three floors each.  Although it is possible to park in the front, it is probably easier to drive your car to your assigned building.

Upon entering, there is a living room to the left with a TV.  There is also a small desk with adequate working space.

There is a small kitchen with stove, refrigerator and dishwasher.  There is a small breakfast nook.

The bedroom is separated by French doors.  The bedroom is not that big as there is barely enough room to walk between the bed and dresser in order to get to the bathroom.

There is a large walk-in closet that is not enclosed.

The bathroom includes a shower and toilet.

 The breakfast, which is complimentary, included cheese crepes, ham, French toast and oatmeal as hot options.  There was also a variety of cereals, pastries, breads and bagels, yogurt and fruit.

Unfortunately, there were a couple of issues that arose.  First, there was a roach in the closet.  Second, there is a large gap between the front door and the threshold.  When the wind blows, there is a loud whistling sound that sounds like a train is approaching.

When I mentioned these issues to the day manager when checking out, she seemed to be aware of these problems but did not seemed too concerned.

I contacted Hyatt and was told that they were going to speak to the property management to work and resolve these issues.

We had 6 meats (4 beef, 2 pork) and each was fantastic, fresh and you can really tell that they use prime meat as they state. While the brisket was a top contender for me, the outside skirt steak was by far the most favorite of the table (we ordered a second serving).

Overall the food was fantastic, and I hope that they will add brown rice to their menu. The server (Bora) made the experience even better, as I have heard from friends that the service can be hit or miss. 

The atmosphere seemed to be very friendly and welcoming, Bora even took photos of our group for us. I understand that KBBQ is cooking at the table, but I wonder if there could be any improvement to the ventilation or filters to prevent a large amount of that smell transferring to your clothes?

I can imagine that the parking situation could be difficult during busy times.

Complete with deliciously buttered biscuits and fresh cut fries. The chicken was flavorful, crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  Definitely hits the fried chicken spot and is ironically sitting across a KFC.

Miso soup - this was the most amazing miso soup I've ever had.  Not too salty and lots of tofu.  Real natural taste.  Probably the way the Japanese intended.  

Har Gow and siu mai - Props to the chef because the presentation and imagery of this was just like real dim sum.  Pretty good and for the siu mai, I couldn't even tell it was vegetarian.  

Spicy eggplant bento box (with purple rice, salad, spring roll and soy nuggets) - they really did make eggplant the star of this box.  There was so much (at least 20-25 slices) and the flavour was great.  The only minor improvement I would ask for is for it to be more spicy.  The purple rice was delicious and had a nice crunchy texture, which was different but good and the salad was awesome. The vegetables were very fresh.  The soy nuggets and spring roll was average.

In summary:

Why come here:You want good Chinese food without msg and without asking your mom to cook for you.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I think this was one of the better Chinese meals eating out.  

Why you shouldn't come here: You want cheap, greasy Chinese food or Americanized Chinese food

Final verdict:  Check it out.  Worth a try even if you are not vegetarian.",2013-11-21 23:29:18

The second star is for the first lady I chatted with on the phone who was extremely polite, helpful, and informative as well as the guy at the sales counter who was very willing to share information about what's required to purchase and own a gun.

The missing three stars are due to the fact that when I called and asked about buying a package or multiple people to share, I was told the Family Package or Best Bang Package would be best for our party of 3 people to share. I printed out the ""Family package"" and took the paper with me where it clearly states, ""4 people max"" ( http://gunsandammogarage.com/family-package ) When we got there, however, the woman working the counter said that it's a 4 person MINIMUM. Now, this is exactly OPPOSITE of what it said on the paper in front of me AND on the website. So she ""went to ask her manager"" and supposedly, we could not share this package with only 3 people. This is absolutely unacceptable and false advertising. Then, even though I had printed out the coupon for $10 off, and it said ""one per person"" they would only let ONE of use it, and not the two of us who ended up shooting (Our third guest just ended up watching because it was too expensive without sharing a package.) 

I do have to agree with the other Yelper who said it's a tourist trap-- it really is. The price-to-duration of entertainment is extremely poor. It took us less than 10 minutes to blow through $300 ($150/package with 4 guns each, 8 guns total.) So, it's really not a good deal at all.

So I ended up ordering a main to share. I got the short rib stew dish. It was good, it was spicy and savory. The cornbread that came with it was just ok. I also tried our friends meals, both the tortelloni (which was a little too sweet and small for the price) and the pretzels with cheese fondue (pretty good stuff).

When I saw the Groupon a while back, I had to snatch it up!  This location is another example of a hidden gem in a strip mall.  I normally wouldn't expect to find food of this quality sharing a parking lot with a Native New Yorker, but then again that is starting to happen more often these days, and I kinda like it!

We came early one Friday night and were some of the first people there.  Instantly, we were greeted by the staff and sat at our table.  Our server was cool, very laid back and very knowledgeable.  A bottle of wine and the garlic butter and bread was a great way to get started reading the delicious menu descriptions and figuring out what we want.

After asking the server some questions and getting his thoughts I went with the pappardelle with scallops and mushrooms, my boyfriend got the gnocchi.  He was going to get the cannelloni special, but forgot when it came time to order.  Bummer.  Guess we'll just have to go back.

The instead of a salad to start we got the tomato soup with meatballs; it  was phenomenal!  The gnocchi was like perfect little clouds with a light tomato cream sauce and my pappardelle was delicious as well.  I was able to save a lot of it to eat for lunch the next day (well, minus the scallops, I didn't think those would reheat well, so we made sure to finish those at the restaurant).  

The only way to make this better is to go with more people so you can try more food.  I would have loved to get some calamari, a caprese salad, or even tiramisu and coffee, but we were just too stuffed.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but the freshness and quality is apparent.",2010-07-24 14:45:41

The storefront is slightly confusing, as the entrance is shared with a ramen restaurant. Saryo Cafe only got about 25% of the real estate, making the place very, very small. 

There isn't any room to sit inside, as there's only a few bar stools along the storefront window. You just grab your sweet-fix and go. 

The matcha soft serve was creamy but the matcha flavour was practically absent. The bright green colour of the ice cream also tells me that there is plenty of food colouring and not enough matcha. I also grabbed the Yuzu Tart--too pretty to pass. The tart has a Pâté Sucrée crust which largely takes away from the yuzu flavour.

How can you just pass by a place called 'Cafe Princess' without checking it out? I am rarely in Finch & Yonge area so when I was, I decided to drop by and see what this place was all about. Even before I walked in, I knew it was a korean coffee shop. First of all, only Koreans would come up with such name for a coffee shop. And second, it is located at Finch & Yonge.

It is located on 2nd floor so you have to go up a flight of stairs. Once I walked in, I was immediately over-whelmed by asian(korean)'ess. It was filled with asians (surprisingly good mix of Korean, Chinese...etc) everywhere with couches hidden around the corner. They were def going for the intimate, girly and relaxing concept and it worked somewhat...with a touch of awkwardness. It might be because everything is so out in the open and if you are sitting on the couch, you can def hear the conversation that's happening behind you.

Their menu is quite extensive for a coffee shop- it's probably because they are trying to serve everything just like every other korean restaurant. They have coffee, specialty drinks (latte, mocha), slush, bubbletea, waffles, slice cakes, ice cream, parfait as well as sandwiches. 

My friends and I decided to get the 'Princess Platter' which came with 2 choice of sliced cake with 2 scoops of icecream with fruits for $15.78. We got Strawberry Shortcake and Chocolate Mousse Cake with vanilla & greentea icecream. The platter is quite big so it's good for sharing 2~4 people if you are just here to share dessert. 

Initially I thought $15.78 was quite expensive for a sharing dessert platter, but if you think about desserts that are around $10 at other restaurants as well as the portion size of the Princess platter- I think it's worth it at the end. Keep in mind that their cakes are not made in-house, and are purchased from La Rocca (which might be a good thing in this case since you know it will be consistent).

Normally I am not really into sweet potatoes- even when there was that crazy phase of yam fries everywhere, I stayed loyal to french fries. But since I was at Cafe Princess, I had to try their famous Sweet Potato Latte. It's basically milk with grinded up sweet potato in a cup. 

It comes super hot so be careful when you drink it (I warned you)! I am glad I tried it but it was way too heavy for me and it felt like meal in a cup. If you've never tried it, I do recommend you give it at least one try.

I've been back couple more times after my first visit but basically always got the same Princess Platter (but with different choices of cake).

One thing I realized about this place after couple visit is that the overall atmosphere really varies from day to day. One day it'd be filled with young Korean couples...and another day it'd be filled with non-Korean highschool students...and another day it'd be filled with somewhat older crowd. Nontheless, I am not going to Cafe Princess for the crowd anyways but thought I would point that out.

Summary: I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this little korean coffee shop, but if you are in the area- drop by if interested in experiencing korean coffee shop (if you are lucky). Drinks are solid and cakes are decent- go for the experience, not amazing desserts and you will have yourself a good time.",2012-04-14 14:51:19

Every single person who worked here was amazing!  And you don't write tips on the credit card receipt?  Here is one place I actually felt like the employees were just going out of their way to be friendly and make you happy and they deserve all the tips anyone can give them.  One example is I made a comment to my husband that I was looking for malt vinegar.  Well five minutes later I am at my table and a girl comes by with packets of malt vinegar for me.  Um I didn't even know she or any employee heard me!  I certainly didn't ask them for it and I don't even remember seeing her hear me!  That is truly above and beyond service if you ask me.  I ate a California blt which was okay.  The California part is where they had guacamole on the sandwich.  Next time I would request plain avocado rather then guacamole.  I also had a side salad with blue cheese dressing and I ate a bite of what my husband had but unfortunately due to pregnant-brain I can't remember what that was.  I also had an order of four onion rings.  The onion rings were pretty good and giant!  One thing that unnerved me while I was here was almost every patron was heavy.

I ordered a side ""Classic Greek Salad"" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum!

I am personally a fan of this place. It's a nice oasis not far from the hustle and bustle of the main city and downtown area.

I think your enjoyment of the island depends heavily on how you intend to use it and your expectations going to it.

Is it a mile a minute excitement? I don't think so. You won't find shopping and rows of busy restaurants and bars here, trying to take advantage of all the surrounding real estate. But that's the point. It's serene, it's relaxing, there's plenty of areas where you can just take in some scenery and relax. In a city where this is becoming a genuine rarity, that's a big asset and the Island has it.

There are some restaurants and boat clubs open to the public, but they are further in between and don't get in the way of the natural beauty of the area.

There's also the residential neighborhood which there is nothing else like in the city.

Ferry costs are still low, and it's quite family friendly.

First I have to say that Matt (our waiter) was awesome. Attentive, nice, accommodating, and friendly. I say this because it is just about opposite of my experience everywhere else I go. I just assumed that it's normal for your waiter to be snarky and ignore their customers. He seems to prove that theory wrong. I'm usually cheap and give out only a 10-12% tip for the usual lack of service I receive, but Matt earned the full 20.

Awesome just doesn't come close to describing the meal. It started with the salsa and chips and kept going all the way through dessert. I know it's usually chips an salsa, but the real star there is the salsa, so you have to say it first. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla, which came dressed with a chipotle dipping sauce, the quesadilla was great by itself and extreme when complimented with the chipotle dip. Wife and I shared both the pernil (pork) and shirt rib barbacoa (beef) tacos, either way you choose it, it's a great dish. Although I did like the short rib tacos slightly better than the pork. The tacos come with sides of both rice and black beans. I've made black beans before, and they don't even compare. Like trying to compare a huffy bicycle to a Ducati motorcycle - they just don't. Our meal was followed up with a slice of cake covered with a mango and pineapple reduction. I will definitely be back sooner rather than later.

Expect to pay about $12 - $14 per plate after tax / tip, a few more if you order drinks, apps, and / or dessert.

If you've read any of my other reviews, you might just know that I'm driven by good food with a great value, and as such. You can find usually grab a deal on (choose one) $5for$10 on yelp / groupon, or $25off$35 from restaurant-com; yes I did use a deal for myself. While normally you can feel the glares of the wait staff whenever you pull out your coupon, Matt made us feel like it was no big thing and was happy to serve us!

I bought two tacos and a water for $8 I believe.  My issue with this place is:

a) I wanted a healthy vegetarian taco.  The tofu was deep fried.
b) The toppings were pretty slim.  
c) I finished both tacos in 2 minutes total.

No biggy, I got mine without. The onions were crisp, fresh red onions. I would have prefered sauteed onions on a steak but its no big deal. They did charge me a buck for the bannana peppers, even though I left the more expensive tomatoes of my hoagie.

I love the atmosphere and decor of the bar. Love the down tempo music. Even the outdoor patio looks awesome. 

The mojitos are still the best I've ever had. They've changed up their menu slightly. There are plenty of flavored mojitos to try, including blackberry and mango. They nixed the Ginger Lemon martini, though, so when I asked for a Ginger Lemon mojito (a made-to-order drink I had the last time I came here), I was happy that the bartender obliged. The server seemed a tad put-off by my request. I might have irked him a bit, but I had to try the Ginger Lemon mojito to see if it was as good as I remember. It was probably the last one I'll ever had... so it was a bittersweet moment for me. My 2nd mojito was the mango one. It was tasty, but I think I prefer the more traditional (less sweet) drinks. 

My HH pal and I ordered the two burgers for $5. They are 1/4 lb burgers and come about medium well. Mine was super salty but tasty. We also ordered a basket of their waffle fries. Damn good! Plus, with the complimentary chips and a trio of salsa, my friend and I both agreed: we felt super stuffed afterwards.

One of the servers handed us the menu and told us they had just opened and were delivering although they were located just around the corner.  Not sure if that service will continue, but it's a nice touch.

After getting past the name of this place, which I think should be reconsidered, i perused their menu. Simply put, their food choices rock.  They have burgers, sandwhiches, comfort food sides, and some awesome appetizers.  Even more impressive is their prices which are ridiculously inexpensinve.  In point of fact, I think they are a little to inexpensive. They'll likely have to go up a bit once they get their costs worked out.  

We had already prepared our slow cooker dinner at home, so we decided to use this as an opportunity to get their appetizers and sides.  I was not disappointed. Their Redneck Eggrolls were simply divine: I could have eaten that as my main dish. But, it was their black and Bleu house chips that really took the cake.  I have never had house chips anywhere-ever that were perfectly made and so crispy you could chew on them for a whole minute and still be crunching away when it was time swallow.  Wow.  I can not emphasize enough how good those chips were.  Amazing.

The only roll which was disappointing was the spicy salmon. I didn't like their style at all, it was a mash of salmon and spicy mayo, giving a very mushy texture. The sweet potato roll, the tuna roll, and the special roll were all fantastic though.

The restaraunt itself was a decent place to sit down. The service was mediocre, only time I saw the server was when I paid and when I ordered my food. I asked for spicy mayo and they gave me a really small amount which was a bit awkward.

Definitely making this my go to sushi spot from now on in Brampton.",2018-04-08 13:25:01

Great atmosphere, great eating, great service.  I got the fillet and it was excellent, lots of butter used to make sure of that.

Oddly, my friend also ordered the fillet and 15 minutes later mine came out, and a minute after that my friend got the manager instead of the fillet.  The manager explained that they ran out of fillets (they had also been out of chicken but we knew that pre-ordering).  They apologize, took a wine off the check, and blasted a prime rib out after about 3 minutes wait (sorry person who had that snagged from the heat lamps).  Nice service save.",2008-03-07 20:50:37

They don't make spicy salmon rolls and their sushi was falling apart--the rice wouldn't stick so the sushi would fall apart. We are avid sushi eaters btw! The main issue we had was asking them for a box because we had a few pieces left from our AYCE. I get that most places don't allow this for AYCE, but I thought I'd ask anyway and I asked one of the servers, who brought us a box, but upon taking it from him, another server RAN over and snatched it out of his hands in front of us and said, ""No, no, no--no boxes for AYCE."" I found this was not in good taste and the other server was clearly embarrassed and ultimately, it was horrible customer service on their part in that situation. They bargained an extra $5 from us to take a few pieces of sushi home, but they have forfeited potentially hundreds of dollars from us. from AYCE, because we are not coming back. 

P.S. I also ordered a green tea cheesecake and they got the order wrong and tried to make me reconsider my order so I can eat what they brought, which was a green tea mochi. But their green tea cheesecake was hard and I do not recommend anyway.",2018-09-08 23:01:49

It's a little hard to get to if you're not already in the area, however.  For all you TTC riders, I hope you will be able to board the 72 bus at Pape Station instead of finding the 72 bus stop around Harbourfront.  I was surprised at how far apart the bus stops were and how few people in that area could pinpoint the stop's location for me. 

Ambiance-wise, you will enjoy this place if you are used to the loud, casual pub scene. The tables are placed close to one another, so you're sure to hear your neighbour's conversation and thus have problems hearing your own. I actually like the loud pub scene while having a few drinks, but my company didn't like struggling to hear our conversation. 

Despite the positive Yelp reviews, I was sadly disappointed with the food.  Price-wise, I found the items to be on the more expensive side even though several Yelpers hailed the restaurant for its affordability. This opinion was mainly based on the fact that you have to pay separately for the sides, each of which cost anywhere between 5-7 dollars.  Also, the menus are handwritten on the walls, so I am sure the prices change depending on the market. 

We ordered the brisket, mac and cheese, and the sausage in a bun. The mac and cheese was a clear winner for us that night. It was creamy and had a deep, rich flavour.  On the other hand, the brisket was unbearably dry.  They serve the brisket with two slices of white bread and a side of onions, pickles and pepper, but the brisket's dryness was emphasized when sandwiched between these ingredients. Lastly, the sausage in a bun could have been a winner if the sausage wasn't so salty. You know the Costco hot dogs? It was saltier than those! 

Unfortunately, two hours after eating here, my company and I both got stomach aches. We didn't eat anything after leaving the restaurant, so we suspect that the restaurant did not prepare our food properly....

Overall, we will not be returning.  We will most likely opt to get our munchies fix at the nearby T&T Supermarket.",2017-11-10 13:24:48

Would recommend building your own pizza and don't be shy to tell them you want more of a certain topping.

I wasn't really sure what to expect but my expectations were far exceeded.  Our server helped explain how the ordering worked - pick your broth, pick your noodle option, and then pick your meat, seafood and vegetables. Once you place your order they will bring out some pickled cucumbers and tomato and some peanuts to snack on before your hot pot arrives.  Most people around opted for the shared pot in the center of the table with split broth, unfortunately my dining partner was allergic to fish so we opted to two separate pots.  There are many options in the sauce bar to make a customized dipping sauce.  Unbeknownst to me beforehand, you really don't drink the broth - it's similar to fondu, it's just a vessel to cook your meats and veggies inside.  The Shacha broth was nicer than the chicken broth but I'd like to try Szechuan next time.  I would say to skip the noodles, too filling.  The meats were very thinly sliced and slightly frozen, which is to be expected given the thinness of the slice.  The crab was good as well, the shrimp balls were just okay, and the pork balls I didn't particular like.  I would like to try the fish balls next time.  Bok choy and Chinese cabbage are a great filling addition, you can also get lettuce to make little wraps with the meats.

During dinner you can order as many items and as many times as you want, two things to remember you have a 2 hour time limit and there is a 10% charge per pound of waste. I will definitely be back to try the lunch portion since I found dinner a little too pricey for the amount of food I was actually able to consume, which wasn't much since after one plate that included noodles I was pretty full.",2017-03-24 23:14:23

After being unable to get reservations a few days prior a few times, the wife and I secured a table and embarked on a double date with some close friends.

Massive dinning rooms we filled with more large (8+) parties than I think I've ever seen in a establishment.

After being sat, our server immediately greeted us and opened our bottles of wine (BYOB!), explaining the restaurant concept and current fresh offerings as he went.  While the place was definitely buzzing, it wasn't too loud that a conversation couldn't be held.  As we were figuring out what we wanted to eat, one thing that resounded to me well was the sheer amount of contact the cooks, servers and owners had with their patrons (which completely explains my inclination that this is definitely a ""regulars"" place).

After placing our orders, we were greeted with fresh garlic bread (generic, but tasty) and our appetizers (calamari and banana peppers) came out quickly.  Both were well executed, albeit a bit standard as well.  This trend continued with our entrees...  crab tortellini, porchetta, etc.  all well executed, tasty, but ultimately just missing something (we'll call it that ""finishing touch"").

You should expect to wait with how popular they are but it's always well worth it. They treat each drink like a gourmet meal. Crafting it by hand right in front of you to see. I might mention that I'm sober while my friends are not so much. Yet still they've always taken care of me by coming up with tasty non alcoholic concoctions while my friends enjoy their wide variety of cocktails. Don't like your drink? I've never had an issue with anyone politely saying it wasn't our jam and have another made. They'll even help you decide if you tell them what your tastes are like. Never disappointed on a weekday as it's the perfect spot to unwind. I personally skip it on the weekends because it's hard to keep up a conversation but I always suggest it to anyone who asks for a decent place to check out for locals or friends from out of town.

Stopped in on Saturday looking for a dining room table.  They had a good selection of items (the lesser expensive ones are closer to the back).  Found a table that we liked that was on clearance, so the price was even better than we had expected.  They threw in an extra 10% off since it was a floor model.  The table + 4 chars were in stock, another 2 chairs would arrive later that week.  No problem.  I had asked to have what was in stock delivered on Sunday Morning (available) and I would pick up the 2 remaining chairs later in the week.

Then it all started to go down hill.
Our sales guy got roped into an issue with a customer who was told that an item was in stock but was not.  I'm not sure why our guy needed to be there since a manager was involved and there were lots of other sales people available.  Our guy just stood there...for 20 minutes.  Eventually they ""found"" that item.

It took another 20 minutes to get our paperwork sorted.  I had to remind him about the 10% off discount.  He radioed up front and told me all would be good.

We walk up front to finalize and pay.  The discount was not on the order.  Had to get a manager involved.  Then it was set for delivery on the 26th...no, it was supposed to be the 22nd.  Had to get a manger to override that.  Girl operating the register was completely confused over delivery some items next day, pick up remaining when they arrive.  Meanwhile, while the manager is busy overriding everything to get the delivery straightened out she lets out this hiccup/burp combination and then proceeds to say ""I need to stop drinking before work"".  Really!?  Once she gets the delivery info figured out she then proceeds to high-five everyone for a job well done...A job well done for something that was screwed up in the first place.  All was set for delivery in the afternoon of Sunday the 22nd.  Afternoon?  I was supposed to get a morning slot.  ""Must have just filled up, sorry."" (more on why this was a major issue later).  Fine, 12-6 delivery slot and they will call the night before with a 3 hour window.  I look at the receipt and it says for delivery 1 table, 3 chairs, not 4? and 3 for pickup.  I point this out to the cashier and she just shrugs.  I have to get the sales guy involved.  He says to ignore that.  I don't believe that.  I tell him to write the correct amount and sign the paperwork.  Done, 40 minutes of paperwork to buy a table and 6 chairs.  I am completely expecting only 3 chairs to be delivered.

Got the phone call that evening, delivery from 2-5 the next day.  Simple enough.

Get a phone call around 3:15pm.  Deliveries are running behind, it will be 6-6:30.  Fine, whatever.

Get another phone call at 5:40.  Still running behind, but will be to you no later than an hour from now.  I confirm, 6:40?, yes.  At this time I log into their handy delivery tracker and it shows the truck is on its way to Anthem making a series of deliveries.  Then several stops in Peoria, Sun City, Surprise, then me.  I was stop number 13 of 16.  They were only on #8.  All deliveries were supposed to be done by 6pm.

6:40pm, nothing, 7:00pm nothing, 7:15pm, nothing.  

I call, livid.  After listening to the ""Your estimated wait time is 1 minute"" message for nearly 10 minutes I get a hold of someone.  They tell me it could take until midnight.  MIDNIGHT!  That was not acceptable.  I told them I paid them to deliver between 12-6 the next day and they did not meet that commitment.  They did quickly refund me the delivery charge ($99), but I was still not happy.  I work the early shift. There was no way I was staying up to wait for these boneheads.  I was getting ready to head to sleep and had waited long enough.   They wanted to deliver on Monday...um...I'm at work!?  They also said that dispatch had left a message with me letting me know it would be later...No call or message...Lied to.  I was told that they sub contract deliveries with another company and they are the issue.  I didn't really care, I paid living spaces for delivery.  It's Living Spaces problem. 

So after much frustrating back and forth, they will be delivering the following Saturday morning.  I told them it needs to be first thing, otherwise I'm just going to cancel the order.  I was told it will be.  They're also supposed to bring the full order since the other chairs will be in stock.  We shall see.

Here's the kicker.  I'm woken out of my sleep at 9:45pm by my phone ringing.  ""We'll be there in 30-45 minutes for your delivery"".  W......T......F...... I told the guy not to bother.

If everything does arrive on Saturday morning and the $99 arrives back on my card, I might upgrade to two stars.  Maybe....

And, yes, I committed a Yelp sin...I didn't check reviews first.  No surprise that my issues seem to be common.",2014-06-23 19:45:17

Had my mind made up before we arrived that I was going to have the chicken and waffles.  When I read the description on the menu, I saw the waffles had rosemary in them.  Not a big fan of the flowery herb, so I asked if I could get the waffles without rosemary.  Was told it's in the batter, so no, but the waitress said when I douse them in syrup, I won't taste the rosemary.

So I took her word for it.  And she was wrong.  Not only did the taste of rosemary permeate the flavors of the waffle, but the waffle was extremely dry.  I think it was made out of corn meal.  Kinda like eating sand.  All gritty and dry and flowery.  It came on the plate in 4 sections.  I only ate one.  The chicken was ok, but nothing to brag about.  Would have been nice if they had a Nashville hot chicken option, but they don't.  One little bitty breast.  

The waitress came by several times, but never asked how I liked the waffles.  She later cleared the tables, including 3/4 of the uneaten waffle and again said nothing.  Maybe she was ashamed?  Or maybe just inept.  My guess is she works at an Apple store during the day and this is her second job, where she fine tunes her ineptness for her day job.

The other 2 dishes that came to the table included chicken, mashed and asparagus, as well as a chicken salad.  Both looked good and the girls each said they enjoyed their dinners.  Moves this review from 1 star to 2...",2018-01-16 10:09:38

Such a wonderful spot.  Love dining there.  The view, the wine list, the attentiveness, the renovations they've done so carefully, the ducks...

But am a little frustrated. I made sure to discuss my dietary issues with the owner and hostess as I entered and was thrilled when they proudly handed me a menu with gluten free options - yay!  I know they have a talented kitchen, but it just makes me feel better to know it's part of their training, their daily conversation with staff and kitchen.  

But after I ordered, the manager came out to the table saying ""don't know why the hostess gave you the gf menu, that's only for evening. We don't have a gluten free menu during the day...""   Well - I'm sorry, but I'm gluten free all day long.  

So they still have some work to do.  Particularly since after detailed conversationS with both the server and the manager, the kitchen sent out the tomato salad with bread, dairy, fruit (in dressing) and starch on it which only tells me they're either not listening, or they don't care.  And I want to give them more credit than that because I know that's not how the owner would want them to treat their guests.

So then entree comes - and it's just ok.  Why?  because I didn't really trust the kitchen at this point - but I was so hungry I ate every bite.  Fortunately no issues.  Which is why I only dinged them one star.",2012-07-07 15:53:58

The appetizer special was prosciutto wrapped white asparagus ( grilled ) , buffalo mozzarella , heirloom tomatoes topped with an over easy quail egg that was topped with a shave of black truffle surrounded by truffle vinaigrette. This was pretty much as good as it gets. I saw black specs in the vinaigrette and thought they were pepper but to my surprise they were pieces of black truffle so I was impressed that the chef didn't use cheap truffle oil and used real truffles. The buffalo cheese has so much more going on with it than regular mozzarella and also just melts in your mouth in a pleasurable way. The prosciutto used was high end. I also liked that Chef Stephen Toevs came out and asked us how we liked it.

I ordered the special, sole topped with fennel salad surrounded by grain mustard beurre blanc and whipped not spicy jalapeño potatoes. I wasn't sure if these taste would work together but they did and were an incredible experience.

My husband had the prime strip steak au poivre. This steak was as good as strip steak can be but it came with fries and onion straws. The the fries and onion straws were good but not as exciting as the very good prime meat and are part of the reason this wasn't a five star review. I do note the sides of fries and onions were included in the modest price for this kind of steak. (Prime strip steak runs approx $49.00 lb at AJs)

We have been up to this point been receiving the very best over the top service from our waiter Grant ( who really was a joy ). But at this point the two waiters on got slammed and I counted our waiter running around with at least seven tables  ( some were outside on the patio ) He had help but wasn't able to ask us how are meals were ( although they were great ) 

We wanted to order dessert since the meals were very good and Grant did make the trip to clear our plates and give dessert menus. We don't drink coffee but I do think we should have been asked if we wanted some with the hazelnut bar we ordered but I know that was due to the workload our waiter was experiencing . I'm not being mean or picky but in high end dining you are paying for everything great.

Over all the food is reasonably priced for high end. The specials were OUTSTANDING. I think the menu is slightly dated and the dessert we tried was good but is not on the level of the really great meals. I also used my preferred dining card and received one meal for free.

I would love to try more of Chef Toevs specials. I got the impression he is a masterful and Creative Chef.",2012-02-12 14:20:54

To add insult to injury, they pride themselves on the fact that they have an ATM for their customers to get cash from. So if they have the ATM, they also get paid to have that in their shop, but their customers have to pay an out of network fee to use the machine! This is ridiculous.
I placed my order over the phone and was clear that I was not familiar with the menu (a new customer) at that point the person should have informed me that they do not accept credit cards! I opted to leave and get cash from my own bank to pay for my to go order.

I know Vegas has dozens of great restaurants and it is so tempting to try them all, but I have no issue foregoing a new place next time to return to STRIPSTEAK. I was recently in LV staying at THEhotel and visited STRIPSTEAK on consecutive days. 

We actually stopped in for the Happy Hour which turned out to be a great deal. From 4-7pm all the apps were 1/2 off and beers were $3. 

Over the two days I ordered, split, and/or tried the following: Duck Fat Fries, Skirt Steak, Crab Cakes, Kobe Sliders, and Lobster Fritters. 

First off, none of them disappointed and some of them (crab cakes, and fries) I had the first night and went with again on the second. The DFF's were great. Each fry matched it's sauce perfectly. The skirt steak I will save for last. The crab cakes were the most unique I've ever had. Usually you think of a handcrafted pan sauteed cake. I have no clue how they got this crab cake so perfectly shaped (probably a mold) and so crispy but it was amazing. Not short on crab and had the right amount of of kick, great dish. Next were the Kobe Sliders. For those of you who claim you can't taste the difference between regular beef and Kobe or grass fed beef, there is a McDonald's right across the street from Mandalay. The sliders were seasoned well and the whole burger was delicious. The lobster fritters were, you guessed it, great. So very light and fluffy and a light creme fraiche to accompany it. Last and very much the best was the skirt steak. I actually didn't believe it was skirt steak because of the tenderness. I was lead to believe skirt was a very tough cut and expected it to be very chewy. Quite the contrary, this steak melted in your mouth. That, along with tasting out of this world in terms of seasoning, made this my favorite dish. 

The last thing of note was the service. A+. We had the same two bartenders serve us both nights and there were awesome. Two of the most easy going friendly dudes ever. They were right on top of things but weren't over bearing, it was almost like they could read our minds. They featured a homemade blended drink serve with one massive ice cube (apparently from a 20k ice maker) that was a blend of two different types of liquor (i asked but now forget which two) and is mixed with some fruit and other ingredients over a lengthy process and then put out in a colander sitting on a bed of ice. It runs for $14 a glass and the guys had no problem letting us try it. It tasted excellent, almost like an Orange flavor reminding me of Grand Marnier. Overall, it was enjoyable and worth the small priced compared to what it costs to get a mixed drink at every other bar, restaurant, and club in Las Vegas.",2010-09-14 17:36:47

Other than RTC local buses, this is a stop for Megabus that goes out to California. This is usually why I am here, I sometimes head out to LA on that cheap-o direct bus.

To be honest, I had no plans to eat at D Grill - but they give you a $5 off coupon when checking in, so I figured I'd give it a shot. And I'm glad I did. 

I looked at the menu before going and the one thing that stood out to me was that they not only stressed the high quality of their burgers, they advertised where their burgers came from. I hadn't really heard of ""Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors"" before, which goes to show you just how bad of a foodie I am. The 3rd generation meat wholesaler rose to fame in the 90's when Mario Batali made them the primary meat provider to his restaurants. They are very well known for their chopped meats and burger blends, and provide Shake Shack with their own burger blend. 

Of course, I found all of this out AFTER I ordered their burger ... I just figured if they were advertising it like it was some big deal, it either was worth the hype or 100% BS. It was totally worth the hype. I ordered a burger medium rare with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was REALLY good. I wish the bun matched the quality of the burger, and the fries were tasty, but standard diner fare. But the quality of that burger ... oh so good. 

The D Grill is old-school Vegas, where the casinos ran their own restaurants rather than outsource to celebrity chefs or large franchises. You can get a hint of the quality of food at their main restaurant - Joe Vicari's - from some of the fare at the D Grill. Obviously, the meat quality will be high. And when I heard another patron rave about the meatball sub, the server said they use the same meatball recipe that the steakhouse uses.

Overall, The D Grill was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely come back here and get a burger again. In fact, this might be the best burger in the DTLV/Fremont area.",2015-05-06 20:57:22

I thought it was going to be another cheesy Chinese buffet. I came here on a weekday lunch with my coworkers. The manager or one of the male hosts greeted us right away and we were seated immediately. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety and selection. They had four soups-egg flower, hot n sour, miso, and wonton. They also had a sushi station. I rarely get sushi that's been sitting out from a buffet so I can't comment on the quality and taste. There was also a salad and dessert bar and of course lots of Chinese food.

There's no way one can try everything here in one sitting. Out of the foods I tried, I liked the steamed clams in some delicious sauce (no idea what's in it but it's good), seabass, chicken wings, and coconut chicken in a creamy sauce. I didn't try the salad bar because I went for the main courses. Their dessert selection is alright. I grabbed a cream puff, chocolate mousse, and soft serve ice cream. Our waters were filled and plates cleared so no problems with service.

This is a steal for $8.79 to satisfy your cheap Chinese food cravings. There's a 10% off coupon on their website but I was embarrassed to use it because my coworker made fun of my coworker for using it last time so I didn't. LOL.",2015-06-03 05:32:05

   When I am riding the rough waves in the sea of living, an entertaining  book is my life preserver. Entertaining books take my mind on out of the world adventures from the 1964 Beatlemania to a walk across America with Peter Jenkins.

  My library card registration needed renewal. Facing a mountain of books headed toward an overdue fine, I had to pay up. The thing is that I am a bigger fan of outdoor recreation. I drove across the valley to combine the Sahara West Library with a hike on the Peccole Ranch Trail.

  Dating back to 2004, when I moved to Las Vegas, the Sahara West has always been one of my favorite libraries in the Las Vegas Clark County Library System. It is a large library that is an MGM Grand of books. The environment is cozy and immaculate. The only thing missing is a fireplace. The library is two floors. The adult and children's book collection lives upstairs in level two. All the biographies are featured under the individual categories.

  When it comes to books, I am a non-fiction kind of guy. Once I paid up, I made a bee-line upstairs to check out the rock & roll and celebrity biographies, hiking (poor selection), and city history books. With the exception of hiking, the selection of books in these categories is approved. My criticism is that the books the electronic card catalog stated as ""available"" were missing. It's a shame because this is one of the few libraries where the Whitney Houston biography was available. 

  It's more than books that bring me into the doors of the library.  In the downloading age, I still appreciate the physical CD. The Sahara West Library collection of CDs is substantial.

  When I walked out the Sahara West Library on my way to my next Yelp check-in,  I walked to my car proud that I am a fan of books. If I am not too busy yelping, the books I borrowed will bring my mind on adventures with the Who and Jimmy Page. If you live in Las Vegas, I recommend visiting the Sahara West Library to borrow a book that will bring your mind on an awesome adventure.",2013-12-14 08:17:43

Tucked away next to the Starbucks, you might not ever notice it (used to be Terra) but it is a little gem! Named after the absolutely gorgeous city in the south of France, Aix en Provence, one of my favorites, I had high hopes for the food but hadn't tried it yet because the previous menu had a lot of cilantro on it. Thankfully I was not disappointed. 

Our server was Aaron and he was just about my favorite server I've ever had. He did not steer us wrong. We started with some really interesting craft cocktails we both couldn't get enough of.  We had the heirloom tomato salad on burrata, steak au poivre, and peach clafoutis. The burrata was actually quite mild and not as gamey as some Italian burrata can be. The ""au poivre"" sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the expertly seasoned steak. It was a solid 5 star meal all the way around. Just delicious flavors at every turn. Hubs had the smoked salmon tartine (on a baguette), duck cassoulet and chocolate ganache. It was delicious, decadent and satisfying. Through the evening, Aaron was friendly, attentive and gave us great suggestions. The interior left a lot to be desired (it was generic restaurant furniture with a few paintings of Provence) but the food and service definitely made up for it.

Today with the sudden impending snow and colder weather, my cousin and I huddled for warmth and a good breakfast at the Grail.  I mean the Grill.  With the light snowfall and the view of MEC across the street one could even imagine themselves being at a mountain chalet.

The waitress was top notch, polite, quick and courteous, we ordered two Pacific Benedict, which is the usual suspect plus a nice portion of salmon.  They had actually brought us two regular Bennys, apologised for the mix up... but it was truly worth the wait.  Let me just say they were perfect, the poached eggs were done exquisitely, both holding their forms; and with the hint of lemon in the salmon and hollandaise sauce it was magnifique!

The highlight of my meal however was the potato wedges/chips that came with the meal.  Nice and crunchy, not oily. I could come in, just order a bag of these, sit in the corner and I would truly be a happy camper.

The space is really nice too, it is a small breakie place but done up just right, the grill to the right when you walk in, with the cafe space to the left, done up with beige colours, artwork and black covered tables.

The course was pretty generous, you got soup and salad with your hibachi dinner. The salad was dressed nicely in a light, ginger vinaigrette and actually contained leafy greens with cucumber slices, carrots, instead of the typical anemic ice berg salad. 

Every hibachi dinner has the option to be served with fried rice for no additional cost.

I ordered the scallop and shrimp dinner $26.25. The jumbo sized shrimps (26/30 or 16/20) were deveined and cooked perfectly.  The amount of scallops were generous and unlike the portions I've seen elsewhere in Madison. Stir-fried carrots, broccoli and onion were crisp and seasoned evenly.

The other day was the first time I tried the prime rib. It was a surprisingly a really good 12 oz. men's cut prime rib which came with a soup or salad and a side for like $14.  For some reason I thought it was just as good maybe even a little better than the prime rib I had from a steakhouse earlier and it wasn't because it was cheaper.  I don't know how to describe how a prime rib should be besides it looked and tasted good and blood wasn't running all over the place. I'd definitely order it again. Do yourself a favor, if you're craving prime rib get the men's cut, they had a prime rib and shrimp special for like $10 but the prime rib just wasn't the same. Ask my mom who got her prime rib and shrimp plate after a couple of men's cut prime rib plates were brought to the table. haha. 

Just like almost every Vegas casino cafe has a menu that highlights a cheap steak and eggs deal or various late night deals. Sourdough Cafe is no different. Here they offer a decent sized cheap steak, forgot how many ounces, a couple of eggs, and hash brown for under $5. I use to come here pretty often for steak and eggs back in the day back when it was cheaper, it's still pretty cheap.  It's not the best or cheapest in town but if you're craving it and you're in the area you might as well save some gas money.

I was most disappointed in the fish; it was a little dry and there was very little sauce or basil, and no spice to it except a few thin pieces of sliced jalapeno.  I liked the bean curd *much* better.  They used a soft tofu that had a beautiful, silky texture, but even that dish was underseasoned.  I found myself adding a few drops of soy sauce to liven it up, something I never do normally.  Finally, I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the prices seemed a little high for the quality and quantity you get.",2018-02-28 05:22:30

I ordered a homemade ginger beer to go with my water and I have to say it was the best ginger beer I've ever tasted. It wasn't nearly as carbonated as the ones you'd buy in the bottle such as Reeds and was a little sweeter. The ginger was so intense that by the end of the glass I was sweating a little from the spiciness. It was REALLY good and anyone who enjoys the mild tingle of ginger ale should try it at least once.

As an appetizer I had the fried ripe plantains. They came out golden brown and had a kind of soggy consistency. In my head I was thinking of a crisper appetizer but I thought they were delicious. I'm not sure how they are prepared traditionally. The inside was sweet and a bit tangy and surprisingly was not as similar to a banana as I thought it would be. I really liked them and was impressed at their ability to walk the fence between sweet and savory.

I ordered the jerk chicken as my entree and thought it was awesome. The spiciness keeps pace with you as you eat it. It doesn't overwhelm you right off the bat but by the end of your meal you usually are ready to succumb to its spice. The chicken came bone-in which in my opinion is always a good sign. I hate it when people sacrifice flavor for convenience. The sauce around the chicken was abundant and delicious and the jerk rub was proportioned perfectly for me. I had a sign of ""rice and peas"" which was more like rice and beans, as well as black beans. The rice was fluffy and abundant and the black beans were really good.

For dessert I had the Jamaican rum cake. It came with a small scoop of ice cream and a decorative fanned out piece of soft, sweet mango. I did not care for the rum cake because, once again, being unfamiliar with Caribbean food I was expecting something else. The cake was incredibly dense, moist and seemed to be full of molasses. I am not a huge fan of molasses so I did not care for it as much.
All in all the food here was incredible. The waitress was really nice and kept our drinks filled. No one was in the restaurant as is the usual situation with non-chain restaurants in Pittsburgh so don't let the lack of customers deter you.",2011-02-24 20:22:24

We were pleasantly surprised to find that an order of cheese bread is basically a large pizza crust with cheese, very generous! Our family loved the pizzas and the giant salads!

At the old Camelview, I was 100% comfortable knowing that the movies would likely fit my taste and I never had to plow through the descriptions or watch the trailers. They would likely be Indy. They might be foreign. And they'd probably be good.

With the replacement at Fashion Square you can get food and drinks if that's important to you but you'll also have to go through the descriptions of movies if you don't know what's playing and you'll have to go through a lot including genres that you are not likely looking to see.

For the longest time the restaurant stayed the same. I liked their food. It has a nice fresh taste and you know it is fixed fresh as they fix it as you order. 
Not sure what they are doing as they have changed the restaurant menu or the way they present the menu to you three times in the last year. One of the new features i like is they now have a smaller proportion available. I am a fan of being able to order a smaller proportion. That was the good.
They no longer offer the fortune cookie. There used to be a big bowl full of them and people could take as many as they wanted. If you wanted to save money just give everyone one as they order their meal. i like the fortune cookie. Yes i know this is petty on my part but come on. They used to have the nice thick napkins but those are gone also. Your table used to be set with silverware, now you have to pick up your silverware by the drink machine. They also used to have the hot mustard available on a rack by the drinks. Now if you want some you have to ask. Seems the small plates are a little less than the regular plates were before the change and the large plates are more than before. 
Today my brown rice was about 5 minuets from being cooked. I was offered to remake my meal but then I would be eating when everyone else was done waiting for me, so I did not ask to have it redone.

I ask to have my roots touched up to blonde and a blonde wash done to get out some of the Orange. My hairstylist in LA who owns 2 salons does this process all the time, it ends up great and keeps costs down. Don't get me wrong the stylist was super friendly and a great person.. But my scalp got fried! I was a couple weeks pregnant when I came in and already hesitant about getting my hair bleached. They advised they wanted to try some color instead of bleach on my head and convinced me to get highlights. I told them that I would need bleach but they insisted their way was safer with color and with bleach  my hair would get damaged. So  I let them do their thing and sure enough it did not work. So then come the bleach which should have been done in the 1st place. I was there about 4 hours. The end product actually came out pretty good which I was happy with... With triple the price of what I have ever paid...When I woke up the next day my scalp was oozing, pussing and flaking off. And it was the day of my best friends wedding. I had to go to a different salon at the wedding location to get my head scrubbed and blown out again cause it was so nasty. Not very happy.. And not happy that I put my baby in danger by having bleach pretty much injected into my scalp. I call the salon a few months later to possibly give them another chance and tell them what happened so it doesn't happen again. They were booked up 3 weeks out. No thanks!

Sheltered downtown between Charleston and Oakey, the Aruba is the type of place you probably won't end up at unless you know it's there.  The parking lot drives me crazy, especially when it's busy.

One of the best things about Poppy Den is their service.  From opening week to now, service has been top notch.  Poppy Den has done a great job of selecting their staff, from hostesses to waitstaff to bartenders, they have a strong team.  Parties of 10 or more, remaking entrees, remaking drinks, dealing with the effects of ladies happy hour, finding fruit for us to feed each other with; they do what they can to make customers happy.  I've always received great service, especially from Camille, Kim and Julian.

Many dishes here combine sweet and salty flavors, and they work well.  Having tried quite a few things on their menu, some of the must try dishes are the Quinoa ""Fried Rice"" with Sun Dried Pineapple (best quinoa dish I've had), Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup, the Shrimp and Grits (pureed polenta and yuzu!!), and Miso Salmon with Shishito Peppers (perfectly cooked salmon).  Other good choices are the Roasted Duck Breast with Poppy Honey, the Crispy Pork Belly (breading is a bit too thick, but still good), and the Poppy Burger (the pickled cucumbers make this).  For desserts be sure to try their Miso Toffee Ice Cream with Chips and the Sake Strawberry Cake.

They do offer brunch earlier in the day, which I think is decent but not as impressive as their dinner menu.  The drink menu is good, however I have seen some inconsistencies depending on who makes the cocktails.  There is a Ladies Happy Hour daily from 5:00pm - 6:30pm, which offers free champagne and champagne cocktails.  Now that the weather is getting nice, the outdoor area is now open for dining.  And with those details out of the way, have some pictures.

The presentation of the dishes served was something you don't typically get at an AYCE place but they were so nice, they seemed like a la carte orders. The rice to fish ratio also seemed a la carte. The slice of fish was way longer than the rice and the cut rolls and hand rolls had very little rice. My husband is picky about rice which can make or break a place for him. He said the rice was perfect for our orders but then became dry and hard near the end of our meal.

Firstly, they do awesome wings, especially on Tuesday nights.  If you're like me, you normally order them ""suicide,"" but here's a tip:  if you want them uber fukkin hot, you want to order them ""loony"" instead.  

Apart from their excellent, excellent wings though, Loons offers pubgrub that simply surpasses most other places in the city.  Unlike other places that offer fried and bland nibbles, Loons gives you Shepherd's Pie, hummus, calamari, awesome deli sandwiches, curried goodness, steaks, and more.  Their burgers are huge, with wide array of toppings, and always made from fresh ground beef rather than store-bought patties.  And did I mention the wings?  Holy God.

Add to that their sassy, sexy, hard-workin' servers.  And how cool they are with families coming in with kidlets who want excellent ice cream.  And their shuffleboard game.  And just enough flatscreens to enjoy the news or hockey game without feeling overwhelmed by the sports testosterone. And their wide variety of on-tap beers.  And their open mike Friday nights.

I'll reserve a 1-star review for bed-bug incidents, so thank god on that.  We had a room in the east tower and as soon as we stepped in regretted leaving the comfort of our other hotel.  Now that the Sahara is gone, this place epitomizes the old Vegas.  This hotel and its casino are frequented by the older crowd and it shows.  The entertainment and decor is as dated as the crowd.  

Upon entering our room, we noticed that it was large, but dim and dreary.  The carpet was clean, but badly in need of replacing.  As if from some sort hotel horror story, we also noticed that the bed was part of a fold-up unit.  I thought those only existed in 100 sq. ft. apartments and seedy motels.  The area behind the bed looked a little dirty, but no bed bugs.  Aside from that, the remainder of the room, including the bathroom looked relatively clean.  However, this might also be the most no-frills Hilton I've ever encountered.  Only the basics are available (shampoo, soap, lotion), and not even a tray for the soap.

The only good part of the hotel was the casino, which was small, but had low limit tables and friendly dealers.  The morning and afternoon gambling crowd is a little sparse and results in $5 blackjack tables.

2 stars.  Although we did not have any bed bug incidents, we always felt a little dirty.  I wasn't expecting your LV Strip luxury, but this doesn't seem to meet standard Hilton quality.",2011-06-10 02:52:16

Similar to my previous post, this restaurant has an interesting jazz vibe. Servers are all Japanese/Asian but the dish are all Italian.

The dish itself is very salty but I really like how it blends with the pasta. Without the salty sauce, the pasta may taste bland, since there isn't much of other content besides the mushrooms. In addition, the pasta is cooked right and has the al dente feel. Similar to all other pasta dishes, they give you a half toasted bread on the side. Also, each dish is complemented with a bowl of salad.

OK, it's not authentic, and it is distinctly tomato-y.  It's like the bizarre love child of pad thai and a creamy curry.  It's a bit spicy, which is unusual.  There are no peanuts, no cilantro, and you get a lemon wedge instead of a lime.

On the other hand - it's cheap as can be, huge, hot, and actually quite tasty.  Once you get over your initial this-isn't-really-much-like-authentic-pad-thai reaction, you might enjoy it too.  I could definitely see myself ordering this calorie binge again some time.",2011-05-06 16:26:33

The water fountains both have cold water now(at least as of 2 hours ago or so) The eqipment is still a bit worn, but as I've stated before, its still quite functional and gets the job done.

I'm a huge fan of Anthony Bourdain's various foodie shows and always on the lookout to either try new things or learn more about ethnic foods. When he did an episode on Shanghai a few years ago, he visited a dumpling palace, how these delicious tid-bits are more than just a dim-sum staple. They have a history in China stretching back centuries, how ""soup dumplings"" the ones literally which have a soup inside are magically made and perfectly held together in their doughy exterior.

I only found out about this place a few days ago and after checking out the latest Peru exhibit at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, both of us were feeling peckish. Came here to check it out and so glad that we did. We only ordered the old stand-bys, pork and shrimp and lamb with green onions steamed dumplings and they were superb. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu. Another good sign, when we walked in at 5:30pm, the place was empty. An hour later, practically all the tables were taken up.

I stayed for a few drinks.  They were all palatable and correct.  The decor is great - I really appreciate the handmade stuff.  The selection is pretty decent, though beers I'd say is average at best.  Being a beer person, I'm glad there's one decent pale+ here, but nothing more than that (that it's on tap helps a bit).  Somewhere around 20 beers total, four on tap, but the craft selection is a little lacking.  This happens to be a place I can order something with St. Germain though, and to me, stands out a bit.  Prices weren't crazy over the top, nor spectacular.  I imagine after food is regularly served here, the need for a happy hour will deplete (thus, I am not mentioning the very slow attendance and need for happy hour pricing).

The idea of a great drink, food and music venue is so long overthought, that I think Phoenix has pretty much forgotten about it.  Finally, after so many years of wishing, someone has guts to go ahead and do it.  I got some sampling of the soon-to-be fare, and I obviously have no qualms.  The genius behind the upcoming food here is nothing to scoff at.  The music lineup seems quite eclectic, but overall tasteful and good; I can't wait to see a show here and experience it at its fullest.  From DJs to indies.  My one qualm (as with many, many other places) is the TV, and apparent need for sports playing.  I have a major aversion to sports in a bar setting.  It removes the awkwardness of silence, therefor fueling anti-socialism (where if there was no TV, the awkwardness would be filled with conversation).

ShinBay has a super relaxed and very sophisticated vibe that belies its albeit fancy strip mall envisions.  The itamae is Japanese and runs the show.  Some of the servers are Japanese too.  The authenticity of the Kaiseki experience runs the gamut from the fine woods at the bar to the beautiful pottery.  I'll stop boring you with the superlative accoutrements and move to the food!

1) Hirame sashimi with five sauces - perfect light way to begin.  The freshness of the fluke and the varied and thoughtful spices reminded me that I'm in for a treat!

2) Best salad ever - more specifically, bigeye tuna from Hawaii (now in season), with fresh greens, freshly grated wasabi root, and a homemade sesame dressing.  Oh and okra!   I'm a huge salad snob and this was the perfect match of greens, proteins, and a touch of savory/sweet goodness

3) Sashimi course - well cut and plated.  Good mix of flavors and especially textures.  Amberjack (meaty), Santa Barbara Uni (buttery), Amaebi (delicate), Mirugai (crunchy), and Toro (fatty!).  Fresh wasabi made its appearance again and oh how I relished it

4) Six tastes - I took some close ups of these, as a distant picture doesn't do this course justice.  This type of dish is a staple at two of the best Japanese restaurants in LA (Mori and Shunji), and Shinbay's holds its own.  There was a) Toro, wasabi, pine nuts, avocado tartar with Japanese ginger, and a crisp wafer and lotus root for dipping, b) Ankimo with Japanese radish, c) Firefly squid with Japanese relish, d) Hokkaido scallop seared and topped with truffle and truffle oil (out of this world), e) Kumamoto Oyster with Santa Barbara Uni and Japanese jelly, and f) Marinated Spanish Octopus (Tako) with a touch of spice.  I was in dreamland

5) Green Tea Soba with Sea Bass - Savory soup time, and wow was this outstanding.  Having flown in from the East Coast I was still trying to shake the ice out of my hair, so this hit the spot.  The green tea soba noodles were rich and yet refreshing, there was a good portion of sea bass to add flavor, and in addition, daikon radish, scallions, fresh wasabi, and even bamboo made an appearance.  All were delicious.  The kombu (kelp) at the bottom was great at the end, as it had soaked up all the flavors and become more pliable

6) Mushroom and clam soup - Another savory dish, and something that I have had before and they recalled I loved.  It is served with five different types of mushrooms over about a half dozen clams and is topped with a shredded Japanese pepper

7) First sushi course - Some excellent sauces really brought these fish to life.  a) Sayori was delicate and a nice way to start, b) Second Fish - ?, c) Odoro Ebi (tiny shrimp) has a nice bite to it and is a rarer find, d) I believe this was madai served with a special sauce that I was told has been used in Japan even prior to soy sauce (sweeter and I enjoyed it very much), e) then Aji which was beautifully fresh and well presented and garnished with grated ginger

8) Second sushi course - I took close ups of these, since this was so wonderful.  a) Mirugai - started big with a crunchy bite, b) Ocean Trout - loved this with the garnishment, c) Kampachi belly - rich cut, d) Toro from Japan - sublime, e) Santa Barbara Uni - I loved ending on a sweeter note

The shari at Shinbay is good and served right about room temperature.  Having been in LA recently, I was getting used to the warm-rice thing, but I think Shinbay's works well since there is more attention to the sauces and since they plate five pieces of nigiri at a time, too warm rice would affect the neta (fish) temperature

9) Dessert course - this is a consistent treat at Shinbay.  Fresh berries with a light sauce over a slightly sweet egg custard",2015-03-26 02:47:56

Although the interior is kind of shabby, the dumplings are great. They're not crescent-shaped like the ones most commonly found in Chinese restaurants and households, but are more round and plump. I'm guessing it helps the dumplings hold the broth inside? 
The broth is really one of the factors contributing to Qing Hua's popularity. It's full of flavor, but also burning hot, so be careful if you're ""cat-tongued"" (or nekojita, as the Japanese would say). If you don't want to risk burning your mouth, you can simply nib open the dumpling from the top and let the broth leak out.
Another secret to Qing Hua's success are the handmade dumpling wraps. They're typically fresher and better in ""mouthfeel"" than machine-made ones. 

Customer service is somewhat of a weakness at Qing Hua. Sometimes it's fast and efficient, sometimes it's slow and chaotic.

Obviously if they have 52 copies of 'The Time Traveller's Wife', they aren't going to buy yours.

I honestly love everything about Bookmans! True, it is slightly dingy, but that is part of the charm. You can buy pretty much any book you could dream of for 1/3 the price you would at Barnes & Noble or any other bookstore. 

But, book aren't the end of what they sell. Magazine, Movies, Music, Games, Video Game Systems, Art.... pretty much anything used that is in good condition and someone else might want, they carry. 

Bookmans is a personal obsession! I would peruse every day if I still lived there.

I also think that their purchasing system is more than fair. I have gone many times and sold old books or video games that I was done with and have felt the credit/cash they gave me was acceptable. There have also been times that I took bags full of books like everyone else is complaining about and had them buy nothing... but I realize that this is part of the business.

They expanded, of course!  And they've been going strong ever since.  And that Starbucks?  Not so much.  You have to give locally-owned Kiva Han credit for giving the big middle finger to big, mean corporate America.  

While you might initially be put off by the slacker appearance and demeanor of the barrista, they make a mean, mean cuppa.  And by that I mean amazing.  

My suggestion is the Almond Joy coffee drink--an amazing combination of espresso, chocolate, coconut syrup, and milk.  It is addictive.  Word to the wise, though, if you get a large and drink it in the afternoon, you will probably be up until 3 in the morning (you'll have to trust me on this).  It's good cold or hot.

They also have good light sandwiches and soups for dinner along with a nice assortment of sweets.

Easy to get a seat as a solo at 5pm, I joined a small family celebrating their daughters birthday. At the other table was another family celebrating Grandma's birthday. I'd say the birthday girls were about 60 years apart in age, yet chose the same place on the same night......(insert spooky music)

I'm a huge fan of hibachi dining (teppanyaki) and have had many meals here and all over the US and world. The chefs are all good, but the show is running a little stale (how many onion volcano's can you see?) Someone needs to take it up a notch with some new jokes besides egg roll.

Anyways...on to the food. Pretty good. I had the combo with filet, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki salmon. All cooked perfectly. Just lacked some flavor. As did the opening salad, the soup (not miso), the dipping sauces, the fried rice....all of it lacked an exciting flavor. So my 3 stars is mostly for the flavor of the food. Service was great, 5 stars. The chef was great, 5 stars.....Just the food needs to get punched up a bit and add some new seasonings besides basic salt, pepper, and butter.

OtNx8XSHqQ8V4XQZTkr1oA,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,xmAakatNKpvIJ-Fmq5swCw,4,9,5,3,"Have you ever tried to do an online search for restaurants where a woman is the majority owner?  Let me tell you something, it is TOUGH!  Don't get me wrong, I've dined at a number of restaurants here in the valley owned by women.  Silvana Esparza's Barrio Cafe, Carla Logan's Carly's Bistro, Tonya Saidi's Pie Hole, and the Sizemore sisters' Treehouse Bakery just to name a few.  But what I thought would be a quick and easy search for other majority women owned restaurants in the valley turned into a near frantic hours long Googlefest.  Making the process even more frustrating was seeing that many restaurants with female monikers were in fact owned by men.  Then I came upon The Market.  A restaurant I'd vaguely heard about, but had never visited before.  

So on International Women's Day, I was off to visit this Arcadia area spot owned by Jennifer Russo-Fitzgerald.  Jennifer had run her own catering operation for the better part of two decades, before setting up shop here in the Gaslight Square area on the southeast corner of 36th Street and Indian School.  The Square is already a haven for foodies with restaurants like Crudo, Nook Kitchen, and Beckett's Table nearby.  The Market itself fits in quite nicely, with a space that is both aesthetically appealing and welcoming.  The interior has seating for about 60 including bar seating, high chairs and regular sit down tables.  The ceiling is adorned with chandeliers and the walls are a mix of local artwork and chalkboards full of information about the restaurant and Jennifer's still operational catering business.  The exterior has seating for about 20-30 more including a drop down high chair seating area for groups.

I came just before 5pm while things were still pretty quiet so I got a seat no problem.  First thing I did was show my Yelp Check-In which gets you a free cup of their housemade Posole Verde.  First off, this wasn't a cup.  It was a full bowl of pork, cabbage, hominy, radish, onion, cilantro, lime, and poblano peppers.  The spice level wasn't overwhelming, but certainly enough to wake up your palette and clear your nasal passages.  Great broth and tender pork.  To wash some of it down, I got one of their cocktails.  The Arcadia Sunset.  Tequila, aperol, lemon and something called strawberry peppercorn shrub.  The drink was okay, but kinda fell flat for me.  It's possible I was more focused on cooling off my tongue after that posole.  For my main entree, I was stuck between three dishes.  Before I could even utter my options, my waiter Taylor told me to get the Carbonara (which did happen to be one of my three dishes of choice).  Spaghetti with pancetta, parmigiana reggiano cheese, peas, corn, chopped tomato, cracker pepper, lemon, parsley, and a poached egg.  Wow, this hit all the right notes.  Admittedly just stirring the poached egg into the pasta was a fun distraction, but surprisingly sweet notes on the pancetta and the peas were really what set this apart for me.  Super dish and great noodles.  For dessert, I opted for the Bananas Foster Nutella Bread Pudding.  Just the title alone made me salivate.  It also doesn't hurt they're using brioche as the bread of choice.  The flower-like presentation is certainly pretty.  The mix of nutella and caramel flavors made it even prettier.  Perfect for sharing, though I had no trouble on my own.  Seriously, every bread pudding should use brioche.

Total cost for the cocktail, entree, dessert, tax and tip (sans the free posole) came to about $50.  Yeah, its not a cheap place to eat unless you're here just grazing during happy hour.  Most of the main dinner entrees here average about $20 each and the apps are around $10-$15 each so this wouldn't be an everyday stop for most.  That said, Jennifer Russo-Fitzgerald takes great pains to source all of her stuff locally which does at least partially explain the price point.  Another cheaper option is their weekend brunch which The Market is probably most known for, and when most of their main menu runs between $10-15.  All things considered, I was impressed by the creativity, the fresh flavors, the service, and ambiance.  And as I mentioned Jennifer still runs her catering operation for your corporate and social event needs.  Great dinner to cap off Women's Day and further proof that women can be successful and innovative entrepreneurs just as men can.  Let's hope the valley sees even more women owned establishments like this one in the years to come.",2017-03-09 02:14:52

My friends steak was to die for. I wasn't craving steak since it was 10pm but if I go there again, I will make sure I'm there earlier so I can order a steak. 

We started with the shrimp cocktail and it was delicious. The shrimps were huge and  scrumptious. I highly recommend that appetizer. It comes with three jumbo shrimps so if you have a bigger party, you may want to order a few. 

We also ordered a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. The asparagus was really good!  I loved them. Unfortunately, I couldn't try the mashed potatoes because they had dairy in them but my friend said they were really good.

Allover, I would definitely return to Harbour Sixty to enjoy a nice dinner.

Rice was nasty and French fries very garbage. The steak was over well done and that's ridiculous since he asked for medium. My meat skewer was alright I gave it a 7/10. The meats were all overcooked. It's obvious this is how Portuguese cook their food....My rice and parisienne *mini potatoes* was saved because I drenched it with red sauce that made it all somewhat tasty which my man refused to have.

I arrived at the restaurant to meet my friends and I was the last to arrive. It took our waiter over 10 minutes to come back to the table to take my order. Once he arrived he was fantastic. I knew I needed to order sooner than later since I have a bunch of food allergies.

I ordered sushi rolls, edamame, sashimi and some grilled items. The grilled items were the best thing I ordered. I opted for the grilled squid, asparagus wrapped in bacon and grilled mushrooms. These items went down easy and tasted fantastic. When I ordered more they didn't always arrive and I was stuck with the less fresh items like the salmon sashimi. 

The salmon sashimi was not fresh. It tasted off and did not melt in my mouth. I didn't want to eat it but at this restaurant you get charged for what you don't eat. Talk about having a dilemma. Hehe 

The next day, I had a fishy aftertaste in my mouth. It was equivalent to the experience I encountered when I used to take omega 3 pills (let's just say I only lasted a week).

Why stay open till 7pm daily if you're constantly running out of food? Save yourself the staffing and operational costs by closing immediately after the weekday lunch rush.

Another way to tell that they're sold out of food is that no one will help you at the cash. I practically had to go back into the kitchen and bring out an employee myself.

I stayed there for the LVBDI over Sept 5-8 and had a group convention rate.  Even with the regular rates for the Flamingo, it still stays firmly in the mid-priced hotel range for the strip.  With the amenities it has (pool, spa, food court, restaurants, garden area) it really is a good value for the money.  Yes, it's old and the renovation didn't seem to take care of the hallway carpet or the bathroom cabinets, but if you're looking for new then you've come to the wrong hotel.

I had a FAB room with two beds that looked out on the strip and it was perfectly acceptable and cleaned each day.  The walls are thin and the large window area does let in some noises from the strip so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.

With check-in/out, I had a diamond card as one of the convention directors so the VIP check-in was quick and easy.  If you don't have a diamond card and do not need any kind of consideration with your room, try the automated check-in/out that is to the side of the hotel check in desk.  I used that last year and it was much better than standing in the long line.

As already noted, as they work on the Linq construction the parking garage and valet is only for the hotel guests and convention attendees.

They're crispy and smoky and juicy you don't really need sauce with it. We also like the cheese curds. They're like mini mozzarella sticks. I wonder if it's bad to order marinara with cheese curds cuz that would be a good idea. Their fries are also damn good. Battered and thin. We did have chili cheese fries last time we were in and they were soggy and not very appetizing. Basically the food is pretty good but the smoky atmosphere makes it not pleasant to go to very often.,2017-02-24 05:14:24

The Spanakopita was light and satisfying, the skewers (esp the shrimp) were cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sides were all faultless... from the fries, tasty rice pilaf, salad to the pita and tatziki (yogurt dipping sauce with cucumber).

What looked, from a distance, like a reasonably-sized buffet, was a surprisingly small spread for a Sunday lunch. Half of the buffet was dedicated to vaguely salad-like items and sauces. The other half - the entrée half - had very little selection, made worse by the rice cooker sitting nearly empty and one of the trays completely empty for more that half of our visit. (I asked several times when it would be restocked, each time being assured it was being refilled very soon. False.) 

The woman in the dining room was extremely nice and eager to please. The two men in the dining room walked around, occasionally stirring trays from the buffet. (I was most turned off by the man who, when asked what soda they had - Pepsi or Coke - responded, ""well which do you want?"" When I requested Coke, he said ""ok that's what we have"". Hmmmm.... )

I got three estimates to paint my house. I didn't know much about Crash of Rhinos but Mike impressed me with his comments and his suggestions.

The crash of rhinos (they really aren't big enough to be called rhinos) came out when they were supposed to and went to work.  They covered everything that needed to be covered and moved everything that needed to be moved.  My house is stucco and had a few cracks along with some nicks and dings. They fixed all of that as well as replacing a few trim boards that were damaged.

The interior of my house is about 3,000 sq. ft. It's a single story with a 3 car garage. There's a lot of exterior that needed to be painted.  They got the job done in 4 1/2 days with a crew that ranged in size from 3 to 5.

Great cocktail menu.

Friendly, unpretentious staff.  Our waiter not only knew the menu extremely well, he also knew how everything was prepared.  For example, the testina we ordered took 3 days to prepare.  I also learned what testina was and that it is delicious (perhaps only when prepared properly).

I had the eggplant parmagiana for my main course and our waiter told me he wanted some!  The chef wanted to serve this dish the night before, but the waiter had suggested the chef wait another day to really let the flavour soak in.  I'm glad the chef listened to him.  Not only did that mean I snagged the last eggplant parmagiana (sorry to the waiter who wanted some), but also that it was extremely good.  I know a lot of people who aren't fans of eggplant, but it's on my list of favourite foods.

The amount of cheese baked on top was just enough.  Not too cheesy that it took away from the dish, but definitely enough to add the texture and flavour.  Not overcooked either, it was just melted enough, but not hardened.

The SUNDANCE SPECIAL is a delicious veggie omelette with spinach, sliced mushrooms,and artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special EGG Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. If I am feeling like an extra heavy filling in my stomach for breakfast, adding the seasoned chicken or blackened chicken will just do it right! 

VEGETARIAN CREPE is a layer of guacamole, mushrooms, fresh spinach and Swiss cheese. It is served with the Works poppy seed dressing, which is so delightful.

COUNTRY FRIED STEAK is a hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with a southern Grandma's country gravy and I have no problem with drinking this gravy as if it was soup. 

SEASONED CENTER CUT NEW YORK STEAK is a succulent 6 oz. Char-broiled steak with two eggs at your style of choice. 

All breakfast items are served with the WORKS potatoes, which is well-seasoned and I just can't get enough of it.  You also have a choice of toast, english muffin or banana nut muffin. I favor the sweet taste of the banana nut muffin because it is palatable at the end of my  meal.

Mussels: a generous portion in a white wine sauce, with chunks of chorizo

1. Their stores are always located in the middle of nowhere...where no man has ever gone before.. or simply where public transportation hardly goes, so if you don't have a car you'd better go somewhere else.

2 The items you see on their website are not the items they have in stock, regardless of what their website may say.

3 The items are not fully depicted in the website, so, for instance, if you are buying a backpack you'll never know how many compartments it has and details like that.

4. Some of the items are inexpensive, but at the end you get what you pay for. I checked their school backpacks and was not impressed. Checked several items and they were not in stock or the quality was not decent.

5. The employees make every effort possible to ignore the customers, especially if the customer needs some information about where to find a product or specifics about the product.

I went today for the first time and left frustrated, rode on two Metro lines, waited 30 minutes for a bus on the way there and 20 on the way back just to buy  nothing because I did not find the things I was looking for, and realized that what they sell is no better from the stuff I can buy at the dollar store or at any sport equipment in downtown Montreal...besides, the employees are not helpful at all, when they see you are going to ask for something they just look the other way and make every possible effort to ignore you.

First off, the reason why the boyfriend and I ventured out of our typical dining price range (for lunch at least), is because we re total burger fans. When the 2009 Best Of's came out we just had to try what the New Times thought the best burger in town was. 

We trotted into the Metro Brasserie around noon to find late-morning brunchers equipped with French omlettes,and steamed muscles and fries. As appetizing as those were, we were dead set on their burger. 

Simply put, their Metro Burger is fantastic. Get it medium-rare to medium well and with everything on it (it comes on a deep golden brioche bun, topped with creamy sauce gribiche, sweet smoked Vidalia onions, tangy cured tomato, and Bibb lettuce.) It also comes with a mountain of fresh cut fries on the side. Definitely worth the money ($13-15) and definitely worth the trip. 

My mistake of the day was getting a Peach Bellini (sparkling white wine with peach juice for $8). It just didn't hit the spot, and it did not compliment the meal at all. If you're a Bloody Mary fan, go for it. Everything is prepared fresh and it comes to you looking more like a crazy tomato smoothie than a cocktail.

First off, we got the hotpot combo. You get 4 items at 5 pieces each and it soaks in the hotpot broth. There's no mild for this so we got the second option in terms of spice levels (3 total). He says it doesn't soak up the spice much in a short time span, but the tofu SOAKS it up well. So, beware, if you can't take much spice like me.

Aside from that we only got the lamb skewers. I'll be back for other stuff. Now, for the lamb skewers, we got mild, because frankly, I don't want to die burning.

So, guess what? I died burning. It was soooooooooooooooo spicy!!!!!!! WHY?! Because they were trying a new spice or new manufacturer (or something of the like) and it was WAY too spicy. It wasn't just us. I believe the staff tried it as well as the table next to us. Yeah, it was death by the burning of my tongue and I was wishing for milk (of course, they didn't have it). BURN BURN BURN.

Anyway, they gave us a new stock of lamb skewers. No spice ;).

Owner came over and apologized and explained the situation. No biggie. He's a pretty nice guy. Explained their VIP cards, too. Right now it's $20 until the end of April. So, if you think you'll be coming often, grab one before the prices go up. It's pretty much where they offer different deals per day and each day offers a different item.

For example, you could get a BOGO (for example, BOGO crab) one day. You could get 10% off the whole bill. And so forth. I don't remember every one that he listed but feel free to ask any of the servers. :)

Yes, there are waitresses dressed like anime characters and there's anime playing on the TV, you definitely don't see many places like that in town. However, you're paying more for the environment rather than for the food quality. 

I actually came here a few weeks ago, the weekend before they changed it to ""Pretty Girls Maid Cafe"" so I'm basing this on the Anime Ramen menu rather than the new menu. I got the karaage chicken and miso ramen. The karaage chicken was average, I've had better at Ichiza. It took them a long time to make the ramen, which is weird because if you've been to other ramen places like Monta, you can look into the kitchen and see how fast it takes for the chefs to make the ramen. My bowl took about 30 minutes to make and when I got it, it wasn't even steaming hot. Their noodles reminded me of the ones you get from instant ramen and the broth lacked flavor. Their char siu was not that great either, great char siu is suppose to melt in your mouth, but this just tasted like I was chewing on pork fat. Service was average, the night I went it was packed so we didn't receive the best service, but we weren't being intentionally ignored. Overall, if you took away the anime theme, the restaurant is subpar.

I agree with reviewers food is great, service decent but not the best I've had. I also think the servers profile you ahead of time lol as to whether you're worth spending extra time on.

I'd go back for the seafood bottom line.
We started with fresh cheese with balsamic vinegar & oregano oil, second we had grilled octopus and grilled sardines, main we both had grilled fish and dessert: one was a meringue dessert, looks  huge which it was! With bits of sponge toffee in it for crunchy contrast (that was quite nice) the other was light too with a creme anglais type topping. Both were delicious. The dessert wine was a moscato, very smooth and the fish was perfectly cooked and fresh! And I'm picky about fish!  If I can taste anything, anything that isn't just fish, I won't eat it.

They asked if we needed them to cut the fish for us lol but we are both Asian and know how to eat a whole fish lol.  My friend eats the fish heads for crying out loud!!

The event itself had a lot of unique vendors, and a lot of opportunities to rescue or adopt a pet. I guess we came too late in the day, because the nail trim booth had already packed up and left. I wish I had know, because it was one of the main reasons we brought my dog.

My only complaint is that while the rules specifically stated that all dogs must be on a leash, there were quite a few patrons that let their pets run around without a leash - or even a collar.

The salad was crisp, fresh, and the chicken on it was charred which tastes awesome. In fact, they call their burgers ""charburgers"" because that is their signature flavor.

In all honesty, I missed having fries with my meal, so next time I would probably stick to that and skip the tempura green beans even though they were great.

It's also the more-or-less hub station for the light rail as there's just a stop or two more beyond it in the ""inbound"" direction. The CTC (Charlotte Transportation Center) is located just down the stairs on street level. There you can catch buses to anywhere in town as well as a few express buses to the bordering towns.

The station itself is bigger than all the others on the light rail and has lots more seating. Of course, being the CTC hub and linked to the EpiCentre it also gets a lot more crowded on the busiest nights in Charlotte. Also, it gets frequented by some slightly more sketchy characters so that's something to keep in mind if you're easily unsettled with public transit. The CTC is also similarly visited.

The take away for me though is that you can get away with parking several stops away along South Blvd. for free and paying $4.40 for a round trip pass to go to the club, a show or nice restaurant rather than paying the outrageous parking garage fees at the EpiCentre or elsewhere.

Sadly, with no wifi and no international plan, this sad American was forced to just duck into the first open place she saw. 

The first thing that I feel that I should say about this place is that they did little to disprove the probably very annoying stereotype that Canadians have to deal with that they put maple syrup on everything. Because I have never in my life been served sweet and sour pork using syrup until this night. And it was definitely syrup - no mistake about it. It didn't taste awful, but it was a bizarre experience for my taste buds. 

Secondly, the staff spoke no English. OK, probably to be expected at an authentic Asian restaurant, but it was to the point where the waiter couldn't understand when we were asking for water, another chair, or to order our food - very essential things! Finally someone else stepped in who was a bit better, but after a lot of painful blank stares.

He kept raving how great it was, and I was at first a bit skeptical because I have my usual favorite Thai spot.  But he was definitely right!
I ordered my usual meal of a vegetable medley with some type of meat covered in garlic sauce.  It's called Mixed Vegetables Delite at this location.  And with me currently being pregnant, I got it at a mild spice level.
It was absolutely delicious!  The dish had just the right amount of sauce to be flavorful, without it being too soup-y.  It came with a side of rice so it was nice to mix it all in get some of the sauce on the rice.  The spice level was just perfect for me!  Although I""m not sure I would categorize it as mild....although it could just be the pregnancy talking.  It had a small kick to it, which is what I was looking for!  But for those who hate spice and want the lowest spice setting, I think the mild still might be a bit too much.  But like I said, my taste buds have been a bit out of wack lately.
My husband ordered the Pad Thai both times we went, so I can only assume it must be amazing!  I tried a small bit of the tofu and it was great!  A bit crispy on the outside, but had the normal soft texture on the inside.  It was flavored so well that my husband didn't even realize it was tofu LOL.  He thought it might have been some scallop or type of seafood. HAH!  
They also give you a small bowl of coconut ice cream, although I'm not sure if this is the norm, a lunch special, or just a random act of kindness.  But it definitely helped complete our meal and the coconut was not too overpowering, which I loved!

However, I just brought in my car today for an oil change and it completely changed my mind about this business. I saw the special on their website where if you refer somebody to get an oil change here then you get a ""free oil change"". Just to make sure this was legit I called them a few weeks before telling them that I wanted to refer my wife to get her oil change and the gentleman specifically said that the referral process would be just fine and I would get the discount after my wife got her oil change on her car. Technically since I have a car that takes synthetic oil it wouldn't be able to be ""free"" but the gentleman said that I would pay for a conventional oil change which was roughly around $21. 

So I come in today expecting to get my ""referral price oil change"" to find out that all of a sudden the rules have changed and now the referral doesn't count if you refer a spouse or a family member? What kind of crap is that? So your saying that my families business isn't important but a random stranger's is? Just ridiculous. I told the gentleman working today that it was unfair that I was quoted the $21 just a week prior and now they are trying to turn the tables and say that I can't get the referral credit if I refer somebody in my family? How come the other two gentleman didn't tell me that when we were talking on the phone scheduling the appointment and the referral? Strange? 

The sad thing about this whole situation is that if they honored their word and simply gave me the discount that they promised me then I would definitely be returning for not only my oil changes but other issues going on with my car as well. Unfortunately, since I lost trust in this business no longer will I be returning but neither will my family since they don't care too much about their business anyways and I will also be telling friends to avoid this place as well.

4 or 5 years ago, I walked into Movies on Central looking for something or other.  I didn't find it, but liked the place all the same.  Good selection.  Actually, probably a better selection than anywhere else in town.  But seeing as I lived in Ahwatukee at the time, I didn't have much cause to make the trek.  Besides, Netflix had everything I needed.

Now that I live much closer and MoC (that abbreviation is probably annoying, but I'm tired) is more or less on my way home from work, I can stop in easily.  So I did last night, in search of a film called Dementia 13.  I called ahead to verify they had it and hopped in my car.  Central Ave is still a big pain in the ass thanks to light rail construction, but I got there with little trouble.  I don't have much more to say other than the selection is still great, the guy who helped me sign up was really friendly, and I'll probably be back.  I still have Netflix, but I look forward to MoC satisfying my appetite for instant gratification.",2008-07-08 14:40:46

My husband and I stopped in on Valentine's Day to check this place out for the first time. I immediately fell in love with the vibe inside. All the plants just gave it a great atmosphere feel. I also loved the patio area. 

We grabbed a seat at the bar. My hubby ordered one of the Hyde Brewing beers and I got a mixed drink (don't remember the name but it had whisky, raspberry puree, and club soda). Both drinks were good. The beer list was fairly extensive and included beers from other local breweries. We ordered the Wagyu beef with dipping sauce as an appetizer. Absolutely delish.

The concept sounded ok but when we went it was nearly deserted, save for a table that was given VIP service at the back.  It emptyness of the restaurant gave an uncomfortable vibe.

Anyways, the menu states that the signature cheese ribs has a minimum 2 order.  This stipulation meant that we were limited to just ordering that.  It was later on when another table came in that a customer inquired and the server said you could order one order of the cheese ribs but that it wouldn't be very much.  Well, it would've been nice to be given that option!

The presentation was nice, you get a large plate that has the cheese and corn, then the ribs on top.  The side dishes were small and not enough for two.  Imagine a spoonful of mashed potatoes spread thin, that's what we got.

The sides were: boiled sliced carrots, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, corn and one egg.  While the serving of cheese and corn (mixed in) was good for two, the other sides were very small.  

Each serving had 4 ribs which were alright but expensive for what we got.  There was one male server with glasses, he was pleasant and helpful.  

I got annoyed that the neighbouring table was checked and asked frequently how they were enjoying their meal and feedback was given.  We weren't asked how our meal was until the end.  Oh yeah, that table that the server was keen to speak with to get feedback, they got free desserts as compensation for their feedback and she was unhappy with her meal.  

I expressed the same comment, it was expensive for what we got and the fact that theres a minimum 2 per order for the cheese ribs is a setback.  But we didn't get a dessert.  Oh well.  

If you go this week during their soft opening, there's a 10% discount.  We ordered two pops but the pricing was different.  When I asked, the response didn't make sense, but whatever.  Supposedly, the menu may be a bit different when they get the knots worked out.",2017-08-02 06:17:17

The service was friendly and efficient and the wait to get our food was surprisingly mere minutes (less than 5). Cheap and fast.

Now the negatives. I ordered the orange beef and what I received did not taste anything like orange beef. The beef looked weird and there was way too much tasteless sauce. While eating I felt that this meal may have been pre-cooked or simply reheated. The tiny roll I got was absolutely tasteless and wasn't given some sauce to accompany it, a first for me.

The rice ball and veggies were decent, pre-heated or not. So I ate that and left half my beef in my plate.

I didn't feel Pho Moderne's lunch menu was anywhere close to authentic Vietnamese cuisine and while I didn't order a Pho or more traditional Vietnamese meal, this didn't meet my expectations. With the handful of Vietnamese places around the area, this could have been better.

A regular Reuben comes stuffed with 7 oz. of thick sliced smoked meat greatness. If you're feeling zaney, 'Zadie' size if for $2 and get 2 more ounces shoved in there. 9 oz. Reuben, friends. Prepare yourself!

Want to be a star of you office? Gruman's does catering. Order from them. I'm sure they have some sort of options for the outspoken veggies in your office, but I don't know what they are. Ma 

Their Smoked Meat Poutine is unreal. The smoked meat is a bonus, but this poutine really holds its own.

Things to know: There's a parking lot in front of Gruman's but you don't get to park in it. It's sort of unfortunate as there's only a few street parking spaces out front along the one-way street. I wish who ever owned the lot would be willing to let Gruman's have parking spaces in exchange for sandwiches. Everyone would win!

They're only open until 3:30 so you can get Smoked Meat Breakfast Poutine in the morning, a Reuben for lunch, but you'll have to skip picking up your 3rd straight smoked meat meal on the way home.

Everyone had recommended it but I wasn't entirely convinced that it'd be worth it being from California. Boy was I wrong. But I was probably sold when I was introduced to the Tres Amigos. I mean, who can resist trying unique twists on guacamole? It also helps that I can order two $3 build your own tacos and be completely satisfied. They also give you tortilla chips and salsa, of course.

 I love the fact that you can customize your order. (Also hate it because you can sometimes miss the taste factor if you get the wrong combination of ingredients). It's also overwhelming because I LOVE sauces and immediately want to add them all. Luckily, I was with seasoned Barrio customers and they called me off my impending saucy (and probably soggy) taco. 

Can we also talk about the guacamole!? This just tugs at my California girl heart. My favorite is the Tuscan guac. Something about the sweet balsamic sauce mixed with the basil on the salty tortilla chip just hits the spot. They also have the pineapple guac but it doesn't surpass the Tuscan one for me. Especially when the chunks of pineapple get scooped out of the bowl and accidentally fall on the table. The smoked salmon special was also great when they had it, though a little salty. The new special as of March is the cauliflower leek guac. Honestly, I don't think the cauliflower goes well with the guac - it gives it a sort of a smelly vegetable taste? (If that's a thing). The fried leeks on top were a nice touch but didn't add to the guac at all, and overall, it just tasted like salty avocados. They've always been so great about us asking to split the Tres Amigos between our group of three to four usually. 

I've been to the Tremont and the one in downtown Cleveland. If it's cold and you're coming during peak hours, you probably don't want to go to the Tremont one because you might be huddled by the door, or if you don't like to be pushed and feel like you're in the way, we stood outside while we waited. At least the one in downtown has a bigger waiting area, plus the arcade area has some tables and chairs. We took our buzzer there for a few minutes to get out of the way and then went back when we felt like we might be called. Not sure if the buzzer reaches there, but the area is right next to Barrio if you want to take a chance. Or, if you find space at the bar, you can get your drink on.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.

I love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.

The meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.

We then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.

I took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.

I did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.

I was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.

All in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.

Oh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )

Anyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out.",2009-03-25 18:45:14

The location of this place is difficult to find.....trust your GPS, it's probably right.  They operate out of the kitchen for Renaissance Catering and you have to knock on the kitchen door, which is on the left side of the front entrance.

Once we got inside, we met the owner and Jessica.  They were both very cool and showed us the 3 flavors that were available when we arrived.....Red Velvet, Coconut, and Plain.  I ordered 4 Red Velvet, 2 Coconut, and 2 Plain.....we needed a box, so it was $12 for all 8, what a great deal!

We took our little treasure box of Cupcakes and rushed to the car to eat a couple before we left.  I had a Red Velvet & Plain and my Son had a Red Velvet and Coconut.  They were awesome!!  The Red Velvet was soft & moist and melted in your mouth.....yum!  The Plain was light and fluffy....also very good.  They both had the right proportion of frosting on it too....nomilicious!  (see pics)

Overall, it was a fun adventure to find this hidden Cupcake heaven.  It was also hilarious because we saw fellow Yelper Tien and another car load of people driving up looking for the location like we did.  It felt like we were doing something illegal....ha!  The owner explained that she also does custom Cakes....I was thinking about getting a Chanel Purse Cake for The Better Half on her Birthday....we'll see.

The portion sizes are very generous and I've never left hungry (and I eat a lot too!)

Bestellen is a European tavern on the west side of the city. It has a bit of a dark and sultry feel, so I'd say a good choice of venue for your next Tinder date. They seem to specialize in high quality beef and pork, fresh to def ingredients, plus they apparently have a roof top garden.

Now I know this is the Burger Hunt, but I came here with a friend who treated me to some fun dishes that deserve recognition. First up we had their oysters served with horseradish. Not much to say here; they were nice. Then came the Pig Ear. They serve these guys as little slivers of (likely) deep fried goodness. The crispiness and salty temptation of these made me understand how easily I could become obese. Next up came the Burrata, which is generally a mozzarella outer shell filled with cream. It was served with candy cane beets, blood orange, and a green of some sort. The cheese was surprisingly light, and the sweetness of the blood orange gave it a welcome accent. Lastly, we got the oxtail croquettes. They were served with celeriac yogurt, and a stupidly fresh tasting salsa verde.

On to the main show! I walked into this not knowing anything about the menu, and when I saw that their burger selection was a single burger... put simply, I was concerned. My worries were briskly eased. The Bestellen Burger features a picturesque brioche bun that stands out from your typical bun in a great way. Once you really settle into that first bite though, things get a smidge emotional. They serve this bad boy with caramelized onions, raclette (a cheese), and a beef patty that rivals Toma's. My goodness was that a thick patty, and thank God because that tender meat melts in your mouth oh-so well, especially as the raclette and onions do the same.

By the end of it all I had big dilemma. Bestellen serves up a burger without a lot of the fanfare of the other restaurants on the Burger Hunt, but damn did they do the basics proud! As of right now, Bestellen has muscled Holy Chuck and Wahlburgers out of the #2 spot, and made Toma feel a little unsafe at the top spot. Still though, Toma is the Truth. Anyway, the hunt is almost over! Loved the experience Bestellen! (And much appreciated chef Jordan)",2016-03-11 03:34:10

Was not my favorite breakfast ever, but it satisfied the omelette cravings.
When we first got there, it was pretty empty, only a few people there, but we went on a week day. We sat ourselves and were quickly greeted by a server. We quickly decided what we wanted and ordered. I got an omelette with spinach, tomato, and mushrooms. Thought it was kind of weird that you either get a potato side or a toast side. Most places you get both, and for like the same price! However, I do like the wide selection of potato options. I went for the sweet potato tots. 
Our food came out super fast. Like kinda too fast. I was surprised how quickly our food came out. At first everything looked good. When I cut the omelette open I was disappointed to see that it was a little runny. Still was pretty good, but would have preferred my eggs to be completely cooked through. The sweet potato tots were very tasty and I enjoyed them! My date enjoyed his food as well, but agreed that it wasn't really worth the price. 
One thing that annoyed me a bit was that our server gave us our check like right after we started eating. Like she was nice and did a good job, but I always find it irritating when servers do that, makes me feel rushed! But other than that, no problems with the service.
Over easy is alright, not the best breakfast joint in the area, but nor the worst either. I'm in no rush to get back there, but wouldn't be totally opposed to coming back.",2014-12-07 03:09:28

However, the staff said they would not do it and I needed to contact the company myself. Moreover, I had 2 conversations over the phone with the office about this and both times I was told to bring them in so they could return them. This frustrated me right before surgery too. 

On the other hand, Dr Vatej is a very pleasant doctor and easy to talk to too. Mary came in and had me put on a paper robe and paper undies for the procedure. The doctor asked what kind of music I wanted and I chose relaxing. Mary put on Enya at the doctors request which was perfect for me. Dr Vatej then prepped my leg and area for surgery. I did not take the Valium because I had to drive myself and take care of things after. I felt the needle pricks but it wasn't excruciating. I just took deep breaths. On the third needle prick Dr Vatej stopped and said my vein is spasming and he couldn't finish. He apologized and suggested I reschedule and take the Valium next time. I was upset of course because who wants to go through it again and I was already upset with the staff over the stockings. I was told to wear the compression stocking over night, so Mary put on the stocking that I needed to return back on. 

The next day I called because I had questions about bruising and the veins being very noticeable. I also needed to know if I was suppose to keep wearing the compression stockings. I was told I would get a call back in 5 minutes but I did not. I'm now upset with this office. Moreover, after talking to Juxo, the compression stockings company, they told me the people I purchased it from is suppose to return it!! Unbelievable!!

We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that. 

The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping. 

Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while. 

To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience. 

From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shot",2009-11-11 21:28:06

One Friday night I decided to check it out with or without him---it ended up being without. I sat at the bar since I was there solo, and it took quite some time for someone to actually start serving me--- plenty of bartenders and servers walked by, and I didn't even get a, ""someone will be right with you.""

I almost left before being served, mostly because the smell of fish was so overpowering. I really do not like any kind of seafood at all, but I think it was a bit strong for someone who is okay with eating it. I stuck it out, and ordered just a burger. It was ok. Not worth the price. I could have gotten a much better burger for the same price, maybe even cheaper, elsewhere. The biggest thing keeping me from going back to this place is the thought of that fish smell.....yuck. The service was really not that great either.

If you like seafood, I would check it out. If not, there are better places in Lakewood to check out.",2013-09-25 19:48:33

The service was friendly and completely bilingual.

The fish is excellent, with a crispy batter and perfectly moist cod.

Also, they're licensed, with beer on tap (Boréale, I think), and Guinness, but that might come in a can, and wine. That's definitely a bonus.

TIP: if you have kids, get a large portion and share it with them. You'll have plenty - two pieces of fish for you and one for your child.

I mean it's like Doggie Disneyland in there! They've got treats of every flavor, other animals to smell and play with, and toys of every size, color, and squeak option. Not to mention the bakery always smells pretty tasty (even to me) and she can usually sucker somebody into a free sample. But I love it even more for the ""Wash"". 
In order to fully appreciate my love of Wag 'n Wash, you have to do some visualization: Just imagine what it might look like when my nervous black lab (who back then was a petite 70-pounds-of-pure-muscle) decides to make a run for it about five minutes into her first bath. 
Wait, did I mention that I have concrete floors? (slip, slop, slide) 
Oh, and a doggy door that leads straight to the freedom of a mostly dirt backyard? (run, roll, rub) 
Yeah. It was not pretty.

B75lUW0O6MgAk-X3zDx0_A,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,xNpD5ObRmK0q87f6QU283A,4,0,0,0,"A year ago I heard about how Chef Carles Abellan and his Tapas 24 concept was coming to Montreal. I didn't get a chance to visit any of his restaurants while in Spain so the notion of trying his cuisine at home was quite appealing. Finally, for the occasion of my grandfather's birthday, I found a good reason to head over.

Being a restaurant in Old Montreal, Tapas 24 certainly tries to make a impressive visually. With the front of the restaurant being entirely windowed, the major use of natural coloured wood on the walls and at the first floor bar makes the whole restaurant pop from the outside. The noise level was relatively loud but nothing abnormal for an Old Montreal restaurant. The service was pretty good for us throughout the night unlike some of what you can read elsewhere so I guess this can be hit or miss. In our case, we had absolutely no complaints.

Foodwise, we had originally planned to go for the MTL a table menu but decided instead to simply order from the regular menu and share everything in order to enjoy a greater variety of dishes. These are the perks of being a larger group in this instance. First up, a few staple items of Spanish tapas. There was the Coca con Tomato. Simple but oh so good. We then had the Iberian chorizo - freshly sliced and a perfect compliment to the bread dish. A spicy kick on top of the usual fattiness. The last of the staple trio was the patatas bravas. The fries themselves were nice and crispy but the key was the combination between the heat of the brava sauce and the creaminess of the aioli. These were so good that we had 3 separate orders over the course of the evening!

The next set of dish were a little more unique. First up, la bomb de Barceloneta - a potato and meat croquette topped with the same aioli and brava sauce as before. Pretty good overall. Each individual croquette was rather big - lots of potato and meat stuffed inside. Great crunch on the outside without losing any moisture inside.

Next up were the garlic shrimps with hot peppers. A solid dish but one that, compared to the rest, lacked any real punch or spark. Enough so that I even forgot to take a picture, so there you go. 

We also have the strangely named Bikini Comerc 24 which essentially are mini grilled sandwiches of tramezzini, Iberian ham, mozzarella di buffalo and truffles. Extremely delicious - the combination of iberian ham and cheese is always a winner... and that is even before we add the truffles. The only complaints are these were how small they were.

The tuna with ponzu sauce was a hit at our table. The tuna was beautiful - nice sized pieces well seasoned also. The ponzu added a nice hint of citrus to mix with the sweetness of the tomato. A light but well executed dish.

Next were the boneless chicken wings with alegre sauce. Here, my camera failed me due to poor lighting but take my word for it, they are worth ordering next time you visit. The chicken was wonderfully moist and tender - simply fell apart using a fork. Great dish.

The final main tapas was actually a main that we added - oxtail stew with potato puree. The oxtail was amazing. The meat and fat was so cooked down that the two bones in the plate appeared to have never had any meat on them once we pulled the meat off them. Beautifully meaty and fatty goodness.

Now, after all of the food, we may think that we were too full for dessert... and you would be wrong. There is always room for dessert, especially these ones. We went with three to share amongst the group. First, we had the molten chocolate fritters. Hot dark chocolate in a fried ball with some powdered sugar... what is there not to like!? They may be too tart for some as it is dark chocolate but delicious nevertheless.

The second option was fresh ricotta and honey- a huge contrast when compared to the previous dish. Personally I loved the combination - a fresh and light alternative to standard dessert options. The sweetness of the honey worked very well with the creaminess of the ricotta. May not be everyone's jam from a texture point of view but it worked for me.

Lastly, we have in my opinion the best of the group - chocolate, bread, olive oil and fleur de sel. Milk chocolate mousse with a hint of olive oil, a touch of salt and a crunchy crouton. Simple but so wonderful in execution. Loved every bit of this one.

All in all, with all the food and a few good bottles of wine, we left full and very satisfied of our experience at Tapas 24. The one stickler would be price point as this definitely wasn't a cheap evening. Be prepared to pay more than you probably expect. I saw a lot of negative reviews for this restaurant early on... other than the overpriced issue, I experienced none of what others have apparently faced here. In my eyes, Tapas 24 is definitely a worthwhile visit. It may not be Barcelona but I'll take it. I suppose that your mileage may vary however.

Menu offers:
- European sandwiches
- Asian sandwiches
- Gourmet coffee
- Smoothies, Asian iced drinks and Italian sodas
- Housemade ice cream

We've never had the urge to order the European sandwich.  The Asian one's all come with pickled shredded daikon and carrots, sliced onions, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo mixed with soy sauce on a crusty house-baked 10inch baguette.  

Tip: If you're not eating it right away, ask for veggies on the side - otherwise the whole thing gets soggy.  This way it still tastes good the next day after toasting.  Plus they always give you more this way.

Our standard picks are:

#1. Lee's Combination Sandwich $2.20
- ham, headcheese (offcuts from the head of a pig/calf rolled in gelatin) and pate
- great contrast of textures and flavors between the 3 kinds of meat: crunchy headcheese vs soft pate (I can just picture some of you wincing.)

# 5. Grilled Pork Sandwich $2.20
- Grilled Vietnamese-style vs Chinese BBQ (#6), which we don't like as much because it's too sweet - we prefer savory with just a hint of sweetness and the charred smokiness from the grill

Cafe Sua Da $2.20 
- Vietnamese drip coffee with crushed ice
- Lee's signature drink which they also make into ice cream
- As much caffeine as a quadruple shot

Too bad this is the only one in Arizona.  There are almost 30 in California.  Props to the owners - this is the most well-run Asian fastfood chain on the West Coast or maybe the US.  Evidence of their success is in the ridiculously large shiny space, huge baguette machine and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Fastfood never looked this good.

Yet again, we had to book the pups for another out of town trip.  I find the staff friendly and well humored, and they seem to care both about my dogs and in answering my questions that my dogs are okay and attended to.  I've brought my own food every time, and the staff has always been perfectly fine with me bringing treats, pills, toys, blankets, etc.

I think one of my dogs got a little bit of kennel cough from this last trip, but overall, she's fine and happy to be home.

I feel bad for this place due to the ""horror stories"" that other reviews have apparently experienced here, resulting in some pretty harsh reviews.  Certainly, I can't be the only person in Vegas who has had positive experiences here.  I mean, I keep bringing my dogs back, and I love my dogs, so obviously I'm not going to willingly put them in a poor environment.  My dogs aren't coming home covered with huge gashes or feces, and only twice have they had a cold, under colder weather conditions.  They do have heaters for the dogs and close them off from the wind, though, so it's not like they are left out in the freezing elements overnight.

It's a loud place with a lot of barking dogs.  It's more than what my dogs are used to at home, but I can't bring my pups on my travels, so it's either this or don't go anywhere.  The rates went up a little bit, but it's still personally reasonable.

They brought bread at the start which was meh - didn't taste fresh or anything. But they pured a decent balsamic vinegar for us, and had an olive oil on the table which I didn't try.

The food came fairly soon, and was great. My friend had the ravioli which she said was very good. Her portion was quite small though. The fetuccine with wild mushroom and italian sausage was good. The sausage was crumbled and though I didn't taste a lot of mushroom, the dish was delicious anyway. The portion of the fettucine was quite good. There were three white wines and three red wines if you go by glass. They range from $6.5 to $12 a glass.

The tiramisu was excellent and probably one of the best I've had. It's a white chocolate tiramisu. Definitely worth a try.

Pricing - I thought personally it's a tad bit overpriced. For this location and type of restaurant, I'd expect about $12-14 a pasta. I pay $15-20 for far more gourmet pastas and experiences.

I can't speak for any component except for the pasta (unfortunately), since after coming here twice it seemed like the best deal. It's served with salad, soup, and garlic bread. 

The good: The salad is good. It's not watery like a lot of other places. Drizzled with what seems like a soy sauce vinaigrette but I could be wrong. Soup was a grainy cream of potato. Definitely something I don't come across often!

The bad: So both times I came in, I've had some bad luck of the draw. Though the spaghetti is thin and is cooked al dente, it resembles ""Sidekick"" pasta, which is common in Japanese cuisine. I'm envious that both times I went my friend's mushroom garlic butter pasta/unagi don tasted relatively good, but something always seemed to be lacking on my plate.

Mesa - this restaurant has been staring me in the eye for ages and I finally got to take it on with great results.  

The menu is a Southern Tex-Mex style and lots of style indeed.  Dishes are flavorful and fairly bold in their interpretations of classic dishes you may be used to.  One of the early delights is the included bread basket with a lot of tasty choices.  My personal favorite was the blueberry scone and another really interesting bread concoction (not sure if it was a zucchini bread?)  My table ordered a variety of dishes from there (they also have a fairly robust wine list and margarita list as well along with a full bar menu) that ranged from lamb salads to amazing looking waffles.  From the dishes I tried, I surprisingly loved the tiger shrimp tamale the most.  The presentation was not only very well done but the flavors of both the tamale and the well-spiced tiger shrimp hit the spot.   

My only small complaints were that some of the dishes didn't seem as strong as the others.  The house margarita (I believe called the patrida) was a little more hit-or-miss - not as sweet but not as flavorful as other margaritas I've had either.  The Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash also was a little more on the not-so-sure side.  I liked the presentation but the dish came out a little colder than expected and the sweet potato hash wasn't as flavorful.  Perhaps an off day for the dish?  

Service was excellent for sure (friendly, fun and keeping tabs on us regularly) and brunch on a Saturday was surprisingly not that busy.  The decor has a fun fire theme throughout the entire restaurant that goes from the ceilings to the lighting - I really dug the theme.  

All-in-all, Mesa is a fantastic restaurant stop and the brunch doesn't burn the wallet either.  A worthy check out.",2015-10-14 04:23:40

Sauce is a good place if you want lunch while you are out shopping, but don't want typical mall food court options.  It's similar to a place like Pei Wei, where you place your order at the counter and your food is brought to you at a table.  I ordered the grilled cheese panini (mozzarella, fontina and cheddar), a slice of cheesecake, and a glass of Riesling.  My total was $15 for those three items, so not too bad at all.  The sandwich was delicious...the cheeses were melted together perfectly and they all complimented each other very well.  The cheesecake was nothing spectacular...not bad, but not amazing.  My friend's salad looked delicious, so much so that a woman came over and asked her about it.  

My only two negatives about Sauce are:
*the wine list was a bit lacking for a place that says it's a pizza and wine place...I think there was only like six choices or so for wine.
*you can't take your wine outside, according to the guys behind the counter. So if you want to eat outside, don't order any wine.  We saw people outside drinking beer, so I'm not sure what the complete story is.",2008-01-27 00:46:21

I ordered the mango banana oatmeal sweetened with honey. While I was sitting down waiting for my smoothie to be made, the male employee asked me if he should use juice or milk and I told him whatever the recipe calls for. He pulls out a book to see how to make the smoothie.

When I tasted the smoothie, the ratios were off. There was too much ice which made every ingredient taste watered down and gave the smoothie a slush like consistency. I could hardly make out the banana or mango and even though the menu says sweetened with honey it tasted artificially sweetened.

A monstrosity of a review for a truly exquisite meal and memorable experience.  

From the plush velvet upholstery and red rose accented lounge to handcrafted crystal chandelier suspended above the lush purple dining room. 

Known around the world as ""Chef of the Century,"" legendary French Chef Joel Robuchon has come out of retirement to open his very first and only fine dining French restaurant in the United States.  As a AAA 5 Diamond Award Winner, this meal had a lot to live up to.  

Reservations were made in advance online about a week before we landed in Vegas.  A credit card is needed to secure the reservation.  I made the request of more private seating, and we received one of the four sumptuous corner booths in the 12 table main dining room.  There is also an artificial patio outside for dining.

We were greeted by a willowy and surly middle aged French gentleman.  No smile, no how are you, just 'How can I help you?'  Maybe it was my fault, we arrived 5 mins early to our 5:30pm reservation, I was ogling and capturing pictures of the petit four cart.  I soon forgot about his cold arrogant demeanor as we stepped into the fireplace furnished dining room.

He walked us to our booth, where the table was elegantly set, and pulled out in anticipation of our arrival.  

When the bread cart arrived, yes it was a CART of 18 kinds of bread, we were verbally led through the varieties and then given an opportunity to choose at our leisure.  The bread was delicious and decadent.  I was especially fond of the brie and pesto brioche.  

Our server had a wonderful quiet demeanor and a rich deep baritone voice.  He explained each course in great detail, and catered to our every whim.  

Darren, our Sommelier was a riot from the beginning to the end.  He offered his expertise on wine, coyness when asked about Marcel from Bravo's Top Chef and entertained with a delightful dance while choosing the perfect wine.  He was aware that Marcel worked at Robuchon, but by the time he started, Marcel had already left the restaurant.  My boyfriend was greatly amused by Darren's process of sniffing, swirling, taking a few steps back, forward and then sipping the wine.  

There is no set wine pairing price here, the Sommelier just works with the client to determine the pace and taste.    

Most tasting menus are not for the timid, usually holding a few items that are less pleasing to one's palate.  Robuchon, proved that he could whip up 16 courses to consistently excite and tantalize me throughout the meal.  

Before our meal began, our server asked if we were allergic or not particularly fond of any items.  I mentioned that sea urchin was difficult for me to hold down.  He let us know that he could remove it entirely and replace the course with another item or he could mention to the Chef to lighten up on the delicacy.  I opted for the latter.

La Pomme
Apple gelee, yuzu granite and chutney
Opened up the palate, tart, and refreshing.  

Le Caviar Oscietre
Oscetra caviar topped with a delicate asparagus cream
One of our favorites, a perfect blend of ingredients.

La Truffe blanche
Truffled langoustine ravioli with diced cabbage
A signature dish, and my personal favorite, the truffles were creamy and the ravioli skin was cooked al dente caressing the shellfish oh so lovingly, and gotta love the brussel sprout!  

Le Thon
Smoked and seared Tuna, cauliflower, Nori and green curry
Very creative way of presenting cauliflower, crushed finely and mixed with nori

La Noix de Saint Jacques
Spaghetti and scallops with chanterelles and shellfish jus
The chanterelles fragranced the dish lightly, while the spaghetti and scallops danced in the jus.

L'Oursin
Sea Urchin, potato puree with a hint of coffee
First time I finished a sea urchin course, nothing was fishy, excellent puree.

La Chataigne
Light cream of chestnuts on top of delicate celeriac custard
The presentation with the fall leaves and the choice of chestnuts really brought forth the spirit of the season, the sprinkled bacon on top put it over the top.

Le Potiron
Gnocchi of pumpkin with mimolette and truffles
The potato pillows were heavenly and the truffles added an elegant touch.

Le Turbot
Turbot baked in a cocette with grilled matsutake 
Wonderfully firm fish with a delicious delicate flavor.

Le Bar
Pan fried sea bass w/the skin & 5 spices, w/verjus sauce
Pan seared and buttery soft.  

Le Homard
Lobster under a disappearing saffron hostie in a seafood boullion
Loved the mini lobster head accenting the side of the plate and the rosemary stir stick, which brought out a fabulous aroma to the broth.  

Le Boeuf de Kobe
Grilled Kobe beef w/watercress tempura, horseradish mustard
Tender, cooked rare and I enjoyed dredging the pieces of cow through the mustard.

L'Epeautre
Sault farrow prepared risotto style, gold leaf
Buttery goodness.",2006-11-29 06:16:09

For our main course, I always order the Petite Filet while my husband usually gets the Chilean Sea Bass. Both are delicious.

Because we continued to lease through them for our next vehicle they were super helpful and really gave us many benefits to re-lease through them. Recently we had also been in an accident and the first place we towed our vehicle to was Country Hill Toyota Collision Centre. It took a very long time due to waiting for parts and the extensive damage but we picked it up in perfect and new condition. The team kept us updated every once in a while and whenever we called in to check the status they always had an answer. They even offer a full warranty for the first year of repairs and beyond (with a bit of deductible on the owners part.) I've dealt with Country Hill Toyota since the purchase of my 2007 RAV4 and have nothing but praises for the team. We're a Toyota family because the reliability is unmatched.

After making reservations for 25 plus people, the Red Room made the claim that that would be, ""no problem.""  NO - PROBLEM.  As in, not one little problem.  As if it should be easy.

Look, I understand wanting to seem like you're pleasing everyone, but here's the thing - eventually those people that put in the reservations are going to show up.  And, when you bring them to an alcove that could easily fit 25 people comfortably, they will be pleased.

Now, when you tell them you only have half that space, and they have to cram in, shoulder to shoulder, all the way around, that's less than ideal.

I've never been at a bar where people were yelling to get out, because they were having onsets of claustrophobia... until I visited the Red Room.

It's dark, it's dingy, and it's loud.  And it's cramped...  but only when you make reservations.  The other guests were spread out.  If the whole bar was as cramped as we were, they could have fit twice the people.

Sounds like I'm complaining, right? Well, I'm not trying to. I mean, this place is good. Don't get me wrong! I s'pose if you enjoy Ethiopian food and eating with your hands (and strange textures and really thin bread), then this is the place for you. 

I give it 4 stars for what it is: a really good Ethiopian restaurant... With, if you didn't know, really good chai tea. Oh, and the food... Well, I'll let you decide for yourself. Maybe it's your end all, be all.",2007-10-09 16:48:34

The main benefactor was my son as he finally has a decent style to his cut. The stylist listened to what I told her and added her own touch - he looks great. Much better than that cheap place we usually go to. 

As a first time client you get a free MVP upgrade which is the hot towel, shampoo and massage.

It's twice what I normally pay - not sure I can justify my own cut here all that much but I think it'll serve a nice treat. That's the star deduction - too pricey in my opinion.",2010-09-16 01:47:34

This is one of the better hibachi grills in the area.  They put on a decent show and you know what you are eating is at least going to taste like the delicious shrimp sauce they dole out by the gallon.  We typically go at lunch and end up stinking out the office when we return from the greasy hibachi smell that just sticks to you for hours.  

Benihana serves up some sushi, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.  Stick to what is cooked in front of you, there is no reason to stray away from that.

Where they really stick it to you is the bar.  Their drinks are ridiculously expensive, so stick to beer- no mixed drinks.  They aren't strong and cost a fortune.

Had a craving for some tacos and, voila, here we go! 

Let me first of all say, I like tacos. I've had some amazing ones over the years and the things that makes them amazing are the freshness of the ingredients, the quality/tenderness of the meat, the imaginative combos, and the double wrap homemade tortillas. And yes, Casa Reyna has all of those!  And they were cheap! Got my belly full with 4 ""mini"" tacos,for $9. Two carnitas (very good) and two tinga (excellent chicken option). I also sampled my wife's el pastor and that will be my next choice for sure. That one was fabulous. Lots of salsa choices makes for great chip dipping. I am such a fan of that!

The last experience I had in the restaurant was easily the worst. The waiter barely paid attention to our table, and that was problematic because my vegan burger was completely burnt. It was blackened on both sides. By the time they were able to redo the burger, everyone at my table was finished. I ate part of the burger and tried the get a box for the salad I paid extra for, since I was the only one left eating, and after getting a hold of the waiter and asking for a box, he never came back to the table. He walked past our table several times tending to other tables, but I couldn't grab his attention. I left infuriated, without my salad and the leftover food I had just paid for.

I've also noticed they tend not to pay attention to you if it's just two people at the table and the servers tend not to know exactly what's in your food--something important when I order vegan friendly food. The bean side wasn't labeled that it contained meat, and the waitress (whom I told I was vegan) happily served me the beans.

I recently got transferred over to a new location for my job, & I was pretty bummed out because I had all of my ""go to"" lunch spots by my old store.  Luckily I came across some great reviews of the Bronze Café on yelp & I'm glad I can add this spot onto my new list of lunch spots.

The first time I came to this Café I got lost trying to find it.  I was expecting a stand alone café but it's actually inside a community center.  When you get inside, it somewhat resembles a student services center or library.

Now on to the menu, there were a ton of things I saw on the menu that I wanted to try but I went with the more popular items that were reviewed.

FOOD:

LGBTQ- A twisted version of the class BLT that we're all used to.  This one definitely takes the cake!  I love anything with bacon & this sandwich not only has strips of maple bacon, but also bacon jam spread onto their ciabatta bread.  I was a little hesitant about the cucumber but it actually compliments that sandwich and gives it that fresh little crunch when you eat it. I crave this sandwich often! (my favorite)

Green Goddess Chicken Salad Sandwich-  This sandwich was really delicious and although its chicken salad you don't feel the heaviness of a typical chicken salad in your stomach.

Hummus- Their hummus is really tasty & they serve it with warm pita bread.  It's a great side dish that only costs an additional $2.25 if you get a sandwich.  Sometimes I'll just get the hummus by itself and eat that for a light lunch.

Vegan Banana Boy Bait-  I'm not a fan of bananas or banana flavored items, but the Banana Boy Bait is an exception!  I sometimes just crave this and this alone, it could be a good snack or even a dessert.  It's not too sweet and the banana flavor isn't too overpowering.




DRINKS:

Vegan coconut almond blend-  This was the first drink I purchased here and I really liked the concept.  It's blended with coconut water and they added almond butter for texture.

But my all time favorite drink from the Bronze Cafe is the Matcha Green Tea Blended.  The drink is not too sweet and not too heavy, it's my favorite green tea smoothie I've ever had here in Vegas.",2013-12-10 23:43:02

(It's about a block away from T&T, at the old Golden Turtle plaza, tucked away in the corner.)

The bakery itself is pretty BIG with a large square counter in the middle (a side each for cakes/pastries, deli meats, olives, & cheeses), a hot table in the back corner, racks for bread/buns, another cheese fridge, a coffee bar, & a separate seating area.

After choosing 1 slice, I asked the lady behind the counter for recommendations.  She said, ""Next time, get this (strawberry shortcake) and this (a chocolate covered eclair)!""  I love it when workers are so passionate about their products that they go as far as to offer up suggestions.  :)

What surprised me - and added *s - was the fact that pastries were pretty cheap.  (Shh...please don't tell the owners I said that!)  For example, the 2 slices of Tiramisu/Caramel Cheesecake that I got were at least 2 portions AND $2.50ea.  Where in the world would you find those prices?

Examples of other pricing includes:  Natas - $1.10, Donuts - $0.99, loaves of bread for $2-3 dollars.  The average price of the pastries/sweets were ~$2 for decently sized items.

The 2 cakes that I got, to-go, were not only fresh, but also not overly sweet!  I'll definitely be back.",2015-02-09 02:12:27

So tempting... but I forgot about this amazing bag when I stumbled upon two quality sweaters thirty seconds later. One was Design History, which is a brand currently sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans, and Bluefly, for only $25. I also found Adrienne Vittadini flats for $29, Meri Meri cupcake kits for $7, Woodwick candles for $10-12, and a luxurious Tahari throw blanket for $29. I walked out of the store minus $120 in my debit account with at least $300+ of product.

I've also been delightfully surprised by the cleanliness of the store and the fitting rooms and by the friendliness of the staff. I was having an issue with my debit card while there, and the two associates that I worked with were very helpful and understanding about the issue.

Love how the guajillo pepper and salsa verde bring the shrimps, fish, scallop and lobster together.

Luckily, the food is worth the drive out to the area and the high price tag. Had three dishes, including a pasta with crabmeat, a pasta with shrimp, and a ravioli with corn. The crabmeat pasta stood out the most, with a light lemon sauce--I'd have added capers but it was ok as is.

UHDqzQ4OX4QffwEXJenAvQ,RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ,cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,4,18,7,11,"My taste buds got a sneak peak of Windosr back in March. I was a cocktail judge for the Arizona BBQ Festival and the friendly folks from Postino's introduced Windsor as a contestant in the whiskey competition. As I sipped a refreshing cocktail with only a subtle hint of whiskey, I made a mental note that as soon as Windsor opened their doors, I'd hop, skip and jump there as soon as possible. So with that, today was the day I made it through the whimsical doors of Windsor. 

I met fellow yelper, Christina P for a patio lunch at this new Central Phoenix restaurant. Similar to its neighborhood brother, Postino's, Windsor's architecture has the same modern and minimalistic feel to it from the exterior, but once you walk through the doors, you enter an entirely different world. Parking is extremely limited at Windsor, but I decided to risk it and found one last spot on the side of the residential street. However, I don't think this residential parking will last long, so I suggest saving yourself a possible ticket and valeting it instead. 

Atmosphere: 

Like I mentioned above, Windosr is completely unassuming from the outside. I had no idea that it was so open and airy throughout the interior of the restaurant and they also have two patios in the back. One patio is smaller and more intimate, and the other is a little larger and seats more. Both are quirky and fun as well as airy but protected from the sun by an overhang. I felt like I was lunching on the back patio of a stylish friend's house. The tables are close together, but I never felt like I was in another table's conversation or they were in mine. This is a great restaurant for patio dining and I could see it not being too hot in the summer should I crave an outdoor lunch. The staff was also friendly and attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke, which is always a plus in my book. 

Decor:

I love the decor of the Windsor. Think retro chic. Everything is very clean and minimalistic but once you look closer, you see how retro and fun everything is. Take the cassette tape wall for example. Yes, it's an actual cassette tape wall and all of the cassettes are authentic and awesome. They have everything from Genesis and AC/DC to MC Hammer and homemade workout mix tapes. It's almost like a memory wall for those who are products on the 80s or earlier! The bathrooms are funky, the walls have funky writing on them and the whole decor resembles a classed up garage that's been converted into a bar/restaurant. 

Food:

Now moving on to the food. The menu is just as retro as the decor in the sense that they have classic items with a twist. They have everything from hot dogs and a crab cake BLT to pastrami Reuben and of course plenty of salads and starters. I am excited to go back and continue to try items off the menu, but today I decided to go for the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich which has pulled chicken with oven dried tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and herbs topped with avocado, watercress & green goddess goat cheese. Yes, it was as good as it sounds, but note that this is a cold chicken sandwich and not warm. It was a tasty sandwich but I think it would have been better heated. We also tried the Kale leaves as an appetizer. If you are a fan of Kale, you'll probably enjoy them. They also come with a chive mayo sauce that tastes a lot like the sauce you get with artichokes. 

Between the food, atmosphere and decor, I really like Windsor and plan on adding this to my Central Phoenix rotation. Between Postino and Windsor, I am one happy camper!",2011-05-10 04:49:15

Sweet potato fries - yum! 

Alligator Basket with fries - Served like popcorn chicken in little fried popcorn nugget like pieces. Fried and seasoned nicely. Served with fries

Oysters on a half shell - very fresh. Yum! Come for happy hour m-th 12pm-5pm for $1 oysters n $2 beers

I have to say that I really like the look and decor of this restaurant; while I was there for an evening out with my friends, there was a table beside us that were clearly having a business meeting over dinner. It had some really nice architectural features and while it felt cozy, it still felt open with the windows facing out to the street and the windows that face into The Bay.

I was expecting a heavier dinner experience based on some of the other reviews for here, but I still wanted to get a good sense of what the food was like. We all agreed on splitting a poutine for the appetizer and I ended up going with the chef special, which was pulled pork tacos with ""the works"". 

The poutine was great, my one friend and I polished off most of it. Great flavor, just the right amount of cheese and gravy. I could have had two of those for dinner and called it a night. 

The tacos were surprisingly amazing - I wasn't really sure what I wanted when I arrived - I was tempted to try the mac and cheese but from what I've seen on here, the portion size is huge and its rather heavy. I wasn't really feeling like a comfort-food kind of meal so the chef special looked like a pretty good option. Nice small warm soft tortillas with pulled pork, guacamole, jalapenos and a whole lot of other stuff. There may have been onions and or tomatoes; it was so good that I didn't really stop to take a good look at what was in side. There were three tacos on the plate with a small cup of fresh salsa-ey-veggie mix - the tacos were maybe six inch rounds? So not huge and not difficult to handle either. They had quite a spicy kick to them but all of the flavors meshed together quite well and each bite was super flavorful. I was a tad disappointed with the salad that came on the side - it had yellow and red tomatoes, avocado and a few other things... the avocado pieces were a nice balance to the heat from the tacos but the rest of the mix just seemed kind of watery and lacking in flavor. I ate all the avocado out and left most of what else was there. 

I was a bit surprised at the portion sizes for everyone's entrees; one of my friends got the pickerel taco & apple-cucumber salad and the other one got the onion glazed pork shoulder with spaetzel. The pickerel-taco dish didn't look like it had very much food on the plate but I think it was sufficient - the pork was a decent sized plate and I did get to try the spaetzel and it was delicious. However, I think that looks are deceiving. My dinner didn't LOOK very large when it came to the table but it was a good size for dinner and it wasn't overpowering. 

We were all still just hungry enough to try out the Warm Smores Pie, which was AMAZING. I mean, you can't go wrong with chocolate and marshmallows but it was a really great balance of all the flavors. And it was gone pretty quickly so I'm sure my dining partners enjoyed it as well :)

The huge standout for me was the service we received at Bannock. Our server was just the right amount of attentive; I noticed in some of the earliest reviews that people felt the service was overbearing and that they were being interrupted during their meals. Our server got it bang on - he knew just when to stop by and ask if we needed anything or if everything tasted good, etc. He was friendly and rather funny but not in a forced way - it was refreshing to get such good service!

I definitely want to go back here and try out some of the dishes that they're known for, like the roast duck poutine pizza and the macaroni and cheese. I'll absolutely go back to Bannock again in future and if you're in the area and looking for some quality food with a nice but laid back environment, Bannock is just the ticket.",2012-03-19 03:31:04

Now I have driven by a million times and have read a few of the reviews that pop up but really I HAD NO IDEA what an amazing place this is!  

As I approached the counter I could not believe the selection in front of me....and I ordered a philly.  Silly me.  I love the ""by the slice"" idea so you can sample a couple different styles of pizza.  There was a great selection from pizza to garlic knots...down to the little dessert complimentary by the cashier.  I told the guy I will definitely be back to do some pizza since that is their thang and that is what everyone raves about.

Contrary to the other reviews the main guy was a sweetheart.  I think people just misunderstand the NY edge.  The place was vibrantly decorated-fresh and modern with a New York feel.  Outdoor seating is available but no one was sitting out there. The chairs and table looked metal - OUCH!  They sure are cute but I dont see myself sittin on those in the summer....this is Vegas boys. Lol 

Now for my Philly, first off their bread is baked fresh.  I ordered the regular which is the 6"" but really it looked more than a 10"".  It was huge.  The bread as I said was so good I could eat it alone....so fresh.  The meat with grilled onions was so flavorful.  You could actually taste that it was steak.  There was so much meat I could only eat half the sandwich.  The cheese I believe was american but didnt overpower the sandwich. Soo so yum.  I brought the second half to the BF at the end of the day and the sandwich was just as good warmed up-I know because I had to have another bite.  I have had the turkey/provelone before that someone ordered me and that sandwich was no joke either.  BTW my boss ordered the Staten Island and its his fav out of the sandwiches.

Here's a brief rundown-  1st visit I shared ticoz burgers had a Deep Blue salad.  Divine.  Loved the Sangria.  2nd visit I took my 12 year old, who had the palm frond and I the Latin passion salad.

3rd (or 4th)  visit- with friends, had a couple mojitos and shared pork tostaditas, green corn tamales, guacahummus, and chop chop salad.

Last I recall- this summer- met my sis, we had a couple mojitos, shared 2 ticoz burgers, tostadillas and lettuce wraps.

Food is consistently fresh- wait staff is friendly and attentive, and the environment exudes an ""all are welcome"" feel.  I appreciate the electletic melding of foods and think that their chef is a forward-thinking risktaker.  If you want prectable, go to Applebee's.

But - family came to visit for the weekend and wanted to go here, sooo we tried it out. It's definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, but I can see how people wouldn't like it. I personally got the pulled pork sandwich, which was different from other ones I've had. It was a lot sweeter, but I enjoyed it. The bread was completely soggy as soon as it was set on the table though, so I was forced to eat it with a fork. The rest of the family thought their meals were pretty good too. The prices were decent for a restaurant directly on the strip and the food was alright. Downside- we asked multiple times if they could change the television directly in front of us to a baseball game. They told us every time they would, but never did. Kind of annoying! Overall, this place is just OK. However, it is a good place to stop at if you're on the strip and want a decent meal and don't feel like spending an outrageous amount of money.",2010-10-29 08:29:39

We all made our decisions, I took the Chicken breast combo, It has 2 grilled chicken breast, And for my 2 sides I went with a Garden salad with vinaigrette and sauteed Veggies, I am a low carb eater so this was perfect for me. My wife ordered a grilled chicken wrap with Hummus and my little girl got chicken strips and mac and cheese. 

The food came out pretty quick and off we went, dive right in, the meals came with a pita bread as well which I gave to my wife for her hummus but that small cup of white stuff I was not sure about. Once we opened it up ""Oh my garlic"" it was so incredible, the chicken was tender and moist and went perfect with the garlic sauce. The fresh Vinaigrette and salad was also nice due to the freshness.

My experience was no where close. I contemplated ordering a past dish that my colleague next to me ordered but minus the meat. But went with the only vegetarian meal on the menus that I could see - a Veggie Burger and fries. Another colleague also ordered the same dish but without the goat cheese that comes with it. The servers mixed up our order and I knew they mixed up but was not in a mood to send it back, because the other colleague had already started the meal.

Now the quality of the burger - I expected the burger to be premium - but it was not even close. I have had veggie burgers just about everywhere Licks, Hero, Harveys, Burger King, etc. Trust me the the burgers at Harveys beats Moxies hands down. For $14+ for a burger and fries, in my opinion was a waste.

The restaurant was busy but not packed. The refill on my drink came in at least 15 minutes after requesting it. BTW, there was a mandatory 18% gratuity included in the bill!

And I am glad that I did not order the pasta dish - in my colleagues opinion it wasn't good and yes they err'ed her order as well.

PROS: we were seated relatively quickly;  pretty decent beer; server was friendly and took satisfactory care of our table of 8; entire staff seemed like an organized, hard working team

CONS: the food. I understand bar food is not haute cuisine, but 4 Peaks was just blah. Pizza undercooked--literally, dough was still moist in parts. Worse? You could tell just by looking at the pizza it needed 5 more minutes in the oven--why even serve it? Next issue: change the fry oil! Over half our table got something of the fried variety (I really hate bar food). In every case, the fried food had that really dark brown quality, indicating the fryer oil should have been changed after the lunch rush earlier that day! After I sent the pizza back and waived off the offer for a new one or another meal selection, I accepted a chicken strip from a table mate. It tasted as gross as it looked.

True, the beer was okay (I was drinking one of their IPAs), and I appreciated the hard working staff (BTW, server and manager came to table to apologize for the pizza I sent back AND comped us a pitcher of beer). I accepted the noise and the need to nearly yell to communicate, but I didn't like it.  But at the end of the day, the real issue was the quality of the food--poor to marginal.  I won't return.

If you actually want your coffee and your coffee made correctly then I would advise you to drive by or just go home and brew your own and ad some syrup , it's cheaper and will taste better.

Please ...please teach the baristas how to make an iced skinny vanilla latte , seems if I go anytime before 9 am it's too busy and the quality is very very poor and so is the service. I went through the drive thru which takes forever and got my drink tasted it told them to remake it ( it was not a skinny late , not sure what it was ) again same thing , again same thing. So I left through the coffee in the trash went to the near by Albertsons where there is a Starbucks and ordered there , they got my drink right and it was amazing. I rarely go to this Albertsons anymore too busy , bad drinks, and Friday they didn't give me my change , yeah it was only 4 cents but still.

Little did we know that our group would discover exactly why this is the case during our visit. It's especially noteworthy that I came with a large group that made a reservation with specific instructions about what we wanted. Our evening plans had been made well in advance, and Soho knew - or should have known - exactly how many people would be in our party, and when we would arrive. Most of all, they should have known we had not only asked for a table to be ready, we had asked for water and very specific appetizers to be ready for our group, as we would be hungry after the event we enjoyed before the happy hour. 

Well, as you can probably guess from my rating, making a reservation and discussing and confirming our needs with the staff well in advance made absolutely no difference in the quality of our visit. In fact, I can summarize my entire visit here in two words: we waited.

We waited for them to confirm we had a table after we walked in at 7:15. We waited for the sever to come after they finally confirmed that yes, a reservation had been made. We waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus. We waited for these drinks, and for water. And we waited for our pre-ordered appetizers. 

Absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner. In the 35 minutes that I waited with the group, all I got was a water. None of the pre-ordered appetizers even arrived while I was there, and many people waited 10 to 15 minutes for their other drinks. I was honestly astounded at how much the staff missed the mark with our reservations and requests. So I gave up, and left at 7:50 to find a better venue that was interested in providing me with a relaxing Friday night meal.

And all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty! I can't even imagine what the service must be like if it's actually busy - and I certainly won't be back to find out!",2015-08-13 03:12:35

I was slightly turned off by the dirty windows looking out onto the street.

We had a groupon which gave us $14 worth of food for $7, the only catch was we had to eat the pizza there.   They have several options for every part of your pie (crust, sauce, veg, meat, cheese).  I believe each pizza costs around $9 with cheaper options for cheese or 1 topping pizzas.  It would be a crime only getting one topping at this place.  You don't go to U-Swirl to get vanilla yogurt with a single cherry on top!  

I ordered the regular crust with Buffalo sauce, probably won't get this sauce again as it is really just a hot sauce, but it would make for a create topping.  Spicy Diavoli (sp) is a better option.  Then I loaded up on 4 different cheese options before adding mushrooms and every meat they had besides meatballs.  (chicken, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, etc...)  The pizza takes 5 minutes or so to cook in their ovens.  The young woman making my pizza was super friendly as was the gentlemen in charge of shipping the pies in and out of the oven.  The pizza is of good size and most mortals probably would be looking for a box half way through.  They also have beer/wine/non-alcoholic beverage options.  2 pizzas and drinks with the Groupoon came to just under $10....great deal.

The only slight suggestion for improvement that I would have is to somehow change their beverage area setup as to not have the door for behind the counter blocking the iced tea and lid section when open.

The sides were nothing amazing but the lobster it self was pretty bad. The shell was hard as a rock and the meat was all shriveled up. The lobster was also very small...

It was difficult (for us to find), but we were very happy with the new space when we did. This is a hip, spacious interior, better than we could have envisioned for the expanded second location. The place was so packed (early on a Saturday night) that we sat at the bar for dinner. I had the ribs, and of the meat, I have to say it was good but not great. I reflected long and hard after about why, since so many people rave about Black Dog. 

In the past, I've written about my reservations on Black Dog's sauces. I prefer a thick tomato-based sauce with both savor and sweetness, like Lil Porgy's. None of the sauces at Black Dog compares. The meat at Black Dog is much more consistently smoked. The ribs had that beautiful pink smoke ring that's a hallmark of quality barbecue. So what were these ribs missing? 

Two things. 

First: They are utterly lean. No fat. None. Now, that might appeal to the diet conscious, but I'm not eating bbq pork ribs to watch my waistline. The lack of fat doesn't make the meat tough in this case, because it's been babied through the low and slow smoking process. The meat is tender, but not falling-off-the-bone tender. It's just barely tender to the tooth. It's tight like meat that has a lack of good marbling or rind. Because fat transmits so much flavor, a leaner cut doesn't have as much; in this case, that means the smoke overpowers the meat in taste. 

Second: The ribs have no bark. Bark is the crust that meat can get when it's cooked low and slow. It's crunchy and packed with flavor. These ribs have none of that -- not any caramelization, not any crust, no bark whatsoever. And that's a shame. 

Here's a link to an article about the wonders of bark: http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/bark.html.",2016-08-31 00:52:53

The staff were very friendly.  They noticed me looking at the menu and said that I was able to mix up my order of 3 tacos - BONUS!  After some recommendations, I ordered the Hermanos, Tofu (highly recommended), & Fish, of course, on a mix of soft flour/corn tortillas.

3 tacos/$10 and I would say that it was a great meal, on the lighter side!  I secretly asked if they would be doing burritos, and they said probably not as Burrito Boyz is down the street.  They may consider switching up the taco flavours and maybe adding bowls, chips&salsa/guac in the future.

Chicken in the Hermanos, which I thought was shredded beef was really good and well-marinated.  Fish taco was surprisingly light!  And I found the tofu just ok 'cause I'm not huge on the sweet chilli sauce and didn't expect the tofu to be cubed up and deep fried.

He is this store's most valuable asset by far. He is always there to the end of his shift (unlike other employees that are ready to walk out the door 30 minutes before close and won't provide service because they chose to clean the area up early) and he's always helpful and knowledgeable. I have never had any complaints about service or quality when Stuart's been behind the counter. I have had though when other employees have been on shift. I can not say enough how fantastic he is.

Canada: Canadian bacon, eggs, potatoes, topped with toasted oats crunch and syrup. I like the mix of the lightly salted Canadian Bacon with the sweetness of the maple syrup.

Milano : fresh mozzarella, tomato basil and balsamic reduction. I noticed that the ingredients stand out more in a crepe . I typically have sandwiches made like this but the bread typically takes over. I loved swiping the remains of my crepe in the balsamic . Very tasty!

There is a variety of desert crepes you can pair with the duo. I always prefer anything with Nutella. The owners are very sweet. They expressed some interest in holding a Yelp event in their cafe. They were mentioning having different crepes from their menu passed around. It would be more of the international crepes. I told them they can get a hold of the Yelp community manger to set one up. 

I also love the scenery . I  like sitting by the big windows so I can people watch. When I look outside It doesn't even feel like I'm in Vegas!",2014-10-04 07:12:49

One of the first things you'll notice, is all of the celebrity photos which line the walls.  Legend has it that the owners were paparazzi in their previous lives, and these snapshots are their handiwork.  I can neither confirm nor deny this rumor.  You'll have to ask them for yourselves.

I've never been to Tommy Burger out in LA, but my wife has numerous times growing up.  We were told their chili burger was very similar, and my wife said it was right on the money.  I tried it, and LOVED it.  The chili was thick and creamy, which made it cling to the meat.

Jacquie (sp?) provided great customer service, and was welcoming and friendly.

They also offer hot dogs, hot sandwiches (like pastrami and french dip), and a handful of dessert options (shake, malt, float, funnel cake, cookie melt).

Wow, don't judge a restaurant by its location.  Not only do they have great burger fare, but their prices are pretty low.  They kept the menu small, offered fresh quality ingredients, which all adds up to a great burger joint.",2009-04-16 22:10:12

I usually get to the M resort and casino at 8:30am and stay until about 10pm to 11pm. (yes, about 13-14 hours)!  Usually the games are done by then.  Yes, i wish there were couches there with a ""blanky"".  

At the M's sportsbook, I have complimentary beer when I bet (usually order the Belgian Beers) and can watch over 30 something games.  In addition, I can manage my bets.  I love the M... they have odds for most of the casinos in vegas... What else can a guy ask for?

Anyways, when I am hungry, I usually swing over to the Vig Deli - few steps away from the Sportsbook.

It is a cozy.  Lines are a bit long during lunch time (as expected).  But, it is only a 5 minute or so wait.

Service - excellent.  The cashier is very sweet and the orders are takened and served pretty quick --  2-5 minute wait for the food.  

Meal -- well, it is pretty good.  So far, I would highly recommend:

a.  Egg, Ham, and Cheese.  Usually, they serve it on a bagel, but I prefer to have it on a French Bread.  It is not your McDonald's type of breakfast sandwich.  It is fresh and VERY Very good.  It cost about 5.99 or so.
b.  Footlong Chili dog with cheese - the dog is a bit salty; however, you kinda forget about it because the chili and cheese makes this a good buy.  Again, it is under $6.  

They also serve Philly Cheese Steaks and Burgers... will try that out another time.

Overall, this place is a great sports book deli (much better than SouthPoint -- kinda over priced over there and quality and is worst).  For the price and quality, I would highly recommend this place.

As my first visit here, it completely decked out girly...hot pink painted walls, neon 'fusia' name in front desk, lots of glitter and glam. Not exactly my taste in interior design, but hey, the service might be good! I notice immediately that there are no price lists anywhere, so it automatically said 'expensive!!' in my head. Then I remembered, I have a gift card, it's ok!

When I first made my appointment, I specified to the lady over the phone that I needed a french manicure and regular pedicure. The lady that took care of me did a regular manicure and when she finished, I realized that she just thought it was a regular manicure, not a FRENCH manicure. I bit my tongue since she finished already and I should have caught her earlier. 

The color of the nail polish for my pedicure came out pretty bright, and I told her that, so she said that it will turn darker when she puts a second coat on it, which she forgot... blah. I could have said something again...but decided to just not. : / Not sure why. 

I thought, oh well, maybe the bill won't be that bad.

It was $85! Just for a regular mani and pedi. I usually pay $15-$20 for a mani and same price for a pedi. What a huge difference. Don't think I will be coming back since the value is definitely shot, and I never really got what I wanted in the first place. They would get an extra star if they only took walk-ins, which they don't, obviously.

Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before, looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere [the company was already delightful...]. I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'. Jeff agrees and we're off - 

We arrived just before 4 - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice. She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef. The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette. Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette. Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle. 

It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way. It was just a nice, shoulder dropping, ahhhh experience. Not the spa, but just what the doctor ordered.

I have eaten in here and today I got my order to go. 

They are fast, it never takes long, my take out today was ready in less then 15 minutes for pick up. The ingredients always taste like they are fresh you can tell allot of this stuff isn't coming out of a pre-frozen bag like the commercial places and if it is they are taking good care of it with proper storage techniques.  

Today I got the Sunday/Monday Special a large 3 topping pie and a dozen wings for just over $20. I think out the door with taxes it was like $24. As my gf put it...we smashed it!!! LOL!  The pizza was good, we ordered a pepperoni sausage and extra cheese pie.  It didn't seem like they went very hefty on the extra cheese I ordered but regardless the pizza was still pretty good. The wings were really good, not sure why they put the sauce on the side, I would of preferred the wings were tossed with the sauce...and they could of been cooked maybe another 1 or 2 minutes in my opinion. They were done...but think they could maybe used another minute to get a little more done.  But we still smashed them so no complaints. LOL.

We have been there before thou...when you go inside to eat you can get pizza by the slice if you choose, and its not like Little Caesars were its been sitting under a heat lamp, it's fresh and you can put your choice of toppings on it. I will say this about that though...if you go nuts on toppings you might as well get a pie. Toppings can be kind of pricey, but typically you can 2 pepperoni slices for around $5. 

As far as the ambiance goes..its cool...seems like it could use a bit brightening up... the place is a little small, I definitely wouldn't go there for a large birthday party, but considering there is a Baskin Robbins next door...it could be a fun little date.  

Would of given this place 5 stars if they had a tiny bar and were open a little later.

Tucker, the owner, bribed me by singing the sweetest sound I've ever heard: My name. He thanked me for being loyal. For being a fan of their brand. He explained their thoughts as they developed the place. Cool guy. Amazing spot. 

They bribe me with delicious food and beverage. Sure, I have to pay for it but, when it's this good, it feels free. 

They bribe me with douchebaggery. The people here are so full of themselves, AND I LOVE IT! When I was a younger man, I wanted to see and be seen. When I'm older, I'll want the same. But right now I'm cool to watch. Mostly, you guys are douche bags. It's true. But it's not a bad thing. You look good. You have nice cars. Own it.  

They bribe me with ""scene""... I always. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I'M. THERE. KNOW. I'm in the right place. No place in town I'd rather be... 

They bribe me with lighting only ""the gays"" could appreciate. I'm gay, so it's ok. 

They bribe me with Bocce ball. I win. I lose. it's fun. 

Amber W is super mad at me for writing this review after only one visit. But I know the Vig. Uptown. Arcadia. Whatever. It's the place to be.",2010-04-02 04:33:23

I was in the mood for something Asian/not Chinese and found reviews on here and thought I'd give it a try.  I live about 6 blocks from the restaurant and have for 6 or 7 years and NEVER saw it until I went to look for it.  Whoever wrote that there is practically no signage was absolutely right, you park in the back and the entrance is in the back of the building.  

I was a later-in-the-evening diner (maybe 9:15pm?) and when I got there, only 1 table was occupied (this was a weeknight).

I ordered one of their soups (which are basically all the same except for the choice of which meat you have them put in) and it was fairly good and enhanced with hot sauce.  I also ordered beef skewers and their specialty pork, which I was a bit skeptical about but for the reviews on here.  The beef skewers were what others on here have mentioned:  bland, and actually sort of hard to confirm that it was beef.  The pork was perhaps the best pork I have ever eaten in a restaurant.  It was grilled and sliced thin, kind of like what you would see with a flatiron or flank steak.  The edges were somehow carmelized which added a welcome and delicious infusion of flavor.  I focused on that and let everything else fall by the wayside.

As others have mentioned, the service was slow; definitely slower than what I would have wanted, and indifferent.  He may be working on improving his language skills which might account for the sense of indifference.",2016-06-04 17:43:50

I love that concept but hated that i damn near lost a tooth unexpectedly biting into a massive bone in my chicken. The last time I was in I didn't like that the guy at the counter stopped preparing my meal to tell newcomers about the restaurant. I was held up while they asked questions and, being in with my fussy toddler, i couldn't appreciate the delay. A simple, I'll be right with you after I finish up here"" could have went a long way right then. Friendly service but could afford to learn to prioritize customers in a fairer way. 

The hummus and baba ganoush are excellent. I had really liked the chicken but, after the bone incident, I think I'm kind of scarred. Roasted veggies are delish but I think they are an extra charge to an already somewhat pricey meal. And finally, my bowl just wasn't that filling for dinner, and I loaded up on toppings so something was amiss. Maybe more protein and less lettuce? I don't know.

At other times, I've ordered a curry at ""medium"" only to find out it's not spicy in the least...
Basically, I think this place is a solid choice for Thai, but it's by no means earth-shattering or anything like that. I actually like the lunch options better than dinner here. The first few times I've eaten at Swaddee's have  all been at lunch, and I've been impressed. But then I ordered the Panang curry to-go, for dinner. I asked for it with tofu, and I got a curry with tofu and onions. That's it. No veggies, nothing. That's really odd for a Thai restaurant. It wasn't flavorful, either. Then I went here last week for dinner, and ordered pad Thai. The noodles were a bit dry and hard, although I have to say, the service was great.

It is a chain that plays predictable music.  People yap on about the atmosphere, but Hawaiian shirts and pretending like we're on vacation isn't a very hard concept to come up with.

I haven't been forced to eat at this location yet (and am hoping to avoid it with all that I can) but I have drank here a few times.  It is almost always busy on weekend evenings and there is a live band on those evenings.  The live band does play a random mix of musical genres on the weekend, which is nice because I might go insane if I had to hear all that Buffet nonsense all night long.

Drinking here is expensive.  Nothing is ever on special and the bartenders don't know how to make drinks that taste good.  The other night I was craving a long island so I indulged myself.  The drink was horrendous- it taste like a vat of sour mix.  My friend said to me ""I never order anything but beer here for just that reason"" and it all made sense to me.  I also recall ordering a round of shots on one occasion that were probably half of a regular shot glass and $8 a piece.  Insane.

Then again, why would you when there are 2 very capable sushi chefs standing there waiting to get to work for you.  We started off with the Escolar and OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOSH, it was incredible.  If you have nothing else, you must try the Escolar.  It's considered a special so they may not have it all the time.  The rolls are solid, sticking to the tried and true basics with impressive presentation.  They actually serve FRESH wasabi root on top the of the nigiri sushi and if you ask for it you can get extra for your dipping sauce.

By the beard of Zeus, I think I found it. Not only do they have Chinese food, but they also have Japanese and sushi as well! First off, I am in love with the online ordering with the little cart that follows you around. So convenient! Second, the food is amazing.

We ordered the crab Rangoon as a pre-appetizer...appetizer, the Volcano roll as an appetizer, plus the General Tso's chicken and cashew chicken as entrées. Yea, we may have over done it a little...
The crab Rangoon was delicious! Crispy, yet creamy on the inside without the crab overpowering everything. The sushi came in this cute little carry out container with flowers on it! Adorable and tasty. It was fresh and cool despite being packed in a bag of hot food. Which is no easy feat, so hats off to Wild Fusion.

Now for the main event! Combo platters. You know them, you love them. Here, they are perfect. The General Tso's was breaded to perfection and came in wonderfully large pieces with fried rice. I hate overly breaded and fried chicken...but that's not here, oh no. The cashew chicken was a little bland, but it was still good. Not only did we order all that, but the graciously gave us some free desserts! Maybe it was because the two of us ordered for eight people and it's some kind of quantity prize. Who knows, I'll take it! 

One last little pro in the ongoing list...they gave us napkins, sauces, and chop sticks. I really appreciate a Chinese restaurant providing all of those things in a takeout bag. Especially the chop sticks, which I have a love/hate relationship with. Love the idea, frustrated by the fourth piece of chicken.

-I tried the stroganoff and it tasted a little off to me. It also needed salt (flavor.) 
-The fish & chips with coleslaw were delicious but EXTREMELY greasy. I personally think they should strain the grease off a little better.

-The deviled eggs weren't that special. I'll make those at home.
-The filet mignon was SO good I almost died again. The spinach and carrots were great additions to the meat. I would order this plate again.

They had a special deal that weekend. Three course meal for $37... YES, PLEASE.

They did give us a salad... Caesar... and it was good. 

APPETIZER: 
TUNA TARTARE - Pine Nuts, Asian Pear, Toast Points
It was delicious. I'm so glad I got it because it was a good size.

MAIN COURSE: 
CHILEAN SEA BASS 
oh YEAH! This is the good stuff. Especially... the sauce! My fiance got the filet mignon and kept dipping it in my sauce (that's what she said). It was really good. Very savory and the fish mixed with it. YES. LOBSTER SAUCE.

SIDES:
BAKED MAC & CHEESE - This was alright. It's not truffled... but it was still good. VERY Big. Share it.

GRILLED ASPARAGUS - Standard. Dip it in my lobster sauce! :D

DESSERT:
NY STYLE CHEESECAKE 
THIS... WAS HUGE. Don't expect the Costco size slice. This is HUGE. You can share with this four people :/ After a big hearty meal. 

STRAWBERRY BAKED ALASKA
MY favorite. It was like a strawberry shortcake really.

SERVICE:
Very good and attentive. Dropped my fork... got a new one instantly. 
We had to wave at them several times, but it was fine. We got our bill and on our way. 

OVERALL:
If there is a deal, grab it.

Stumbled across this place after a gun show at westgate; was the only place not packed and forcing people to sit outside. Service was very very prompt with entire crew on top of things. 

We ordered three dishes: the American, the Californian, and an order if poutine fries (which was a pleasant surprise on the menu). I'll let sav review her own food but here is how mine was. 

Californian comes on a waffle that is not sweet at all but very light, and much light than sandwich bread or a bun. It had turkey that was actually turkey, not deli sliced sandwich meat sadness that is typically served. Bonus points for red leaf lettuce instead of iceberg, and the cream cheese herb spread was great as well. 

Lastly, the poutine. Huge fries covered in beef stock gravy and melted white cheese. It was incredible to the point of wanting to drive an hour plus to get to get, while reciting the words to ""o canada"" and itching to go to a hockey game.

It was difficult to know the menu offerings. If you get the opportunity, review it before. Since there was a line, I didn't ask too many questions i.e. Side dishes.  

I had a blackberry lemonade drink. It runs about $4.  I liked it, my husband wasn't a fan.  I definitely want to go back and try something else.  I caught the breakfast menu about 30 seconds before I ordered.  Not clear if this is served at 1pm but I was interested!

I would not go back for them at all. There are other places that are cheaper, have more options and are actually good. The comfortable personal space hasn't won me over.

Subtly sweet coconut broth enhanced by the big hunks of pineapple, lime leaves, and fried tofu. The drunken noodles were like any drunken noodles, nothing special to report. I liked them though, for sure. I only wish the serving of jasmine rice had been larger. We needed to order a second bowl.

After the second person joined me, and we had made a decision, we were seated, while we awaited our third companion.

We found the AYCE menu to be extensive, including many dessert items beyond the standard ice cream scoops. Of course, this place is a bit on the pricey side, esp for dinner, so it makes sense that there are so many options. All of the food we ate was fresh, enjoyable, and worth the price.

The reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 4/5 is for service. We were ignored for quite some time before being able to give our orders, or add to them, throughout the dinner. It also took an incredibly long time for us to get the bill. Essentially we had all gotten dressed in our various outerwear and were sitting there waiting for the bill to be brought to us.

I asked about drink specials until we could get decide on a seat, she grabbed the menu and told me I could get captain Morgan vodka double for $5. I said they make a vodka now? She said yes I can mix it with coke or whatever. Which is hilarious when you read on I'll tell you about the Pepsi. 
So we grab a waitress, the slowest droopy drearest one we could find, well the only one. The other girl was running around cause she kept forgetting everything we later discovered from over hearing the table next to us. Anyway we pop a squat on a high top till we beg Jackie 2 times to bus that table so we can sit in chairs not stools. She offers drinks until then, very good. A bucket of beer with 10 ice cubes and a captain Morgan vodka and soda. LOL Sat at the end of the bar waiting to be delivered for a bit, a couple all in black guys strolled along, didn't grab them to deliver nor was anyone cleaning the table. She said she would get it. She decided to take a order from a 4 top in the mean while. I guess a big party just left, but I only seen 2 dirty tables and 6 busy ones. NO one was at the string of high tops. Then she wanted to take are order, I said I'm still waiting for that table. Tell your boss you need help, NO I'll just do it. She replied. She moved like all she had to eat was valium that day. And the brain activity was just as slow.

To the food, the Miller's seafood bake? Awful boiled in water with some seasoning powered here and there. Brought in a net bag. Dry as a fart. Corn mushy and clams cold, awful I'm sure the air condition that was on blasting ceiling fans and the Windows open at 91 degrees out didn't help. I actually opened a wet nap and in less then 3 minutes (yes I did I it twice) it was a piece a loose leaf paper. The waitress had no interest in hearing what I was saying. I DID 3 times attempt to get our unhappiness across.
 I asked for a COLD glass with salt and lime for my now warm beer. Knew that was going to happen when the bucket only had 10 cubes. She says ""we have Pepsi"" again I said, same response. We looked at each other and my date said ""NO, an empty glass, cold with.."" She interrupted with ""oh duh, ok"". And the bartender things you serve coke? Huh? Maybe they do have both, im not sure. 
The foil baked mahi was SO SO a bit dry and NO flavor.
Then the fire place came on, Wtf? It's mid June in Vegas!! The table next to us even was shocked. Wth is going on. First open the huge ass Windows to null and void the air condition, then a fire? 
We were SO over this dinner we grabbed our last beers and went out side. Just to noticed the same two glasses on the table outside next to the couch, that we noticed ON THE WAY IN!! We were soooooooo over this evening I would have strangled a manager if I would of demanded to talk to one. 
Low and behold, the fire pits kick on outside. We ran for the car!!! Worst $66 plus tip, I don't know why I did that. Ever!!!
 I hope to go back in a few months with a totally different out come. All the experienced people out of work, and this is what they come up with. Shame on you! OH and they didn't have the dessert he wanted either. Poor guy we stopped at McDonald's on the way home from dinner, sad..

The beef dish (see the photo I posted) featured a sliced, minimally-seasoned grilled beef that came with a very pungent sauce on the side, and raw vegetables. Perhaps this is the way the vegetables are supposed to be served with the dish and the accompanying pungent sauce, but I didn't care for cabbage wedges, whole string beans, and eggplant slices which are raw. And the beef was underwhelming, even with the very pungent sauce applied to it. This is one dish I know I will not be ordering again. The grilled fish with shredded green mango was quite good.

Facility: Typical pub atmosphere but the washrooms were pretty gross. They were modern but everything was falling apart. Soap dispensers were empty, hand dryer broken, floor was filthy... they definitely need to put in some sort of cleaning schedule with the staff. We sat on the patio which I much preferred to sitting inside (music inside was full blast, good luck holding a conversation). The only problem with the patio is that there were a lot of fruit flies/gnat flying around, so it an get annoying.

Service: Service was generally good. As other echoed, food came out quite slowly. I ordered Yam Fries as app and the Mac & Cheese as main, but they both came out at the same time (bleh) - waited about 20 - 30 minutes. Waitress was lovely though. Checked back frequently and refilled our glasses when they were empty. She was friendly and held good conversation (I don't remember her name, but she looked like a shorter Margot Robbie).

Any way, the spread of snacks were pretty good. They had two salads, of which both were tasty because of their dressing. I've always loved the spicy bean sprout salad; I had a bowl to myself. I recall going to other spots with a broader collection of pickled goodies, but it's not that important to me. I did also have the scrambled egg dish, and the zucchini/tofu soup. 

Oscar, our hwaro master, was great. I must admit, I did enjoy having our meats cooked so we could focus on chatting. He asked what temperature we liked our beef and took care of the rest. We ordered a large set 3, and all the meats were delicious. Unfortunately, they don't let you substitute meats. I will point out that their spicy marinade was a bit much for my friends. So make sure you can stand the heat before you order.

After years of waiting, Agave y Aguacate officially opened its doors to their new digs at 35 Baldwin St. So for those of you who were fans of the former Kensington location, or watched Bourdain's Layover in Toronto, here's your chance to finally sink your teeth into the goods!

The menu boasts tiny plates meant for sharing. To start we had the Pinto Bean/Tomato soup with Ancho Chile and Queso Panela.

Get it. Trust me. It is so good. 

The smokiness from the Ancho Chile really elevated the Tomato Base adding depth and richness. The cubes of Queso Panela immersed in the soup were warm and squishy, adding the right amount of salinity and creaminess to balance the rest of the components. What I'm really trying to say is, get it, it's good :D

The Chile Poblano Relleno stuffed with Guacamole, Pineapple, and Gooseberries had our table singing. This was spot on with just the right amount of heat emerging from the pepper and zippy zing from lime. Loved it!

Another favourite was the Tostada de Tinga. If I were you, I wouldn't share this item because a) It's hard to share and b) It's really yummy, so you won't want to share. 

My friend had the Flank Steak Salad and really enjoyed it. I had the Pollo en Pipian Rojo. I felt like it could use a tad more seasoning. With a little bit of reworking, I can see this being a good one.

And of course, it is impossible to step away from a Mexican meal without Dulce, right? So please allow me to  indulge :) The 70% Dark Hot Chocolate with Mexican Spices was liquid gold. Imagine drinking chocolatey velvet and you'll get the idea. A must for any chocolate lover.

I was particularly smitten by the Carlota de Limon. It is a dish of layered Mexican Biscuits with Lime Curd that will have your fingers and toes tingling with joy. I love Key Lime and this totally hit the ball out of the park. 

Overall, this was a great meal. I am so happy to see authentic Mexican dishes, as they are prepared and eaten in Mexico, introduced to the culinary diaspora of Toronto. Kudos Agave Y Aguacate!",2014-01-08 04:20:15

It arrived cold...but that's not the restaurant's fault, so I'll let that slide. 

The main issue is that everything was so SPICY. I feel bad complaining about this because it's an Indian restaurant but even the papadums were spicy! I like spicy food but I also like to be given the choice, and if even the sides are spicy then it's a bit much for me :(

The garlic naan was great - not stingy with the garlic like most are - as were the vegetarian samosas. But the paneer curry was a bit watery, and was just sauce + cheese, which was a little disappointing when I was hoping for something a little beefier (not literally, I am (mostly) vegetarian!)

My fiancee and I were feeling in the mood for some Chinese or maybe even dim sum, so I popped on here and found this place located in Chinatown. 20 minutes later we were circling the block trying to find a place to park, which, having it be a Friday night was next to impossible. Add-in the fact that she rolled her ankle the night before, I knew if we ever wanted to eat ""tonight"" I couldn't park at any of the lots down the road, we'd never make it in time. 45 minutes after arriving in the location, and our 6'th trip around, I saw someone begin to pull out and I snaked the spot, only a few hundred feet from the entrance. We made it in, and to the second floor. There must have been some kind of party going on because there were whole sections blocked off and people setting things like tables and speaker systems and the like. After standing at the top of the staircase for a few minutes wondering if the place was closed down for some kind of rented out party. A smartly dressed elderly gentleman grabbed some menus and gestured for us to follow him, alrighty then. We were sat in the back room next to the window overlooking the street we just came in from, nice spot, gave us a view to look at. Something I did notice was the large flat screen TV that was in front of us, wasn't showing a sporting event or anything, it was showing what was going on in the adjacent room. In case I wasn't interested enough in watching the people close to me eat, now I can watch the people far away from me eat as well. 

The menu is quite substantial with many options, but what I immediately took notice to was the lack of ""carts"" pushing around Dim Sum. We must not have been there at the right time, so we decided just to go for the dim sum sampler platter to get a feel for what they served. Neither of us could decide on any one dish so we gave the ""Dinners for Two"" a shot with, I think, platter ""E"" Not a bad deal when you look at how much food they give you. 2 soups, 1 order of Dim Sum, 5 plates of various meats and fortune cookies. It seemed to be the best way to try a variety of what this place had to offer and satisfy our confusion on what to get at the same time. Since we didn't have any particular server we just told the first one who stopped at our table what we wanted and off they went. 

Within a few minutes the Dim Sum platter was sitting in front of us, not bad considering they were a little busy, the cooks must have been on top of things in the back of the house. Everything on the plate was fantastic, my fiancee especially loved the pork siu mai. We weren't even halfway through when the soups came to the table. Hot & Sour and Wonton. I can say with hindsight looking back that the wonton soup was the most disappointing thing we ate. It had no flavor and smelled a little...Earthy.  We elected to just share the H&S. The food began rolling out at a nice pace. Starting with the Lobster shrimp, and ending with the Beef w/ Broccoli, the middle also had Pork, Chicken, and Duck. All the meat groups were present and all of them tasted fantastic. It took us about 2 hours to take everything in and we enjoyed everything we had. Finally the cheque came with the  2 fortune cookies.

Now I have a rule I made with myself, albeit a silly one, but it's still one that I follow. I will never choose my own cookie. I will either take by process of elimination of what is left on the plate, or allow whomever is with me to give me one. I dunno, just something I do.. 

This particular day as I said before, was filled with immigration paperwork that has taken almost 2 years to complete. Two long arduous painstaking years..  I am in the process of getting my Canadian Fiancee down to the states, and that Friday in Montreal marked the day that she was given the green light to come.  It was quite a joyous day for the both of us, which is why we were treating ourselves to a big dinner.

I tell you that part of the story so the conclusion makes a little more sense.  We cracked open our little sugary sweets in unison and read our fortunes. Normally we play the ""In bed"" game, where you put the words, ""In bed"" at the end of whatever it reads, try it sometime, it always makes them sound better. ""You Will be experimenting with new and exciting things....In bed.."" See??  However in this case, that was not needed. After a brief chuckle from the both of us, we read them to each other. Hers read ""You will soon be traveling abroad"" and Mine... ""Patience Will Triumph"". It's like, they knew we were coming. We definitely had to be there that night.

Give this place a try, everything was great. Would have been a 5 star experience, but the soup tasted like soil, and there was a very loud band warming up for whatever was going to happen later in the evening, made eating and talking to each other difficult",2010-04-05 14:17:52

The cafe is cute and cozy. Got there around 1245 ish and was surprised that it wasn't  more crowded. The menu was fresh and highly organic. I stuck to my favorite of steak and eggs. Eggs were well cooked, and the steak comes in thinly sliced cuts, which were actually pretty tasty. Normally when you get toast at a breakfast joint the jam or jelly comes in those 5 cent plastic tubs that for all I know are a decade old and packaged in Bangkok by 6 year olds , not here. They use fresh organic stuff here scooped into a heap that is eatable in itself. Nice work.  Staff was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. The prices were moderate I'd say. Our bill for two was close to 30 bucks which is a bit pricey for breakfast, but I'm sure rent in that location is a business killer.

I ended up selecting the Reese's Cup, which is one of their many Hot Cake Sundaes. The Reese's Cup was two very large hotcakes with peanut butter chocolate chips cooked inside. It also had chocolate ice cream, chocolate syrup, caramel topping, honey roasted pecans, and whipped cream on top. 

Although I didn't really feel like I was eating breakfast, I didn't really care because it was so good.

This building is fantastic and definitely worth having a look at. Lucky for us, it's also a bar! Exploring history is better when you've got a beer in your hand. Fact.

Apart from the incredible history, the rest of the Bank & Baron, is well, surprisingly normal... When it comes to food, drink and overall experience, Bank & Baron comes off to me as a pub, just like pretty much any other pub in Calgary. Not a bad thing by any means, just surprisingly safe.

Being right along Stephen Ave, this would be a good spot for the downtown business crowd and a nice location to catch a happy hour after work. 

The place is huge. The ceiling is around 2.5 stories up with balcony seating overlook the main floor and the ginourmous centre bar. If you're planning on a night out with a bunch of friends, this would be a good place to go. There are plenty of huge tables complete with padded leather booths, and some of those semi-circle booths. Everyone gets a booth spot! Remember kids, if you're the person at the party who has to pee every three minutes, sit on the edges so you don't make everyone get up. That's called bar courtesty.

It's got a really classy old school feel to it, except for all the TVs everywhere that I feel really ruin the look and feel. They tote themselves as an Old School Bank and New School Pub. Maybe the TVs are the new school part of it? The menu could be described as New School, featuring items like lobster mac & cheese, truffled organic potato chips, craft beer fondue, and plenty of old fashioned pub faves. The beer selection isn't so New School and playes it pretty safe, but I guess it's important to have Budweiser specials for the TV watchin' crowd.

Holy crap, the basement! The basement is SO COOL. To get to the washrooms you need to pass by this incredible bank vault area.

Due to the Las Vegas summer heat killin' my brain, I'm gonna try to keep this one short today.  

All I can say is...$2.99 special for an order of chicken fried rice!  Deal!

Yes, and this chicken fried rice from Chop Chop Wok is pretty killer.  So good!  Theirs has a genuine 'fried' taste to it and I'm pretty sure the chicken is marinated.  Goes great with a side of kim chee and an ice cold beer.  Complete meal!

Chop Chop Wok is located close to my home, and has some of the better Chinese food in my area.  This place is more for take out, so don't bring a party of 50 or more!  All they have for seating is several small tables and a few tables that sit between 4-6 people.  Chop Chop Wok is definitely a small Mom & Pop type joint.  And with just the one nice lady running the entire front area, it is such.  We all know these little hole-in-the-wall places can offer up some good eats!

The menu at Chop Chop Wok is a mix of Chinese and Japanese.  Everything from rice and noodles is available, even the usual suspects of Mongolian Beef, Egg Foo Young, and Kung Pao Chicken are there.  Chop Chop Wok goes above and beyond by also including some Japanese flair, sushi rolls are available as well as bentos!  There are weekday specials that start at $4.95, saving you some cash for your stash.  For that small amount of change you get soup, an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll.  Not bad!  They also offer combo plates for just south of $7.  You can get out of Chop Chop Wok with a fully belly and a still full wallet!

I'll have to be honest, I haven't tried much on the Chop Chop Wok menu.  Mainly because my usual stop is there for the $2.99 special chicken fried rice for a snack!  But I've seen many of the dishes come out of the kitchen for eat-in patrons and it does look fresh and tasty.  Nothing sitting in a buffet tray under a heat lamp!  I've heard folks eating here say that the food is pretty good, and the prices are good as well.  I promise to try more stuff here soon!  Until then the cheap chicken fried rice will be calling my name.

It's no surprise when all of my suburban relatives were surprised such a place existed and asked how I ""discovered"" it for my engagement photos. When you have a whole block filled with colours and legitimate artists with spray paint bottles, suddenly, vandalism becomes art.

Though there's graffiti all over the city, Graffiti Alley specifically points to Rush Lane that runs from Spadina to Portland. It's made up of a series of back alleys and laneways where you get to admire impressive street art while dodging the occasional car or two. The works really are a sight to behold, if you look past some of random spray painted words that look like they were done by drunk people. You've got professional-looking murals taking up the whole side of a building. Vibrant colours, a ton of creativity, and artwork that is uniquely Toronto. 

On weekends, Graffiti Alley becomes Instagram Alley as everyone and their mom brings a camera to the party. I'm almost sure there are tours being led down this place. The walls are a living canvas. People paint on top of things all the time, making way for new backdrops. I won't lie though, Graffiti Alley looks much better through a camera lens than with the naked eye. With a camera, you can point it upwards and avoid all the garbage and crap at your feet. 

Now that summer's here, I can imagine it only getting busier with social media influencers and tourists. Don't let that stop you though. Grab your best camera (phone), don't be afraid to get dirty, and get your 2 minute photo shoot with the famously brilliant Aquarium wall. Your followers will appreciate it.

The food, exceptional. I only got one drink and one appetizer (won ton tuna tacos). The drink was amazing. The tacos were good but won-ton shells are probably not the best case for tacos- they break easy and the contents just spill everywhere. Smh.

The dog has very little ""dog mess"" around, which shows me that people take pride in the park and generally clean up after their dogs. 

My only complaint is that I saw so many owners with food, which has a tendancy to cause issues with some dogs. Owners were giving dog treats to dogs (a big no no) and there were a couple young kids walking around with ice cream bars with dogs following them (just asking for a dog to knock over your kid to get the yummy treat).

I am pretty sure it will cure whatever ails you. 

Yes, it is going to cost you more than AYCE options. It will cost you approximately $28 for one order, but you will get a dish that defies culinary logic. This galbi manages to be thick AND tender, which leads me to believe they have a Korean black magic wizard in the back casting tenderizing spells. 

However, they should also hire a wizard to work out their service kinks. It is grand opening still, and they were swamped by all the CES businessmen posses. They were out of tea, out of broccoli, and they managed to mess up our order in every way possible, including running one credit card for the entire bill after we gave them three for a split check. We were there for 3-hours! Someone who didn't eat the bewitched galbi would have probably given them 2-stars based on the service alone.

If fish is your friend, you will also be pretty delighted by the seafood combination, which comes with lobster tail, squid, shrimp and salmon. The seafood lovers at my table were drooling on the bountiful sea offerings as they were laid across the grill. It is a good value, although we think we may have been given a double order? (Refer to paragraph 3.)

Banchan were not particularly notable to my dismay. 

However, in the end, Mr. Tender Galbi made up for everything.

We ended up eating dinner at Poppy Den both times. The weather was perfect at night outside and it really ended up being a relaxing experience. 

ATMOSPHERE
The dainty trees were lit up with colorful lights on the patio seating area, which really made the atmosphere and matched the type of outing us girls were looking for. There was music, but not enough to drown out our conversation. The mini garden-esque idea really matched the small plates and wine selections that were offered for happy hour. It made us feel light, happy and care-free~


FOOD
Our food was delicious! And as I am currently going with a pescatarian lifestyle, the happy hour menu was perfect for me. Everything was only $5 each too.

1. HOUSE SUMMER SANGRIA
Won't get you drunk but will definitely get you happy. It was the essence of a summer fruit drink. Loved it with my spicier appetizers.

2. EDAMAME, delicious spicy oil with Asian fusion flavos. Could be addictive! 

3. WATERMELON SALAD WITH GOAT CHEESE, My goooooodness... YES.

4. SHRIMP TACOS, Well-seasoned, crispy and lots of flavor! It comes with two tacos, well worth the price. It won't make you full, but it's enough to be able to sample other appetizers and have a satisfying meal.

5. AVOCADO TACOS, Perfect amount of avocado and the salsa and sauce complemented this savory and yummy dish well. Lots of creamy, fresh and salty flavors here =)

6. FRIES WITH KIM-CHEESE SAUCE, Me loves the kim-cheese sauce! I want to try make this at home. So simple, so good. I try not to eat too much fried food, but the kim-cheese sauce needed to be in my mouth. Soo... I think I ate most of it! Sorry to the ladies at the table! 

7. MISO TIRAMUISU, Very, very... interesting. And salty. And... different. It was like a tiramisu, with cream and spongey cake. But in-between bites, I had strong hints of miso paste and crunchy honey peanuts. I think my taste buds were confused with this one. I kept eating it though because I was either intrigued, or I thought it was just so weird that someone came up with this dessert.  

8. GIANT FORTUNE COOKIE DESSERT, The delicious cream inside, the fresh berry sorbet & berries, combined with the crunchy shell of the fortune cookie. Loved it, thanks to the cream and the sorbet. Would order it again. Now, if there was some way I could have a gallon of it...


SERVICE
We were treated VERY well by the ladies at the hostess table, whom even helped to give us tips on what was good, and consistently checked up on us in the beginning, when it wasn't busy. We even got to meet one of the chefs, Alexa, who asked us how our meal was and was very nice about answering our questions about our food. 

Maybe the one thing that we had a problem with was when our main server whom we asked for water, said he would bring it right away, and then proceeded to delegate our request to another server. When it didn't come for another 15-20 minutes, we asked the main server again and he apologized for the other server. I thought that was kind of weird because he should have checked on us and got it himself, rather than putting the blame on someone else. It wasn't that big of a deal, but it was pretty hot and we were thirsty during the end of our meal.

Overall though, great experience, Would come again with the ladies or on a date!",2014-06-18 06:27:29

It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entrée up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.

Our reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.

During our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entrées came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  

At this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was ""on the house, and it was their/his fault.""  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entrée was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.  Live and learn.",2015-08-25 17:56:33

Bread came with this eggplant yogurt sauce. Grilled bread, great sauce, so tasty.
To start we had the sardines, snails, and the chorizo. All had really good flavor I didn't think cheese and cream would work with snails, but it really works. Chorizo, served in a flaming pig for presentation, was delicious. Sardines I've liked since I was a kid. Though a little bit oily, then still had that great sardine flavor. We also split the paella. This was the dish of the night. Perfectly cooked rice and seafood. Loved the grilled prawns in there. The whole thing just kind of sang. Chocolate cake for dessert, delicious, done.

After waiting weeks for special order flooring from Home Depot, it arrived damaged and unusable. As the boxes weren't damaged, we didn't know until the installer came.  Since we were in a hurry, we went to Lowe's.  Picked out a floor that was ""in stock locally and would arrive in 3 days.""  Actually, it was in Texas and would take a week.

I have a problem with Dairy Lane. WAIT, no,  that's not what I mean... I mean I have a Dairy Lane problem!  When I'm without their Back Bacon Grilled Tomato Eggs Benedict for too long, I'm pretty sure I start experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

Personal stand-out items: The aforementioned Back Bacon Grilled Tomato Bennie. It's the perfectly classic concoction. The tomatoes add this wonderfully tangy juiciness to compliment and cut through every bite.

I decided to visit this establishment because our usual place was packed (Ginger and Onion) on Sunday.  My girlfriend and I decided to visit Casa Imperial since it's down the street and thought it'll probably be less people cause it's a expensive than others.  Also, my cousin gave it good reviews.  Oh my, I wish I haven't visited this place.  I should've known, my cousin eats for material things and not with her stomach and tongue!

It's cute cause it's in a Mansion but it doesn't work with dim sum, probably for a western restaurant.  When I walked in, it felt strange cause it's awkward.  I feel it's not being appreciated by Asians.  It has the finer things with fancy tableware and waitress and waiters in butler and maid outfits but it lacks in quality of taste.  The difference in old fashion vs fine dining dim sum.  I prefer my old lady/non-English speaking cart ladies.  The quality is there with expensive garnish (shark fin flakes on siu mai, beef tripe in xo sauce, and etc..) but it didn't taste good.  I've been to better fine dining that given me the WOW factor and this was just LAME!

Decor was horrible!  Asian establishments are known for being a hole in the wall, not likely going to spend lots of money decorating or fixing up. And they didn't, the castle-like restaurant was dirty and dusty, and not overall maintained (other than adding more tables in the hallway)  since what seems like centuries. We were seated upstairs (2nd FL), very tight and crammed.  We had a 2 seater table by the chandelier, and tiny table with big chairs with barely any leg room.  I'm Asian and it was tight, can't imagine for my girlfriend who has long legs.  We we're in between the walkway downstairs, people had to squeeze by (customers and staff).  I was a little appalled cause we were seated next to the chandelier with glass rail.  How nice it was to eat and see the chandelier covered with dust.  EWWW!  

Food was decent.  Decent to the point, it'll probably taste better at a Asian food court that serves dim sum.  Not worth the money!  We usually eat 5-7 plates of dim sum at ginger and onion, which costs between $20-$25 including tips.  Casa Imperial cost us $43 including tips for 5 plates of dim sum.  We've ordered Crispy Pork Buns, Chicken Feet, Siu Mai, Sticky Rice in lotus leaf, and Papaya and Custard cake.  Out of five things we've ordered.  We only liked 1, which was sticky rice.

I remember thinking how cool it was to take the escalator up to the movie theater.  So here's where we are now.

Really good things:
 - Where else are you going to shop?  There is SO little good shopping when you live in/near this area.
 - There is a Costco.  This brings up the status level of just about anywhere, let's be honest.  This was my MAIN Costco for a long time.  
 - The Chinese food restaurant is pretty cool.
 - I love the old school deli!  It totally feels 1975 when I go there.
 - They haven't tried to overly modernize.  Sound like a dubious ""good thing"" but I love the old school brick work walk ways and planters.  
 - New shops like Ross and Petsmart have really helped the place!

Not so good things:
 - This was the nastiest Wal-Mart I've ever been in. I'm already not a Wal-Mart fan, but there were a few times when I needed something fast and well, it was there.  Walking through there during Christmas for freaking ornament hangers was one of my worst experiences ever.
 - Can you call this a food court?  It's almost hidden and for good reason.  There aren't many reasons to eat there, and there are many reasons not to.

It's not ghetto.  It's old school.  Know what to expect going in (lots of shoe and accessory stores and nothing in the way of high fashion) and it can be an oasis of shopping in the middle of a shopping desert.",2007-02-26 18:17:30

They just added a coffeehouse recently and I am impressed with the quality of all of their coffee. 

One gripe (and the reason this local AZ business doesn't get my 5th star) is that they use an out of state roaster for their coffee. 

The coffee is good, but there are many many talented roasters here in the CenPho area who would be more than grateful to get a piece of that AZ pie too. Just food for thought since Bookman's was founded, and thrives due to AZ cash, maybe spread the love to other AZ businesses.

I remember my dad telling me stories when he attended UNLV, and now I have found myself creating my own memories here. Don't come for the food, come here for the drinks. They have so many beers on tap, they have made it into a game. If you decide you want to keep coming back (because you won't finish all in one sitting) then ask for a beer card. There are approximately thirty beers on the card, and you get a stamp for every one you try. The only stipulation is that you cannot try a beer twice. It has to be thirty different beers. I made the mistake of mixing light ales with dark lagers with who knows what else one night to try to fill up my card, and it ended in, well, a mess, if you will. Anyway, it is such a fun place to be (we chose Tuesday nights for our weekly get together) and after dining hours settle, it gets a bit louder, and livelier. Crown and Anchor is the best place around UNLV for groups to get together in a casual atmosphere for fun conversations and drinking. Be careful though. You can get tipsy pretty fast, and nobody wants an accident to happen. We always designate a driver (which always seems to be the party pooper since they cant join in on the debauchery, hehe) and the police always seem to be about. Crown and Anchor is so much fun, but have good fun, be safe!

Recommended drink: The beers on the card. Have your server recommend an order, don't just choose or you will end up in the bathroom all night!

The Good: 
- Fish and chips tasted incredible.  Red striped battered, hot and crispy, cooked to perfection.  Probably the best fish and chips I've had in the city so far. 

- Fat Carl was AMAZING! Very succulent, juicy, crispy chicken (even better than the stand alone fried chicken), soft bread and a mmmmm factor of 11.

The Okay: 
- Pulled pork waffle - exactly as it's described.  Not bad but completely pales in comparison to the items above.

- Southern fried chicken and waffles were lacking.  The skin was deliciously crispy but the chicken itself was dry on the inside.  

- Catfish & Collard Green Soup got mixed reviews at our table, some said it was perfect, others like me thought it could've used more flavour.  Still not bad at all.

- Collard Greens tasted good but nothing too memorable

The Bad:

- Mac and cheese had absolutely nothing going for it. Bland, not cheesy enough and let's be honest - if you're not tasting better than instant KD, you're doing something wrong.

The dipping sauce for the chimis was sweet and tangy, a pleasant surprise. The jalapeño cheese bites were not spicy, and were closer to hush puppy consistency than I expected.

We ordered an enchilada sampler and shared it. It included 4 enchiladas (spinach, cheese, avocado, and a meat), a chile relleno, beans, mashed potatoes, and a dollop of guacamole. The meat and spinach were my favorites, but the other two were also good. The beans were thick and hard. Next time, I'll get the rice.

Although it was good, and definitely enough to share, I think I'll stick to their seafood. On another visit, I had the Tilapia Vera Cruz, which was delicious and unique.

Most meals are a bit high (about $18 - $24). The seafood is worth it though. 

The décor is pretty. It reminds me of the casual opulence of the Paris casino in Vegas.

We're not big meat eaters, but, hey, you can only take so much chicken before you start sprouting feathers.

I lost count of the number of staff who wished him a happy birthday, from the hostess when we arrived, to the hostess when we left, and all manner of staff before, during and after the meal.  And there was the Happy Birthday card on the table, and the tiny dessert with a birthday candle at the end.

We started with the amuse-bouche Fries - three kittle cups with different seasonings with three paired dips.  I'm not a Fry Freak, but I have to admit I just couldn't stop, even with all the salt (I'm giving up on complaining about salt, which is just too pervasive in restaurants).

Both of us ordered the NY Strip, and it was good enough to make me a meat eater.  Perfectly cooked.  Juicy.  Tender.  We ordered Asparagus in Horseradish Beurre Blanc and the Truffled Mac & Cheese as our sides.  The asparagus was fabulous.  But the Mac & Cheese, which they're famous for, was just too rich for my taste.  I know I would've been happier with the Scalloped Potatoes, but hubby wanted to try the Mac, and it was his birthday, so...  Besides, I was too full from the complimentary fries to even get through the steak, so it was no problem to eschew (pun intended) the macaroni.

The service was terrific - not elegant, because this is a casual place, and that's just the way I like it.

My one nit-let about this very stylish space is the chairs.  They're very comfy, upholstered arm chairs.  But the arms are as high as the table tops, so I couldn't sit as close to the table as I like.  It made the comfortable seating a bit uncomfortable for Petite Moi.

SERVICE: 

Right off the bat, the fine service at this location already made this a better experience than the last time - we were seated quickly, the server was quick to take our order and fill our request (e.g. for an extra spoon), and the food arrived much faster then expected.

FOOD:

Came here specifically for the Lobster Roll. As per other reviews, the roll was a bit smaller than I would have liked, and also somewhat on the soggy side. The contrast of the warm buttered bread with the chilled meat also felt odd at first, but as the roll was overall quite tasty nonetheless. The seemingly home-made chips that accompanied the roll were too salty for my taste, but added some nice crunch to the meal (along with the pickle). 

After hearing good things about the Lobster chowder, I also had to try it. Though quite pricey for a soup ($13!), and a bit more watery than expected for a chowder, there was plenty of chunks of lobster, potato, celery, ham etc. to liven it up. 

ATMOSPHERE:

While a bit cramped, the restaurant did very well in terms of maximizing its seating capacity. There's definitely a certain aura here that makes it a comfortable spot for a dinner or late night drinks. There's also a couple TV's near the small but serviceable bar.

Knowing that the restaurant is located in Crystals--a shopping arcade (mall is far too down-market to describe this place) featuring Tiffany, Cartier, and LV--I had a feeling this would be an expensive celebration, and it was, but well worth it.

Our table in the treehouse wasn't ready when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink. I thought I was prepared for Vegas prices, but I was wrong. Martinis that cost $18?! But when in Rome ...

As our bartender raised the shaker to pour the martini into the oversize martini glass, I noticed that the cocktail shaker itself was about one and half times the size of your regular shaker. That's right, we got about three generous martinis out of that one shaker. Unfortunately, we'd each ordered a martini, which is why the rest of my review will be a bit vague.

This Mastro's features a variety of seafood, and you can create your own seafood tower appetizer, even if it's only for one. We passed on a seafood appetizer and ordered a very good Caesar salad, followed by a bone-in rib eye for him and a bone-in filet mignon for me. Our waitress also sold us on the lobster mashed potatoes--1 1/4 pounds of lobster chunks folded into buttery mashies--so we enjoyed some seafood too.

Between the monster martini and the addictive pretzel bread (soft with a slightly chewy exterior, sprinkled with salt), I had a hard time saving room for the entree and ended up taking half of it home. But it was one of the best filets I've ever had. Although I love the tenderness of filet mignon, I typically prefer the flavor of a rib eye. Both were excellent, even as leftovers.

The restaurant provided a complimentary slice of chocolate cake to mark the occasion. And although it would have been nice if they'd given us their famous butter cake, which they'd talked up, it didn't really matter because I was too full to have even one bite.

I guess I'll just have to go back for more pretzel bread and that butter cake. But next time, I'll definitely share a martini--and maybe remember a few more details.",2011-08-12 04:57:14

The experience starts with great service from Cindy, and then great conversation from Rich himself, who takes the time to visit every table, engages in interesting conversation and makes you feel at home.

It's obvious Rich has a passion for what he does, and it shows in both his words and his cooking.  Most of the menu is homemade and offers both classic and gourmet Italian dishes.  The food quality and portions are excellent, and they go out of their way to make sure you're dinner is a great experience.

Highly recommended.",2018-03-29 13:06:38

The place is a wide open restaurant that's spacious and simple. The food came out very quickly and the service was very good. I came with family and we started off with egg rolls and chicken wings. Everything tasted great. I ended up getting the lemon grass chicken, but got to try the pork chops from my brother's plate. Both were excellent.

I came here with my siblings for a quick stop to pick up some pastries. We tried their mint brownie, cheesecake brownie, sugar cookies, and white chocolate & cranberry cookies. They were all pretty good. If you purchase 5 or more pastries, you get 1 free!

I wish I tried one of their savory menu items, but we came here right after having dinner. We just thought it would be great to grab some dessert, since we were in the area. Their menu had a list of soups, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches. All the more reason to come back! 

Another great thing about this place is that they give you the option of making your own gift basket. If you check one of the photos I have posted, you'll see the section where you can pick ribbons, boxes, baskets, and other lil things to make your own gift set. They also sell random trinkets. So cute!

This establishment sits right at the intersection of Craig & Tenaya, and is right across the street from a Starbucks. It's great for those who are just bias to having coffee from Starbucks. These two businesses are an awesome pairing. lol

Also, I skipped the beer here as the previous times I've been, they tasted water down. You know something is up when a review for a brewery starts with their more well-known brunch.

The main server is a real livewire, lots of fun a very good at her job.
In my ebook on Food for City Building, I argue that cities need a host of independent restaurants to make main streets come alive, so a place like this is welcome. 
The other point they add -- or added until the imitators followed them -- is that independents need to use their edge as independents to do something unique and non-franchisable -- franchises can only survive with an algorithm that can be turned into a mass market/mass production/cheap labor offering. Smoke houses use to offer that, but I think they now have to up their game to stay unique and special and worth the extra money.",2014-11-01 20:33:16

Being a Peruvian rotisserie chicken joint, expect very flavorful roasted chicken, colorful dipping sauces, and a laid back atmosphere.

Upon my most recent trip here, my wife and I split a half roasted chicken which comes with 2 sides. We ended up getting sweet potato fries and chicken soup. If you are a fan of any soup, I recommend this one as a side. It's broth based, but they don't kill it with salt and load it down with huge chunks of chicken, rice, vegetables, and cilantro. A must have if I get sick this winter! Also the chicken is a can't miss. Don't forget to get the dipping sauces located in the back of the restaurant. I recommend the yellow (tangy) and red (spicy).

He may have been doing some cooking or dishwashing in the back. He needs to hire some help. Our service was actually fine until we all wanted to check out at the same time so we could get to the play. Even then, we were able to get checked out fairly efficiently. 

We started with appetizers. These were pretty good: Tzatziki, Tiropita, Skordalia with Fried Eggplant, and Saganaki Nothing fancy, but solid. 

The main dinner entrees were not so good. Two of our party ordered chicken kebab and mixed grill kebab. Despite specifically asking if the kebabs included vegetables like tomatoes, there were none and everything was barely lukewarm. I had the gyro platter and was very disappointed that the gyro meat was not fresh from the spit, but just pressed slices from a package. Mine was also barely warm. Another person had the Mousaka. She said it was good but not warm. 

So the famous chef who cooked for Jackie O was waiting tables, not in the kitchen. He may make stuff ahead of time and then hire people to warm it up in the microwave. I'm not sure. Mine was definitely not homemade, although the salad that came with it was good.

The doctor was incredibly compassionate and we feel that he felt our pain and loss. 
The thing that stands out to me is that a couple days later, I received a sympathy card from the office. Not the standard printed card, but an actual sympathy card that signed with a few words of sympathy and empathy by EACH and EVERY employee at the clinic. Wow!

From the outside, the restaurant is housed in a cool modern treehouse.  On the inside, it's what you would expect from your typical fine-dining establishment.  The service here is attentive and accommodating.   They pay attention to detail by offering a black or white napkin depending on your attire. 

The food?  Perhaps some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Let's start with the bread basket.  It was mixed with a variety of carb-loaded treats.  Olive focaccia, soft pretzel, etc.  

We ordered the Spicy Mambo Salad and the Ocean Club House Salad for the table.  Both portions were very generous and each is enough for an individual meal.  Both were delicious but have their own individual personalities.  The Spicy Mambo Salad has no protein and is reminiscent of a caesar salad with hints of wasabi.  The Ocean Club House Salad had bits of lobster and shrimp and were well balanced.  We also order a side of macaroni and cheese for the table.  The ""side"" was huge and plenty for a table.  In fact, we had some left over for a party of seven.  Again, delicious.

For my entree, I had the 12 oz. filet.  I ordered it medium rare as I normally do.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender to the point that I could have peel off pieces with only my fork.  It's arguably the best steak I've ever had.  A friend order the sea bass, and unlike other fine-dining restaurants I've been to... the portion was huge.  The sea bass had a lightly seasoned crust and super white in color throughout.  It was flaky, yet melted in your mouth.  This was by far the best sea bass I've ever had. 

The reasons I didn't give Mastro's five-stars?  Three reasons.  First, the waiter seemed to have a little attitude when one of our guests requested separate checks.  And second, they had a band playing there that night.  I'm not sure if this is a common nightly play.  But, I'd rather not listen to a 70's - 90's cover band while I eat a fine meal.

When we first moved we had quite the struggle finding great food.  Thailicious came up in a search with great reviews but it is not close to home so we never ventured out.  My husband and I decided to go to the gym today (I haven't been in more than 6 months) and I was starving after.  I did a Yelp search for the area and Thailicious popped up.  

The best thing is that the reviews are accurate.  The restaurant looks clean.  The decor is modern.  They had nice music and the World Series of Poker was playing on the television.  I've been meaning to improve my Poker skills so this was perfect.  

I ordered the yellow curry mostly because I wanted potatoes.  The waitress said I could have just had the potatoes in the green one, but I didn't want to be a high maintenance customer.  I order a hot level of six because I wasn't sure what hot actually is for this place.  I like hot, hot food.  I think it's only been twice in my life when someone said a fish would set your mouth on fire and it actually did. Once eating Shrimp Diablo in Cali at some dive joint that set my pants on fire and another time at a Korean Barbecue while eating a random appetizer.  I think they set you on fire there so you'll leave and stop the AYCE.  The number 6 for me was mild.  I'll try an 8 next time for comfortably spicy.  

I also had a Thai Iced Tea.  I've never really liked this drink but it's something my husband would normally drink.  It sounded refreshing this day.  I enjoyed it for once.  Most places that he gets his tea from has a bitter brew.  This tasted strong but not old.  I'm not a fan of the bitter stuff. 

We order the crab delight (Rangoon) appetizer.  The presentation was pretty.  I swiped the flower and took it home and it now is living in my meditation room.  They prices were small but delicious.  

Hubby got the chicken satay to go as he wasn't hungry.  Poor thing missed out.  I like my food hot and fresh.  He said it was, ""Okay.""  I'm sure if he had been in the mood for Thai and hungry it would have been more than okay.  

All righty folks.  That's all I've got.  Wait! I have left overs so I've got this and that.

Definitely not a problem though, because I kinda figured it would be packed pre-game. It was my friends birthday and she preferred to sit at more a table setting so we grabbed seats at the window. I would definitely recommend it, especially when there are things going on downtown. It makes for great people watching. 
I got the tabasco fried chicken and the pot de creme since I wasn't super hungry.
She got the lamb burger which came with fries and the souffle. 

The chicken was not my favorite, a little on the bland side (could have used some salt) and the coating was a little greasy, although very crunchy. It had a nice spice to it from the tabasco, but otherwise there wasn't a lit of flavor and for 12 bucks for a leg and thigh and nothing else I was expecting the best fried chicken I've ever had. Or at least something close.

The pot de creme was delicious per usual.

The lamb burger was cooked perfectly and my friend loved it. I grabbed a bite and it was delicious, and I'm not even a big fan of lamb. The souffle was delicious as well.

The night stated out alright with the appetizers of salmon tataki and the grilled calamari. Both wear seared right and the accompanying sauces were tasty. But the sushi platter that came afterwards was disappointing. Rolls were heavy on rice and poor on fish. The sashimi slices were thin and the speciality roll we ordered lacked flavour.

November 2014- A decent experience. I always get a gel mani/pedi. Tony was lovely, and took care of an ingrown toenail, and my nails looked lovely when I left. The downside is they chipped a week later. 

December 8th, 2014- HORRIBLE
Same mani/pedi- this time with a design. They looked lovely. I decided to ask if they might have time to wax my eyebrows. DO. NOT. WAX. HERE. Tony burned my eye browns so badly I had to see a dermatologist, and get antibiotics, and a prescription cream to apply. I couldn't wear eye make up for a week- and the skin was peeling and bleeding. 

December 27th 2014- I went back, hoping that things would be better, if I stated that I had previously been unhappy. I was very specific with what I asked for. I have an ingrown toe nail again (a normal problem for me) as well as wanting a pretty design for the new year. I was treated so rudely. They insisted on doing my finger and toe nails at the same time (not very comfortable for me), and didnt remove the ingrown nail. 

What really just pissed me off, was the owners son (who's maybe 7 or 8). He was running up and down the room, jump roping, and yelling. He got bored of that, and came up to chat. Okay, fine. He started telling me that his birthday was in July, and honest to goodness, said, ""You'd better gimme some money, so I can buy Pokemon!"" Okay, I get it. Kids ask for money to buy stuff. But c'mon! So then, he actually takes my purse off the hook attached to the chair, opens it, and hands me my wallet. For Real?!  I told him that it was not okay for him to be touching my things, and took my purse and wallet back, then putting them back on the hook. 

It was pretty bad, after that. I told the gal doing my nails that I was not okay with the noise and atmosphere, nor the service I was receiving.  She finished, I paid ($65) and the boy still tried to get me to pay him.

Anyway, prices of some things here are much better than other places. Not everything is expensive. Their produce section is small as is their dairy section. Sometimes their freezers are out of stock on some items. It all depends on what day you come into the store. Weekends they are super busy. So go early if you can.

Yes I know, it's only an appetizer dish, not a real entree. But generally, these appetizer sampler plates offer some pretty tasty food for a modest price and can be a legitimate meal on its own. But the Appetizer Trio at Margaritaville is abysmal and a disgrace to all appetizer platters everywhere.

It comes with 3 things: chips with a mushroom cheese dip, lava lava shrimp, and 2 egg rolls. But the portions are all out of whack. There's less than a handful of shrimp, the egg rolls are finished off in 4 bites, and the plate is overflowing with chips and the worst dip of all time. $15 for essentially a plate of chips and a couple random items on the side. Totally not worth it.

The dip was terrible. It didn't even taste like cheese or mushroom. Extremely bland and zero flavor. All it did was add a pasty texture to the crunch of the chips.

Lava lava shrimp was actually okay, but there was so little. They came served in this cup that was half filled with lettuce where there should've been more shrimp. Blasphemous.

And the egg rolls were decent too. Those came with a chipotle thousand island dip that was rather thick and heavy but very flavorful.

But the shrimp and egg rolls are eaten so fast and you're left with a mass plate of chips and really bad dip. Leaves you yearning for more and quite unsatisfied.

Margaritaville seems like a really fun place to hang out and Westgate is pretty poppin on the right nights. But this appetizer dish was just so astronomically horrible. Shame on you, Margaritaville.",2012-02-11 22:21:09

We have some decent options here; Hot Topic occasionally stocks up on some great stuff for nerds like me and there are plenty of other stores that offer trendy casual and business outfits alike. Phone service? They've got it! Are you an Apple user like me? You'll want to stop on it to check out the latest Apple products here. And so on.

Service = gotta be part of a large party to get any attention.
.
After experiencing a very poor Som Tom offering at another ""Thai"" restaurant, I came to try Lemongrass Thai Cafe.  When I entered, there was 1 table seated and one person who turned out to be waiting for the rest of her dining party  Waitress greeted me and directed me to a table.  She provided a menu and asked if I would like a beverage.  I ordered a beer and she was off.  She returned with my beer and asked if I was ready to order.  

I placed my order for Som Tom with no shrimp and requested that the chef create a version with more Thai chile than they had ever used previously...along with a side of steamed rice.  Waitress wrote down my order and turned toward the kitchen.  She placed my order just as the remaining 9 of the party 1 patron was waiting for arrived.  Waitress seated and menu'd and water'd the party.  

About 10 minutes later, waitress returned with my salad.  It looked to be about 1 1/3 cup of salad along with a similar-sized version of steamed rice.  It also had green beans, which were not listed in the menu.  I asked Waitress to take it back, as I did not see green beans on the menu.  She took the salad and went to the kitchen, returning shortly to ask if I was allergic to green beans or not.  I asked why that was relevant, as I did not want green beans in the salad.  She replied that the chef inquired.  I said I was not allergic, just passionately detested the taste of green beans.  She returned to the kitchen, then went to take orders from the large group.  

I finished my beer while waiting for the salad.  When Waitress returned to the table with my salad,  I requested chile from Waitress.  She put her hands on her hips and said ""You have not even tried it yet.  How could you know it needs more spice?""  I asked her if she saw any Thai chile in the salad.  She peered and said she saw none.  I took a bite and, as suspected, knew I would need more chile.  I renewed my request and she was off.  

She returned with chile offerings and was off to the large group, making sure their water glasses were full and trading quick jokes with the diners.  I seasoned my salad and began to eat.  After a few bites, the desire for a drink made itself apparent.  I tried to catch Waitress' eye in her scurrying around the large party like a housefly.  It was to no avail.

On completing my meal, Waitress returned to ask if I wanted anything else.  I asked about water and a bill.  Both were delivered with alacrity.  I paid the bill and left.",2012-07-04 20:21:23

The place was packed - ofcourse. but wait wasn't long, maybe 10 in or so. We got a lil cute intimate table at the back of the restaurant. I got a cider and hubby got something on tab - and we got lobster poutine and steak tartare. 

The entire experience was awesome. The poutine had a decent amount of pink lobster goodness on top of your cheese and gravy and fries heaven. I coulda eaten 5 of those myself. The steak tartare was okay - it came with some lobster and fried potato chips. But i was comparing it to the steak tartare i had in paris... and lets just say this was not Paris.

I think the food is a little overpriced and the place is a little too seen-and-be-seen-ish, but I keep returning, because the concept works for me. I'm always looking for healthy convenient options and Flower Child fits the bill. I like how organized they are in the ordering process; you walk in and a staff member will grab a table and put a number on it for you while you order. This process prevents you from having to meander around stalking people for a place to sit, it makes for a lot less awkward experience.  

Everything I've tried so far has been quite tasty, the quinoa salad is delicious and filling with crunchy kale and flavorful manchego, I get it with grilled tofu for extra protein. I've also had the ""pick 3"" and I highly recommend the sweet corn and quinoa, it's very rich and creamy you can't tell that it's healthy at all. I also really enjoy the Flying Avocado wrap, the chicken is cooked perfectly and the hummus and avocado go really well with the veggies, also they let me substitute the gouda for manchego without the bat of an eyelash which was really nice.  

My favorite part of Flower Child is the fresh lemonade that comes in seasonal flavors and the delicious fresh brewed Iced Tea.

However, my boyfriend and I enjoy seafood and especially shrimp so we come here to eat as its directly across from work and an easy place to go for dinner.

It gained its two stars for a few reasons: usually we don't wait for a table, at lunch or at dinner time and the food is consistent. Not consistently amazing or anything, just consistent. The biscuits are yummy and I always get second helpings, but the staff isn't always eager to bring me second helpings of biscuits for some reason. I can almost never finish my entire meal (usually the downfall of me eating so many biscuits) but I get to have leftovers for lunch which is pretty good most of the time.

I can't agree that the service is top notch at this location. The staff frequently stand around the computer stations talking instead of getting drink refills or checking up on their customers. And when your section isn't that full, I'd rather see you doing your job than screwing off where you think I can't see you. I've never seen any manager troll the areas to ask people how they're doing either. Which probably would give them some good quality feedback that they could put to good use. I've had some fairly negative staffing experiences at this location: servers trying to tell us that they're 'fighting' over who's table gets biscuits first in the back (give me a break - its lunchtime and you should have plenty of those bad boys); ordering something pretty basic and having them get it wrong, taking away my plate while my friend starts to eat and 5 minutes later bringing back the same wrong plate with the right part on the side (I could have spent that time eating); spouting off random friendly crap that you know is 100% insincere and taking FOREVER to get drinks (seriously, it takes less than 1 minute to pour a pop out of a fountain machine).

Although there are better places to eat in Toronto, when you're craving shrimpies and greasy cheese biscuits, nowhere will satisfy that craving like Red Lobster.

The food was OK, nothing crazy good to me. The popular appetizer right now is deep fried avocado and they have it. I thought the Avocado came in a tie with the grilled shrimp as for the best things we ate. We tried the Steak and shrimp with cilantro rice and grilled tomatoes. The cilantro rice had maybe a hint of something but was very bland to me. The grilled tomatoes had no taste - even a splash of lemon juice or a pinch of salt before they grilled it would've helped taste wise. 
The waiter had a whole speech as to how their steak was excellent and it was the same steak as in the expensive steak house (I forgot the name) in the Silverton. So we were sold but the steak wasn't tender and I had to ask for sauce to deep it in for taste.
The shrimp had a yummy sauce on it.......
My brother really enjoyed his steak salad in a taco shell and my kid's cheese quesadilla was passable as well.....
The service was slow....too slow....the waiter at some point did come up to me and said that because I wanted my steak well done it would take longer which is fine to me but bring out all the other stuff like the kid's meals and the easy salad!!!! So even with all that it must be known that we were only the 3rd table with people in there so the extra slow service was just weird to me....
My main problem was with the young lady who was the greeter at the front. It was a Sunday afternoon on Father's day and her demenor was just awful. She hardly cracked a smile and she had ""I hate my job"" written all over her face!!!! I watched her with each customer that she brought to their table and each time it was just so unfriendly, so unwelcoming. I told our waiter what I felt and I hoped that he passed along the right channels because there are so many people right now that so badly need and want a job and that would appreciate one. So it just sickens me to see public service employees act like that.

Oh and as we were leaveing she didn't even look at as and then as we were going to turn a corner we heard in a very low monotone voice just like in a weird freaky movie ""Thankyou, have a nice day"" My Mother looked at me and said how nice she was thanking our backs.....",2011-07-11 04:17:47

If you have a craving that just cannot wait and you are at Caesar's then you don't have much choice.  The garlic pepper crab was not too bad and was probably the best dish we had.  But most of the other dishes are extremely salty because it is Beijing style, but the chef has a particularly high salt palate, even then.  The waitress admitted that they get a lot of complaints about the saltiness of the food, but there is nothing they can do about it.

Service is an atrocity - textbook for what you should NOT do.  We were seated at a table that was filthy underneath.  When I pointed this out to the hostess, she told me to just change seats.  They refused to clean it up.  She has to be one of the laziest people I have met in my life.  I was going to complain to the manager, but even she is a piece of work.  We sat next to the kitchen, and I guess one of the other tables sent back a dish because it was too salty.  Then she and the staff started to bad mouth the customer right in front of us.  Of course, it was in Chinese, but we still understood.  She used the entire gamut of expletives to describe the customer and started to give them a dirty look every time she walked by their table. Loosely translated, it went something like - eff them, they don't know s**t, nit picking.

To summarize, this place is a great value for simple maki rolls and makes them really well, but overprices the more involved rolls and leaves a lot to be desired. One thing I like about this place is that it serves Malaysian dishes, sushi, and Japanese dishes. The menus are quite extensive, which is a plus if you want to try a lot of different items, but perhaps if the restaurant specialized a bit more it could make up for some of the gaps in the sushi. I had the roti chanai appetizer: the roti was a typical  style, that you can get at a lot of places including flattop, but I really appreciated the fact that it was served with a tasty chicken curry. I had the lobster tempura roll, the shrimp tempura roll, and the golden dream roll. The golden dream roll particularly peaked my interest because I wanted to see how the mango and pineapple sauce ingredients would be incorporated. I was definitely disappointed with this one because the heaps of mango on the outside of the roll were flavorful but made it harder to eat, and the pineapple sauce pooled at the bottom and made the roll a lot more sloppier without adding much to the taste.

I would not have found out about this place had it not been for a 5 AM opening shift I agreed to take at the Starbucks nearby. Thank goodness that I did though :)

There was no way was I passing on the Funghi Swiss, which came with truffled oyster mushrooms. As an added bonus, I redeemed the Foursquare special, which gave me a double decked upsize (and proved to be more than I can handle)! There was nothing too overpowering with the grilled cheese, which is how I like it. It was an even spread of oyster mushrooms, with the subtlety of the truffle oil, packed between the chewy goodness of the Swiss cheese. The accompanying chutney dip and rosemary chips (resembling Ruffles) added a nice touch as well.

For about $10, I'd say the price is fair. I like their idea of the ""feature"" which allows customers to a create a new item on the menu, with the best item replacing the lowest selling item next month.

Because the pictures of the store here are nothing like the store I experienced. The store I experienced is an empty shell with a single register and counter to walk up to, a couple of stools in the window, and empty machines that clearly used to hold additional options for people who walk in but are now never in use.

I don't know. This place really underwhelmed me, and not just because the entire shop is a bland empty white room right now. Kudos for attempting to offer a variety of types of smoothies (weight loss, protein, wellness, energy, and cool blended), but...man, I hope the other smoothies are better than the one I had. 

The smoothie I got, a berry mix, had a weird aftertaste that I often experience in smoothies for some reason (is it the yogurt, maybe?). Plus, I thought the list of smoothie options was kind of short for a place calling itself Planet Smoothie. The option list was made up of two or three columns with four or five options each. Definitely not a lot, and not fitting for a business with a name like this one. And it was definitely way too expensive for what I got - it didn't even taste super fresh. Heck, it didn't even make me feel full or satisfied in the least: I proceeded to have dinner with friends an hour later and was absolutely starving. Made me wonder why I bothered getting a smoothie in the first place.

Location wise it isn't far from the strip at all, but I would not take a stroll around the hood if you don't have to. It is located on the northern (older) side of the strip around the Riviera, Circus Circus, and still in the works Fountain Blue. Check-in was the worst part of the stay by far. The long took FOREVER!

As for the bed...I would trade mine in for one of theirs in a bat of an eye. Sooooo comfy!!! We didn't spend much time in the casino, but their Sports book is one of the best in Vegas.

Before moving to town my husband and I stayed here a couple of nights. His company flew him in for a conference and flew me in to look for a place to live. It's not the most convenient place to lodge if you are leaving property each day because everything is a hike from the rooms. The walk from self parking to the front desk is ridiculous with luggage so I'd definitely recommend valet parking for guests. The room was clean and had a luxurious feel. The only amenity that wasn't provided was a coffee maker. Completely inconvenient, but typical because they want to strong-arm you into spending money at on site coffee shops. Can you just charge for Keurig pods in the room like mini bar items already? I'll gladly give you my money, but don't inconvenience me.

The property is amazing and meticulously maintained. The pool and lounging area looks like a lavish resort pool area should look. They've done a great job with this section of the resort. The spa is also clean with a luxurious feel. Locals get discounts on services at the spa which I have definitely taken advantage of a few times. The spa also has its own parking lot at the back of the property making it very convenient for locals. 

The restaurant selection inside of GVR and in the attached District is solid. My favorite restaurants inside the property are Pizza Rock and Tides Seafood & Sushi Bar. Both are casual, but have good food. The Grand Café isn't anything special, but is a good option for a quick lunch. Hank's is hands down the worst restaurant I've been to in this entire town. The food is horrible and somehow the service is even worse than the food. I'm excited that the property is about to add an Italian restaurant and a Mexican restaurant as well.

I was in search for a 100ft cat6 Ethernet cable and the Best Buy closest to my house did not have it, so I went online and checked the next closest Best Buy and was happy that it said it was in stock. Upon arrival, I usually get a greeting from the security, but not this time unfortunately. As I entered I immediately noticed that the store has changed entirely and looks a lot cleaner. I proceeded to go to the networking section and it was a complete mess with the Ethernet cables. All the Ethernet cables were not organized in length or type, so it was a mixture of 5e Ethernet cables and cat 6 Ethernet cables, which someone could easily mix up and purchase the wrong cable type, length or both. It was quite obvious some of them were ones that were returned as they just taped back on the cable on the package. As I was looking for my 100ft Ethernet cable, I could not find it so I asked for assistance and showed the person helping me that on the website it was in stock. I gave him the SKU number to check to see if it was in stock and I was told it was in stock, so the employee tried helping me look for a 100ft cat 6 Ethernet cable. With how messy it was, after some digging around, all I could find was a 50 ft one and a 150 ft one. Sadly 50 ft is too short for me and 150 ft is way too long, but I was in need of an Ethernet cable so I settled on the 150 ft. As I went to go pay, I was first in line and there were literally no cashiers, so I'm just standing here for a good five minutes until an employee realizes that I have been waiting and a line has built up. I don't know what's been going on with the two Best Buy's in my area, but the lack of customer service has really gone downhill. With how messy and unorganized this one has become and the fact that a product in stock couldn't even be found is not a good look.

We eat and drink yet again! 

Andy, our resident McFatFat, had a groupon that he kindly offered up to the group for our ""snack"". 

The draw for Andy and Lily is the super cold Sapporos. It gets icicles in your mug so if you're into that, you might want to check it out.

There's combo dinners (meant for two people) and a la carte items but the menu is pretty stripped down to mostly items for the grill, sides and a few out of the kitchen dishes like bibimbap or soup. It seems combos are the way to go since grabbing la carte stacks up fast. 

We just grabbed up Combo A ($26.95) which comes with chicken, shrimp, harami steak, and another kind of steak (4-5 pieces of each) . Sushi rolls (8 pc various kinds), two miso soups, two bowls of rice, one bowl of salad (more than enough to share), fried items: pork katsu, 3pc chicken karage, 3pc fried potstickers, and small banchan: diced radish, cabbage kimchee, seaweed, edamame. For two people this would definitely be a lot of food. More than enough to be stuffed, easy to split with three people to a contented full.

McFatFat wanted to grab their Kobe style beef ($19.95). It's still not bad of a price for great marbled pieces (8 slices) though it was almost as much as a full meal combo. It was very good- tender, flavorful even without any sauce. 

The lady made kinda a face when we said that was all we needed which for reals wasn't necessary to do to someone. 

Yes, there are 5 people sitting there but really it was about beer drinking and having a snack and not having a full dinner with some beer. We already ate and drank a few times so we weren't hungry, but always up to nosh!

I went in here for some sort of lunch item because I couldn't find a parking spot at Panera. I was hoping Publix was like Harris Teeter and had a salad bar.  Nope, they do not, or at least it was not where I would expect it.  

What they do have is a deli that creates custom sandwiches which are extremely popular as the line was 25 deep and they were lined up through the deli area so if you wanted to see if they had premade sandwiches you had to fight through all the people.  

Finally found SMALL pre-made sandwiches and side salads.But it was so crowded that I could not see if they had any condiments for my sandwich.  At this point I was thoroughly annoyed and just wanted to get out of there.  But NOoooooo. Couldn't get out that easy. Then I get stuck behind people who want to walk 3 wide and hog and entire aisle and walk as slow as possible.

Honestly the Bi-lo that was here before was more organized for the deli area.  Their sandwich and hot food bar was right in front which made more sense.

What saved this from being a 2-star review is the customer service up front. Somebody was waiting for me and took me right away. Yay and she and the bagger were very friendly and helpful.  Thanks for the Publix reusable bag too. I only had 2 items though so it seemed like a waste.

So far Publix, I am not a fan but I only came here for a QUICK in and out for lunch. I probably will not be a regular here because it's not close to home but they are building a Publix near me so there is still hope. And if I do come back, I'll remember to take a late lunch.",2014-11-03 17:54:41

We were not disappointed at all.  I had the philly cheese steak sandwich.  The steak melted in my mouth, the peppers on it were crunchy and not soft. My side dish was the hatch pepper mac and cheese.  It was creamy and the right amount of hatch peppers topped it off perfectly. Just the right amount of heat and flavor.  Craft beer was on tap from local breweries.  We spent a long time talking with Tim the General Manager regarding the business.  Everything is made inside the restaurant, fresh on a daily basis and that includes the breads, dressings, etc. The restaurant is also involved philanthropically with non profits in the neighborhood as well as reaching out to other restaurants for participation in their fund raising events. I like a local business that gives back to the community where I live.  Go grab a sandwich and a beer.  You will not be disappointed.",2015-05-18 18:30:17

Sitting at the counter where the food is being prepared, is a really fun treat.  You get to see how everything is put together and well, you realize how many calories you're actually consuming.  This can be a good or bad thing.  :)

The pasta dishes look small but trust me, it's enough.  

Never had a bad meal here.  This is the other place I recommend to friends who are looking for Italian.",2014-04-05 22:11:51

Walked in around 5:30 or so, and there was only one person in front of us in line, and the restaurant (and nice patio) was about 50% full.  We ordered quickly and got situated at our table before I went up to get drinks.  I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of drinks that were available, I counted 14 different fountain drinks (including Cherry Coke, Mello Yello, Orange Fanta and the other usual Coke stand-bys) as well as a Gold Peak dispenser with three different flavors.  I also thought it was nice that all over the restaurant there were boxes of peanuts for patrons to enjoy while waiting for their meals to come out.  My assumption was that it takes awhile to get the food.  Well, I was wrong on that one, because my food was up pretty quickly (less than five minutes).  I'd imagine if it was really busy it'd take take a touch longer, but for this visit, it was good.

I had a cheese burger (which was double pattied), the wife had a cheese veggie sandwich and we split the smallest size of fries.  Now this may have been the smallest size...but we could have probably fed four people off the amount that we got, it was a very generous portion.  Good flavor, but they weren't crisp.  I thought they could have been cooked a little more, the wife thought maybe they had sat out for a bit.  The burger, I liked, meat seemed nice a fresh, with good flavor.  The bun was fresh, but I've had better.  Off one serving, if I had to choose between In N Out or Five Guys forever, I'd probably give In N Out the nod, but this burger is definitely bigger/heartier than what you are going to get at In N Out.  I could see Five Guys growing on me with a few more visits.  

I had previous heard that Five Guys was kind of expensive...I thought it was a pretty good value for our two sandwiches, fries and one soda (wife got water)...less than $15.  (Note:  I did think it odd that there was a tip bucket up front...I mean, there isn't a waiter, I had to go get my own food and I bused my own table...I wouldn't tip at McDonald's...).

Anyways, this is a solid 3.5 for me.  I could definitely see this moving up to a 4 after another visit, but I wasn't blown away this time.  I am excited they are here and a solid burger option for me.",2010-03-29 02:58:54
