_8R6kZMUh0c_RvvTu0syKg,RsmcsC_A1shrZPt3l0DzGQ,yesClkCZlpLGTYZROkx4SA,4,2,1,3,"My best friend in Charlotte lives in Plaza Midwood and is a big fan of seafood. And we've both found it difficult to find good seafood in Charlotte. So when he told me that he found a place where he had good Chilean sea bass and a lobster tail for under $20, I was pretty skeptical. But naturally, I was prepared to give it a try.

So we went one evening in December around finals time. It was a cool spot. I wasn't really sure what to expect walking in. It wasn't a fancy place at all, but the decor had its own appeal and charm to it. It had a variety of streamers, lights and...well ""flair."" Like it or not, it's definitely not something you see everyday. Plenty of seating, a cool tiki bar, clean, terrific and attentive service...not sure if there was any outdoor seating though. 

But the highlight was the food. There were many cool options to choose from. They consider themselves soul seafood fusion and the menu options did not disappoint. The special was halibut with lobster tails and rice. Absolutely delicious. The best seafood that I've had in Charlotte. I also had to try the gumbo, because, well, I'm a fan of gumbo. And I'm now a fan of their gumbo. The meal was terrific and very reasonably priced. It was so great in fact, that I ordered shrimp and grits to go for my wife (who has to work late.) she was pleasantly surprised and loved it too! We can't wait to go back.",2013-01-06 21:06:45

The fact that the administrative girls know my name? Impressive. Delivered my first baby with Dr. Deka and I am just so grateful for her! We could not have had a better experience. Though I did have some issues (preeclampsia and the baby heart de accelerations) I felt completely confident with her and the entire staff. They truly care about their patients and it is so evident!

X04auNoVLnd6WZLovaeYzQ,WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ,3,3,1,1,"Yusho serves Japanese street foods in small platters, similar to tapas. 

I've only been here twice, the first time was when I was invited to a dine around when the restaurant first opened. I brought my roommate and we sampled several of their dishes. Some of the flavors paired with the dishes were a bit different than the typical Japanese cuisine, but this made the tasting fun and new. I remember loving the fresh oysters and the NY strip steak... Incredible! I also remember not caring for the ramen at all, as for some reason it tasted sour. Some of the dishes were mouthwatering good and the others, less than average.

My second visit was more recent, when I came for the event Yusho After Dark. For $20 you're able to enjoy a main dish, an alcoholic beverage, and the apps they pass around to your table. There was this unique salad with dried black mushroom and a poached egg that I liked. Never tried anything like it! 

I know that their normal menu is a bit pricey for the small portions they provide. I would say that Yusho is a restaurant to go to for the experience and to try new, different dishes. If you are starving, I would recommend going elsewhere.",2015-02-24 09:48:31

After waiting in an unreasonable period of time and not seeing a server to take our order we finally left.

The pancake (I forgot the name of it) was one if the best I've had here in Vegas with lots and lots of walnuts inside topped off with bananas.  The turkey sausage was good but we did have an issue that was taken care if but still shouldn't happen...my wife had a crab benny and she had shell that was left behind with including a piece of a knuckle...she the taste was off as well....the only pet peeve...no booths or comfortable chairs the tables seem too small...but will be back to give it another chance...in sure you guys deserve it.,2016-07-26 00:19:56

  Most disturbing, the Centre signage is flatly wrong. Signs steer you to a second floor washroom that is locked and a nearby shopkeeper must tell dozens of shoppers each day that to go the first floor. The signs on that floor steer you to a single user washroom. This is completely unsatisfactory. I simply cannot understand why a mall would lock washrooms and cannot get its signage correct.",2017-10-12 13:57:39

That was the dish I ordered most recently because their pho had gone completely downhill from when I used to visit this place frequently many years ago. They started cutting back on so many ingredients, it essentially became 95% noodle + bean sprouts and 5% meat. At those odds, I'm better off eating a McDonald's ""100% beef"" patty.  

This rice noodle dish had 3 meat components and none of them tasted completely natural. The chicken was probably the best, as it was actually the texture of chicken and tasted like there was some real flavour in it.  There was a slab of beef wrapped around slices of raw onion. Yes, just raw onion with no real seasoning or cooking. It was so tough, I couldn't tell if the beef was real meat or MSG-flavoured carpet. There were also chunks of beef (?) wrapped in seaweed. Not sure if it was beef because all you could taste was a weird sweetness. The seaweed was soggy. 

What was good about this dish? Well the carrots, peanuts, and chives were pretty good. Not because they had any special flavour, it's just that they tasted like what they're supposed to be. 

Funny story, when my friend asked for ""a table for three"", the lady thought he said ""a table for free"" and promptly told him to get out. Throughout dinner, I'm pretty sure she was watching us in case we actually had no money and bailed. This wasn't relevant to my rating as service at Chinese-run restaurants is kind of...special. Rule of thumb: if they don't argue with you on anything, you're in the clear!

I had expected more of a fine steakhouse, but it looked like more of a diner to me. We weren't that hungry, so went to the Fireside lounge instead of the main restaurant. We sat at the bar and played video poker and they comped our drinks. 

They have an extensive specialty drink list. got the frozen chocolate banana drink. OMG...so good!!  Well worth the $10 price, even better when it was free. 

We ordered nachos with some of the ingredients only in half and it came out correctly.

I've always been a huge supporter of animal rescue organizations, and while I rescued Minnie from a small rescue site seven years ago, I've supported the Humane Society through the years with monetary donations as much as possible.  But yesterday, I did something different...

I started my day (just like Melissa H) by rolling over to look into Minnie's eyes and be reminded how lucky I am to have an incredible dog that has become my family... After our morning walk and breakfast, I teamed up with a group of friends and we made the trek out to Dobbins Road and 19th Avenue to volunteer at the Humane Society.  I had no idea what to expect and I hadn't seen the reviews that came before mine, but I was extremely impressed at the size, cleanliness, and friendly staff at this fabulous facility.

During our three hours on-site, Kathy Chumley gave us a tour of the building,  told us about the history of society, and educated us on how they operate, the animals they care for, the staff they employ, the volunteers that help, etc... We saw the cutest dogs, cats, bunnies, and horses and we helped with feeding the horses, petting the cats and bunnies (I guess this helps socialize them), and putting leashes together too.

If and when I adopt another animal, the Humane Society is where I'll go to do it... and I highly suggest checking this place out if you're looking to add to your family as well.",2009-10-27 01:48:44

Fatima did them and I am very happy. She was thorough and took her time, which I appreciated. She wore gloves. She prepped my skin properly. (I worked in a salon for a couple of years which is why I notice some of these things) She used a new wax stick and strip every time. When she was finished she used an aroma oil on my skin. Often times I break out if the wax is no good or not clean....not a single break out in this case. That also means they use a wax that is for sensitive skin. 

The salon is pretty, professional, and well taken care of. (Meaning clean) Everyone speaks English. This was nice for people like me that really want to explain what I am looking for. I walked in on a Saturday and they were able to see me right away. Next time I will make an appointment because it is polite but they said eyebrows are easy to fit into the schedule. Although $20 might be on the ""higher"" side of an eyebrow wax, I feel I got what I paid for. But if all I have to pay is $5 more than most places for this type of an environment, I will count that as a good deal. I will definitely be going back.",2015-07-29 20:35:51

The food was delicious we had the bacon wrapped shrimp with a Thai sauce with a coleslaw and asparagus wrapped in New York steak with a Marsala sauce for appetizer. 

I had the 20oz rib eye, my wife the lobster ravioli and my daughter had a classic burger. Yum, yum and yum.

My steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, my wife's ravioli was made from scratch while my daughter loved her burger. 

To end the meal we shared a cheesecake and creme brûlée. Creamy rich and smooth. Can't wait till next time.

Everything was excellent..

I'm a bridesmaid in a friend's upcoming wedding and the bride decided to order the bridesmaids dresses from here.  Everything was fine and good...until the bridesmaids dresses failed to arrive by the promised date.  The poor bride and maid of honor made repeated frantic calls to see if the store could put a rush on the dresses or at the very least, provide a new estimated arrival date.  The staff here was very rude and unprofessional -- they never once apologized for the delayed dresses, got flustered and angry on the phone, and refused to pay any extra amount to have the dresses rushed so they would actually arrive on time.  Very bad customer service!  In the end, the dresses arrived a mere week before the wedding, the bride had to pay out of pocket to overnight them to out-of-town bridesmaids, and we all had to pay extra to have them rush tailored.

The patty melt was fresh and tasty, the rueben was just as a rueben should be, and my bottled beer ... well it was bottled beer.  The service was pleasant and reasonably prompt.  So why just three stars?  It's not just that the French fries were soggy.

Clue #1 - Our server was the bartender.

Clue #2 - We were not sitting at the bar.

It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that Karsen's must be a very small place.  Indeed it is, with six small tables inside, and about eight seats at the bar.

So what's wrong with that? --- Nothing.  Throughout Spain and Italy bars like this are the main places people go for quick meals.  But Karsen's takes small to a new level.  For example, there are no draft beers.  For example, from your table you get a view of a long untidy corrider leading to the back of the building.  For example, your one seating option is a bar stool.

In the end, Karsen's feels a bit like a third world beer joint, slightly upgraded, and with food much better than one would expect at such a place.  Three stars -- that's just about right.",2013-05-08 16:22:40

It's Sunday, Father's day, and well... Vietnamese style brunch, they transform this made to order restaurant to an all you can eat buffet. Make sure you get here early as this place is pretty much packed for it, because of the quality of dishes that they serve. The buffet definitely differs itself from every other ""Chinese"" buffet in that they only do it one day a week and well, the food is good. 

They stick to one thing they know. Vietnamese food. They don't have pizza or sushi or even BBQ. It's not a large buffet, but they're efficient in sticking to their own specialties. That's why this buffet is better than the usual ""formula"" buffets. They have broths, pho, pork, fried egg pancakes, spring rolls, grilled pork, and the most popular: quail. Yes you heard me, quail. What restaurant would be crazy enough to put that on a buffet? And when it comes to the dessert, it's all Vietnamese desserts. No pudding here! 

And it's not like the food is mediocre either. The quail is seasoned and well cooked. All the dishes are actually, and you truly can sample a lot of the dishes the restaurant serves during the week by just coming to the Sunday brunch buffet.

I started with the eggplant pizzettes.  They were crispy but not oily.  Good app.  I had a large New York style Big Apple pizza.  It had good crust, but could have used about another minute in the oven to crisp the bottom just a bit more.  I love truffles so I also ordered a square White Truffle pizza.  It could have used another handful of mushrooms, but overall, I loved the flavor.  Some may say the crust was too oily, but I like it that way.  I usually hate square pizzas, but I will order this one every time I come here.  

If you are looking for a bargain, you won't find it here.  The prices are not low, but the quality is high.  Drinks are expensive, so come during happy hour if you are going to have a few.  

The reason for a one star deduction is the service.  The service was terrible.  In fact, it was so bad that I would normally have given a two star deduction, but that White Truffle pizza was so good that they earned one star back.

The bisque as unexpectedly rich, decadent, and delicious. I could have just eaten that and left happy. The grain bowl was a bit of a hit-and-miss for me.

But like I said, it is possible to eat here for a reasonably. I recommend starting with a starter such as the tuna sashimi, but don't waste $7 on edamame that you could buy at Trader Joes. Then start with 6 or so rolls. You can always order more later if you are still hungry.

I love the Pinot Gris by the glass from the Willamette Valley. Its crisp acidity goes perfectly with maki rolls and sushi.

The white tuna sashimi is a perfect starter. My mom (who hated anything resembling raw fish before coming to Umi) couldn't get enough of this. It's a must.

The white fish and mint is my favorite roll. Something about the brightness of the mint against the subtle, freshness of the white fish makes this roll absolutely to die for. I also can't get enough of the salmon sushi. It's topped with cream cheese and cherry tomato. Our waiter recommended it to me once, and I have to order at least one piece every time I go!

As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).  

If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good. 

Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. 

Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down.

In visiting restaurants I usually sit at the bar to eat, but their inside bar seems to stay lively so cheers to a lively bar and I sat at a table.  

I had the Chicken the first visit.  I can't remember exactly what they call it, but it came with Mac n Cheese and I'm a fan.  There was another restaurant I loved that had a similarly cooked chicken with a molasses gastrique that was taken off the menu so I'm thrilled to find this one.  It doesn't have the molasses gastrique for that tart/sweet bite, but it is delicious and well-made and I will get it again.  The Mac n Cheese was creamy and cheesy and delicious.

At my second visit I sat outside on their enclosed patio!  I like that they have enclosed it completely (open to the sky though) to shut out noise and bypassers and parking and I'm sure the neighbors appreciate that as well.  It's simple, but has a finished looked to it with flowers and some simple decoration and delineation between table areas and I enjoyed sitting there.

There is a bar out there, but it wasn't open when I was there on a Wed evening, so I guess it's for when it's busier or weekends/special events.  

The seating is mostly trestle tables that you may or may not end up sharing with other people.  You are served separately from any table mates and it actually works out quite well.  People tend to be a little more quiet which is an interesting effect and one I appreciated.

At my second visit I had the Crispy Salmon with Brussel Sprout Chips, Parsnip Puree and a fair drizzle of Basil Oil.  Yum.  Whoever the cook/chef was on this piece of fish deserves high praise.  

It was cooked perfectly.  I say that because the crisp on the skin was to the perfect degree (for me - deeply caramelized/smoky without tasting burned)  The salmon was so hot internally (Ah cahnt tahk so haht)  but not the least bit overcooked with that smooth creaminess of texture that melts in your mouth - so wow - Thank you Chef.

The Parsnip Puree was just enough to give that extra taste without becoming overwhelming in that licorice taste...was it parsnip puree or fennel?  Now I'm not sure, but oh, so good.  The Basil Oil was subtle but gave a depth that was appreciated with the Brussel Sprout Chips.  

The Brussel Sprout Chips were my only slight detraction.  I thought I was getting some little roasted brussel sprouts (which I would prefer), so getting the little, crispy flakes was slightly underwhelming, but they were really good, not too charred and enough of them that I still got the brussel sprout flavor I enjoy and they added a nice texture.

We ordered the vegetarian platter (appetizer), beef tajine, and mixed grill.  The platter doesn't come with enough bread so our server brought us more.   The kitchen prepared a chicken tajine instead of the beef.  The owner was kind enough to not charge us for that plate.  

My wife had a mango margarita which she said was perfect. 

The desert was a nutella crape with a scoop of gelato.  I thought it was odd that there was a gelato case in a Moroccan restaurant so I asked about it.  I was told that Morocco was close to Italy so gelato is also part of their restaurant scene.  

You need to pay at the reception table like at a diner.  They have a really cool iPad looking device that swivels.  The owner told me that it keeps track of trends and advises them on their hot sellers.  It can even be used as a punch-in clock for the employees.

The cupcake place that people said to go were Caked and The Cupcakery. Both were far away from the Olive garden we ate at. Yelp had tons of mixed reviews of GiGi's cupcakes but I said to my self, you can't mess up a cupcake.

So we find it and it was easy to spot for the sign is very clear.

We get inside and the place looks wonderful, very welcoming and nice decor etc. I asked what was their most popular and the Rommie i think it was suggested the Red Velvet but his personal favorite was The strawberry shortcake i think?

We purchase it and take it back to our hotel and i give one of two that I order to my friend Traci who it was her Birthday. 

As i bite into mines, i didn't like what i tasted it. The frosting wasn't cream cheese which is a no no to me. Your red velvet should always be a cream cheese frosting.

After biting more into it, I don't like the taste of the cake it self too. It tasted very artificial. Not very good in my opinion.

The frosting though is what very much killed it for me. It tasted like it came out of a tub that the super markets get. I remember tasting the same exact frosting from the super market chain QFC in Seattle.

OMG! OMG! It was by far the best Bruschetta I have ever tasted..... If you don't try anything in your life... 

This is a must!!! I know, I know it's toasted bread but it's not the bread it's the toppings on the bread......
 
I had the Brie and apples with fig spread: the Brie and fig melted in your mouth and then here comes the crunch from the apple... POW!!

Fresh Moz w/tomatoes you can't go wrong! 
Smoked salmon with pesto.... Yummy 
White bean with chopped tomatoes....round two please..

At first I looked at the price...$14 for Bruschetta but you get to choose up to 4 different varieties so that was great. Worth every penny!!!!!

The wine was delicious!! Before 5pm all wines on the wine list are $5 so keep them coming! (I had the Victor wine it's a red zinfandel with vanilla under tones) 

I also order the mixed greens salad... Don't let the name fool you.  It's was soooooo good! 

It had shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, Gorgonzola, leeks and mixed fresh greens...,this combo of flavor sent me on a tail spin... ( I know I'm a drama queen) 

My husband had the turkey panini it was delicious but nothing to scream about.  

Desserts was the crème de la crème of desserts....salted caramel sundae..... Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate cover corn nuts and two pretzels on the side with a side of salted caramel to drizzle on top!!!! Yummy!!!!

The wine list is rather large for a smallish restaurant.

The service at Bella Luna is also top-notch.  The wait staff is attentive and flexible to requests, and the owners (a husband and wife) will often swing by during the meal to see how everything is.   

Prices are also reasonable with most entrees running in the $10-$18 range.

The only drawback is the size.  It's not a huge place, so call ahead or come early.  

I suggest:  
Veal Saltimbocca-  All of their meat is very good.

Me and my coworker were talking about pizza the other day and this place came up.  I looked it up online and it looked familiar to some other places I had been to.  Same concept at least.  I was super excited to try it out.  The fellas (and one lady) decided to come here for lunch today.  We chose a bad time to come (12:00 noon) and the line was about 25 people deep.  We had planned to eat it here but ran out of time so we got it to go.  I placed my order for a Steak & Blue.  My total was a little over $8.00.  Paid the woman my money and waited for my pizza.  Here is how it was...............

Steak & Blue-  WOW!  This thing was fantastic!  I'm usually a simple type guy when it comes to pizza.  Pepperoni or plain cheese suits me well.  While I was standing in line, the Steak & Blue sounded way too good to pass up though.  I couldn't have picked a better pizza!  They start by brushing oil and garlic on their pizza crust.  They then load this thing up with mozzarella cheese, pieces of steak, onions, mushrooms, peppers and gorgonzola (the blue!).  They throw it in this huge oven and a few minutes later it is done.  The flavors on this thing are out of this world!  The crust stayed perfectly sturdy and crisp even after a short drive.  The first bite in, I knew I had a winner!  It was basically like eating a cheesesteak pizza.  It was damn tasty.  All the ingredients were fresh and blended together very well.  I will be back to get this pizza again.

The line was the only thing that sucked......not their fault though.  If you came here during off peak hours, you would have your food in 5 minutes.  Service was friendly and the pizza was delicious.  This is the best kind of ""make your own pizza"" type restaurants that I have ever been to.

The fat on both meats rendered beautifully and the taste and texture of the cooked products justified the premium price.  The gentleman at the butcher counter was friendly and helpful.

Only come here if you want cheese curds, or some variety of ice cream. 

The burgers and sandwiches are all overly greasy and over priced. The flavor isn't quite right either.

If you decide on curds, don't waste your time with the family size. It's always the same size as a large for me and costs a ton more. They're delicious but not worth the premium for the family size. 

The management is cheap too. Want a dipping sauce for your curds? Guess what - you have to ask for it and you get charged a premium for ranch.

The waitress was also very happy to answer our 457 questions about the food options so that we could decide what to order.

My rice with beef was larger and more filling than expected, especially for the low low price (around $5).  For slightly more you can make your meal a combo and add a couple of appetizers.

Listen homeslice, not only are you flirting with my brother in front of my parents whom are across the table from him, but his wife is sitting right next to him! How do you not see the giant rock on her finger? But, I will say, it was really entertaining for me cause everyone else was super uncomfortable with it.  Haha, I laugh at awkwardness. 

This waitress is also one of those that thinks she is too good to write down orders, well this time she should have because she wasn't paying attention. My mother orders, then I order the petite filet-medium, but the healthy one that skips the mashed potatoes and adds a salad. Simple enough right? Well, then my Dad orders and for his side gets muffin and I think to myself ""well, crap, they have yummy baked goods and its fall so they probably have their pumpkin muffin"" so then I say to her, ""oh and can I have a pumpkin muffin"" and she responds, ""is that all?"" and I say, ""yes"". With me so far? Okay so then my sister-in-law orders and then my brother orders and has to listen to her witty response. Boom food comes out. Guess what I get? Just my pumpkin muffin. Apparently homeslice thought I just wanted a pumpkin muffin instead of my petite filet. Yep, that happened. We all had a good laugh when the waitress walked away to put in my real order that we all reminded her about. So eventually it comes out, but its not the healthy one, I get the potatoes and instead of it being cooked medium, its well-done.

I suppose compared to Pillow Chicken, this dish seems like its from a different restaurant altogether. Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.  

However, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.  

Anyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.

We had the same bartender both times we visited and I totally see her face in my mind, but can't remember her name. Casey, I think it was? Either way she is super friendly so I highly recommend sitting in her area of the bar. She always has a big smile and is just super upbeat. 

The downside to this place is the price. Some, quite a few, of the bottle beers are pricey. Like $8.50 pricey for beers that I don't believe are worth it. Also, they don't serve food, but you can order food from outside restaurants to be delivered there, a concept I still can't wrap my head around (bartenders and servers I spoke with at local places were not happy about that, btw). 

I think this spot will be perfect once they have some bands booked. May be pricey, but the layout is wonderful, especially when the doors are open. It's big and spacious and whatever beer you like, they probably have it. The service is top notch and they have TVs so you can catch the game. I say check it out.",2013-05-29 17:28:54

Last week the boyfriend suggested we go on a ""date"" and try something new, but preferably in Tempe since that's where we would be shopping prior.  Nothing came to mind, so I browsed Yelp and found Classic Italian Pizza.  It was love at first read.  

Thanks to the prior reviews we were able to find it by searching for the Big Lots sign, and were greeted by a mostly vacant parking lot.  There, in the corner, the restaurant was glowing and inviting.  Upon entering we were surprised to find only 3 other tables full, and this was a Friday night.  Yippee!  No wait!  

We started with the yummy brick oven bread, Caprese salad, a glass of pinot grigio, and Warka (polish beer)....which all came out quickly.  The bread held up to it's expectations - it was the perfect texture of chewy dough and light flavor, brought with a plate of marinara sauce and balsamic.  Next it was on to the pizza - Margharita for me and Pepperoni for the boyfriend.  Both were yummy, hot, and flavorful.  Every table has it's own bottle of olive oil, balsamic, parmesean, and red pepper so we were able to spice our pizza's up just how we like.  Mmmm!

For me, it's not only about the food it's about the ambiance and this place definitely has both.  It's cozy, pleasant, and when you're there you really feel like someone invited you to be in on the secret.",2008-12-13 15:59:30

It's small and cozy, and depending where you sit, it's hard to get up to go to the washroom. Speaking of that, it's in the basement. They kept it modern and clean with one room for each gender. I wasn't a big fan of the wallpaper or the decor. Nothing spoke out Malaysian (fusion) to me. 

The entrance could have a better set up for the server/host to greet the customers. Things were placed on two stools. 

We were early and were offered water right away. Throughout the dinner, water was refilled without asking. They were informative on the night's special entree and the ingredients that are used in the desserts. 

Meals: (1) The lettuce wrap with two (pieces of) soft shell crabs was small and I believe it's not worth $11. There's better deal out there for an app like this at a Japanese place. (2) The red chili wings looked good and it was actually hot in temperature which was nice since you know they just fried them!!! It had a good sauce to it, just a bit tiny on the size of the wings. (3) Char Kway Teow fried rice noodle was not worth it at all. It came with three shrimps, not prawns as the menu stated. I ordered this dish because it was recommended by other Yelpers. It reminds me of a ""pad thai"" or stir-fried noodle at a chinese place. The sauce was bland, but the spicy sauce that came with it was a lot better. They didn't add hardly any veggies, just bean sprouts, so it looked ""blah"". A little bit of red peppers, green peppers and coriander would have made the dish stand out! (4) My friend ordered the Laksa and he said the sauce was great that he took it home, but the quantity was not enough that he felt hungry still. A joke was that we should try the Cubana place next door to fill up our tummies after this experience. (5) Sago sago was for dessert and they were disappointed as they say it wasn't worth the money. My friend said she could make it better!!

We actually kept up with the timing of when they would see us. They were so busy there that all the waiters and waitresses had their hands full of plates and there were dirty glasses all over the counter that we first lay our eyes on. It just didn't look too impressive, but as a yelper who loves food, I'm still waiting for it. 

We had a couple waiters come to us saying that the maître'd will come serve us. When he did, we got seated for approx 15 minutes before we got served water. By that time, we already figured out what we want to eat from the groupon coupon we had. (2 apps, 1 antipasiti, 2 entrees, 2 desserts) ($69)  
We quickly ordered our food and noticed that the table next to us had the wrong entree ordered and served to them. The waiter told them that it would be a 45-60 minute wait in order to change it. It must have been a jungle in there because there were so many people and many plates flying out and in the kitchen. 

My boyfriend and I decided to take this date to come here because it was reviewed as the top 10 restaurants out of 6500 in Toronto so we thought it'd be nice to try. 

We timed that our appetizer (mozzarella and tomatoes + arugula salad) came another 20 minutes after our ordering and our antipasti (beef carpaccio) came 10 minutes after we finished our apps. We waited almost an hour until our entree came and by that time we wanted to pack it up and go because it was already 1045. So basically we spent 2.5 hours at the restaurant waiting for our entree (rainbow trout + lamb chops) to come and we didn't even get to eat it because we weren't even hungry anymore because of the wait. I was really disappointed as I had read reviews that this place was amazing.

We just wanted our desserts by then and we ordered the creme brulee and tiramisu. Both of which were amazing and to-die-for! It was so worth the wait!

The waiter was a young man and was super polite about it. He apologized a whole lot tonight about the wait times and how this hasn't happened before and he hopes we would come back because food is actually really good. How do you only have 3 chefs on a Saturday night???!?! But anyway I don't know if I would come back.

I had no idea what it was except that people said it was like a donut and filled with cream.  From what I saw on here it looks like a honey crueller.  No problem, wanted to jump on the donut bandwagon.

Sent someone to go there and get it.  They bake 'em throughout the day.  Whatever we got was not what I thought it was.  It was nice, dont' get me wrong.  I long for the Lemon Meringue softness of a good glory hole donut, but alas, they don't make 'em anymore.

The donut was soft and even though it's fried it didn't taste deep fried.  However, the box it was nestled in said otherwise as a large oil stain made it's mark.  The cream was a bit of a disappointment.  It's ok I guess but if you want to talk about quality the cream was jammed into one small area, albeit there was alot of cream but it didn't distribute evenly.  We got the nutella version and the same thing, it was all in one area.  

Personally I'm not much of a cream person so I just threw it out and just ate the donut.  The donut is light and fluffy.  I guess this is what people would call a cake or bread donut.

Went back and they had another one, called garfoo (whatever).  It's a regular donut but with sugar on top.  This donut reminds me of the bakery that used to be in Kensington Market long ago, except that one was a twist.

Had a passion fruit tart, not bad but the tart itself was heavily covered in sugar icing.  Not necessary I say.

I'd love to come in here myself but I better make sure my wallet is with me!

I am not a huge fan of supper clubs either and that played into my distaste for this place. When I am at dinner, I generally don't like having to scream across the table to talk to my friends.

When we got there, we were seated right away this time on the high top tables near the bar. The service was a little slow at the beginning, but all our needs were taken care of. The four of us ordered; shortrib agnolotti with kabucha, steak tartar, crispy shrimp with a spicy bisque, beef carpaccio, and the beet salad.

Overall, the food is decent. The best item was the beet salad. It is not a knock to the other items, but the greens were just that good. I love beets and am glad to see them make an appearance on many menus nowadays. The agnolotti were also wonderful. The stuffed pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce is reduced to caramel consistency and retained all the flavor of the beef. Out of the raw dishes, the carpaccio was better. The pesto tossed noodles on top was a splendid pairing. I've had better tartars on the Strip, so I would skip that next time. The bisque for the shrimp had a nice flavor to it and would be great for a cold day.

The shop itself is quite spacious. There is a communal table near the back, and a long pew which accomodates three tables near the front of the cafe. There is also a bar at the street facing window. Thanks to the free Wi-Fi it was a pretty accomodating place to work for a few hours.

The coconut latte was pretty good! It's quite sweet, which is a change from how I usually like my coffee but it wasn't bad at all. The coconut really makes for a mellow drink, and was an impressive opening salvo.

I wrote more about the food in the captions of the pictures, but the definitive highlights for me were the foie gras, the beef, and the dessert; so amazing in both textures and flavors.  Let downs included the scallops, the duck, and the bread.  Crab was decent, as was the butter (can't believe it was made  the same afternoon!).

The setting was pretty fantastic, with glass walls right next to the capitol so you can see the building lit up at night. Elegant and dim (but not too dim), with great service.  Each person who presented the courses walked us through what components were present in the same even cadence.  Some minor quibbles: on the scallop dish it was obvious that the fingerprints had not been wiped off the dish, which was somewhat off-putting. Also, the timing of the courses varied dramatically, with some long pauses and others that had a dish right after another.  Not sure what happened there.

However, the servers were perky and fast.  Our order was taken and delivered just like that.  I had the veggie burger with no bun and coleslaw.

- 2016 Les Petits Arnauds blanc sec ($33.00) - this was a white bordeaux, which my cousin's never tried before. A light, dry white. Went down easy. 
- 2016 Chateau Les Arromaus sauvignon semillon ($33.00) - the cous and her friends ordered another bottle. They wanted the same bottle but ended up getting this as the bartender thought this was the same white bordeaux. 
- Warm olives ($4.95) - the olives came with rosemary garlic and chilies. Olives were tasty but the best part was the hint of heat in the olive oil sauce.
- Oysters ($1.00 each) - we ordered two dozen oysters to share. Love buck a shuck (regularly $3.50 each)! It came with horseradish, lemon, mignonette and a spicy (not really) sauce. These were tuxedo oysters from PEI. Pretty fresh but a couple of oysters had bits of pieces in it. 
- 3x Lobster ($24.00 each) - the cheapest lobster I've ordered in a restaurant. Each lobster was about one pound. It came with a side of warmed butter (meh); I always prefer to eat mine au natural. Nice touch that they give you each a cracker and pick to grab the small bits of meat. Decent!

When a friend told me her family has been going to Wong's for years and years, I knew I had to try it. 

When we walked in, the decor reminded me of my family's local Chinese restaurant that we loved. After we were seated, our waitress brought us hot tea and ice water. My husband and I have a ritual: he gets whatever is most like his favorite dish (General Chu's Chicken) and I get something different. Then, he has to have noodles. 

He found the Emperor's Chicken, which was very good. The big chunks of white meat chicken were fried, but not thickly battered. The sauce was spicy with a hint of sweetness. Our other dish was the Mongolian Beef. It was very good, but not as good as my favorite Mongolian sauce - at the Mandarin Grill in Tucson. The lo mein noodles were good, but my husband wanted the BBQ pork, and that's not really something I like.

We started off with the fried pickles. My theory about fried pickles is that they all taste the same. They really do. No matter where you go, if they're serving fried pickles, they will take like the next place's fried pickles. I am waiting for someone to prove me wrong.

My fella had the ribs with slaw and hush puppies (aka dinner donuts), and I had a chicken burger. We were so stuffed by the end! The fella loved his ribs. My chicken burger was good too. I was especially pleased at all the sauce options. I do love a good sauce.

The thing is, the food was kind of expensive for what it was. No deep fried pickle is worth $11, folks.

As many Yelpers have given this a pretty good review, I decided to come to give it a try while I was craving for some hot Korean soup on a chilly day.

Came here on a Saturday night with 3 others. Parking was terrible, even though there was free parking in the back, the lot is super small and quite a dead end. The lot is shared with 2 other restaurants that were beside it. There's rarely any lights in the parking besides the back lights of the restaurant itself. Once, you drive in all the way to the back of the lot and noticed there'e no parking, then it's time to test out your backing up skills in the dark. What makes it even more challenging, try to avoid the bumpiness of the road with holes all around.

The place is very small inside, 4 booths and only 5-6 tables and barely any room for you to stand while you wait. They seem really busy or rather UNDERSTAFFED. We sat down at our table for a good 10 mins and we didn't get drinks or even the menu. Good thing there was the service call button on the side of the wall, so we just kept ringing it until someone came to our table. 

We ordered the hot table bacon for 2, a pork bone soup and a beef broth soup.  Usually at other Korean restaurants from previous experiences, side dishes come fairly quick after you order. We WAITED OVER 30 MINS to get side dishes and after another 10 mins, we got our pork bone soup. The pork bone soup was COLD!!! Like I was actually able to put both my hands around the bowl of the soup and it was room temperature! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!

We told the server and all she just did was swap me another one that was coincidently coming out to the kitchen to another table. Seems like she DIDN'T CARE that the SOUP was COLD!!

As we were waiting for other food to come, we finished some of the side dishes and wanted refills, the server wasn't too friendly when we asked and told us you can ONLY choose 3 to refill. I've NEVER been to any other restaurant that limits how much you refill side dishes. Apparently as I read reviews from fellow Yelpers, they also give you a free pancake with your side dishes, which we NEVER got! =(

When we got all our foods, we had to wait for rice, which took another 5 mins for the server to bring to us. Food was decent, nothing spectacular comparing to other Korean restaurants but the amount of times we had to ask the server for things that they should automatically bring to the table just RUINS the whole meal.

You get a slice of watermelon each after you're done your meal because to help cut the MSG that they put into the soup so you won't get thirsty later on.

I informed the young waiter that the tandoori chicken was cold, he went and took the temperature of the chicken, said something to his, what looked to be his boss, then closed the lid. Clearly it was under temperature and he tried to reheat it in this way... huge health hazard that could get them closed in of itself. No biryani, only 3 meat dishes and all were chicken, no naan or rice on the buffet line so it had to be brought out which seemed to be difficult to even find someone to help. My drink remained empty for the majority of my meal even though a waiter kept walking by. I finally asked for a refill and it took him about 8 minutes to bring me my refill. Sweet rice for dessert? what the hell is that? Literally their basmati rice that they serve to everyone, mixed with milk and sugar. It was disgusting and the rice was under cooked. I'm Indian... I have never heard of this recipe before.... for 11.95... its a rip off. Enjoy GOOD indian food and drive a block up to Delhi Indian Cuisine.",2017-10-13 10:19:00

    We have been here dozens of times and still look forward to going every time we are in town. I have ordered most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. And the portions are huge so thats a bonus right there. They have fantastic wings and there not way the hell over priced like at the Bellagio cafe. 
    I love the decor as well, The neon is great, and the tree running all over the place is nice also. My only complaint, the damn booths are for tinny people! Im not a small guy and I have a hell of a time fitting into any of the booths. This is the country with the fat people remember? I think a remodel is in order here.

We started going a year ago after they first opened.
Their stuff was fabulous - cheap, fresh, full of guacamole, tomatoes, fresh herbs, etc.
The service was always terrible - the same very overwhelmed woman at the cash and just one guy in back who takes 15-30 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME to make a taco.    But the food we got made that forgivable.

Fast forward one year later - we went tonight and got an order to take out.
We got home and found they screwed up the order and gave us 2 steak instead of 1 steak, 1 chicken.   
On both orders there was: 
1.  Zero guacamole.
2.  Zero fresh vegetables.
3.  Spicy, VERY  overcooked meat that has had a ton of packaged seasoning added to it.
4.  Higher prices than only 1 year ago.
5.  Instead of a ton of fresh herbs there were just a few dried out flakes on top.

This is not the same product they put out just a few short months ago.
What we got completely turned us off from a place we've enjoyed about 10 times, and honestly it's just sad  :-(",2016-05-08 01:52:37

Tia Rosa set the bar and the value of this new version falls way short.  I have been back a few times thinking it is me being too critical, but each time it seems that there are fewer and fewer cars in the parking lot telling me my thoughts are probably confirmed.  Some have voiced their opinions like me here on yelp, but my guess is others have simply gone away.  The issue is it needs to be better than the old tia rosas to maintain business... it isn't.

My biggest complaint is the value.  Paying $4.50 for a bean and cheese burrito and then having to spend another $2.00 for the ""grande"" one... or should I say one that would actually be considered average is a bit crazy to me.  Truly 6.50 for a bean burrito in a takeout restaurant?  Another $5 for 2 drinks.  Mix it in with 2 small shrimp tacos for $14.00. $25.00 for lunch for 2... no chips = crazy.  I can go down the street to Serrano's, sit down, chips and salsa with the same food and it is $7.00 less.

Today both of us left hungry and unsatisfied. Would I ever come back?  Why should I? Too many other choices. Our new place to go is backyard taco in Mesa.  There you will find a similar idea, better prices, better food, and filling portions.  Of course they have it figured out there and people have responded so you will wait in line to get your food.

Back to Rosa's.... No longer a crowd there and while I'm sure the new owner is please to be getting a few extra ""bonus"" bucks for smaller portion meals, when the people keep feeling ripped off and stop coming (like me) getting those few extra bucks will go away and we will see the building empty again within a year.

I had this place on my radar for a long time, but just never managed to get myself there. The feedback from friends was extremely positive. I had a general sense of what to expect in terms of quality.

This place exceeded my expectations for the price point. 
The space is wonderful - clean, crisp, modern, large open concept kitchen, with an excellent patio.
The service is top notch - extremely attentive and much higher quality than the price point. I'm really impressed - it reflects so well on management. 
The food is excellent - I'm a big seafood fan, and specifically branzino. There aren't that many restaurants in Toronto that can really impress me with this dish, and somehow, they're the best I've ever had (including Europe where the fish is from, various restaurants in Toronto and the West Coat/LA) . The fish was cooked perfectly, and they opened up my imagination to some possibilities on how to serve this fish that I haven't seen before. I also have to mention that every single dish I had that night was nothing short of perfect. 

Overall, I'm cognizant that it's probably rare to have a perfect dinner night in Toronto these days, but I had it at Figo, and all my friends seem to be saying the same thing. 

I'm very impressed and wish this restaurant all the success they deserve. Looking forward to coming back... except for the parking situation, which is terrible in the area.",2018-06-27 21:06:04

Between my couple of trips to Japan in the last 6 months and work and family and yada yada yada, I just haven't had a chance to come back in a bit and I was wondering how things were in Kabuto and it didn't disappoint.  

Gen-san was as chipper and friendly as usual and shipment of fish from Japan has increased from 4 times a week to 7 times a week, and still with a GREAT variety of shiromi-zakana, or ""white fish"" from kyushu area.  I mean, the variety of white fish they have is pretty impressive.  A lot of decent sushi-ya's in Tokyo don't even have that many white fish to choose from, so it is truly an AMAZING luxury that you can have such a variety of white fish in the U.S., although many Americans most likely cannot appreciate the variety of white fish as they tend to be less fatty and you are tasting more of pure amino acid taste rather than fat like Toro, and vast majority of people don't have the experience or pallate to appreciate the subtle taste.  

I had my usual.  Chirashi followed by Nigiri.  Chinu sashimi on chirashi was superb, as well as akami of blue fin from Spain.  I'm pretty impressed with consistency of farmed tuna from the Mediterranean.  

I can't remember all of the pices in Nigiri set, but I think they were ma-aji, chinu, kohada, akami, harakami, uni, hira-aji, ikura, tamago, and anago.  I had to have that sweet Boston scallop as well as some of that heavenly melt in your mouth O-toro to wrap things up.  

I have to say that no restaurant in this city satisfies me like this one.  It's pretty f'ing amazing that we have an authentic sushi-ya like Kabuto in THIS town.  I'm even happier that there is a discerning enough clientele to keep this place open as 90% of so called ""sushi-lovers"" probably don't quite ""get"" this place reading some negative reviews and they should just continue to go to Korean AYCE sushi joint with yum yum sauce, mayo, and imitation crabs and leave those precious 10 counter seats for the rest of us.  According to Gen-san, there are a quite a few out-of-towners who make it a mission to eat here everytime they come to Vegas.  Cheers for real sushi lovers. 

Oh one more thing.  I think those tables seats need to go....but now that I think about it...it might be alright as they keep the counter seats open for those of us who know how to appreciate sushi.",2013-05-11 06:18:25

Our server was nice but she was the only server on the shift. Although the restaurant isn't big at all, the place was almost full. We never got water refills or never got checked up on. 

I ordered the shang beef noodle. Asked if they can make it spicy and was told to use the sauce on the table. The beef and noodles were really good but the soup itself was not hot at all. The sauce provided on the table did not make the soup much spicy either and slowly dissipated the actual soup flavor. The noodles came out within 5-6 minutes so I wondered how they prepare it since the soup wasn't even hot at all. 

I also ordered the beef pancake appetizer. I thought our server forgot the order since it wouldn't come out even after I finished my noodle. I asked our server to check up on it and she told us that it takes awhile so it usually comes out in between your meal. She should've warned us about that when we placed the order because we wanted the pancakes as an appetizer, not as a dessert...

I'm not sure if this was intentional or just our GREAT luck :) but that was a good thing.  Everything was piping hot and really good.  The knots were burned on the top a little bit but they were free so I didn't send them back, that was just a tiny little over sight and I'm sure it doesn't happen a lot.  The bill was about $36 and that included 3 soft drinks for our kids..  I think very reasonable and well worth it..  I really hope this place grows as the food and service were really good!

I am a regular customer at Kashman's and although I feel like it's kind of expensive, I love their food, so it's worth it to me!  Today I had the chopped farmers salad (no cheese + turkey).  I love that it is full with veggies and the light balsamic dressing they use goes perfectly with it!  

Other menu items that I order consistently are the omelettes (they do egg whites no problem), oatmeal, trifecta plate, turkey sandwich, and tuna melt.  The bagels are the best I've had in Arizona, and my friend DeDe swears by their matzah ball soup!

I witnessed an interesting scenario when I was there today... a guy had bought lunch for his wife and came up to the register when I was paying and said: ""Excuse me... my wife changed her mind and does not like her cookie and she wants to exchange it for a blueberry muffin.""  

Nancy, the owner, looked at him and apologetically said ""I'm sorry, sir - that is the cookie she chose and I cannot serve that cookie to anyone else now.  You can buy a blueberry muffin if you'd like.""

This made me think two things: 1 - I'm glad they will not reserve food like that but 2 - perhaps they should have asked if the cookie was bad, etc... and maybe even done so much as to give them a muffin to make them happy?

If I come here, it's usually because I already happen to be in the area and it's only for their fried chicken, or ChickenJoy as they call it. Everything else is meh. The sides that come with the entrees are usually meh too...they don't look every appetizing because they're probably just frozen or canned foods. I mean I doubt they're making fresh corn or mashed potatoes here. 

Prices are mediocre for a fast food joint and really depends on what you get. The chicken seems a little pricey but most everything else is cheap unless you're getting some type of new or specially featured item that isn't on the regular menu.

In terms of the food, we found the portions too small. I had the breakfast burrito. It was not satisfying despite a good taste.... and the side of potatoes was tiny.

We were out on a Saturday night looking for a dessert/snack and other places were packed so we came to Green Grotto and didn't have to wait at all to be seated. The service here was actually pleasant and really friendly to my surprise.

While I wouldn't order any full meals, the snacks are decent here. We went for their (popcorn) salt and pepper chicken and it was straight out from the fryer. It was moderately crispy, and dusted with the chinese 'salt and pepper' - you can taste the mild hint of the sweetness coming from the five spice. It's very aromatic in a good way! The chicken grew on me as I kept on eating it.

We went with their hot brown sugar ginger grass jelly for the dessert and it was also pretty decent except for the fact that it wasn't as hot as we would have liked. Funnily we asked for hot water which was boiling hot (not our intent, but it worked) and adding that to the dessert immediately made it warmer and diluted the sugar water in a totally acceptable way (it was quite concentrated with ginger and sugar).

There was wrestling, bounce houses, trash everywhere, lots of tacos, and lots of tequila sounds like one fun party to me.  As a first year event, I was impressed.  
The Good:
*The taco quality was impressive for a festival and the concept is fantastic.  My favorite that I tried was Barrio Cafe's spare rib taco.  My least favorite was the grasshopper taco but I was thrilled that I didn't spend a lot to try it and had the chance to try it. The side cart items like street corn fantastic!
*A portion of the proceeds benefit Waste Not a charity delivering food to 100 agencies.
*They had some kid activities. Face painter Daisy was fantastic.
*I left with a stack of coupons and a list of places I want to try.  
*The price was very fair, not sure how the VIP patrons felt.  We went average Joe and enjoyed the festival.
*People were having fun.
The Bad:
*The location of a dirt parking lot and little shade was not ideal.
*Pay another face painter the line was way too long.  She was very good but one more possibly two would have been great.
*The layout of the vendors needs more space between them and if you put them in a U make sure there is plenty of space between them!

We were all pretty tired from packing, moving, and cleaning all day (me, most of all), so it felt like a load had been lifted off my shoulders when we walked into the fairly dimly lit Rooster's and were immediately seated without a reservation.  My only shock came when I discovered that the menu items were all offered a la carte, and no one item was all that cheap!  I let that pass, though, thankful for my friends' help and hoping that we'd have an excellent meal.  Turns out, we did have an exceptional meal.  Every a la carte item we ordered was delicious, starting with the soups and breads, and finishing with dessert.   It was about $200 (for a party of four, with drinks) that was well-spent, considering what the cost of movers (and/or my time and patience) could have been.

To be honest, the second I was handed a menu, I wanted to leave. There are 3 main ramen choices and none sounded off the wall great. Lawrence said he was fine staying and he ordered tea. It was canned. I thought that was a little bizarre. 

I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and a side of kimchi and he had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen. When it came out it smelled like... pancakes! It was the weirdest thing. It smelled like a ""bowl"" of pancakes. The soup was actually pretty good, and I added a bunch of sesame oil and cayenne and garlic. It was good (even though I got cayenne pepper in my eye somehow.) Lawrence said he liked his soup too.

I got a two item lunch special ($7.25) of a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans (I could have had rice rather than beans).  I also got a root beer ($2.05).  Most of their drinks have an extra charge for refills but this was not a small glass and was plenty.  Right after I seated myself a bowl of warm chips, a small mixing bowl, a carafe of mild salsa and a bottle of hot sauce were on the table.  It was neat being able to adjust the heat of my salsa.  The shredded beef was very tasty and the shell was thin and crisp without being hard to bit through.  I would suggest eating the tacos quickly before the shell gets soggy. The enchilada and the beans were ok.  The sauce was a bit different than some other places.

Also, make sure you try the Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos as an appetizer. The tuna is fresh and the dish is very flavorful.

Loblaws first off, is huge which a shopper could love or hate. The aisles are huge, which makes for a more comfortable experience, rare to have in a downtown store. If you notice they don't carry a product, let them know and they will order and stock it based on your request.

The wood paneling (originally just natural, stained wood) is painted with warm cozy colors.  The tables are copper with wood trim and are very clean.  It's almost like the place gives you a nice, grandma style hug to welcome you in.

They do have a rather extensive menu, but their signature items are marked with a small broken eggshell icon.  I highly recommend the shrimp and grits!  Also the Benedict Oscar is super awesome.  I'm a bit obsessed with poached eggs (mostly because I can't do them myself at home.... yet), but toss in some steak, asparagus, crab, and Bearnaise sauce, and you get one hell of a breakfast!

In terms of the Monterreys here, I would rank this one second behind the Matthews location. I still think that one has better salsas than the others. This Monterrey does have a good sized patio, though.

Monterrey has a lunch menu that runs from 11am-3pm. They also have different specials every day. I pretty much order anything that's covered in cheese dip.... chimichangas (I recommend getting them soft instead of fried) or pollo fundido. My friend Andrea always gets fajitas. That's pretty much her go-to at every Mexican restaurant. Starter wise, you get complimentary chips and salsa. I go cheese dip over guac because I feel like their guac doesn't have that much flavor. 

It by no means is the best Mexican food in Charlotte, but it's a solid option for the price. It's not fancy. You'll smell like Mexican food after you leave. It's a big hit with the college kids in the University area. The last time I was here, a party of about 30 sorority girls came in for dinner and drinks. The staff didn't miss a beat with the large group. 

My only complaint about Monterrey is that there isn't a convenient location for me. I'm near uptown, so I have to drive to Matthews or Monterrey to get my fix.

Upon entry, I noticed this place was a little smaller than I thought. Turns out there's actually a closed off VIP section to the right of the restaurant.

The menu, as explained already, has standard Chinese dishes and some unique dishes. Some recommendations include turnip cake (one of the BEST I've had!), mushroom tart, fried tofu, miso turnip (with a bunch of other stuff), and the ""fake shrimp"" dumplings.

Really impressed with the level of service at this particular PF Changs. Andrea was our server and ensured that our party had everything that we needed. I ordered two drinks, the first was the coconut mojito which had the right balance of coconut milk with the traditional expectations of what a mojito should have (mint, lime, rum, soda). Second drink I got was the mai tai; really strong and really reminiscent of an Arnold Palmer!

For entrees, my party ordered the vegetable egg (spring?) rolls, the ginger chicken with broccoli, chili-garlic green beans and the salt/pepper prawns. All of these dishes were excellent! I will attach photos to my review shortly after posting.

Ambiance wise, this PF Chang's has the bar directly viewable as soon as you enter, with dining tables situated around the bar. Plenty of tables, yet this place gets so packed so quickly with how popular PF Chang's can be!

Service wise, my server Andrea was great, came by at the right moments and offered suggestions when asked, but more importantly, the entire front of staff was incredibly attentive.

There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.

We started with the ""Nontraditional Pierogies"" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.

We also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.

For an entree we had the ""Cinco Formaggio"" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.

We also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.

I ordered the Country Chick Sandwich with avacado, chips and a green tea, a chicadilla, the cinnamon sugar waffles, and the wafflenut with Nutella and almonds-- OMG I'm full!  This place is pretty awesome.  Definitely not a dieting place though lol... Their waffles have got to be one of the best I've tried.  Served up fresh and warm, the waffles are nice and crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside.  Loved it.  

It's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland in the Target complex.  Really chill environment.  Great for breakfast or lunch, or maybe a snack or dessert.  There were 2 girls behind the counter cooking and taking orders.  Super friendly staff.  I think they have wifi, because a lot of college students look like they were meeting to get work done.

WpVelcjpFDKZmfaIwGgXiw,3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,9PIC380tmNYpIC3z5cvcNA,4,4,3,4,"Is Sweet is a cute little coffee/ tea house that serves desserts like slices of cake, brick toast, shaved ice, ice cream. Located in Chinatown, in the same plaza as Viet Noodle Bar (which is located on the corner and can be seen from the street). Just head towards the back of this plaza and you will find Is Sweet.

My husband and I were in the area this past Friday and decided to stop by. We arrived around 8:20 pm. The female employee behind the register had a heavy accent and so I had some trouble understanding her. I felt bad that I had to ask her to repeat herself several times as I had asked questions about the crepe cakes. I do appreciate that she tried and was patience and still smiling despite my repeated asking her to say what she was saying one more time. 

I ended up purchasing Matcha Crepe Cake (to go) $6.50 prior to tax ($7.04 after tax) and consumed the next day (since we were full from our dinner). Since I had ordered this to go, I had a side of matcha sauce packed in a small container. However, if consumed on site, a chocolate drizzle is placed along side the cake (but customers are given a small cup of the match sauce to drizzle on the cake on their own). I thought the cake was very moist and not too sweet, even with the added matcha sauce. My husband liked this cake but thought it would have been nice to also have the chocolate sauce provided to give another added complement flavor to the cake. I am really a fan of crepe cakes and though each layer was perfectly moist and had just the right amount of creme between. 

Wait time was longer for our slice of cake than I had anticipated. I think the employee who took my order may have forgotten about us because I caught her looking surprised as she turned around and saw me (I was sitting across the room, as I waited for my order). Then shortly after, our to go order was brought out to us. 

The prices do seem a little bit more pricey than your typical tea house (there are some fruit teas available for purchase, served in glass mason jars if you choose to enjoy your drink here on site). But I would still probably come back here anyway to try one of the other desserts that they have and most likely would order one of the tea drinks while I am here (I am not much of a coffee person, but they do have several coffee drinks to choose from). 

I like that there is free WiFi available to surf the net and I also like that there is outdoor seating here so that I can bring my 4 legged little girl the next time I am out here in Las Vegas. 

I do want to mention that the indoor seating is kind of small though and was rather busy while we came in. 

Also if you wish to order one of their crepe cakes, it comes in 3 different flavors: matcha, vanilla, red velvet. And lastly, the current Yelp check in offer is 10% off 1 beverage. 

Is Sweet is a cute place if you are into coffee/ tea Asian houses and wouldn't mind adding a dessert to your get together with your friend(s) and/ or date night.",2018-05-29 06:14:21

I've been here a few times and there are a lot of good things in the menu. The chiles rellenos (stuffed peppers), croquettes, churrasco (skirt steak), and the crispy beef dishes are some of my favorites. The empanadas and garlic shrimp are also very good. This time they had a chorizo special that I was really disappointed by. I'm used to it being juicy and flavorful, but it was a link and very dry. 

The service is really good. They are attentive and food comes out as it is ready. They take reservations, but there's usually not a wait when I'm there. It's a pretty small, cute little place. Being tapas style, the price can start to add up, but it's worth it for a special occasion.

Of course, fish n chips aren't just the only things worth trying out at Brit & Chips. You'd be missing out if you didn't try the imported Ben Shaws soft drink. I don't think that there are many places in Montréal offering these drinks. If you like cream soda then you should absolutely try Ben Shaws' because it just puts any cream soda to shame.

I had lunch here recently, and despite the small frontage the restaurant is HUGE.  I think about 8 of 300 tables were occupied.

The menu is pretty diverse, and I had the hamburger which was well-cooked.  However, the guacamole just didn't fit and I think sliced avocado would of tasted better.  It was just too much mush and salt. The beet chips were wicked awesome and I should of put some on the burger to add crunch.

My coworker ordered the pork chop, but for some reason he asked for it medium/med rare (you don't have to be clairvoyant to know how this turned out).  Once he sent it back and had it cooked properly he said it was excellent.

I'm not sure how this place will fair, as it's tucked back slightly on the north side of Scottsdale Quarter and will need to move a lot of chow to pay the lease.  It's a bit pricey for what you get ($14 burger) and has a lot of eatery competition.  I don't feel they quite nailed it on the decor and concept.  Perhpas if they get a HH crowd (nice large patio) which will probably depend on some better specials as all the cocktails seemed north of $10 and some appetizers over $15!

We had come for the opening and had been fans since due to the freshly made udon and great flavors. They now serve ramen BTW so check that out regardless of my opinion.

Staff was friendly and service was lightning quick today. Excellent service.

On to the food. Low key pretty much everything is good. The mad tiger is a favorite for the spicy fans (it's really light on the spicy side. More chilli flavors come through.). The duck nanban was nice. The duck was super tender. Great flavors. The miso carbonara has been a long time favorite here. Light and creamy. Really makes you feel good.

The item I had today, however, was the ramen. It was good! It was on the lighter side, though, almost too light. There also wasn't much of a salt component. Maybe a slightly heavier umami or the addition of a soy sauce component may be beneficial to the ramen. On the other hand, the flavors of the clam were very present and very forward. The clams themselves had a nice texture. The scallops were super nice to bite into, like little bits of surprise in every bite. Very good item, just needs a little more umph.

I have also had the spinach artichoke dip which is pretty much your standard spinach artichoke dip.

The one of the big things that has this at a 3 star not a 4 star is the lack of pitchers of beer. It's insane that a sports bar doesn't do pitchers of beer.

My boyfriend had a few beers and bought a round of car bombs for his friends (10$ each-again pretty pricey) and the tab was about 50$.

When you went into a store, the shopkeeper called you by name and probably knew what you were planning to buy. For better or worse (and it certainly wasn't all good) those times are long gone - but we found a little slice of it last Friday.

     When we walked into Casella's Italian Sub Shop at about 3PM, we were warmly greeted by Joe and Denise, a father/daughter team. Joe, originally from Philadelphia, opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef, just south of McDonald in Scottsdale. Denise started working with him twenty some years ago. They instantly know if you're part of the ""family"" or a newbie. If you're curious about an item on the menu, you're given a taste. Most of the things are made in house. Joe cooks 70 pounds of chicken breast a week for his famous chicken salad. Mom makes the meatballs, and Denise the cannoli filling. I could go on, but you get the idea. These are genuinely nice people who care about their product and want to please the customer. Joe gets in every morning at 7:30 (although service doesn't start until  11 AM) and stays right through closing at 6 PM. He likes to know what's going on. Saturday closing is at 3 PM so everybody can spend time with their families. And there's a lengthy Christmas break for the same reason. Very nice.

     Naturally, Philadelphia Steak Sandwiches ($6.60 - $7.20) appear on the menu. Joe's isn't your typical greasy, cheese whiz loaded, meat too-tough-to-chew sandwich (which, I admit, often appeals to me): here the meat is meltingly tender, sauced with a little marinara, and topped with provolone, served on an outstanding roll made by a local family baker.

     We had to try the chicken salad sandwich ($3.70 fir a half, $7.20 full size) - we knew it would be fresh since Joe cooks up a batch most mornings. In the back cooler you can see huge jars of mayonnaise waiting their turn. The salad was very simple, not gussied up with lots of add-ins. I will say that when I ate the leftovers at home I added a dollop of cranberry sauce. I think I'll bring some to Casella's next time we go.

     After 2 PM, if you buy two sandwiches, you get a third free. So I chose the Italian Hoagie ($3.70/$6.80). Ken was astonished to find that he actually enjoyed this one. What made it truly delicious, oddly enough, were the onions. Thinly sliced, and sweet enough to be eaten on their own, they also graced the cheese steak. Our side of homemade coleslaw was one of the best versions in town. Can't wait to try the potato and pasta salads. 

     Other sandwices on the menu include roast beef, ham and cheese, meatball, sausage, and pastrami (not made in-house). Also available are two entrees: Lasagna ($10) and Spaghetti & Meatballs ($8). 

     Now for dessert. Ken wanted a cannoli, usually not something I like. I'm now a convert, at least to Casella's version. Denise makes the silky filling, garnished only with a few chocolate chips, and the large, wonderfully crispy shells don't get filled until you're ready to snarf one down. Homemade rice pudding is on the menu. We had a taste and it, too, was delicious, but it had no raisins. We'll bring those next time, along with the cranberry sauce.

     Not much to say about the decor. I think it came from that long, long ago time. Basic wood paneling. There are photographs of years and years of Saguaro High (I think that's the school) graduating classes. That's about it. But the warmth of the Casella's fills the room.",2011-01-09 23:04:35

Being housed in a hockey arena, you should know that his particular grocery store is huge. The high-ceilinged space holds 28 aisles of shopping madness. I learned this from one of the programmes (yeah, a programme) at the entrance. Grab a map too. You'll need it.

In addition to the modern conveniences we expect in large grocery stores (a bakery, deli, butcher, etc.) Loblaws has some nifty bonuses. There are quite a few places to snag fresh-made foods to eat in the store: the canteen, sushi bar, a T&T kiosk, a patisserie, a juice bar. There is also a wall of cheese, which is an 18' tall fridge. You can even have chocolate chiselled by the chunk. Oooh.

But I probably won't frequent this store. If I'm shopping at a big box grocery store, then I expect a cookie-cutter layout and this is anything but. I was lost in the aisles for ages and they occupy only half the gargantuan space. And while I can get used to the layout, I probably won't get used to the crowds. On my visit the store was packed to the gills. I actually traded in my large cart for a small one because it was otherwise impossible to move around. This may change as the novelty of this new grocery store wears off, but with their central location and parking lot. I can't imagine it will ever be dead in here.

Fun fact: f you take one of the small carts you can't take it down the escalator (only large carts work with their cart-moving machine. There is a person standing at the escalator dedicated to telling patrons this. Small carts need to take the elevator down to the parking lot. Parking is free if you spend $18 or $8/hour. Ask a cashier to validate your receipt.

Obligatory Title Pun: BLAH-BLAH-BLAW.

You also have to pick up your own cutlery, sauces and drinks? Why do I have to give them a tip? They have a lot of staff on hand.

We ordered a whole chicken, but we got two drum sticks and two breast portions? The chicken was tasty and juicy. The spiced rice was mushy and the french fries were ordinary. We ordered the New York cheesecake. It was okay, but taste like a cheesecake from a supermarket.

It had ""harbour"" (the neighbourhood) and ""sports"" (what I needed) right in the name of the place.

This is a local haunt for many of the folks that work right down by the Toronto harbour front or live in one of the o-so-many condos that line the lakeshore.  There's TVs aplenty so there's no problem with sight lines, and the menu is mid-to-medium-high range for a sports bar.  There's all of the usual faves you'd expect (wings, burgers, etc.) but there's also a high volume of wraps and Chinese/Szechwan items as well.  Not often a sports bar gives you a choice of Asian noodle, but here you are.  The staff are friendly and accommodating as you'd want.

Though awkwardly placed for the staff, the patio is situated inside a small square found in between buildings.  The fenced off area does make for an okay patio, but it's separated from the building making it slightly awkward for people leaving the restaurant and colliding with servers bringing out food and drink.  When full, the patio area looks more and more like a pen you'd find on the farm filled with livestock.  Except the animals are having wings and beer.",2008-09-09 22:52:27

I went with three other people and we all ordered the tasting, which seems like quite the steal for a four course meal. However we asked the waiter what we would be having for the tasting and what wines he would recommend. Interesting - each person does not get the same thing for each course (whatever the chef has left over from the other dishes) so we were not given any recommendations since there was a big question mark on what would be cooked for us. Of the four courses that I received, I was sad to receive a basic salad - lettuce, tomatoes, onions and dressing. Since I was paying for a tasting I was expecting some creativeness. However I did like the soup I received for my second.

Service was slow but that can be somewhat attributed to the broken ac in the downstairs so everyone had to be seated upstairs. We were sitting at the table for over 3+ hours - oye vey! To make up for that the chef gave us desserts on the house which was a big plus.

We went there one day for lunch to celebrate my co-workers birthday. We chose this spot because they have gluten free pizzas and my co-worker can't eat gluten. We arrive and the restaurant is semi busy but nothing crazy for St. Patty's day. We ordered three pizzas, one pepperoni pizza, one gluten free vegetarian pizza and a MARGHERITA pizza (one of the house specialties). First thing, the place wasn't busy. Let's make note of that. Secondly and this is a pet peeve of mines especially since I come from the hospitality industry, our server did not write our orders down. PEOPLE!!! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, UNLESS YOU HAVE OVER 10 YEARS OF RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE THEN YOU BETTER BE WRITING DOWN ORDERS. And here's why...first pizza out was the pepperoni, 10 mins later the vegetarian pizza comes out. 10 mins later, we're still waiting for our pizza. We flag down our server and tell him that our pizza has yet to arrive. Before even checking to see what the status was on our pizza he says it'll be out soon and that's due to the restaurant being busy. So we wait, and wait, and wait. The guys have already eaten their pizza and the vegetarian is about half way through and still nothing. We flag him down again and he goes to look and claims someone walked off with our pizza. Yeah right. Keep in mind, there is no sorry yet. So we ask to see a manager. She comes by claims that she was just told this and she will have it out soon. and she will comp it off the bill? Not a sorry or anywhere near it. Any good manager would know to always apologize to the guest after hearing how their staff messed up a table. We kept telling her that we've been waiting and the server hadn't really down a good job but all she kept saying was I was just told this. By this time yes the restaurant had picked up but there was no way our pizza would have been overlook had the server stayed on his tables. He would have seen that pizzas were missing and he should have gone to the kitchen and asked them right away what the status was on our food and then gone back to check on it.

I took my parents here for a belated b-day dinner in January. It was a weeknight and I wasn't looking to spend big bucks on a meal. Lola's takes reservations on Yelp and, as I said before, kind of a unique gem near downtown. Not your typical strip mall or casino eatery.

We started with oysters and crawpuppies. And for an entree we tried etoufeee as well as gumbo. All of the food was cooked well and came out quickly. All of this paired well with an Abita beer or glass of chilled white wine. 

As it got later into the evening, the restaurant started filling up quickly and was getting loud. Being that I was with my parents who are older and hardly ""party people"", we ordered dessert to-go and made it an early night.

My birthday is always during winter restaurant week. This was my first restaurant week experience because for whatever reason, we never took advantage of it.

I made reservations via open table about a week in advance. My actual birthday (Friday) didn't have too many reservations left (only 9pm) so we decided on Sunday dinner here. 

I am going to agree with other reviewers and say that you pay for the view. Food and service are okay, but for the hype and (regular) price of entrees, I just expected things to be better. 

I ordered off of the restaurant week menu. Honestly, Le Mont had a good pre fixe compared to other places. I went with the stuffed sole. It was stuffed with crab and almonds.  I got to choose soup or salad (salad) and a dessert (strawberry shortcake). The server assistant brought out bread for us. While appreciated, the bread was oddly very salty.. like pretzel salt. Thankfully the poppy seed bread made up for it. My salad was initially served with the wrong dressing and I had to send it back. 

My boyfriend didn't care for the pre fixe menu ordered from regular dinner menu. He went with the duck. It is marinated In raspberry vinaigrette and cooked. afterwards more vinaigrette is placed on it. The dish was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. It put my stuffed sole to shame, lol. 

The sides for our dishes were mashed potatoes and veggies (carrots, asparagus). The mashed potatoes were extremely dry, unseasoned and very bland (think instant mashed potato flakes and water!) It was disappointing. At first I thought they were just slacking since I was using a pre fixe menu, but my boyfriend $45 entrée was served with the same basic potatoes.

My strawberry shortcake was delicious. We also bought a bottle of wine. 

While the view and duck entrée were amazing, everything else was pretty basic, including service. Don't get me wrong, she did an good job, but I guess I was just expecting to be ""wow'd"" more since its a fancier place. The hostess basically ran to seat us at our table instead of kindly asking us how we are doing or making sure we were even caught up with her.

The only thing I truly miss about Paris is their pastries. Ever since eating those French pastries almost every day on a trip in the past, I can't seem to find a French bakery that comes to close to what I had out there. 

Then one day, the fellas and I decided to take a trip out to Montreal. We were actually just walking aimlessly, touring around when I had this bright idea to find a French style pastry shop. We stumbled across Mamie Calfoutis by chance and because of the proximity it was close to our location at the time.

The pistachio croissant. Do not even think about stopping here without grabbing one of these. Yes, it's that legit. The pistachio is subtle but strong enough that your taste buds will be awakened by it. The croissant itself wasn't too flaky nor too puffy. All in all, I miss this the most from this place. I should've racked a box of it by itself to take home. 

The other item I got was the apple Danish. It looks sweet but it's really not so as much as it looks. The apples were fresh and I would definitely get it again especially if you enjoy those fruit infused type pastries.

One of my boys got the chocolate croissant and his response was a smile and I quote, ""Tasty treat!"" He seemed real impressed by it.

Mamie Clafoutis was no doubt worth the stop. I just wished our pad was close enough to it that I could've walked over every morning to enjoy a lovely pastry and coffee just like how they do in Paris. All the workers speak French and most of the customers seemed to as well. Don't worry though, once you start ordering in English, they will start conversing with you in English. Everything seemed to be made in house morning of because everything we got was fresh even though we ventured in during the afternoon.

The empty parking lot, leasing signs and the lack of windows should have been our warning.  It was like a scene from Bridemaids.  Once inside, we were greeted with an empty room that resembled a temporary dining hall rather than a restaurant and the televison with non-stop infomercials didn't help.  I wanted to leave but I was still holding on to hope that the yelpers before me gave it 4 stars for reason. 

We ordered Chicken & Waffles which were smothered in gross, lumpy gravy that tasted sweet.  My daughter scraped off as much as she could, and ended up eating my shortstack of pancakes which I couldn't swallow because they were super dry.  No amount of butter or syrup could save them.  The only redeeming entree was my son's Breakfast Nachos.  ""Redeeming"" is being generous since I like the concept of breakfast nachos but their execution was lacking.  I would suggest melting the cheese and adding salsa, sour cream and guac to make it more than just chips with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and olives topped with cheese and tomatoes.  Service was ok, she was nice enough, but it did feel like she wasn't really expecting customers to walk in.  We could have just missed the breakfast rush, but I doubt it.

With a request for a good IPA, she returned with no less than three tasters in hand. Impressive! Lunch was off to a great start (especially with Whitesnake playing on the jukebox!).

The waitress at Shakespeare's was awesome and the grub was good. My only gripe was that there was a noticeable lack of vegetarian options on the menu. A veggie burger option would be amazing. A girl can dream, after all.

I can't even begin to tell you how terrible the service is. I will tell today's story since it is the worst yet. We get seated and were completely ignored for 10 minutes. Our waitress came, told us she was going to take a table of 15 people's order then ours. So our order got pushed back. That was the last time I saw the waitress, which I guess was good for her because that got me angry to start with. I was on my lunchbreak with coworkers and was looking for a quick meal. I should have left then, but stayed. 

The manager came and took our order, half an hour later, they brought out everyone's meal but one. She was obviously without a meal and we all made eye contact with both the manager and our waitress multiple times, who completely our attempts to even converse with them about the issue. Finally, one of us got up to ask. No apology, they just hadn't brought it out. So it was just sitting in the kitchen getting cold, while our food got cold being respectful and waiting for everyone to recieve their food. 

Food was amazing so I wasn't angry during that, except we never got our water filled because we were completely ignored by the man filling up waters. That was his entire job and he failed at it miserably. The soda I paid $3 for? Never refilled either. 

We then had to go ask for our tabs, which of course they messed up. They haven't done one thing right the whole time, why start now? While waiting for our checks to be picked up, a lady brought over 3 new checks for us. Thanks, but you're about 15 minutes late. 

I spoke to the manager, who has seen me come in almost every time, and nicely explained I was not happy with the service. Her response? A smile. My response? Well you just lost my office's business. As well as a tip. Well I do have a tip,

10-15 flavors of 'hard' ice cream (by hard, I mean that the ice cream can be packed into a cup, unlike a frozen soft-serve), my favorite is orange blossom. The ice cream is good and has a different taste because it's made with honey (it's a positive taste). Plus, there's 'special' ones that rotate each month [graham cracker ! pumpkin !] My only complaint on the ice cream is that the mint has chocolate chips in it :(

The lines can be long...My sisters complained the cashiers have become slower over the years (they used to work there) but I haven't noticed  although they were flighty my last time there. 

The prices are reasonable. A 'single' is actually two (large) scoops for 2.65 or so and increase every summer.

yAwakLjm0F3_gHZy_hmBWQ,JiPMk9WmbJu-VfTRAKpZpw,SmkYLXEYhzwUZdS6TAevHg,5,10,1,6,"Yeah, maybe this place is trendy. Yeah, maybe you're sick of the 4,000 photos of the whiskey wall on your social feeds. Yeah, maybe Butcher seems overhyped...but honestly, the place IS awesome.

If there's one complaint, it would be the hostess station, where - as both casual observers and customers - we've seen some arrogance and rudeness toward patrons who perhaps walked in, unaware of how busy Butcher gets, and were curious about getting a table. Pretentious attitude from a hostess? Yeah, they might want to curb that sooner, rather than later, being the host stand is your first impression.

Anyway, I digress...save yourself that hassle and make reservations. Butcher is almost always busy, and it's not always easy to post up in the bar area.

As for the whiskey, Butcher has one heck of a variety on-hand. You'll pay the price if you want to go deep, but there are plenty of excellent, cost-friendly choices on the menu, as well. It's an overwhelming amount of choices, so I'd recommend downloading the Grail app, so you can peruse their whiskey list ahead of time!

There are two things that make Butcher worth going, though, that I think is better than the whiskey (let's face it, unless you're looking to drop $25+ on a 1oz pour of some hard-to-find spirits, you can get a solid whiskey at most places nowadays): the food, and the service.

We've NEVER had bad service at Butcher. We've had a party of two...up to a party of 50+, and the service has always been top-notch. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to chat with. They'll be able to steer you in the direction of a whiskey that's in your budget, and they'll be able to provide in-depth info of the food menu. Oh...and you'll never have an empty glass of water (a huge plus to me).

The food is excellent, albeit indulgent. For example, the brussels sprouts are phenomenal, but I can't tell if the brussels themselves are good, or it's just the delicious filth that tops them. Frankly, I don't care, though. Delicious is delicious is delicious. The mac & cheese, shishito peppers, bread, baked camembert, bone marrow...you name it, we've tried it. All of it has been enjoyable...but indulgent, like I said. Don't stop in looking to eat a ""healthy"" meal. Stop in with pure American gluttony in mind. To clarify, though, the portions aren't gluttonous, but the flavor is.

My favorite menu item, though, is the Butcher Burger. Ground in-house, and limited to 20 per day. Get there early and get one. It's one of the best burgers in the city, hands down. It's not loaded with a bunch of nonsense, either. The burger meat gets most of the spotlight, and it deserves a spotlight (it may actually need one to be seen in Butcher's very dark atmosphere).

My last trip to Las Vegas we had stayed at The Cosmopolitan and the location was still under construction but said opening soon. Fast forward 3 months and YES, a slut is born. I've always wanted to try the OG Eggslut at Grand Central Market in Downtown LA but I've been trying to avoid the long crazy lines. Not that this one located across the way from Marquee on the 2nd floor doesnt have crazy lines of their own. We wanted to go there at lunch right before going to the day club and the line must have been at least 100-150 people deep. CRAZY! I ended up going after the day club and there was no line at all so it worked out.

I went with the bacon, egg & cheese on a strong suggestion from my friend that had it the previous morning for breakfast. It was great. It was served up on a really good brioche bun served warm but it had cooled down a bit since I walked it back to my room. The sammich came with a good amount of delicious smoked bacon, an over-medium egg, cheddar cheese and ketchup with a kick. I really liked it. The combination of flavors made for the perfect breakfast style sandwich. The runny egg was great. The bacon was smoked niceness. The cheese was tasty. The sammich had good flavor and filled you up enough as a small meal unto itself.  

Service was super friendly. Appreciated that. The cashier's son had a similar name to mine so we had a pleasant convo about names/nicknames. He made sure the bottled water I got was super cold and the lady that retrieved it for me was nice enough to find the coldest one and to also bag my sandwich because I forgot to mention it was to-go.

I will certainly go back to Eggslut again the next time I'm at The Cosmopolitan. I def wanna try the famous slut... They're opening one in Glendale so it might be time to finally be a regular and hit all the highlights on their menu.",2016-08-26 16:32:28

Stout - chocolate coffee. Not as sweet as French toast, but delicious as we'll

We started with the baby octopus which was served cold in a sweet sauce, this dish was flavorful and unique and we really enjoyed this. We also shared the edamame and karaage, both were delicious and generously portioned to share. For mains we tried the beef gyu bowl and the chicken curry bowl. Both of these were packed with flavour, the chicken didn't have much actual chicken but the potatoes, carrots and the curry sauce were delicious and hearty, it felt like Japanese comfort food. The beef bowl had a generous portion of beef and rice, there was also egg, some edamame, ginger and a couple of slices of cantaloupe in the bowl which was nice and refreshing. We also ordered the iced genmaicha tea which had little pieces of coconut jelly in the bottom, we really enjoyed this drink. 

For dessert we had the matcha green tea with Oreo pieces and this was really yummy and a nice way to finish the meal.

The restaurant itself is really modern and trendy looking, lots of intentional mismatched furniture, light fixtures and other features give a sort of hipster vibe to it. It offered a nice dining environment.

The crowd is mostly younger people but we saw families and all sorts of people filling the tables. 

The service was pretty good, we got our orders in and our food pretty quickly and our servers were courteous however they seemed a bit overwhelmed with the volume of customers they had. 

Overall a cute place with some good, inexpensive bites to eat. I can't wait to come back and try more items on this menu!",2016-08-14 02:48:14

I had been here a number of times prior; had not been particularly enamored with their food (plus thought it was over-priced), but this time we all agreed it was quite good.

Alexa was our server.   Of course, we had to joke with her about her name.   I'm SURE she probably hears that a lot!!  Quite friendly, professional, and competent.  I mean, putting up with five women out having a good time, well, poor thing!

First things first -- we had to determine what we were going to drink.   Three of us decided on the happy hour martini which tasted like a slushy with kick.   Yummm!   Sorry I don't remember the name, but the photo is included.   Then we saw people next to us having a drink that looked good with its frozen ball of ice.   Of course, we had to ask.   He was having an old fashion.  I decided to try the manhattan and birthday girl tried the old fashion.   I must admit, I liked her drink more than mine.   Probably cause it was a bit sweeter.   And the ice ball is cute.   Ya' know how important presentation is!

The next important thing was to order food.   We decided on lobster potstickers, hoisin bbq ribs, ahi poke tacos, fried calamari, crispy chicken spring roll, coconut skewers.   We agreed we liked the potstickers, the ribs, the spring roll and the skewers the best.   Great flavoring with it all.   I didn't try the tacos.   

Of course, with us celebrating a birthday, we had to have dessert.   The only thing the restaurant offers gratis for a bash is vanilla ice cream.   We figured, with five of us, a scoop of ice cream wouldn't go far.   Therefore, we ordered the butterscotch bread pudding and the chocolate mousse cake.   All of it came with vanilla ice cream plus the gratis ice cream was three scoops -- count them -- three scoops.   

We agreed we liked the butterscotch bread pudding the best.   the chocolate mousse case was good as well, but the bread pudding was better.

Their dishes are authentic. 

Located in a strip mall but don't let that discourage you. Decor is modest but look past that and give their food a try, this is a hidden gem. You won't be disappointed if you love Asian food. They also have a great lunch special menu which includes an egg roll, soup and tea with your entree.

I always get the Scallops and Shrimp and the Family Style Bean Curd (fried tofu w/ veggies). I like lots of veggies in my dishes and Yin's doesn't disappoint.

My first step through the door 2007 near New Year's Eve, was nirvana and my enlightenment only continues. It's to believe what you see - wall to wall, floor to ceiling, nook to cranny libations for what seems like miles crammed into 750 square feet. 
Odd liquors that you have never heard of but sound interesting - check! Bottles and cans of beers from around the world - check! Glass objects like AK47s and walking canes filled with vodka - double check!

Sushi chefs are less thoughtful than they used to be.  My wife is dangerously allergic to avocado.  We ordered a roll without avo, but it was accidentally made with it.  They pulled the avo off and served it to my wife.  Luckily, I saw the green residue on the rice.  Upon closer inspection,  there were more chunks of poisonous avo waiting to take my love away from me...and send her to the hospital.  

Also, the rice with nigiri is shaped wrong, which tells you the sushi chefs are less skilled than previously.

Servers are still very nice, but not very attentive to check in often.  You only see them when an order is being dropped off.  We had to flag our server time every time we needed something like tea or water refill, plate, chopstick, adding orders.

Reservations required. 2 seatings per night. Our reservation was at 6pm ON valentines day (02/14/2015). I had arrived early. Doors opened at about 5:55 or so to let guests who were waiting outside in to take a seat. 

Upon seating with one of our friends, who arrived earlier than us. We were given a menu. The menu presents the omakase selections - Nigiri ($48), Yoroi ($80), and Kabuto ($120), the a la carte selections - appetizer ($8) , sashimi ($24), miso soup ($4), seasonal dessert ($4-7), and a wide selection of sake, wine, beer, and other drinks. 

Aside from this menu, there is also a menu of the day's fishes available to order a la carte (some of the fishes are picked from this menu for the omakase). Fishes range from blue fin tuna from Spain to fishes you may have never heard of before. 

I was recommended to choose the cheapest omakase selection (Nigiri for $48) and add by a la carte later for any want to try, so that is what i did. 

This is not your usual japanese restaurant. Each thing is served as you eat. One after another. Not all given on one plate. Pace yourself. Enjoy it. Savor it. Dont feel rushed. 

Aperitif - shot size of their homemade sake aged for approx 10 months with about 2% alcohol.

Sweet. Smooth. Flavorful. Delicious. 

Amuse (bite-sized hors d'œuvre)- Monk fish liver with ponzu sauce topped with a spicy radish and a side of pickled cucumbers and seaweed. - 

Clean flavor from the liver with a nice kick from the radish and pickled veggies. 

Nigiri (10 pc) - Hobo (Gunard), Hira-aji (Coastal Trevally), Akami (Blue Fin Tuna), Kan-sawara (winter butterfish), Umimasu (Ocean Trout), Chu-Toro (Medium Fatty Tuna), Homemade Ikura with rice, Chopped Toro with rice, Kogane Anago (Golden Sea Eel), Gyoku (Sweet Omelette)

Chu-toro was amazing. Insta-mouth orgasm. Not too fatty like o-toro but not too lean like akami. 

Homemade Ikura is amazing. Perfectly seasoned and super fresh. You do not see a single egg thats ""deflated"". Amazing combination with their sushi rice. I could eat a huge bowl of ikura and the rice daily. The sushi rice is cooked perfectly, and the temperature that is almost perfect to not room temp, but how it should be. Body temperature. 

Kogane Anago was perfectly cooked with a good amount of their secret unagi sauce. Not overly sweet. Not overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel. You don't find saltwater eel (anago) as you usually do the freshwater (unagi). 
Gyoku. homemade sweet egg branded with their own logo. Not too firm. Sweet. Thick. Flavor reminded me of a chinese steamed egg dessert i used to eat as a kid. 

Hand Roll - Premium fatty tuna hand roll with chopped onions served with a dipping soy sauce

First time ive seen a hand roll made this way but from now on, im totally copying their style at home. They roll it horizontally into a roll and close with a strip of nori vs rolling it into a cone. Smart. Unique. Chopped fatty tuna mixed with chopped onions. Onions adds a nice texture to the chopped fatty tuna that was soft and tender. The dipping soy sauce complimented it all nicely. Not overly salty, almost sweet. 

A la carte nigiri - Isaki (Striped Pig), Mizutako (Giant Octopus), Kanburi (King Yellowtail), Botan-ebi (Live Sweet Shrimp), Kohada (Shad), Ezo-bafun Uni (Japanese Sea Urchin), Uni (Sea Urchin)

Most of these were amazing in itself. I'm glad i ordered these to try. 

Isaki had a good texture and sweet. 

Mizutako was not chewy. Quite tender

Kanburi was amazing. Almost another insta-mouth orgasm like the chu-toro. 

Botan-ebi was fresh. Meat was ""crisp"". 

Kohada was prepared well. Nicely seasoned and prepared due to the tiny bones it has. Not too vinegar-y. 

Uni (from Catalina Island i heard) was AMAZING. I turned and told my best friend ""i feel like im eating ocean butter..."" she just laughed. mmm ^_^ 

Ezo-bafun uni... AMAZING. flashback reminder to my japan trip in 2006. Sweet. Fresh. Simply Amazing. 

Dessert - Strawberry Mille Crepe Cake

Served with hot green tea. Perfect combination and end to the meal. Not overly creamy or sweet. Green tea was fresh and hot. 

All this costed approx. $100 and some change before tips. This is not a meal to be over stuffed, but is a meal to indulge in the finest of cuisine and to experience the almost absolute tradition of how sushi is supposed to be served and eaten. 

Service is superb, if not a little too much XD the reason why i say this is because i felt like i had someone standing behind me at all times ... waiting for something to be finished and taken away... lol ! but great attention and super nice ! The chef's were nice as well. They probably know they have a slight accent so they were nice to repeat any of the names i couldn't hear clearly when they served the nigiri.

It turns out, they had immediate seating. I think the inside is fun and colorful. It is a little cavernous, but they have a lot of natural light shining in and low booth walls mean few dark spots. However, this night included a table full of twelve screaming middle schoolers, turning the interior into an echo chamber. So we sat outside.

unfortunately, the Dec 2012 version is too eggy, not enough ham, boring bechamel and missing the frisee and vinaigrette which balanced this dish and made it so delightful to photograph and look at.

Great price for all-you-can-drink bloody mary, but it's so goddam spicy that i can barely get the first one down. And this is from the guy who sprinkles ghost chili flakes on my fried chicken.

1) service was very slow. It took 30 min. for a cheese pizza to come to the table
2) the cheese pizza we ordered looked as if it was made on a tortilla or possibly some sort of flat bread.  A big salad and 12 inch pizza should have filled my family of four up, however I found self scavenging for pizza bones. I almost asked the guy in the booth just next to me if I could share some of his meal. 
Long and short of it is that the appeal is most likely to Chicago ""Transients"" who like deep dish pizza and I swore off ""Pizza Hut"" years ago.  I knew I should not have passed up a slice of pepperoni from Costco for the crackers and cheese from here.",2012-02-02 22:57:15

Dark, romantic and overlooking the Strip, the atmosphere engulfed me and I couldn't help but feel like I was in a James Bond movie. The only thing missing was a martini. 

As expected, the food was rich and delicious. The standout was the amazing Bone Marrow and Oxtail Jam ($16)--sinfully indulgent and heart clogging, I inhaled that dish with great relish. Our waitress was great--sweet and knowledgeable of the entire menu. 

So I embarked on this date more excited at the prospect of gulping down bone marrow rather than meeting this dude. Does that make me an asshole? Probably. But more importantly, would I go back to Comme ÇA? Absolutely.",2015-02-03 17:08:35

It seemed much later in the day already to me. So I Called Rosatis around  9:45am, and ordered  a deep dish pizza, a thin crust pepperoni and the dough knots.  The deep dish was for me, but I figured I go ahead and get a couple of things to have when the kids got home from school.  The guy who answered the phone, took my order and told me it would be ready in about 35 minutes.  I already knew  that because I order from here all the time.  The Deep dish takes about 35 minutes to cook... That's why I was calling ahead... So, he tells me 35 minutes and I hang up... I get there about 30 minutes later, the pizza isn't quite done, but I knew I was a few minutes early, so I sat in the waiting area for a few minutes.  It's approx 10:25am, When I get there, there's only one guy working in the back, he was preparing a pizza, so I said hello so he would know I was there... There was no one else there when I got there.  After I had been sitting there for a few minutes , another employee comes in and clocks in, then another.   They turn the lights on. I hadn't realized the main lights weren't even on when I arrived.  ANYWAY, I asked the girl if they were open, because it sorta dawned on me that it was early and I just put the pieces of the puzzle together.  She said that the website says they open at 10:30, but the restaurant opens  at 11am...

So the IMPORTANCE of my review is this;   I called in my order at 9:45am.  (They open at 11am) The guy didn't say we are not open, he took my order.  When I got there, no one blocked the door so I couldn't enter, I was allowed in the store. My order was HOT and ready, with a smile at 10:40, (20 minutes before they even open, and with a pizza that takes 35 Minutes to cook) AND  he guy offered me an apology  because I had to wait for the five

Today, we wanted to see why this restaurant always looks like it's packed. Now we know. The service was impeccable, and we thought the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The food was spot on - from the shumai (tastes like it's made from scratch) to the Taipei Special Dumplings (which have a tasty thin exterior and a rich, savory pork filling), we enjoyed our appetizers very much.

The main dishes were equally as nice - we had the crispy shrimp and broccoli (lightly battered crispy shrimp and a great sweet chili garlic sauce) and at our waiter's suggestion, the basil rice noodles with chicken. I must say that the basil rice noodle dish was the best of the day; flavorful thin chicken slices with fresh basil tossed in with the delicious noodles and a little bit of sauce. The dish just works... Like other Chinese restaurants, the portions are large, and we probably should have only ordered one entree for the two of us after enjoying the two appetizers. Food was served at the correct temperature, too, which is something I always look for. (I hate it when food is too hot or too cold when it is served!)

There is room for improvement with regards to the actual menu - it's too big, and has too many items on too many pages, making it a bit difficult to make up ones' mind, but this is hardly unique to Taipei, and I would say 99% of Chinese restaurants have this problem...

I decided to get their basic original burger with cheese just to give them a try. I have to report It was a very good burger. A nice thick patty. Not too big around, but I'm guessing it's in the 1/4lb range. A nice size for the $3.99 (+.60 cents for cheese) price.

What made the burger a standout was that you could tell all the ingredients were fresh. From the beef to the lettuce, onions, tomato, etc. it all tasted very fresh and tasty. 

Best burger I've had in a while. Definitely a step up from a Carl's Jr. for example. I'd rank them right up there with Five Guys and In N Out for taste and quality.

A very rich, decadent collection of dishes, I thought all were very well done, especially the mac (WOW!). The ""Bulls' Balls"" weren't as good as I had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the ""tomato foudue"", which was genius. (An angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) The ""street tacos"" were really good but really rich. My fave thing on the ""fried pickles"" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). Ended with a ""stout float"" (Guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. After food we had a really wacky concoction: ""Johnny Apple Seed"", consisting of Knob Creek, honey and apple cider. First of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what ""hard cider"" was! We had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. No matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! AHEM! But a great idea, IMHO. Sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! So overall, I'd say GO. Now I need to go back for a burger, perhaps that ""duck duck goose"", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & foie gras! YIKES!",2011-02-17 16:23:04

See the reviews from Stephanie and Helen regarding the stunning and embarrassing lack of service at this establishment; I promise you that you will be red faced by how you will feel when you leave. I used to frequent a few times a year with the family as we are close by, but stopped due to poor service. 

Four or five servers, slightly more than the  customers in seats at 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon chatting idly while my friend and I waited for a menu. After 30 minutes, I approached one delicately, asking what I did to offend them, and how I could make it better. The manager then came to he table, loudly and facetiously asking ""how can I help you?"" I reminded her that She is the same one whom sat my friend and I at the table; yet she did not seem to recall that moment In time. Please note that you need to get up to ask them to take your order, and if you need to go you also need to ask them for the bill. 

I remember now why we don't go to that place; a place that blatantly disregards their customers who are willing to part with their money. I am curious to see their cash outs at the end of the day in contrast to the overhead on servers who stand in washroom doorways and rush past tables so they can avert the eyes of eager patrons. 

Is Montana's immune to closures? The fish and chips were tasty. $20 tasty? They need to increase prices in relation to low patronage. 

Montana's, please don't try to overcompensate for lack of acknowledgement. Just remind your folks to respect all of your customers 
consistently, from the start. I won't be back for at least a year, then perhaps we'll try once more. Please provide your staff with timelines to serve your customers and to follow up with them appropriately without sounding false or forced.",2015-10-18 02:32:06

We got the angus beef AYCE (not the wagyu) and while angus beef is supposed to be higher quality meat, we didn't find it better than some of the other AYCE places we go to. The meat is also really really THIN which causes it to burn quickly so you have to be super quick, I wish the meat was thicker so you can enjoy it more. It's not hot pot here! They also seem to put all their meats and some of their veggies suck as okra and mushrooms in marinade. Everything is really sweet and you don't get to eat the natural flavour. I can't enjoy the beef flavour because it's covered in some sweet soy sauce. The pork belly too was super thin and honestly, I didn't know you can mess up pork belly but I was not enjoying it. I've been spoiled by the thick cut pork belly at authentic Korean restaurants, and this one does not melt in your mouth at all. In fact this one was thin, dry,  and tasted like paper. 
The good things I liked about the restaurant was the cooked food. The takoyaki was really good, so was the butter corn, the clams, the chicken karage, and the edamame were all tasty. 
The restaurant is very modern and new and bright with lots of tables so there was no wait. The service was average but we didn't expect much really.

I hope they keep at it (although they are owned by Basha's so it could be touch and go).

What I like about AJ's is the grill outside:)...and cupcakes:)

In addition to all the overpriced crap they sell inside (I swear, Lucy Ricardo is inside the store just making prices up as she goes along...the same box of Kashi Go-Lean that I can buy at Fry's for $2.95 is $4.80 at AJ's...the same friggin' box!:(...they have a grill out front that is both reasonably priced (how does $9.00 for huge  1/2 pound kobe beef burger and a drink sound?:) and really, really good!

They grill everything over an open charcoal grill and the salmon sandwiches, the burgers, the chicken sandwiches and the hot dogs are great, tasty, hot, fresh, well priced...and they are beyond sweet to me at the grill!

Queue up at the counter like I did yesterday and get yourself one of their incredible grilled salmon sandwiches...it looked like an entire salmon swam onto the toasted bun.

All the condiments are right there for the taking...so don't be stingy with whatever you like on your sandwich...don't see it?...Just ask and they will head into the store and get it for you:)

Then sit outside, in the shade, under the misters and enjoy one of the best, most reasonably priced lunches you will have!

After lunch, remembering what my buddy, Abu J. said about the bakery at AJ's, I headed into the store for my sweet treat:)

A revelation!

First of all...Thanks for the tip, Abu!

Second of all, Sprinkles should buy their cupcakes from AJ's and resell them...they could still charge their $14 per cupped cake and the cupped cake would actually be good...everybody would be happy:)

I bought a vanilla cupped cake with vanilla frosting (so subtle, but so satisfying:)...so much better than several of the cupped cake boutiques around town and really, on a par with some of the best...maybe not quite as good as Tammy Coe, but then I only paid $1.45 for this little gem...that ratio of price to goodness hunts!

Next time you are up in the north country, swing by AJ's and say ""hi"" to Stefanie and the people behind the grill at AJ's and do yourself a favor...leave room for a cupped cake...you'll be happy you did:)",2009-08-05 00:36:55

I had filet mignon and scallops.  Delicious!!!!!   My BF had the salmon and it was just ok.  The table side preparation of the spinach salad was neat and salad was tasty.

Our bill w/tip was $170. 

Reason was only 2 stars was the lack of ambiance.  We were told upon arrival that for breakfast, the same room was used for the Ceres buffet.  The large room with lots of tables, makes sense now.

A variety of gelatos and sorbets (my favorite was balsamic, but my daughter settled on a bowl of ""pink"" or raspberry...which was also really good), strawberry balsamic macaron, chocolate salted caramel macaron, and the frozen sphere marshmallow thing. Loved loved them all. The toasted marshmallow over the rice ice cream was seriously so delicious. We also had a chocolate chip cookie, which was good, but nothing special. They had a lot of other interesting flavors and pastries - very intrigued by the basque cake! The woman behind the counter informed me that they rarely have the same flavor 2 days in a row, so I definitely have to go back to try some other things out!

They barely opened a couple days ago, so I assume they're going to do something about the décor/ambiance (right now it is literally just an open room).

Service was extremely friendly, gave us lots of info and background on the products, and was very generous with the samples.

HOWEVER, the main drawback here is the price. Macarons are on the small side (as they should be), but are $2.50 each. Even the chocolate chip cookies were $2.50. So for 3 cookies, a marshmallow and a tiny ball of gelato.....$16. I could definitely return if in the area, but Freed's is still setting the standard for cookies in Las Vegas (by quality, price, flavor, and variety)!",2015-02-03 22:43:51

We sat down and I asked what gluten free products were available. I was told that the wraps can be GF as well as the bagels. So I ordered a wrap, but as it turned out they were out. 
Now I'm not a picky orderer, I love all the foods, so this isn't the kind of thing to irritate me whatsoever. I ordered a salad instead ($12), and had low expectations because this didn't seem like the type of place to order a salad. But feeling in need of some real food and feeling hopeful, I went ahead & ordered the goat cheese and arugula salad. This came with a 'side' of their GF bagel (for an extra $2). 
So, the bowl was massive (more arugula than a person should really eat in one sitting) with a few cherry tomatoes, and a few (probably canned) roasted red peppers and a bunch of breaded goat cheese balls. Everything tasted OK, and I appreciate that they have something almost healthy looking on the menu but WOW, this isn't something I would ever eat again. It needs way more salad stuff you guys!

Upon calling for a reservation, I was told that a manager would call me back to confirm the reservation.  I thought this was strange, but went along with it.  The manager called me shortly, but told me that she needed my credit card number in order to hold the table.  I have never been asked to do this before, and felt strange about it but did it anyway.

Dinner was great-our waitress was attentive and it was a great experience.  However, about two hours in, the hostess came over and was quite rude to us about how reservations have a two hour cap on them.  I was a bit confused by this, as we were a party of ten and I was never told this very strange stipulation when the manager was taking down my credit card number.

Most sandwiches are around the $10 mark, more if you have add-ons. Also check out their English breakfast fry-up as well, which is rumoured to be the most legit in the city.

4 different kinds of bacon are available - strip, peameal, British style and wild boar. Customizations are encouraged here, but I highly recommend giving their in-house brown sauce a try.

What better way to spice things up than to order Thai food?  We placed a gigantic order at Lemon Grass, including Pad Thai, House Fried Rice, Chicken with Pine Nuts, Green Curry Noodles, Panang Curry, Massaman Curry, Chicken Coconut Soup, Beef with Macadamia Nuts, and Pork with Green Noodles.

Everything was ready quickly - we picked up the order after about 20 minutes or so.  I'd say, given the quality of the food, it was overpriced.  Nothing was really especially good.  It was all just standard, but tasty, Thai take out.  Nothing that made us say wow.  I did enjoy the non-curry dishes the most (the fried rice and pad thai especially) - those were a little above average to me.  The curries were all fine....but they all tasted REALLY similar.  That was disappointing.  We really couldn't detect much difference between the three at all.  That was a bit disappointing.  They were so much alike that we mixed the leftovers all together and put them in the same tupperware - no reason to keep them separate.

It's fine, it's fast, and it's pretty much what you'd expect Thai takeout to be.  There might be a few standouts, but overall it's not anything you haven't had before.  I'm sure you could find more authentic and more fresh-tasting Thai food easily.",2010-11-29 15:19:42

First and foremost the food. 
I very much appreciate the items on the menu (rice, udon noodles, more recently ramen noodles and other staples of Japanese cuisine), which are not made fusion or Canadianized. No gimmicks here. What is more they offer varieties related to the owner's Kyoto hometown.
The taste however leaves something to be desired. The food needs much more flavour. Japanese food needs marination and dashi and Manpuku needs to step up.
The portions are small, but I have to say that I was completely full for $11 because I ordered two dishes. yes, the prices... knowing they are in a food court and next to a college the prices are economical.
I had the shigure rice bowl and missed the shoga (ginger) taste, It lacked favour, which is why they offer you Japanese seven spices automatically. The rice was fine. The bowl was $7, which is fair. 

They also offer alcohol and Japanese cheesecake, etc.

Think about it. Their ramen bowl is $8 (which is how much a ramen bowl is in Japan) and they are only one small non-corporate location. In contrast some of the other ramen chains in town charge double that (and I have to say while they offer a little more quantity the quality of some ramen in town leaves a lot to be desired so it is not like we are comparing very bad ramen to very good ramen either). Kinton needs to improve its broth, get better chashu. Sensotei's tonkotsu is not even tonkotsu. Touhenboku is rather bad. I don't even bother with places like Ajisen..

Service
This place is packed and they are rushed. With that said, they are all Japanese so they never comes across as impolite or dismissive. Unlike Kinka, Sake bar Kushi, Uncle Tetsu, etc. the black t-shirt clad staff are entirely Japanese here. The good looking owner has done the same thing for over ten years and is still attentive and caring. They could probably use an additional waitress, but fact is where would they stick the person?? lol
Upon entrance you are given a menu and asked whether you would like tea or water. Everything else moves at varying speed i.e. depending on how busy they are could be fast or slow.
The waitress/cashier are still polite.

They are in a food court, but occupy the favoured walled-off and dine-in space with waitstaff. Amazingly, for $11 or so one could have a meal and a side, which is what eating at the crappy junk food (McDonalds, Popeyes...) stands next door would cost you!

During lunch here I had the pleasure of sitting next to what sounded like a student and her teacher and could overhear the entire conversation with what sounded like a pretty straightforward attempt by her to pick him up. I am all for younger women/much older men relationships (and anything else that anyone's heart desires), but kept wondering if there are rules for student/teacher relationships. Whether he ended up saying yes to her or not I cannot be sure, but he did pick up the bill for both of them lol.

But, one our friends REALLY wanted to go there, and she was willing to go early to put our name on the list, so off we went.
We did wait for a while, but we rocked in the chairs out front where it was shady and the time went pleasantly enough. Then, we were ushered in to be seated in the most crowded, noisy environment possible. They were cramming way too many people in too small of a space. Everyone was bumping the person behind them, the servers couldn't get between tables, and you had to take a scenic course to get to the restroom. etc. Hated it.

I vaguely remembered visiting a Cracker Barrel in AZ, and it being a pleasant experience. After my memory was refreshed by this visit, I remembered liking the cute store, the little peg games, and the hash brown casserole. Virtually everything else was an example of home cooking from someone who was not a very good cook.

The servers were pleasant enough, but they brought everyone's food at a different time; my sister's toast was cold and unbuttered, and they brought out rock hard butter LATER which could not be spread;my server asked which two sides I wanted with my sandwich then charge d me for both when it turned out there was only supposed to be one. (Her error- my penalty), etc.

 These were only a few of the gaffes- followed by another unpleasant experience while trying to pay the check. They force you to go stand in line in the gift shop so you might buy some extra crap, and the little old lady at the register bungled the simple operation of check splitting so badly that some people paid for things they didn't order, but wanted out so badly it wasn't worth it to try and correct it.

We sat across from the fountain so it had a great vibe. We initially had a concern due to a holiday special two for one for brunch and was told by the waitress that it only covered the specific brunch items not the brunch menu. The manager came over to clarify that it did indeed cover any items on the brunch menu up to $15. I ordered the Pesto Chicken and Quinoa Salad and loved it. The menu states all ingredients and the calories which is helpful in making decisions. It was so filling that I had to take some home. The staff was super friendly and the bread before the meal must be one of the best in town.,2017-05-27 22:01:06

Recommended items were the BLT, short ribs, shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles. My favorite was the BLT it had a thick fried green tomato with house made bacon. The short ribs were delicous and fell right off the bone and I would definitely order those again. The chef even gave us complimentary cornbread and bone marrow. The cornbread was standard and the bone marrow was good and served with bread and jam.

The bar was a bit tight for the event and the two bartenders were working hard all night.  There was one bartender doing some fancy tricks with the cocktail making. I thought he was part of the vendor team promoting the whiskey but turns out he works at Blowfish.

The promoter was there and explained their whiskey. You can order it neat, on the rocks, and 2 different cocktail choices. The expert was also coming around to guests with the bottle and pouted shots for us. They also brought in some Taiko drummers to perform twice for the group.

The sandwich was great, and despite the name, it was a reasonable size. I also had a nice latte along with my breakfast. At the time, I paid with a gift certificate so I didn't pay attention to how pricey it was.

I returned for lunch while my car was being tuned up, and I got a massive burrito filled with quinoa and veggies. It came with a lightly dressed salad on the side. I brought home a carrot cupcake for my husband, and he thought it was great. My lunch, latte and dessert was nearly $30.

Next came the Smoked & Roasted Bone Marrow, they didn't skimp on this portion. It was the best bone marrow we have ever had. We talked about that marrow for days. It calls our names.
For our main course we split the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles, they know how to make fried chicken, I cried a little as I ate it.
We got drinks through out dinner, I started with the Yardbird Old Fashioned which was a mistake, it is way too savory (bacon-infused Buffalo Trace Bourbon is used in it) to drink with a meal.

I had the chicken fajita, which was quite tasty, but it was only chicken on a bed of lettuce with a few spices.  I'm allergic to sweet peppers, so they didn't serve me any. No beans and rice accompanied this though.

We got there at 9:45, paid $5 for parking, (no line, lots of spots) were in and had seats under an umbrella by 10:15. By 11, I doubt you could get a shade spot, but lots of people did have tents, covers etc. on the grass areas all over the park.

Good things:

Wave pool was fun, kids loved it, even when it was busy

Lazy River was fun, nice break, lots of tubes or you can just swim it

Splash Island for the kids was great, slides for them (but adults could ride too) with maybe a 5 minute wait, lots of spraying, dumping, splashing water.

Bad things:

Waits for big slides were LONG. The kids only managed one (Royal Flush) and that took an hour and was the shortest line by far. They didn't want to wait for any others.

The whole stand in a long line for a tube, then stand in line for the slide is annoying. I guess if you rent a tube, you can bypass some of the tube lines, but you cannot bring a rental tube on a few of the slides. 

The ground everywhere, lines, etc. is hotter than you can possibly imagine. Shoes are an absolute must.

Food is expensive and so-so, but I find that to be typical of any water or theme park.

I should add that we didn't pay, got free tickets from a friend. If I had paid the $40, I would have been disappointed, (NOT worth it) but if you get a pass and go several time I think it becomes a better value. Also, if we were a MUST RIDE SLIDES family, I think it would have sucked with the lines.

But barbecue is an art form to me and that would be like saying a Rembrandt is better than a Renoir or a Picasso.  Each artist, and here I mean barbecue artist, has their own technique and style and there can be none that is the best.

Now, worst?  Heck yeah there can be worst and I've had plenty of it. Maybe that's why I'm so dialed in to the subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, differences that can make me drool when I encounter a masterpiece of barbecue.

We discovered this place while coming back from errands of a Friday night hungering for some good brisket. We almost went to another place we never heard of but we had just passed it and didn't want to backtrack during Friday night rush-hour traffic. The website had promise, not overinflated promises just some key things that made it sound good. One was that they often sell out. That's actually a good thing because it means they're not some huge national chain that has a ton of frozen meat sitting in a semi parked out back.

And trust me, Hek Yeah is about as far from being a national chain based in New York City as you can get.  I'm reviewing this without knowing anything about their backstory, like who owns it, where they came from, how they learned the art of smoking their meat, etc.  Those are all trivial when I've got a taste for brisket, just show me the meat.

We picked up a pound of it to take home where we had some nice Mac Cheese waiting (that's our Mac Cheese not theirs in the photo).  Just a pound of meat in a bag, that's all. Note that the stuff's not cheap, the pound was over $18, but who's counting?  While I believe it is the ultimate sacrilege to put anything on brisket, especially so-called BBQ sauce, I do like tasting what local joints make so we took a tiny sampler of three of their recommended ones.  The lady asked if we like spicy and the answer was affirmative, but holy cow, er, pig ... that stuff is hot enough to remove paint. But that's a good thing, what I'm saying is it's very, very good.

Kudos to them for mixing a nice balance of lean and fatty and burnt ends in the pound. The ratio was just right.

This is a place I honestly don't want to review for fear that next time I go the wait will be 6 hours. When we went we lucked out and there were just a few casual folks hanging around.  So let's make a deal here, I'm letting you in on the secret of Hek Yeah ONLY if you promise you won't go there the same time I do.

No matter which soup base you go with, you'll end up adding things to make it tastier unfortunately. The broth is super bland.

Walked past it twice. It's an old garage converted into a brewery so you see the white garage door as the front. Not what I was expecting.

We walked in, and wow the smell of cured meats greeted us.  A server welcomed us and said the bar upstairs was available for seating. So we made our way up.

It's kind of tight up there, but you can look down and see the bar and the brewing going on. REALLY high ceilings, cool space, candles and flowers on the wood tables. Very comfy.

We ordered the Weiss and the Toilet something or other. Fantastic beers. Ordered a few tapas (the menu is interesting), and we were really loving the potato and sun cholks on a stick. They were $3 each. We also ordered the crispy pork which was AMAZING, the liver pate and bread, and the salami plate. All were delish. They can add up quickly with the beer, so if you're ultra hungry, I would say be prepared to spend a pretty penny to eat. 

Overall, the ambiance was great, the server was fantastic and I am guessing their menu changes weekly. I will definitely go back and try more beer and more tapas. This place is a great addition to the Ossington strip. Can't wait for the patio!

Enjoy!",2012-04-30 18:21:31

I've tried several things my favorites are the roll-ups. Both the chicken and steak roll ups are awesome! And they both come with different dipping sauces that kick the favors up perfectly. My favorite side is the potato salad it's not mayo based and is made with small red potatoes.

My husband and I had an unexpected date night, and Groupon led us to Centurion.  We were seated promptly, but the host seemed to be entirely lacking in personality.  Thank goodness our waiter (and a lovely waitress that helped us decide on a dessert) made up for it! 

I quickly chose 5 different items for us to share, and was so disappointed when I found that they were out of the gnocchi.  I was quickly reassured that I would love the stuffed mushrooms as a replacement (despite the fact that I generally dislike mushrooms).  I went ahead with the waiter and owner/manager's suggestion, and they were right on!  Those mushrooms were fabulous!  MUST come back just for those!  In addition, we also ordered the mussels, a lovely blackberry salad, and a pasta dish.  All were tasty, but the mussels outshone the others.  We also ordered the brie en croute, and the host delivered a ""well done"" pastry to us.  When I inquired about how black the pastry was (the outer portions were totally burned), he said, ""Is that going to be a problem?""  I thought it was strange that I actually had to tell him that no, I didn't want to eat burned pastry and had to ask directly for a new one.  Luckily, the second time was better.

This of course allowed more time/attention from the manager(owner?); I've got to say, I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about-- the guy we met was awesome! He was very friendly, not small talk friendly but ACTUAL conversations friendly.

I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with fries and cornbread. My friend got the same except with coleslaw instead of the fries. 

Ribs: okay, I don't know if I just hadn't had ribs in a long time and I was just really homesick and craving... OR THOSE RIBS WERE THE BOMB! They were slathered with just the right amount of BBQ sauce (you can never have too much when it comes to ribs though) and the meat was that perfect consistently where it could fall of the bone without much effort but it hasn't. AGHHH so good! I must return!

Fries: not going to lie, the ribs were so good that I don't remember if I liked the fries. But honestly speaking, fries are my favourite thing in the world and so if I don't remember these then they were probably between mediocre and alright.

Cornbread: Damn. Who'd have thought you'd find good cornbread in Montreal? It was delicious! I could taste the buttery goodness in it but it wasn't at all greasy/oily. Couldn't get enough of it.

Coleslaw: I'm not a coleslaw person but my friend said that it was good. It was purple though-- not sure if that's a Montreal thing?

Overall: I didn't get anything to drink, just water. So all together, including tip, I paid about $30. This is normally the price range I would pay (on the higher end though) at the smokehouses back home so normally this would be okay. BUT the portions were small. Usually when I go out for ribs (or something to that variety), I'm overwhelmed by the amount of food that's put in front of me. I wasn't really wow-ed though. 
And I finished it. Easily. Never have I ever finished a whole meal at a smokehouse-- I usually end up having to take home a little container of leftovers.

Yeah so absolutely delicious but WAY overpriced for the portions.",2016-03-31 05:22:33

Me and my boyfriend came here to meet up with my uncle who was staying at Ballys. The place is pretty small with a few tables and stools and a couple of stools at the bar  The both of us sat at the bar and ordered entrees before my uncle arrived:

1) I ordered the HALF RACK BABY BACK RIBS w/ a choice of 2 sides; I got the baked beans and cole slaw. I don't remember what kind of rub or sauce but whatever our server suggested was really good. The meat was cooked well as were the baked beans. As for the cole slaw, it was swimming in a pool of the dressing, yuck. 
2) The boyfriend ordered the CARNE ASADA including spanish rice, refried beans, and choice between corn or flour tortillas. The carne asada was a nice sized portion and the accompanying onions and peppers added more flavor. The beans were good, but the spanish rice was a bit salty. 

We had just finished dinner when my uncle came to meet us.  From then on it was a nonstop drink-a-thon. Beers are relatively cheap, with $5 or $7 pitchers, depending on the beer, and so between the free flowing cheap beer and the endless choices of tequila, we stayed at the bar for a good majority of the night. The 2 bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive getting refills and explaining the 2 sets of flights my uncle had also just ordered:

1) The SPIRIT OF MEXICO: 4 shots of various tequilas for $29 
2) BLANCO FLIGHT: 4 different shots of other tequilas for $29

Pros
Attentive and friendly service from the staff.
Some very unique dishes on the menu. 
Playing the Leafs game on the big TV's. They had at least 4 TV's, 1 not working though.
Banana coconut crusted chicken breast was unique, some of the edges were a bit burnt. Not enough vegetables for a side dish, and bit too much rice. 
Smokehouse deluxe beefburger - Definitely big, and literally a two-hander. 
Half pound calamari is enough- comes with a choice of two sauces tzatziki or chili, we asked for both and they give us a bit of both :)

Cons
Downstairs bathrooms.
Somersby rhubarb tasted amazing but was $8.48, a bit steep IMHO. 
Parking can be difficult in this area. 
Didn't have audio for the Leafs game.
Not a five star IMHO due to the high prices.

I had only tried ramen once before in my life but wanted to know all about this noodle-y dish having watched Mind of a Chef on Netflix with David Chang recently.

We tried three different ramens, the newest being shoyu kotteri tsukemen, black tan tan, and spicy red miso.

All three ramen were delish. The Tsukemen ramen had a hot fish based broth with cold noodles and veggies on the side. I liked taking the noodles and dipping them into the broth - Yum! Spicy red miso was also yummy, I enjoyed the kick! My fave was the black tan tan ramen. They give you black sesame seeds to grind up and put into the broth - so so good!

Pizza was really really good.  Menu is short and a bit too limited.  It really is ONLY pizza.  Food gets a 4.5. 

Service.  After two visits the service nets out at average or slightly below.   First visit was great although it was quite early and they started by saying ""order fast we have limited dough left"".  We thought that was a bit odd.  Not really a service problem per se.   Second visit service was just too cool, rushed and we didn't feel overly welcomed.  Service is a 2.5. 

Venue....hmmm.   I respected the art.  My wife felt afraid.  It was curious and begged some thought.  I wouldn't bring a small child here at night.  Maybe not even during the day.   It was dark and hipster cool.   But not overly comfy and the open kitchen was a blessing and a curse.    

Hygiene.  The place was clean.  I will give them that.  The owner was there and we watched in amusement as he would: decorate a pizza, touch machinery and storage bins, hike his baggy jeans, adjust his ball cap, then back to food.  It became a game for us to see how many unclean things he could touch before returning to food.   It kinda grossed us out.  If we were truly concerned we would have left so it was more amusing than anything.   And a bit gross.  I'd give it like a 2 on that whole aspect.    

What's most important?   Well.  All of it.  You go out for a meal.  And you pay good money.  The art of the game for restaurateurs is to deliver all of these things at a price point that represents value.  It's not easy to do.   

If it were me, I would slightly adjust the art to eliminate the dead women with eyes gouged out, diligently train ""friendly"" into my servers and keep the open kitchen but proudly show off ""best in class"" hygiene - wash stations (being used) hair nets, clean white uniforms.   That's just me.

The atmosphere is unique....unique in a way that reminds me of the Stardust days and vintage Vegas. Their menu even says ""some things are better left unchanged"" and when it comes to what they do at The Peppermill, they're right! They don't need to change a thing and if they ever did, it may be the worst move ever.

The menu is extensive, and the portions are LARGE and i mean LARGE. It's done on purpose to replicate what Vegas used to do before greed by the ""big guys"" set in. The food is pretty awe-inspiring, and seemed pretty robust in quality. The ambiance alone gets the 5-stars.

If you go to Vegas and don't try the Peppermill, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice and it may even result it a display of your own penitence.

u32Rd5s-R1cOJNhRno9npw,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,bQm046mj02fKlNMvoS2SBg,3,6,5,5,"My first ever run-in with Turkish cuisine was when I was in Grade 4 in Mr. Wills' homeroom class.  He was my English teacher and we had read C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  After we finished reading the book, Mr. Wills bought Cadbury's Turkish Delight in for the class as we all were wondering what heavenly deliciousness could make a brother betray his own blood?  Well, I later found out that it was nothing but a pinkish looking jujube-like candy covered in chocolate.  I guess you can't really consider that to be a sampling of any culture's cuisine.

While exchanging emails with my mom about how all the good bakeries in Scarborough reside along Kingston Road, she must've stumbled upon a connected link to other bakeries which led her to Ma Maison, which was inconveniently located at the polar opposite end of the Scarborough bakeries I was referring he to - Ma Maison was in Etobicoke.  Since my mother wanted to try their croissants, and since I was going to be in Etobicoke anyways, I decided to go outside my comfort ""zone"" (literally), and try Turkish cuisine.  Yelp has always brought me to new and exciting restaurants that I would otherwise not discover or even think about trying... Anatolia fell right into that category.

I arrived at approximately 5:45PM on a Wednesday to an empty restaurant.  There were about 5 tables at the peak (while I was there).  There were 2 servers.  The decor was traditional with lots of Turkish chinaware lining the walls and tapestries.  Red-and-white-checkered table cloths were laid across the table.  

Being inexperienced, other than having read reviews about the Mixed Plate being good, we asked the server for her recommendations for an appetizer.  None of us were particularly hungry, so we just got one mixed plate and ended up opting for the quartet of dips/spreads.  This is also the first time I've been to a restaurant where I was uncomfortable trying to pronounce the names of the dishes in fear of sounding like an idiot, haha.  So I just said, I'll take a number 16 and a number 35.  I bet I challenged the server's memory! 

Meze Tabagi-  Four of Anatolia's most popular spreads including: Ayse's Walnut Spread, Hummus, Salsa and Eggplant.  Other than the walnut spread, I found the other 3 spreads to be rather bland and unflavourful.  I will say though that all the spreads tasted fresh.  The bread that came with the dips was different than western breads.  It almost reminded me of eating a water biscuit as it was quite simple in terms of flavour, but I wouldn't use the word bland to describe it.    

Anatolia Mixed Plate - Came with 1 grilled chicken kebab, flame broiled beef kofte, lahmacun (a crepe-pita hybrid filled with ground beef, and various Turkish spices), bulgur rice and a rice pilaf.  The grilled chicken was quite tender, juicy and succulent and the yogurt dip was rich and creamy.  The beef kofte's had a nice char to them and were also quite flavourful.  I loved the rice pilaf that was cooked in a chicken broth but the winner of this mixed plate had to be the lahmacun.  The lahmacun was wrapped into a cigar shape, and had so many different layers of flavours that just came together to create a tasty, tasty ""crepe.""

To end the night off, I tried a Turkish Coffee.  It took about 15 minutes from the time I ordered it to show up on the table.  Turkish Coffee comes in an espresso cup and a piece of Turkish delight.  I had originally ordered it strong and sugarless (I was thinking Starbucks coffee) but when the server gave quipped ""Are you sure?"" I took her recommendation and went with medium instead.  It was later revealed to me that Turkish coffee is quite strong.  I guess that's why you need the Turkish delight as an accompaniment.  Turkish Coffee in my own words, tastes rather ""woody.""  It does not possess a particularly strong caffeine flavour to it, but is unique in its own right.  Just a heads up that there will be coffee grinds at the bottom of your cup, try to avoid drinking that!  The Turkish delight was a lot better than the Cadbury version that I had back in primary school, and had nuts in it.  

Verdict:

I must reward top marks when it came to plating and presentation.  Everything was so visually appealing, not to mention savoury.  The Mixed Plate is definitely a must try as all the proteins were juicy, succulent and tender with a nice char/grilled flavour to it and the rices were flavourful as well.  The bill fell shy of $50 with tax and tip.",2011-07-29 12:39:00

The service is perfect. They seat you ASAP and the water glass of mine is constantly full. They check-up just enough so you feel remembered, but not pestered. 

Food here is just like Grandma's :) 

Cucumber salad and papaya salad (youre not supposed to eat the crabs, just suck on them for their saltiness, not too much of a fan) are good appetizers. If you're looking for soup rather than salad for appetizers, the Tom ga kai soup is my faveee, and they make it well here.

For entrees I usually get Red or Green Curry. Yummm. I have found that the red curry is spicier than green when ordered on the same scale.  My last visit, I stepped away from getting my usual curries, and got the ground chicken larb salad. It was just as I had expected, almost as good as grandma's ;]. I recommend this dish, I think people stay away from food that they don't know... but larb is ground meet of your choice. Thai basil and cilantro really dominate the dish, along with this it has the standards of onions, and fish sauce. With the ground meat, you put it in cabbage wraps.. mmm. So, you can call it a variant of lettuce wraps. 

My only complaint is the lack of rice they give for the curry... There is so much broth for this and i like to have my curry and rice well proportioned, but they dont provide you enough... I know how the asians hate wasting!! But I dont think it would go to waste if they just gave another scoop. 

I have tried tmy friend's pad thais, pad see ews, and other noodle dishes. I am not too fond of getting these here because I feel that I can get these in chinese take out!

The combinations of flavors and textures and the ""waste nothing"" approach to preparing food. You picture little Asian grandmas in the kitchen, meticulously tucking the pork and bean paste filling into each pork bun. You imagine them crafting hand made dumplings, egg-rolls and wontons. You think about a couple of middle aged Asian men busy stir frying ingredients in giant woks over hot stoves, wiping their brows as they furiously tend to their tasks.

That is not what happens here and I'm sorry to disappoint you.

If you have ever visited an Asian supermarket...check out the frozen section sometime. There is a vast selection of ready to microwave dumplings and pork buns and meats and vegetables of all kinds. There are egg-rolls and wontons and pot stickers and shrimp and octopus galore. Over in the condiments aisle, there's General Tso sauce in a bottle and Hoisin and Bibim Bap and Bulgoki and seafood sauce.

Throw the above items into a microwave/pot/oven/wok and then you place them on a buffet. That is the type of meal you'll get here- which is not to say that is is a bad meal at all, but you don't need an Asian grandma to make the treats being served on these steam tables because they have been manufactured by a machine, frozen and reheated for your dining pleasure.

Many Americans don't venture into an Asian supermarket and for those Americans, the bloom is not off of the rose. Me? I can't stay out of an Asian supermarket once I locate one, so the value for me here is that someone else prepares the food for me, does the dishes, and refills my drink. Although a piece of tuna sashimi was still mostly frozen, it was an OK place to chow.

Try eating the shrimp which are fried in their shells with the shell and the head still attached. They fight back a little as you chew them up, but they are far tastier. Try a snail with some of the dumpling sauce or hot mustard. Damn good. Do not let me see you put a slice of pizza or some mashed potatoes or french fries on your plate here. Do grab piece of fried chicken, however.

I've been lucky to have gorged myself at much better Asian buffets before, and I prefer the Hong Kong style (which this is not) but despite the 2.5 stars I'm giving World Buffet, I will return because this type of grub is hard to find in AZ. $15 per person ain't a bad price and that includes a soft drink and the all you can eat crab legs, oysters, sushi and sashimi.",2011-12-01 22:28:48
bg-6Psk8ClnBieJh6a2RQw,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,Z0o7EnCj3fgzC7E3QRabhQ,4,7,5,5,"Since I still haven't properly tried Pizza Rock, or any of his other restaurants for that matter, this was my introduction to the cuisine of the famous Tony Gemignani. It was certainly a good first impression.

With a rapidly expiring Groupon to my name, I arranged to meet a couple of friends here for an early dinner. While I was waiting for them, I noticed that it was the tail end of happy hour. Upon inquiry, the host informed me that they do honor happy hour pricing for Groupons. This unexpected surprise bode well for the night.

After my friends arrived, we got seated. We were shown to a booth, having been indecisive with the choice between that and a table. This was great. I felt comfortable because of the cushions below and behind me, but they were actually very unobtrusive. Moral of the story: go for a booth if you can.

I appreciated the decor, with the retro faux brick walls and the clean, modern black table tops meshing well, and the good lighting allowing us to eat with our eyes first (and take photos of course). They have plenty of TVs and they were almost all tuned to the Thursday night NFL game, which was a nice plus for two of us fantasy football managers.

Anyway, I seem to have digressed a little. The food was great, and stacking discounts made money a forgotten issue at the meal went on. (Quick note: I didn't go for the alcohol tonight, but during happy hour, well drinks are $3, draft beers and wine by the glass are $2 off, and specialty cocktails are $3 off.)

We definitely ordered every happy hour appetizer, and then some. The Classic Meatballs ($3 HH for 3 meatballs) were moist, tender, and savory, with a nice pool of sweet tomato sauce lending more flavor but not covering up the meat at all. The Calamari Fritti ($5), which we had in a traditional style, came with a marinara sauce and a spicy calabrese sauce, the latter of which was the more interesting of the two even if it was starting to edge into too-spicy-for-me territory. The Garlic-Garlic bread with cheese ($5) was tasty in the super-cheesy middle sections, but got a little boring at the ends.

I think I had the most mixed feelings about the Italian Fries ($3) They have four different types of fries, and although we skipped the Truffle fries and Gorgonzola fries, we did go for the Rosemary Garlic fries and Honey Pancetta Parmagiano fries. I'm a little sad to say that, although the fries are nicely crunchy outside and fluffy inside, they're clearly under-seasoned. The Rosemary Garlic fries merely have ketchup to help cover up this flaw, and I left those alone after a few bites. However, I really liked the other variety because the honey, pancetta, and parmesan stacked sweet, smoky, and savory flavors (note: add more cheese from the parmesan dispenser if necessary). I just wish that the foundation was solid.

Because 9"" pizzas were $2 off for Happy Hour, we felt more comfortable sampling different varieties instead of going straight to the higher value 16"" pizzas. My choice of the New Yorker ($8 HH), per another friend's recommendation, was a nice meaty pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and dollops of ricotta on which I probably should have used a knife to spread out a little. The ricotta definitely added an unexpected dimension. The Tartufo ($10 HH), a white pizza, had some nice touches from the light truffle oil and goat cheese, although I would have liked just a bit more prosciutto. The Quatro Formaggio ($8 HH) was a nice combination that didn't have me missing the cheese at all, aside from the rather pronounced crust on the edge. Speaking of which, I never skip the crust anyway, but the dough was delicious on all of the pizzas - crispy and crunchy in just the right amounts.

I should also mention that our server was friendly and engaging from the moment we entered the restaurant, building a nice rapport at least with my more sociable friend. He had a nice sense of humor and wasn't too intrusive, haughty, or whatever issues you might have. He even left me something interesting on my phone when he borrowed it to run the Groupon voucher... nah, just kidding on that. It was a nice joke though.

It wasn't perfect in every way, but my experience at Little Tony's left me wanting to return, especially for the fries with honey and pancetta. And the excellent meatballs, of course. Actually, I should finally check out Pizza Rock now since its Green Valley Ranch location is closer to me. Besides, it's probably gonna be a while until the next Groupon.",2015-09-25 05:55:37

Sure, there's no swimming pool here like there is in Jacksonville, but let's face it: it's Cleveland! The seats are all nice and easily accessible. Parking can be tricky, as parking immediately adjacent to the stadium is either for season ticket holder, or media/employees/players. Plan on parking and walking quite a way. Or take public transportation or private car service and save yourself a few headaches. Food and drink is like it is at most sports arenas: expensive and limited options. There are several private clubs in the stadium, and if you are lucky enough to be invited into one of those your options are a little more robust. From late October onward, plan on the weather having an impact on your stadium visit. Even a mild day can feel cold due to the winds coming off the lake. On the other hand, this is part of what makes football in Cleveland so special.",2017-12-17 04:59:09

Pretty good pub atmosphere, great chips and pretty good fish, especially for the desert.  My fish could best be described as a plank.  Three good size Cod fillets that were bonded together by the beer batter.  In the traditional English style, I prefer the Haddock fillets but you really only find that in England and New England.

The batter was laid on a bit heavier than I care for but it was still good batter.  The chips were nice long slices...perfect.

The tarter sauce was slightly sweet, I prefer it tangier.

Portions were good, particularly for the fish.

They have an interesting concept here called ""TV Dinner On Trays"" in which you can build your own platter by choosing 1 ""On Tray"" and 3 sides for $15.99.  Marla tried that and wimped out 1/2 way through it, so she took some home.  Sherry tried the barbecue chicken ranch salad.  Maryann went for the wood-grilled chicken burrito.

And then there was Susan.  Sometimes Susan gets really hungry.  Sometimes Susan wants just a plain ole good cheeseburger.  And there's only one type of meat that Susan acknowledges as a burger--beef!  No turkeyburgers, no ostrich burgers, and certainly no veggie burgers will do.

You see, Kay and I had just left a dandy Yelp Elite event at the Andy Warhol Museum on foot and were heading towards the trolley station to get back to Beechview. Alas, Kay was hungry, and she wasn't waitin' to get a homecooked-by-me dinner. 

We passed B'Z, but we were somewhat put off by the total lack of patrons and its intimidatingly swanky decor (I was feeling like a cheapskate and thought they might be too costly for my budget that evening, but we'll probably get there eventually as some internet research the following morning revealed an interesting bill of fare and prices that don't look so bad after all). I wanted to try Pittsburgh Sports Bar & Grill, but Kay feared rowdy boozers, especially considering that a Penguins game was heating up. 

Tilted Kilt was simply not an option.

As the frosty winds that began as nibbles turned into snakebites, I caught sight of Rivertowne. Warily, we entered. 

And at first, the atmosphere was tolerable, relaxing even. A tight ice rink contest was shaping up on the flatscreen telly, and the clientele was well-behaved.  

Behold my sole, major, star-deducting caveat. 

After the hockey game wrapped up (the Penguins won!) some obnoxious, chunky, balding DJ who looked to be my age yet was trying to act like a 21 year-old jackass, picked up a microphone, yelled into it, and started spinning blubbery, rubbery, misogynist hip-hop at top volume. 

Look, hip-hop's not my bag of chips (I'll never pretend that it is and don't expect everyone to bob their heads to the crazy shit I listen to either), but any music played at high levels can conspire to derail a meal. It was so loud, we could scarcely communicate with our server, and digest this: Not even the youthful customers seemed to be doing much of anything! They weren't even dancing! Hell, you couldn't get down if you wanted to anyway due to the tables and chairs obstructing any space one might need in order to boogie. Yet, DJ Pastywhitedude kept imploring people to ""Get up!"" and ""Make some noise!"" And noise is becoming a problem in restaurants nationwide, our Rivertowne experience causing the subject to land at our feet in a booming manner...

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zester-daily/turn-down-volume-restaurant-noise_b_1756393.html

It was as deafening as any concert I've attended. I kept wishing I had brought my earplugs. As I alluded to in the previous paragraph, this created a problem service-wise and brings me to another curious observation about Rivertowne. 

The bartenders were all very comely young females who practically disregarded female patrons and did almost nothing but flirt aggressively and shamelessly with the fellas. I don't remember even seeing any of these barely-legal strumpets in painted-on denim even do so much as pour a drink! The plainer-looking and not-so-svelte servers waited on tables occupied by couples or groups. It's not that I wanted the cute, apple-bottomed redhead to wait on us -- it's that I found the dynamic tawdry and somewhat discriminatory. Staying on that track, I also noticed that aside from our server, the female staff was entirely white. Shades of Panera Bread? I'd say so, but unlike Panera, my meal was decidedly satisfying (Kay had some issues with her burger, but I'll let her tell that tale).

We mostly enjoyed the briny, meaty, juicy Scotch Eggs, the ""fire sauce"" and boldly flavorful minced sausage jacket masking the springy texture of the hardboiled (too long) eggs enough to ignore it. 

Not feeling like slaughtering yet another burger, I opted for the Salmon BLT, which triumphed once our waitress brought out a cup of the dill mayonnaise the kitchen forgot to apply to it. Served inside twin cuts of Italian toast was a grilled salmon filet so humid, savory, and weighty, I nearly consigned the B, the L, and the T to oblivion. The inclusion of fried egg was my choice and made the sandwich an even wealthier kingpin than it already was. Also selected by me was a side of onion straws, that while nearly too oily (methinks someone neglected to drain them on paper towels prior to service), had a crunchy, deconstructed onion ring facet to them that I found irresistible, especially when dunked in Heinz ketchup. Heck, along with onion petals, I always find these hard to pass on since they're just different and are uncommon on area menus. 

We almost skipped dessert due to the fulminating, discotheque environs but felt compelled to share a liberal helping of the Dark Chocolate Stout Bread Pudding and were remunerated with something that approached an igneous, fudgy monkey bread (love the stuff! look for it in your supermarket!) or a cinnamon roll made of nothing but the center filling.  

Turn down the noise, and I honestly would give R-towne a 5. The food is not at all lame.",2013-02-24 23:19:58

The spot, with an attractive mostly female wait staff, should surely be a hit in the Old Town Scottsdale area, and it's nice there's an affordable restaurant with quality food connected to the mall.

Today, my goal to discover all the goodies that this amazing area on Toronto has to offer took me to Wanda's for some much desired pie. Wanda's Pie is a somewhat big and confusing establishment. There's no clear menu or board, and lots of their baked goods are not even marked with names, so I found myself staring and drooling at a counter full of goodies and not really knowing what exactly I was drooling over. 

All the pies looked delicious, which made it hard to decide on which one to get. The bf got the Swiss Apple, and I chose a mini strawberry-rubharb tart because I wanted to control my dessert portion. Of course that totally went down the drain when a baking sheet full of freshly made peanut butter chocolate cheesecake cupcakes came out and I instantly blurted out: ""I'll have on of those too!!!"". So much for portion control. 

The apple pie was good. The pastry really should have been way more flaky, but the filling was really good. The strawberry-ruhbarb tart was delicious. Sweet, tart and buttery and the perfect 2-3 bites. Now, on to that decadent and ridiculously indulgent sounding cupcake: It was a disappointment. The filling was almost tasteless and so buttery that I felt like I was eating lard. It really wasn't too reminiscent of cheesecake, except for the graham cookie bottom. It was over sweet and indulgent just like the name suggested and I was unable to eat more than a couple of bites. 

Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Wanda's, but I'll be staying away from their cupcakes in the future.",2010-10-10 00:31:52

Their whole menu offers 7 distinctive beers, each with their characteristic flavor, and they do fill growlers.

I've always wanted to go fruit and veggie picking, but I never thought my first time would be in Vegas. It was a delightful surprise. I only wish I didn't decide to come here during the middle of Summer. 

The drive over here was a little confusing because there was another sign for a Gilcrease FARM that led us through a dirt road where we found two little boys selling vegetables and fruits on a small table. We asked them where the orchard was and they said we had to keep going down the main road. We turned around, went back onto the main road, and eventually found the orchard on the right side. 

The orchard is pretty big. It's everything you'd expect an orchard to look like. When you enter there are parking spaces on the right side. You also have the option of driving your car into the orchard (if you're lazy as f*ck, or if you just plan on getting many loads of veggies), but you have to pay a fee to do this. We just parked out car and entered the orchard.

There is a lady at a table when you just enter. She gives you some bags, a map, and lets you know which veggies/fruits are okay to pick at the time.

Since we didn't come here for anything specific except for a good time, we walked in and pretty much started picking everything in sight, which was kind of stupid. We soon realized that we needed to be a lot more selective after seeing that there were still at least 15 more rows to go down. 

We ended up with a couple giant squash (no idea why), some apples, an eggplant, a couple tomatoes, and zucchini. There was a lot more than that to choose from, but we just got too exhausted and our skin was burning.

 We walked down to the pay area, which also has piles of already picked fruits and veggies to buy and also the BEST apple cider you will ever try! Since we were all dying from the heat, we each bought the smallest apple cider and took it down in one gulp. That's when we realized it was DELICIOUS and ended up guying a gallon...EACH! It was just soo good, especially since it was ice cold. I believe we spent less than 20 bucks for everything, which was quite a deal.

I really like this place. I'd definitely come back, but not in the middle of summer and not without a ton of sunblock and water. If you don't mind driving, I suggest you try this place out, just for the experience, if not the apple cider.",2011-02-16 08:05:20

We were given samples of the food and drinks before our movie.
The Blue margarita was really good to me, it tasted sorta like blue raspberry kool aid mixed with a touch of lemonade. 
the pizza was really good, not sure which one it was (and i apologize for the blurry pictures on the menu but for some reason certain pages would not take a clear picture- but I took the pictures so you could see the prices). the pizza had ham and mushrooms and a few other toppings. and was so good! crust not to thick. very even throughout each bite with ratio to toppings and crust.
bacon wrapped scallops, have a feeling they were previously frozen- but that does not bother me since Charlotte is not a coastal city it would be expensive to get fresh each day. Any-who they were delicious
coconut chicken- i was shocked how good this was since I ate it before I knew what it was- I am NOT a fan of coconut at all. 
Theater is large and with an amazing screen. Very modern with large comfy seats that have arm rest, cup holder, table and the seats lean back a little and they ROCK. you feel like you are sitting in a large recliner. you also have a service button in case you need to call your server. 

now for the hard part of this review. I understand they are new and still in training of how to do things but this is where the 1 star fell off. it took a long time for them to come take the order and the movie had started. She took our entree, drink and dessert order all at once. And this happened to lots of others as well. This is a kink that needs fixing. Others received their food way before us and it was someone different who brought the food and brought all of it at the same time. NOW all you have is this small college type table (you know the little table in a college classroom) so I had to send the dessert back since I had no place to put it. 
shortly after our food came our bill- Why? what if we were going to order additional items? this made no sense, and actually i did have to order my wine later. 
They never came back to refill my water or check if everything was correct. Another kink. 
the food though was again super! I had the ribs with fries and added a side of cheese (the cheese I received was something like Velveeta melted down with red peppers and green Chile peppers at a pot luck dinner appetizer) it was good but hard to manage. The ribs were tender and smoky, lightly sauced with a sweet/smoky sauce. They send you 6 individual ribs with a Good bit of meat on them. The fries came out hot and crispy, these are the seasoned shoestring type fries. 
The dessert was huge- as you can tell by the picture- and definitely made for sharing. the chocolate frosting is VERY rich. So if you are a chocolate lover this is for YOU.
At the end there was a lot of confusion with the servers and checks. Some servers were still bringing out desserts after people had left. Some waiting on there checks etc. 
The servers were doing their best- but just were not equipped to handle such a large group. A few suggestions is to take orders before the movie, have servers that are assigned to certain areas so that there is less communication errors. once food is served have the server come back to inquire if drinks need refilling or if the entree is as requested. Again come back to remove any dishes and ask for dessert/drink order then. Once dessert is served present the check at the same time and then return a little later to remove dishes and check. 
Other than the few kinks in service that need tweaking this was a great night. I love the concept and hope to return soon",2013-03-21 16:17:21

I run a university alumni group and we have been going here to watch all of our football games this season.  This mean, every Saturday, 15-30 people show up and bring them business, stay for 3-4 hours, spend money on food and drinks, and we take care of our waitress who usually is Megan (she's awesome, PS).  However, Zipps is unwilling to reserve us any sort of area, give us any sort of drink or food specials and as of last night, they wouldn't even put our game on one of the 20 televisions in the entire bar area until the UofA game was over.  When I asked to talk to the manager, Jeremy, he copped a SERIOUS attitude with me.  He told me they have been more than accommodating to our group and we don't appreciate anything they have done.  He said he would turn our game on once the others were done.  Well, Jeremy and Zipps management/owners, by me having to arrive at your establishment at least two hours early to ensure we have a spot, your staff telling me I cannot sit at a table unless I have a minimum number of people with me, me paying the same price as everyone else for everything on your menu, and then as of last night having your server put our entire group's tab on one person's credit card and telling us we have to wait to watch our game when there are 10+ alumni sitting there waiting; if you think that is ACCOMODATING, you are DELUSIONAL.  

Last night was the last straw in putting up with their awful attitudes and service.  Ten minutes into the game, when they finally did put it on the TV, we had already paid our tab and gone next door to O'Clancy's where they had no problem giving us three big tables, drink specials and our game (did I mention it was the home team, ASU game?) on three big screens.  We will be moving our groups' viewing parties to another sports bar from this point forward.  In case you forgot, Zipps, sports bars are a dime a dozen and yours isn't worth ten cents.

I know Zipps' owners have recently fired much of their staff and hired all new management and servers at their Kierland location, I think it is time you reevaluate who you have working for you at your Camelback location.  And, incase you deal with other alumni groups in the future, the two bars I have talked to since last night have been more than willing to reserve an area for us, give our group food and drink specials during our games, and always promise to show our games.  Remember, Zipps and Jeremy, football season may be half way over, but basketball season is just around the corner, and....our team is good, so we like to watch them.  That is 26 games that we will be watching from December to March, not to mention every Saturday from now until December 4 for football.  Man, sucks for you.  I guess your loss is someone else's gain.

Oh, and by the way, I'm a server and have been for almost ten years, so I know what accommodating is, and you are not it.",2010-10-11 00:42:25

What's important to me is cold beer, and good happy hour food at a fair price.. plus great service. I got all of these things.

So far I've only tried one food item, it was great! Not something you can get just anywhere. Try the Street Corn! Especially during happy hour. 2 whole ears of corn for $5.00! The taste, the spices, a true treat.

It seemed much later in the day already to me. So I Called Rosatis around  9:45am, and ordered  a deep dish pizza, a thin crust pepperoni and the dough knots.  The deep dish was for me, but I figured I go ahead and get a couple of things to have when the kids got home from school.  The guy who answered the phone, took my order and told me it would be ready in about 35 minutes.  I already knew  that because I order from here all the time.  The Deep dish takes about 35 minutes to cook... That's why I was calling ahead... So, he tells me 35 minutes and I hang up... I get there about 30 minutes later, the pizza isn't quite done, but I knew I was a few minutes early, so I sat in the waiting area for a few minutes.  It's approx 10:25am, When I get there, there's only one guy working in the back, he was preparing a pizza, so I said hello so he would know I was there... There was no one else there when I got there.  After I had been sitting there for a few minutes , another employee comes in and clocks in, then another.   They turn the lights on. I hadn't realized the main lights weren't even on when I arrived.  ANYWAY, I asked the girl if they were open, because it sorta dawned on me that it was early and I just put the pieces of the puzzle together.  She said that the website says they open at 10:30, but the restaurant opens  at 11am...

So the IMPORTANCE of my review is this;   I called in my order at 9:45am.  (They open at 11am) The guy didn't say we are not open, he took my order.  When I got there, no one blocked the door so I couldn't enter, I was allowed in the store. My order was HOT and ready, with a smile at 10:40, (20 minutes before they even open, and with a pizza that takes 35 Minutes to cook) AND  he guy offered me an apology  because I had to wait for the five
Minutes that I waited....   NOT TO MENTION, The pizza looks and smells incredible..... That is wonderful customer service... I'm also posting a photo of my order so you can drool over it while I eat it.",2016-10-15 01:56:38
266Z1cM9i2iMTj1n-Us85A,JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,5,13,6,10,"Why do people still go to Ichiza when they can come here instead? 
This place is four times bigger than Ichiza, so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for a seat.  The menu isn't written in Kanji on the back of pieces of cereal boxes and scotch taped all over the walls. The seats are padded and comfortable unlike Ichiza who has wooden benches for chairs. This place doesn't smell like a public restroom like Ichiza does. And best of all, you don't have a psycho old man working here. Why not come to SHUSEKI instead?

I walked by here and saw a sign that read Rauman instead of Ramen. It could have been a spelling error, or it could have meant that this place serves Yokohama style Rauman(a Chinese influenced variation which no other place in Las Vegas has).  I decided to gamble and walked in. I looked at the menu, and noticed that it literally had over 200 items on it.  I immediately noticed that they had Tan Tan Men. That's an extremely rare Chinese dish which is unrealistically popular in Japan! I've been to every famous Ramen house on the Westcoast, and there might have been only about 8-10 restaurants that serves authentic style Tan Tan Men. So the fact they had it here is a big deal for me! 

I decided to order the Tan Tan Men, Miso Rauman, and Karage Chicken. You might think that's a lot of food for one person, but because my body fat is less than 4% and I run anywhere from 8-15 miles a day, my body literally never gets full. 

When the Miso Rauman came, I couldn't believe how big the bowl was. I thought Anime Ramen had gigantic portions, but this place was actually maybe 20% larger than Anime's bowl which is already double the size of Monta and Sora.  Yes, this is a gigantic bowl of Ramen!!  I immediately tasted the broth and I couldn't believe it. Yes, it really is a Yokohama Style Rauman. FINALLY! Finally, they have Yokohama style Ramen in Las Vegas. They got a Sapporo style(Sora), a Tokyo style(Monta), and a fusion style(Anime), and now finally a Yokohama style. Ironically, Shin-Yokohama is the city where they have the world famous Ramen Museum. I heard it's like being in a chocolate factory, but with Ramen instead.  

They use rib meat for charsiu here. Why hasn't anyone else ever thought of that? I still think that Sora and most Sapporo style Ramen houses have the best tasting charsiu, but the uniqueness of using rib meat made this Ramen very enjoyable. Off course Monta has the worst charsiu, they cook it ahead of time, keep it cold in a refrigerator, then while it's still cold they just drop it into your Ramen and serve. SHUSEKI, Sora, Anime, and Yagyu all have far superior charsiu to the overrated Monta. 

The Ramen also comes with egg, corn, large portions of bamboo, bean sprouts, ground pork, shredded onions, and extremely straight noodles. Yokohama Chinatown Dan Dan noodles are always straight and so pure white that they are almost transparent. 

The Tan Tan Men was just as good as what I used to get at the restaurants that were operated by ethnically Chinese residents of Japan.  Of course it could never compare to the extra thick Tan Tan Men of Chin Ma-Ya in Little Toyko, but it was still the best thing on the menu and of course the best Tan Tan Men in LV.  Also, remember that Yokohama has possibly the largest Chinatown in Japan. So the vast majority of Yokohama Ramen-Yas are going to be Chinese variations. 

The honey toast here is far better than Ichiza's and it's actually taller and they give more ice cream. It's only like 6 bucks too!

The Karage Chicken was perfect.  It came plain with no dipping sauce. They use dark meat, and give you a slice of lemon. The meat was very juicy and tender. 

You know, everyone always says that Monta is the best Ramen house in Las Vegas, and Monta has these fanatic fan boys that give 1-star ratings to all of the competing Ramen houses. Last time I was at Monta, I overheard a boyfriend and girlfriend talking about how they never ate at Anime Ramen but gave the place 1-star, and made up a fake review all because it was Monta's rival. So, Monta does have a psychotic fanbase. But, let me tell you: Monta is far from having the best Ramen in LV. Places like Yagyu, Anime, Sora, and even SHUSEKI have a far superior style of Ramen.   

While I was leaving, I spoke with one of the owners who is an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in the Tokyo area. He informed me that he ran a restaurant in Japan for over 15 years before coming to Las Vegas. We Las Vegas Ramen fans are very privileged to have a restaurant in town that serves the cuisine of the Chinese immigrants of Japan. These places are very hard to come by. BTW, he also said he might start serving a variation of jajangmyeon in the future.

I had remembered it mentioned that there was a Starbucks at Macy's and I decided to give it a try.

The outlet is on the southwest corner of Macy's in Downtown Summerlin.  There is a metal gate that blocks people from arriving/leaving Starbucks via Macy's unless the store is open.  There is a door on the outside sidewalk that bypasses the store and allows access to Starbucks.

Since it was early, I got a spot to park on the street.  Since it's so close to the garage, there are only a few spaces near the corner but I snagged one of them and walked to Starbucks.

The baristas were pleasant and made my drink quickly.  It was also a very quiet place with only a few customers.  It's a small outlet owned by Starbucks and operated by employees of Macy's.  

This certainly will be an option when I'm in Downtown Summerlin.  There was no up pricing as there is at the two locations in Red Rock Casino.  That's good!",2014-11-13 22:50:34

We quickly looked over the menus that were outside before we went in.  Since it was a Sat, they had brunch until 4 pm.  We were seated at a table and given all the menus except the brunch menu.  After a few minutes, the employee returned and I asked if we could have the brunch menu which we saw outside.  He seemed annoyed, but returned with a couple brunch menus.  

We were not ""served"" by the regular wait staff.  This was either the owner or manager.  He did not have on the same uniform as everyone else.  After several minutes, he came back to take our orders.  Two of us ordered french toast, the other two decided to split a pizza.  The server then asked if they would like a ""side salad"" to share.  They agreed.  I ordered a cappucino in addition to my french toast. 

The food came out relatively quickly.  The french toast was excellent and from what I could tell, my friends really enjoyed the pizza.  The server did not return at all during the rest of our stay.  My friends were out of water and noone ever came back to refill.  We finally flagged down our server for the check.

Once the check came, we all were shocked!!  My cappucino was $6!  That was a $1 less than my entire meal!

The two friends that split a pizza, realized that they were charged $12 for what they thought was supposed to be the $4.95 side salad from the menu.  

My friend did address the issue with the cost of the salad with the server who then proceeded to ask, ""well did you eat the entire salad?""  

After some conversing, they agreed to reduce the price to the $4.95.  We were just digusted with the overall lack of service. and even though the food was tasty-- it was completely overpriced for what you actually got.

Vanilla Crepe Cake and coffee were ok, and it's a nice little coffee house.  That's where it starts and stops.

Over-priced for food where no baking is done on premises.

There's a string of these Asian Coffee/Tea dessert places that are grossly overpriced.  

Crown Bakery, Sweets Raku, Baguette Cafe, Rosallie: just a few places where they actually make their food on premises and charge accordingly.  In fact, less expensive in some cases plus higher quality.

It's loud, so be prepared speak up when chatting with your friends. The acoustics in a beautiful old church will do that - but dining in such a unique environment is worth it. 

If you visit you'll notice that the confessional booths have been repurposed, as is the pulpit - which now houses brewing equipment. 

The menu is always changing - there are staples of course, but it seems like every time I visit the chef has found a new spin to put on an old favorite. Make sure you ask what the ""Untraditional Pierogi"" is. I've had a few, and I was lucky enough to visit when they had rattle snake pierogis (which were delicious). 

Another little known secret is the espresso bar - so if you happen to prefer coffee over beer, grab a shot of espresso! It comes garnished with a little bit of spiralized lemon peel. I'd never had espresso this way, but adding the lemon peel to the espresso was delightful and really brought out some different notes in the espresso that I hadn't tasted before. I definitely will try it this way again! 

The pepperoni rolls are also good if you're looking for bar food, as is the Buffalo burger.

I went with the spicy chicken wrap; spicy marinated and grilled chicken, brown rice, mixed beans, tomatoes, squash, zucchini, cauliflower, broccoli, bell peppers and onions. It was a bit late to be eating dinner, so I decided to sub out the pita and asked them to wrap it in lavash instead. What a creation?! The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the veggies were cooked but not mushy, the beans and rice added depth and gave the whole thing texture, and the lavash was crisped to perfection but not burnt. The thing had me swinging on a vine!

As long as it's cheesy and bready I am usually OK. We discovered last night that Papa John's actually delivered to our place, even though they are over on Ft Apache, so I thought we would give them a try.

I should point out here that up until last night I had never sampled a Papa John's pizza, however I have often heard them compared favourably to Pizza Hut or Dominoes.

I ordered a Ham and Pineapple pizza and a serve of wings with ranch dip and garlic dip. The pizza arrived more promptly than the 65 minute estimate and the driver was friendly enough.

When I opened my pizza box I was greeted with the sight of something that looked like it had come straight out from under a heat lamp at a food court. Upon eating a slice it turned out to be fresher than it looked, but it was a bit greasy and the sauce was overly sweet and unusual on a pizza outside of the frozen section at a supermarket. The pineapple on my pizza really didn't work well with the already very sweet sauce. I ate a couple of slices and consigned the rest to the fridge for more desperate times. I found myself eating for the sake of eating.

Next I moved on to my wings. I think they were honey chipotle or something very similar. They tasted pretty decent but were extremely gloopy and difficult to eat. They could have done with about 70% less sauce. The garlic dip in particular was a bizarre concoction. It looked like clear, melted butter and tasted weird. Probably not meant for wings, but I'm not sure what it would go with.

Sadly, I think Papa John's is going to have to be given the big miss in future. Of the low-end pizza chains I would have to say that it is easily my least favourite.",2012-01-08 21:19:24

Look, I admit some of the food here is excellent. Key word is the word ""some""; in order for me to up it to 4 stars, a majority of the food has to be excellent. I expect the set dinners to have the best of what restaurants have to offer, however I did not feel like I received ""blow-your-mind-away"" style of food despite the reviews here.

In fact, I was a regular at Maple Yip 7-8 years back. In fact I was a regular when this place used to be called Midtown Seafood Restaurant before Maple took over. I stopped visiting here when I moved to Markham and was accustomed to the higher quality Chinese restaurants up there. One of my relatives decided to ask me to return here tonight just to check on how the food quality has been since we left.

We ordered the set dinner which consisted of a crab soup with fish maw, half of a free range chicken, general tao pork ribs, bok choy with oyster mushrooms, lobster, and steamed fish. To return to our tradition roots, we also ordered a chilled chicken feet as an appetizer.

The chilled chicken feet is still one of the best appetizers you can order in this restaurant. There's largely no chemicals added and the colours are natural. The crab soup was also excellent, and not that heavy on MSG/salt/all  that like. The bok choy with oyster mushrooms was great as well, as well as the free range chicken. However, the other three dishes were disappointing; the pork ribs had more bones than meat, the lobster had more shell than meat, and the steamed fish was too small for 4 people. The dessert at the end was good, as always the last few times I visited.

People may say I ordered the wrong items, which isn't entirely wrong. However for the set dinners I expect at least 80% of the food to be good, which wasn't the case tonight. I gave it 3 stars cause the food that was good was really good, so if you stick with their specialties you'll definitely have a great time here.

Oh, and reserve beforehand, especially if it's after 6:30. You'll regret it if you don't, especially on a weekend.",2015-03-08 01:38:05

There are two pianos and three or more players... so they alternate and take brakes to keep you entertained.

I'm definitely not cool enough for a nightlife review, but the daytime trip was not bad.  There was a bit of confusion about how to server us and we ended up initially ordering at the bar and carrying our drinks up, only to be served food and have our tab moved to the roof later.  The location was quiet, not too crowded (but definitely not dead), and had some struggling but diverse plant life.  Can't attribute the weather to the location, but it was a superb Carolina Blue sky without a cloud in sight and a good temp even without a breeze.  Again, no guarantees you'll get the same treatment.  ;)

The beer selection was not bad and I was able to get a sweet enough cider (with a cute little snifter growler tasting to ensure I would like it beforehand) to hang out with the beer-folks for a bit longer.  The food was surprisingly good.  The sliders came on mini-brioche-like buns which were perfectly toasted.  The burgers themselves were good except for these too-large pepper grains scattered throughout.  I'm sensitive to certain peppers, but my appetizer companion agreed that he felt and tasted the chunks and they were just slightly jarring.  Not horrible, but not a well-mixed or complimentary seasoning either.

For being open on a Sunday, it was a nice place.  I liked the variety of appetizers and would definitely return if I was interested in munching but not cooking.  I'm not sure how big the full-sized burgers were but other guests came and left more quickly than we did so perhaps not great for full meal lounging?  Let me know if you know otherwise!",2017-08-18 16:50:05

It sits next to the Pho place, they are basically the same place with a different host desk.  Same table areas and I'm sure the food comes out of the same kitchen.  My husband and I entered through the coffee shop entrance and even though they were semi-busy it was still a wait to get a table.  There were at least half a dozen empty tables waiting to be cleared.  The hostess looked upset and kept coming to apologize for our wait, as a huge line began to form behind us.  I mean show some initiative and grab a bucket instead of freaking out about it.  

We were seated at a table next to the service entrance which was annoying, but at least our waitress couldn't duck and hide.  I asked if we could order off the Pho menu.  I only wanted some spring rolls, no weird shaped spoons, tiny bowls or fancy condiments required.  I was told they could not accommodate my request.  We both ordered ""The biggest burger on the strip"" which I'm sure it's not.  Ten ounces the menu claims, I doubt it, but whatever it was edible.  

The bill came with our order, no upsales there.  I did order a soda when my meal came and it must have been too much of a choir to re-do the bill, so I got my beverage for free.  Not once were we checked on during our lunch, but we got a re-fill when the waitress brought back the reciept to sign.  Not that we really needed it, we were done.  Not bad if your staying at the hotel I suppose, a bit over-priced.  Just remember if you want pho or any asian food you better damn well enter at the pho side or your sh*t outta luck.",2009-05-27 03:22:25

Sadly dinner is all al la carte. 

Spicy Minced Pork Bibimbap ($9.99) with braised fatty pork belly served in this sizzling hot pot. It is not spicy at all but if you want some heat, Korean hot pepper paste could be added. 

Matsuya Special Steamed Chicken with Rice ($10.99) which is basically Hainanese chicken. It was just ok. Though the leaner free range chicken is used.

Price point is a little higher and the menu is quite different from their Scarborough location.

We were there Wednesday night for a bite and drinks with friends. We sat inside as it was very busy and we took what we could get, but it was probably better given how hot and muggy it was outside. Downside of eating in is that it's very loud in there but they were playing the Jays game so the place was packed - not the place for an intimate date or group dinner. 
They get 4/5 stars because the beer was cheap! Drink specials every night and Wednesday's were $4 14oz Steamwhistle. I also had 2 fish tacos, I had done my Yelp research and you didn't let me down. They were awesome! Competes with Grand Electric, a nice portion of fish, some kind of crema, and a lot of finely shredded cabbage - my favourite part. Topped with pico and cilantro, hot sauce on the side. I could have had two more! 

Ended the meal by sharing s'mores churros. They were pretty delicious, must be eaten right away. I'm not a huge sweet fan but for $5 it was a nice portion to share!

It was packed, like sardines in a can packed!  This restaurant is on the end of the strip, across  from Circus Circus so I was surprised to see how popular it was!  

For Sunday Brunch, our estimated wait time was 45 minutes but they said it could be longer.  You can wait in their Fireside Lounge where you can order drinks or if there is space, play a few slot games in the front.

After waiting close to 45 minutes & our names not anywhere close to being called, we overheard someone say that the bar served the full menu & is open seating!  What!  So we ran on over & immediately got served.

Met some great people, saw some outstanding golf and overall was very impressed with the players on this professional golf tour. I also got to have several lunches at Reds. I was equally impressed with the food and the service at Reds. The atmosphere is very ""country clubish"" loads of golfers celebrating after their round with friends. Well, not all celebrating, some of them crying in their beer.  But, it was clear that the drinks were flowing, the food was being devoured and the volume was spirited. There is a large outdoor area, so you have you choice of the bar area, a more removed area (for small to medium groups), general restaurant area and the outdoor patio area. So, take your pick.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken Wrap with sweet potato fries. It was very good, all the right tastes wrapped up nicely. The next day I had the Arizona burger. A giant burger with guacamole, peppers, caramelized onions, cheese and few other things. Honestly, it was one of the first burgers I could not get my mouth around, I had to take it apart and eat the parts separately.  Not that this was in any way bad, it was just a giant burger with so much on it that for me it was impossible to hold and eat. The menu is not large, which is good, but from what I had and from what I could see the other patrons wolfing down, the menu seems solidly excellent.

Many things I really liked a lot from and about Mayuri Buffet so I will start with those things first.

Of course I couldn't try everything but by a landslide to me the best dishes were the vegan dishes and this would have been a solid four star review if I only tried the vegan dishes. The dishes were all different but the one thing they all had in common were that they were WILDLY FLAVORFUL and VERY SPICY. Some of the names of the dishes were Pongal, Kosthu, Dal Fry, and  Butter Masala.

Out of the meat dishes I tried the Chilli Chicken was moist and very flavorful and good.

Durring my stay ""Butlered"" Naan bread was served and latter a crisp kind of crepe stuffed with a seasoned potato and pepper filling and latter yet a lacy sort crepe wrap.

The things I didn't care for.

Three other chicken dishes I tried had very dry non developed with flavor chicken. They were the Tandori, Biryani, and Masala. I also tried the Cod Curry. I couldn't eat that one either because the fish had that like purchased from Fry's or Safeway taste. It wasn't bad but it was that non fresh taste. But I DO NOTE fish from almost any buffet anywhere usually isn't good. 

My husband only took meat dishes and didn't care for them and disliked the goat most because of the meats dryness. 

They had many deserts but I narrowed it down to three to try. I didn't care for any of them. The worst one was the one that resembled a donut hole. It was fresh made of lumpy thick raw batter and was horrible. Another resembled a funnel cake but also had this raw texture. The carrot halwa was so sweet I thought my teeth would fall out. That was  almost good.

Service was clunky. They poured us water but didn't ask us if we wanted beverages till we were almost done. We also didn't receive the naan bread until we were half way done.

The pavement outside is uneven in one spot and IS HAZARDOUS.

Buffets do differ from day to day and hour to hour maybe some days they could be better.

3.5 stars I would go back because the vegan dishes were very  tasty.

Slight update*****************5-23-16

Buffet is about half the size from last time and offers around ten dishes. Chicken has improved from last time .....pretty good but few choices. I thought the Kadai Bhindi Masala was very tasty.",2013-07-15 12:32:16

The meat on that Steakhouse is just unparalleled. These were my staples until I tried the Rising Sun, which was the best burger I've had in my life. The Oreo shake is good. They have really good sweet potato fries and onion rings. Good for a kid-friendly place on the strip. Good service. Also, you never have to wait too long.
If you're debating between BurGR and Holstein's, BurGR has much longer waits, not as good service, and it's harder to get to (if you drive your car). The burgers are comparable with a little more refinement going to BurGR. However, BurGR has better fries (truffle) and shakes - OMG BurGR has good shakes, really more like dessert.
If you want a quick bite or have kids, Holstein's is your best bet.",2014-05-08 21:32:10

I decided to go with angel hair pasta with salmon.  The angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft, not too hard.  The salmon was a a tad bit more cooked than I would have liked, but because there was a nice scampi butter sauce, it was still delicious.

The restaurant is pretty big imo unlike other ramen places lol pretty spacious. They have solo tables that face the wall, much like a lot of ramen places in Japan. 

I ordered the dipping ramen dish, where all the ingredients are separated from the soup. The soup is super condensed, Brothy and flavourful, so using a little bit can already be a bit overwhelming. Just dip your noodles for a bit for a huge splash of flavour! You can really taste the flavour of the broth, it's super rich. The egg was great, still runny and has a sweet flavour. 
The best part is the noodle though.. Omg so chewy and thick! Not a bad chewy but it has got a really really good bouncy texture, it tastes good even when it's cold and not in the soup lol. They give two pieces of meat like every other place, and unfortunately it's a really thin (like less than 1cm). 

We also ordered the edamame, they put some sort of miso soya sauce in place of salt which makes it have a really good aroma and taste. But it's extremely salty.. After the fifth one I can feel my tongue getting irritated from the high amount of sodium. 

The karaage was good but wasn't mjnd blowing, the batter is a little light but the seasoning was on point with mayo and lemon on the side. They give you four medium sized pieces for $4.9

For dessert we ordered the Mochi ice cream in green tea and black sesame. I never had Mochi ice cream and so when I had this I wasn't really blown awAy. It's literally Mochi texture wrapped around ice cream lol I don't know what I was expecting, it sounded amazing. It's fun to try and a pain to take split pieces apart.",2016-05-19 13:28:37

The New York dog is missing something, but I can't figure it out yet.

As they don't triage their orders (i.e. people not ordering bbt could just get their piece of chicken and then take off), instead they deal with one order at a time, with one cashier, and it looks like one person making bbt.

Secondly, the fish shrunk. It seemed like everything was cut in half.  
The quality of fish was still great but I can't compare them to the first time I went there because not all the fish were the same.  However, I believe the salmon roe and eel's quality were the same both times.  But just the 2nd time around they shrunk.

Chock full of cool things to do, from a little farm / barns scene with real things to play with, to a bank setup where they have that cool vacuum tube thing from a real bank to play with.  My kids especially enjoyed the water table (aprons provided), puppet shows and the grocery store (with actual cash registers).

I especially enjoyed the fact that they have staff walking around constantly picking up the props and making sure everything was neat and orderly so that the kids have maximum fun.

Before moving from the Highland Creek area to South Charlotte, all of my TJ shopping was done at the Mallard Creek store. I only went early in the morning to avoid the crowds and the lines. Last Friday afternoon, I decided to swing by this store for the first time. After circling the parking lot a few times, I almost gave up. I'm not a lazy individual- only determined to get one of the close spots right by the door of any establishment. Even the opposite side of the lot by the CVS and other stores was completely filled. On my way out of the lot, I saw a sign for more parking in the back. Finally! 

Inside, the place was slammed. I cursed myself for procrastinating on getting groceries earlier in the week. There are many more items for sale here than I've ever seen at the other Trader Joe's in the north part of the city. After grabbing my bacon cheddar cheese block, my striped lobster ravioli, French vanilla ice cream, some Alkaline water and a few other essentials while trying to stay out of the way of other shoppers, I made it to the counter.

I asked the cashier if this is a typical Friday. He told me it's a typical everyday! Great store- but I refuse to return unless it's at 8am, as the doors open.

Upon walking into the theater, you feel like you're transported to another world. The theme of KA is fire, and as soon as you set your sights on the stage you see, and if you're sitting close enough, feel it. Large fireballs rise from what appears to be a bottomless stage area, creating a sense of excitement and curiosity. 

The show displays the theme of fire through out it. The way the songs for this show were composed, in my opinion, mimic the growth and expansion of a flame. They start off small but crescendo into much more, giving the listener different feelings as the song progresses. If you don't get what I mean, try listening to Love Dance, one of my personal favorite songs and performances during the show. 

The technical aspects of this show were absolutely magnificent. One of the things I found most interesting was the Sand Cliff deck. Not only can they move this stage around using hydraulics, but there are touch sensitive panels installed in the stage allowing it to track the movements each performer makes. That stage is truly a work of art. 

If you are in Vegas and looking for a show to watch, definitely give KA a chance. If you are a lover of music, art, or technology this show will be very pleasing to your ears and eyes.",2012-12-05 22:48:46

They bring you salad, miso soup, steamed edamame, spicy cabbage, little (soy?) beans in something of a bbq sauce, and a couple other things that I'm not entirely sure of, but they're darn tasty.

FULL STORY: Stopped by with some friends right before close one night.  The owners were out chatting and greeting folks even though it was late -- they seemed to know all the neighbors coming in and were in no hurry to shoo anyone out.  

Tried a few flavors -- they have some classics and some funky ones rotating through along with a couple vegan options.  Some were pretty mild (taro), and some were on the more sweet / strong side (almond) - definitely recommend tasting before you choose to find what you're into.

I personally loooved the black sesame flavor!  Look forward to coming back soon and trying more of their creations.  I wish you could see what's available each day on the site or something to know if your faves are in stock!

The sauce though was lacking a bit sweet but bland and the cheese was ehhh ok. Topping on the pizza was really good I'll give credit where it is due.  I kinda felt maybe the personal size pie was a little bit on the cheaper end of quality and that it's not what I would say is the standard here so I would have to give the place another run around to see if it hits the spot with a larger pie.

It wasn't the soup that turned us away, it was the response of the waiter and the subsequent poor service.  As soon as my husband paid and signed the receipt, the waiter rushed over and noted ""oh you didn't leave a tip, are you sure?""

That put me off...

It turned out to be a very good way to try the restaurant (and a lot less expensive than the official tasting menu offered). The Caesar salad to start. Excellent choice. The dressing was superb, a bit tangy and very flavorful. Then the meatball pizza. It is a flatbread (or verrrry thin crust). Good cheese. A strong second dish. The penne with meatballs came next.  The penne was served al dante, my fav. Really good red sauce. We finished with the lasagna. It turns out we saved the best for last. That had to be one of the best lasagna I have ever eaten.

So delicious and not overly rich. I wish I had some right now. For dinner I had the tortelli. It was in a butter sage sauce and this was amazing.

*I love The Cosmo (their parking spots green/red system, Estiatoro Milos restaurant, Art-o-mat machines, etc) but Marquee was mostly worthless the night I went.

On Fri/12 Apr I was with a group of total 8 people (3 women, 5 men) going to Marquee.
- That night it was special guest DJ Benny Benassi (did a great set but that doesn't compensate for Marquee's failings) and it was $50/man and $20/woman cover charge.  We had bottle service so we didn't have to pay cover.
- Group I was with got bottle service, 3-bottle minimum requirement.  For the 3-bottles Birthday Boy (who paid most of the tab; he was crazy generous because it was his 21st b-day) opted for 2 bottles of Ciroc and 1 bottle of regular Crown so the tab came out to $2,100.  We were expecting $1,500 but maybe that's only if we ordered the non-premium spirits.
- We arrived at the door about 12:30 am and so they put us in the ""Library,"" which was a lounge not a marquee club we were expecting to enjoy.  It played different music from the dance floor so in the Library we couldn't hear DJ Benassi's set.  The Library has a pool table and an older crowd, and to me was really boring.  Only good thing was the music wasn't as loud in the Library so it was easier to hold a conversation (eg with a girlfriend).
- Birthday Boy and most everyone in our group wanted to be on the main dance floor but the waitress was never able to move our table there.  I don't fault the waitress/staff for not being able to move us since we arrived after midnite, but sticking us in the Library should entail some perks/consolation (perhaps discounted bottle service, knocking off $200 or so off our $2,100 tab).  We wanted to party at Marquee Nightclub, not the Library lounge at Marquee.
- Making the most of the Library assignment, me and a buddy (the other 6 people were 3 couples so they weren't as concerned with finding eye candy) would walk down the stairs to the main dance floor a few times.
- It was so disappointing because: a) the bouncers at each entrance (about 5 of 'em) to the dance floor would not let me enter the dance floor (they only allowed people to exit the dance floor).  When I asked which way to the dance floor entrance no bouncer gave me an answer.  Really, I can't go to the dance floor in a nightclub? b) Between the main club area and the Library, it was about 2/3rd's male. 

Sausage fest + $2,100 for 3 bottles + dreary Library table = 1 Yelp star.

beautiful setting and the menu wasn't too overwhelming. the happy hour looked like a great deal, so maybe we'll head back for that. 

we only got shared plates because all the entree dishes were ridiculously overpriced. the fish of the day? cod. and 28 bucks for THAT? cod? thats just crazy....28 bucks for cod. if you want more people to eat organic and local, you gotta cut the cost. why on earth would a middle class family of four eat somewhere that serves organic and fresh but it costs a month salary when they can just go to freaking california pizza kitchen or cheese cake factory for half the price? 

anyway, so although we can luckily afford a few organic pleasures every now and then, i'll cook my own wild caught fish for a fraction of the cost. so all our shared plates were good...the tuna, the falafel, the ravioli, and the beet salad. but our server was so ""miss"". not that it was his fault, i don't know. he said it was the kitchen. in any case, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our first appetizer. they slowly came out on time after that. and then we indulged in the p-butter mousse and apple crisp and both were delectable. 

and as a show of gratitude, we were comp'd the dessert due to our long food wait! now that's good business in my book. so we'll probably go back and try the happy hour menu. don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and probably very healthy, just a wee on the pricey side for what you get.",2010-05-22 13:33:59

I went there first and waited for my friend. The waitress immediately greeted me and brought out my water right away. 

I ordered the tonkotsu shoyo ramen because I love the pork flavor while I prefer my food a little salty. The ramen came out really quickly, but that may have been because there was only one other table there. The ramen was super hot and actually burned my tongue. I do like the flavor of the broth. It's nice and has a pork flavor. I did not like the chashu that was on my ramen. It wasn't as soft and  didn't melt in my mouth like in other places. I loved the thick noodles, though.

There were a couple of things I didn't like about Pampas; first, someone from the restaurant offered to take a ""complimentary"" picture of us. We agreed and ten minutes later she came back out and gave us a small picture with a 10% off our next meal discount. That wasn't the bad part - she also brought out two larger pictures, one with a Vegas themed border and one without for a price...what is this!? I just wanted to eat at your restaurant, I didn't want to be sucked into a sales ploy...


Second, I ordered the salmon sandwich with ceasar salad and it was TERRIBLE. There was NO flavor, the bun was dripping with grease and the cheese was so thick I almost chocked on it. The ceasar salad did not taste like a ceasar salad at all! In fact the only thing I could taste was lettuce and the fake parmesan cheese that it was doused in. Not only that but an hour later I was feeling sick wondering if I was going to vomit or not. My husband had the steak sandwich and the steak was tough, there was NO flavor and again the cheese was incredibly thick.

3nuwqEyF4FTzIYCd72236w,qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,5,3,0,0,"Tableau offers American cuisine by chef Mark LoRusso. I've had dinner here once, lunch once, and breakfast four times.

The dinner menu offers a wide choice of New American cooking. I'd call it fancy but not flashy. Breakfast and lunch are much simpler, but with a few fancy touches.

The room is quiet and formal. Tables are widely spaced, with long white table cloths and a single orchid in a bud vase, and sprays of Phalaenopsis orchids decorate the room. Soft music plays in the background. Service is efficient and attentive. In general, service has been friendly and efficient. Sadly, my lunch at Tableau was an exception. When it was time for the check, my server disappeared. I waited and waited and waited, even looking for someone else to help, but with no success. I finally felt it necessary to go to the hostess, and ask what had happened. My server never returned; someone else brought the check.


** DINNER - TASTING MENU
The tasting menu is a good way to sample the best of what Tableau has to offer. I'm not much of a drinker, but decided to get the wine pairing as well.
* Prior to ordering, the chef sent out as an amuse bouche a small sample of cream of potato and chorizo soup. It was full of potato flavor, with a hint of chorizo.
* Osetra Caviar Trio. Each of the three items had a small amount of caviar on top: (1) a shot glass of potato soup, with creme fraiche on top, was thick and rich, served cold; good-very good; (2) traditional garnish of creme fraiche, chopped hard boiled egg and chopped onion, all in a china spoon; very good; (3) a scallop cooked on the medium side; very good.
* Crab Minestrone. A clear soup with zucchini, beans, and lots of crab. The soup had a lot of flavor, the zucchini was crunchy, the beans were firm, the crab was sweet and firm.
* Tasting of Foie Gras. A medium thick steak served on creamed corn. The foie gras was seared on the outside, and had a good flavor, but wasn't as good as at the top places in town.

This was this point at which I realized the generous wine pours were getting me drunk. I would drink only a fraction of each glass hereafter. However, it was too late. I would fall asleep several times. I think the server caught me once (""Sir? SIR?"").

* Pan Roasted Halibut. The fish was firm, cooked through but still moist. Outstanding flavor.
* Prime Filet. The steak was good, but nowhere near as good as at SW Steakhouse.
* Camembert. Nutty, bitter. I'm not a Camembert fan, so I rate it Fair.
* Selection of Desserts: (1) Roasted banana ice cream had a strong banana flavor; very good. (2) Vanilla pot de creme was like pudding, but so much better. (3) Chocolate souffl was not the best I've had, but was still very good.

Overall, a very good meal indeed. Beware the generous wine pours!


** LUNCH
My only lunch at Tableau was a Dungeness Crab Club Sandwich. In lots of little ways, it was executed very well. The sourdough bread - all three layers - was nicely toasted and had very good flavor. It was firm enough to hold up as a triple decker sandwich, but still soft enough to be easily bitten through. The crab meat was plentiful and tasty. In addition, there were avocado slices, sprouts, sun dried tomatoes, and bacon. Somehow or other, I was able to eat this sandwich without having the contents spill out all over the place. Spiced French fries were served on the side, and were pretty good. Well done!


** BREAKFAST
My breakfasts were:
* Banana French Toast, made with raisin brioche and a layer of mashed bananas. The french toast was very good - crispy on the outside, soft inside. However, I thought the banana flavor was too strong, overpowering the rest. Chicken and apple sausage was surprisingly good.
* Banana Ricotta Pancakes with Walnut Honey Butter. They were light to medium in texture, with a moderate banana flavor. They were pretty good, but not special.
* Poached eggs and duck hash. This was actually part of the weekend brunch menu, but I ate early. The dish consisted of 2 poached eggs on top of a hash of shredded, slightly crisp duck meat, and fried finely diced potatoes. It was delicious.
* Kobe short ribs and eggs. Two very attractive stacks, each consisting of: a round, thick, fried potato cake, greasy but good; shredded braised short ribs (very good flavor); gently cooked scrambled egg; a small amount of tangy barnaise sauce. It's very, very rich, but excellent. My favorite breakfast at Tableau.



When I first ate dinner at Tableau, I knew I had just had a very good meal. The food wasn't flashy, but it was very good. Lunch was also very good. Breakfast was a harder sell. I think that part of the problem is that I'm very pedestrian in my tastes with respect to pancakes, French toast, and the like: keep 'em plain, just butter and a little syrup. I had a similar reaction to the highly praised French toast at Bouchon. As long as I stay away from sweet starchy breakfasts, I've been very happy with Tableau.",2007-06-23 00:49:02

Temptation may give in as you eagerly dig into your meals. Pace yourself or you'll be stuffed as your fork hits the bottom of that plate. 

Trust me, in your lifetime everyone should try a Gulab jamun. In laymen's terms that would be a little ball of dough. Two of these ping pong sized balls come in a container. You won't want to share. I mean, the civil thing would be to share. But really, once your spoon touches the sweet cardamom syrup that's involved. Mmm...I don't think so. A moment on the lips a memory forever.

Moving on. Just remember to leave room for dessert. There are other sweets available up front to choose from, I'll report back next time. (Gosh darn it. They've got me.)

Zipping into the nondescript shopping center we studied the menu upfront. We seated ourselves in the dining area, which is a no-frills kind of place. (There's a TV if anyone really, really needs that.) Our server was quick to take our order and our food was out lickity split.

Spicy means hot! (If you opt for spicy be prepared.) The Chicken Tikka Masala was divine with copious amounts of chicken. Served with four large artistically cut pieces of naan leftovers abound.  The Kabli Pulao really does come with a foot long serving of a beef shish kabob.  (The beef has been shredded and molded into this arc of a shape.) The rice was airy and well balanced with raisins and shredded carrots.The accompanying chatni sauce was a delightful surprise on top of all the goodness involved.

It's a sizeable restaurant, with an area dedicated to takeout food called Foodie express. There's also a Presotea inside, which you can order for takeout or dine in. Having just been in China a few months ago, I was excited to try some classic street foods, but I was just disappointed with the overall taste and quality of the dishes. 

They lay cheap plastic overlays on their tables which is about the most authentic Chinese component in this establishment. 

The restaurant has a loyalty program, which is a smart marketing move, in which members get discounts on menu items (usually $1-2 off) as well as daily specials, which is 50% off on a specific dish  each day of the week. Membership costs $30 per year. The membership card also acts as a gift card, so you can choose to load a minimum of $300 on the card, in which case they waive the $30 membership fee or you can load $500 and they'll waive the fee and also give you an additional $40 bonus. I personally wouldn't opt for this program because I would never come back to this place, but it's definitely convenient if you come here often!

Service here is quite terrible, which is to be expected from many Chinese restaurants. Servers don't speak English as most of the clientele speak in mandarin anyway. Although my only complaint was that certain dishes came out after we already finished the first couple of dishes we received. I did hear other tables complaining about it getting certain dishes altogether.

This was about the 4th time I had to spend over $500 on repairs in 6 months, so I got a second opinion. My water pump was not cracked, the coolant was just low! If it were cracked, there would be a pink line according to a certified mechanic of my cars make (that I will not be naming.) Also, the mechanic told me while they were replacing the serpentine belt they should've seen my water pump was cracked and charged less for labor if I could pay for the part while they were already under the hood.

tx3mKGlvclU1Ro75ensWpw,nvHJFFr5R74ug5NOh2VDPg,GzAs1oSFEjgnVS5HwrYKTw,5,3,0,2,"When I think of local beer or have to list off a few of Charlotte's largest and most notable breweries, NoDa Brewing always makes it towards the top of my list. In addition to some creative brews and a few of my seasonal staples, the new tap house bring more reason to cheers local beer.

First off, lets start with the beer. I have a few favorites here that are on opposite ends of the flavor spectrum. Two year round brews are the Coco Loco and the Hop Drop and Roll. The Coco Loco is a smooth porter with hints of chocolate and coconut and my favorite for the winter. The Hop Drop and Roll is a knock-your-socks-off IPA that I gravitate towards in spring and summer. Also if in season, try the Gordgeous pumpkin ale. It's a good reason to look forward to fall. They also do an imperial version that releases in the winter that is fantastic. Overall, you can't go wrong here as they have a wide range of brews that should appease everyone in your group.

Next we will look at their taproom. I've been the victim of a few mix-ups now that they have 2 tap rooms. Note that their new flagship is on N. Tryon, while their original taproom (which is still open) is on Davidson. I recommend going to the larger facility (on N. Tryon) as it is newer, has more parking, and more seating. I hope they can eventually get to the level where both taprooms feature different beers and feels (kind of like Wicked Weed and the Funkatorium in Asheville), but Rome wasn't built in a day. At the end of the day, a taproom is a taproom, but the new space has some cool features. My favorite is the outside fire pits combined with the beach chairs. It's a great space to chill and chat with friends. I also recommend doing a free beer tour as these guys know their stuff.

Want to bring some of their beer home with you? No problem, as they sell four packs of their most popular beers. Another fun fact is they are one of the very few Charlotte breweries who sell kegs to individuals. Great for me as it allowed me to fill my kegerator when I'm not brewing. The deposit will be higher than the large chain stores, but I like the idea of supporting local breweries at the grassroots level. 

If you are a beer fan and haven't stopped in, I recommend giving it a try. It will be interesting to see what NoDa does at they approach their self-distribution limit. I hope they find a creative way to keep growing and don't lose their entrepreneurial spirit when it comes to creating delicious new brews.",2016-04-13 01:58:22

""Mashu, mashu.""

any israeli who has any similarly breathtaking experience will, without hesitation, speak those words in response to her elation.  literally translated mashu mashu, which in and of itself is already a bastardization or a slurred version of the real words which make up this phrase, means ""something something"".  the essence of the phrase is essentially ""isnt that something"", as in isnt that incredible.

surely this phrase was repeated either in adoration of this ancient food or this restaurants version of it.  either way the phrase is apt.  ive been here many times and though you do have to wait a while sometimes to get a seat the food will pay off.  this is the best mediterranean restaurant closest to downtown.  all the middle eastern places downtown are indeed fast food places that for the most part pale in comparison.  their food is not as fresh, nor as plentiful.  the salads here are meals in themselves.  traditional ones are israeli salad and tabouli salad with well made standards like caesar and greek.

you can also get a number of kebabs, a fish entree and a handful of well made traditional middle eastern appetizers and dishes like hummous, tahina, fried eggplant, eggplant salad, and varying lamb dishes.

this place still is not my favorite.  that honour goes to Sababa way further north - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sababa-restaurant-thornhill - they have more specialties, but this place is quite good and being the only real place to get this kind of food done well in close proximity to a relatively jewish area, its no doubt why its always packed.",2008-12-19 23:47:12

On the outside, Konjiki seems like another typical ramen place which shares the street front with a interesting Japanese cafe. As make your way down the hall in line, you slowly see a fairly sizeable restaurant that seats about 40 to 50 people. Inside, it has a very cool communal central central that is flanked by small tables around the edge. Don't worry if the line seems long, it moved pretty quickly for us as we were looking for a table for 2 on a Friday night (took about 15 mins). However, watch out if you are coming with a party bigger than 4, as seating will be tough. We grabbed a pair of seats on the central table where they have coat hooks attached underneath - I thought that was a neat design. Waitress came by quickly and offered us hot water or tea.

On to the food, the menu is pretty simple - 5 types of ramen where their signature is the clam broth. I ordered Shoyu ramen while my wife tried the vegetarian ramen. They have some small dishes like gyoza and karaage which I will have to come back to try. The noodles came fairly quickly - superb presentation especially the vegetarian one. I took a sip of the broth - wow - it was light but very flavourful with taste of clam while not being too rich. It had a great taste that had me drinking several spoons before getting to the noodles. The noodles were done perfect - initially I was worried about the portion but it was filling. Bamboo shoots were soft and yummy while the sous vide pork was super soft with subtle flavours of the truffle. This was definitely a winner. For vegetarian one, we weren't sure what to expect as most places serve a plain veggie broth but Konjiki went above and beyond to create a rich and thick creamy soup that coated the noodles perfectly. There were some nice slices of pickled beets, tofu nuggets and onions to round it out. Amazing flavour profile which had a creamy taste to it. It is one of only places where I drank all the soup!

Overall, we loved Konjiki - it is different in a good way with subtle and complex flavours. Sorta like classic ramen but refined to the next level. This will not replace the traditional rich pork based ramen but it serves as a great complement.",2017-12-30 03:29:29

I met my friends at the bar, where we enjoyed cheerful, engaging service.  I had a glass of Hayes Ranch Chardonnay (nice pour, by the way)!  Two of my friends had Woody and Wilcox beer, and another friend got the vodka special.
When we went into the theatre, the server responded immediately to our request for service.  My friend and I got the $25.00 special, which was an appetizer and two entrees.  We got the cheese fries, which came with some kind of dipping sauce.  All of the cheese, which was reminiscent of food court nacho cheese, was at the bottom of the bowl.  My friend then had a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Although it was challenging to see in the dark, he feared that the chicken was underdone.  I got the thin crust margarita pizza.  If that was thin crust, the regular crusts must have been thick as concrete blocks.  The pizza also tasted like it was frozen, but not as good as Digiorno.  However, when I reheated  the leftovers the next day, it tasted better.  Perhaps the flavors needed to meld.

In and of itself, this place is just an average bar. It's kinda neat and it kinda has a theme and the layout is kinda good enough for you to kinda be able to wander around looking for your friends, a hookup or a fight. 

A few facts: 
I've been here several times, and it's never been apeshit busy. 
I never had to wait in line to get in. 
If there is ever a line here, I just keep on moving. 
I typically find a decent place to sit. 
I've never met anyone here that I would want to continue to know beyond that. 
I've always come here with a group of people, and it was never my idea to go.

I tend not to drink when I come here, but I think about the only thing I've had here is an Appletini years ago - also the only place I've ever had one of those. They put a little thin apple slice on top and I thought that was the coolest thing. I found out later just how not special that was - and that I was about one Appletini away from getting a boyfriend and matching fanny packs. So funny the idea that a drink can ""make you gay"" - like it's a magic potion or witches brew or something. Honestly, I don't know anyone who drinks those anymore - gay or straight. As a rule, I don't drink any martinis anymore - I just detest the shape of the namesake glasses they come in.

But I digress... I've had some decent times here, but still these days I'll go out of my way to not go here. The only compelling reason to come here would be me and the company I bring - and I'd rather take my friends somewhere cooler. Devil's is a bit of a meet market and the atmosphere does lend itself to scamming, so if that's what you're looking for...

I do hear about fights happening here quite a bit - a good friend of mine got blitzed here one night and almost got into a fight with another patron - took his shirt off, threw his arms out and bobbed his head even - he ended up punching a cop instead and wound up going to prison.

So filling and made so well all the ingredients taste fresh. I've also has the hazelnut crepe which was cheap as well around $4. I believe both crepes together came to just over $13.  The crepes are huge so I dont really suggest getting both unless you plan to share one. When i got both they made me my savoury one first let me eat it then made my hazelnut one. They're great at not rushing you out they want you to enjoy your meal and they want you to enjoy the crepes as they are fresh.

It's nestled in the bathurst and eglinton area, and is a non descript gem. 
This is an elegant and simple Italian food restaurant with an excellent excellent excellent wine list. I highly recommend the place. A little pricey (about $60- $80 per head) but well worth it for the level of service and quality of food. The place is intimate and friendly. The managers and servers all give you attention and the restaurant is small so it feels like you belong. 

If you're confused about the wine, ask the sommelier. If you are unsure about something, ask the server. I sometimes expect a level of arrogance at restaurants like this, but i found none here. I was torn between the ahi, beef or octopus carrpacio, so the house made me a trio platter without me even asking!

Really where do you get service like this in Toronto anymore? 

I love the place and recommend it for small groups (2, 3 or 4) just because of the intimacy factor.

In depth review: Saw the amazing reviews on Yelp and drove a good distance to try it. We ordered the pizza and wings special that is listed on the website. Gent who answered the phone was not too sure about the special and had to ask another co-worker about it. Our order was for take out and the pizza and wings were ready in 15 minutes as promised. Nice booths along the wall for people who want to dine in. 

We ordered a large mushroom and cheese pizza (extra crispy) and the wings Buffalo style (medium heat). Pizza looked and smelled great. It passed the old ""NY test"" and did not slump over and you could eat it with just one hand. Crust was delicious. Was not the best pizza we have had in Vegas but it was near the top. The mushrooms were plenty and they were certainly fresh. Solid pizza, we enjoyed it. 

The wings were mediocre and I was disappointed with the sauce and what they call ""blue cheese."" Buffalo Wings are made to be paired with blue cheese dressing and for some reason restaurants on the west coast like to give you ranch dressing? The blue cheese dressing they gave me tasted like ranch and it was really watery. Passed on it and used my own in the fridge. I asked for extra wing sauce on the side and this was also very watery. Tasted OK but it was too wet and watery and did not coat the wing properly. Need to work on the sauce, you can do better. 

Great pizza but they should pay better attention to the ole chicken wing. It's not a side item and it derives the same amount of love you put in the pizza pies. 

But we will be back and give it another chance. Try some other items as the guy cooking assured me that everything was homemade and delicious.",2013-11-16 03:19:59

I find a spot first at the comfy deep seat chairs in the middle of the room and order my cup of coffee with a little flavor (white chocolate) in it to try and replicate my usual order from CBTL... my mistake as i should have just stuck with what was on the menu as it was too sweet. My next order was my lunch as i have been sitting here for the last couple of hours and i have been staring at photos of the wraps on their website so i asked them to make me their favorite. I have no clue what it was but it had beans in it and was certainly tasty as well as very healthy and really hit the spot. The service from the entire staff has been a pleasure with smiles and a solid attitude that makes you feel welcome. I think my next order to finish out my day will be the Americano which based on reviews will be nothing short of fabulous.

2.50 stars...

Visited for the first time today to have my hybrid car's oil changed.  As usual, car dealerships tend to be costlier than independent auto shops, but my last few visits to the dealership has left me very suspicious of how much I'm being charged and what services are actually being performed.  I decided to check Yelp for options and stumbled upon a review by a Yelper I met once, a long time ago during a vegetarian meetup (I think), and he suggested I look up a valley car care radio and TV personality Mark Salem's website.  On it, I found a few shops that can service both our Toyota hybrid models.  After a few emails with a couple of Scottsdale shops' managers, I decided to try Whitey's.  The other shop gave me a quote for a complete maintenance service ($$$) that was almost as much as what I'd pay at the dealership, whereas Whitey's general manager Scott Almhjell gave me the option of just getting an oil change, which includes an inspection that would then tell me if the car needed more work.  (Our hybrid models' oil only needs to be changed every 10K miles, instead of the standard car model's usual 5K req.)  I'm now wondering if I should've just gone with the other shop to get the full service, as I don't want to skimp now, and pay heavily later.

I suppose I would've left a lot happier had the shop washed my car.  I wasn't EXPECTING that Whitey's would do so, but excellent customer service usually gets the customer to return.  I know that the dealership would've done so, but I also understand that the dealership has a Danny's Car Wash next door to it.  I very much appreciated that my contact at the shop, named Sean, had someone available (Alex) to drop me off at the restaurant of my choice, less than a mile away, so that I could have breakfast while the car was being worked on, and that I was able to enjoy a nice, long stroll around Civic Plaza before calling the shop so that I may get a ride back.  There certainly was ample time to wash the car, and this would certainly have created the warm buzz of positivity about taking my business here and would've guaranteed my return for another service, possibly one that would cost a couple of Benjamin Franklins and change, instead of the $35 plus tax that I was charged for today's oil change.

I'm omitting an observation I made when I returned to my car after I'd paid for the service, because I don't want to seem too critical, and I was truly hoping I'd find myself able to trust this auto shop for both of our hybrids' care.  Probably not going to be a repeat customer.",2013-04-12 07:16:17

The peppers came in a nicely charred pile, but didn't have enough of the sriracha sauce that was minimally painted on the plate. Not bad, just a little ho hum. The caesar had good flavors, but was egregiously over dressed, and was a smallish salad for the price, with more bread than salad. The pork terrine was good...the best thing I had. I've eaten at Meat & Potatoes a couple of times and thought it very good, so they may be spreading themselves too thin by opening this place, with two others soon to follow. They also kept burning the toast for the salad, which everyone seemed to be ordering, and the place was full of smoke halfway through our meal, which never dissipated, so they need a better exhaust system. They spent a lot of time and creativity here on the drink end of things...now they need to get their act together in the kitchen.",2014-01-02 02:32:21

As in any korean restaurant, your food is served with an assortment of complimentary pan chan (little appetizer dishes).  

I went once for lunch with a group of 4 friends who were equally surprised at the quality of food.  We also got a complimentary summer sushi roll (crab, avocado, and egg wrapped in a thin layer of cucumber) drizzled with a sweet and savory sauce.

I ordered the Halibut Tacos, which were nice and fresh except for the fish part. Honestly the crispy fish could have been from Costco's frozen food section for all I knew.

The pizza was beautiful but tasted very basic.

The concept is similar to Captain's Boil: you can pick your catch and then customize the flavor and spice level according to your personal preference. They also have a raw bar for all you ceviche lovers. There are a few signature items I was definitely eyeing like the oyster sliders, their epic looking slaw and a very Instagrammable looking lobster nachos. 

It's a huge establishment that feels like a family friendly sports bar with great customer service. Perfect for a large group outing or for a date if you don't mind wearing a plastic bib and getting your hands dirty. 

I opted for the lobster roll (you have the choice of getting it served hot or cold) along with sweet potato fries (for a dollar extra) and Caesar salad. As one of the pricier items on the menu, I had high expectations but the dish definitely delivered. Served hot, there were generous chunks of buttery lobster nestled in a lightly toasted bun. So delicious, definitely something you will want to savor! The sweet potato fries were well seasoned. I got them thinking that the Cajun fries would be too spicy for me but they weren't spicy in the slightest. The salad was fresh although I wish they had more options to choose from.

This huge, sprawling mansion contains 90% original furniture, clothing, artwork and fabulously maintained interior. It gives you a glimpse into the opulence of a time when many made fortunes from the industrial revolution. Tour guides point out specific points of interest and explain what the family life was like for the wealthy at the time they lived here.
It is particularly pretty decked out for Christmas. You can go in the evening and there are vendors selling hot chocolate, soft pretzels and other treats. During the day you can stop for a cookie and some hot chocolate at the cafe and eat in what was once a stall for the stable animals on the property.

I've been to this location many times but honestly it's not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town and don't plan on going back.  They give you chips and two types of salsa at your table upon arrival.  You can tell in the picture that the salsa is very watery, which makes it difficult to stay on the chip.  They currently have pink tortilla chips for breast cancer awareness, which I thought was pretty cool. I've ordered many different things on the menu over the years but today I had the taco salad.  They load that salad shell up with shredded chicken.  Honestly, there is more chicken in the salad than lettuce.  I've had to order extra lettuce on the side before just to really make it into a salad. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. They have different lunch specials from day to day. Service has usually been quick.  I've been there previously with large groups and the service was also quick. They prepare guacamole table side if you wish.  Their cheese dip is delicious. At the end of the meal they bring everyone at your table a desert tortilla chip with whip cream and strawberry drizzle. It's very tasty.  I included a picture of it in my review.  This is the larger of the two locations and can accommodate large groups.  It does get very loud at peak times and especially at night on the weekends.

After my bad experience at Thai Lhana I thought I would redeem the Thai cuisine by checking this place out for dinner. The parking lot look busy but when I got inside, there were maybe 5 couples seated. There were only 2 servers so we waited a bit before being seated.

The place was scary quiet, library quiet. I couldn't figure out but then I had an AH-HA moment... the tables were GINORMOUS. I felt small sitting in the chair and the round marble tables normally seat 6-8 but are used for couples. Everyone was seated so far away, screaming would have been a good conversation level. 

The two servers seemed pretty busy so it was a while before we were able to put in our drink orders. We both ordered an iced thai mil tea which was good, standard. 

We ordered a Thai Sampler Appetizer: wontons, fish cake, chicken satay, egg rolls and Thai Toast, pad thai and red curry (spice level 4 of 5).

It was about 45 min before our appetizer made its way out. I would normally be understanding if they were busy but there were only 5 other couples in there... and its just a plate of deep fried goodies. I think that should have taken 10 mins.

The egg rolls were probably the best. The wontons needed more filling, I pretty much ate deep fried wonton skins. The fish cakes were good but overwhelmingly seasoned with lemongrass. It was almost too much to eat. The chicken satay were alright, a bit dry from the grill. The Thai Toast is battered tofu and deep fried, of course... would have been better if I had some maple syrup. It was deep fried beyond recognition.

The pad thai noodles were mush. The noodles were overcooked and just stuck together in a huge ball and was hard to separate. And while I wanted to taste it, I honestly believe Thai ESan cooks season all their dishes with a huge heap of chili powder. Every part of the noodle was covered in the chili powder. I'm actually still flossing out chili flakes from my teeth. It was too hot to even enjoy.

The red curry was good. I liked the coconut flavor and fresh basil. Never had curry with green beans and bamboo shoots before but it was good. Also another dish with a generous heap of chili powder added to it. I couldn't have anymore because my lips were on fire. 

I know Thai food is spicy but damn... let me taste the other flavors too. All I tasted was HOT. I couldn't finish the curry or the noodles. I thought Thai ESan would convince me that Thai food was amazing again but it was too hot to handle.. and not in a good way either.",2010-01-16 03:36:33

This place has been around since I was in university (which is more than 5 years ago) and the taste has been consistent over the years. The broth is flavorful, the beef is tender, and the noodles are chewy. I like the diced preserved vegetables as garnish because it adds a bit of saltiness and crunchiness. I asked for chili oil on the side because nothing beats a cold winter night like a steaming bowl of spicy noodles. I do suspect that they use MSG in their soup because I felt very parched after dinner.
The noodles are pretty bland if you just throw it into the soup and eat it. My advice is to let it sit in the soup till it has a brownish tint to it before you start slurping.

- Space: the space is quite small and smells like Indian spices. This is quite yummy while you are in the restaurant; but it stays in your clothes, for your workmates to know that you had Indian for lunch...
- Food: It can be better; also, they could have served fresh naan at the table.

Now don't get me wrong, I like Thai Basil.  The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  

The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.

Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table.

I had this place bookmarked, after finding out that they make this yummy Apple Caramel Cheesecake & Carrot Cake that I get at Whole Foods.  So I figured why not go directly to the source of this yumminess?

Anyway, instead of the Apple Caramel Cheesecake/Carrot Cake that I know Carole's for, I got the Triple-C Cheesecake.  Guy at the counter was very friendly and attentive and this was his suggestion after I told him that I don't like super sweet desserts.

Service was extremely slow.  Everyone at our table received their food at different times.  Even the people who ordered the same thing had significant delays compared to one another.  This restaurant needs to improve on timing.  Are two sushi chefs enough?  It sure didn't seem like it.  

The sushi was okay, but I've certainly had better.  The rice didn't hold together very well.  Nor did some of the fish on the rice. 

The worst part was chewing one of my favourites (hamachi aka yellowtail) and discovering a fish bone at approximately one centimetre in length.  I felt something hard and poke the inside of my mouth.  This was completely unacceptable.  I brought it to the attention of one of the staff and even showed the bone on my plate.

Not just airplane food, even the food in the airport because of strict regulations and whatnot. So when I arrived at this swanky bar with iPads, I'm thinking: ""Here we go, $18 for a dry, mediocre, patty with limp lettuce"".

But no! It was $14 for a surprisingly decent burger! I don't know if they've lowered the prices recently, but that's what I paid. That seems on par with some moderate American restaurants in a popular area and it's nice not to break the bank before my trip even began. I built my own burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and my friend ordered the breakfast burger complete with a very beautiful fried egg and bacon. Our conclusion was that they were both good burgers! 

Of course, you can't compare it to other burgers, only to other airport options. The bun was soft, the toppings were fresh, and the beef patty was, gasp, juicy! Even the bacon in the breakfast burger was well done and not chewy dry pork strips. My other friend went with chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were tender and those fries could have been served at a good wing place. Very binge-worthy. 

While the food was a surprise hit, the service was a bit of a miss. The staff were friendly and the food arrived in good time, but the tables were filthy. Dirty plates that were next to us weren't taken away until we asked them to, even though people came by to take our order and then again to drop off our drinks. Ah well...it is the airport after all.

I enjoy date nights here and the two of us usually share those two items and are perfectly content for the evening.  They are sooooo delicious and just perfectly satisfying.

This location has one large room with a small bar, tables, and booths.  The restaurant is dimly light and you can feel a draft throughout the restaurant whenever the door opens since it's just one large room.  When you walk in, there is no ""Please wait to be seated"" sign and there's usually no host/hostess, so we end up waiting around a bit awkwardly until someone notices us and leads us to a table.  Coincidently, we've ended up at the exact same time the last 3 times we were here.

Service has usually been prompt whenever we come here for dinner (around 6-8pm).  Unfortunately, all the tables and booths are pretty close together, so you end up overhearing a lot of conversations, even if you're not trying to.

This dealership attempted to pull a yo-yo financing scam on us on 1/3/15. It's very simple, let me explain how it works:

1. They give you an amazing low interest rate (2.99%). You agree and sign the papers. What they don't tell you is ... the deal's not done yet. The loan hasn't been finalized.

2. Honda West calls you after you drive off with your car (days, if not weeks later) that the financing 'fell through' and the new interest rate is higher.

3. You get screwed. Either you agree to pay more or you return the car.

That's the scam, and Honda West does this with approval from the management. The people I worked with: Jimmy in Finance and Shubao in Sales.

Other dirty tricks Honda West tried to pull on us:

Lie #1: Told us the lease buyout price wasn't negotiable. That's a lie. Source: https://help.edmunds.com/entries/26536513-Car-Leasing-Basics 

Lie #2: Told us the buyout price was $13500 and then offered us a payment plan of $310 for 60 months. Dude, $310 times 60 equals $18600. That's a $5100 increase and another lie. He told us the $5100 were 'taxes and fees'. Tax is 9%. Where the hell did the other $4000 come from? 

Lie #3: When I caught that the loan wasn't approved yet and that he was going to pull the yo-yo scam on my little brother the Finance guy told us: ""Oh. All loans aren't approved prior to purchase."" What the hell are you talking about? All loans are finalized prior to purchase of ANYTHING whether it's a car, a house, a condo, a boat, a student loan for tuition. All loan terms are finalized before a transaction or else why the hell are we signing papers?

Spreading the word on every social media outlet from Yelp to Dealer Rater about Honda West's dishonest practices. The few hundred dollars they tried to squeeze from my family is going to cost them far more than that. If you're smart, you'll stay away from Honda West. If you're dumb, you'll buy a car from Honda West and end up paying as much for a Honda as a BMW.

Carlos O'Brien's - Not, I repeat, not even remotely irish food.  It is Mexican food.  (Now some of you might wonder about this clarification, but I'm shocked how many people thought Carlos' was supposed to be Irish food...)

This country's border states each have their own species of Mexican food.  Arizona's tends to have a lot of meat, deep fried tortillas and about 4 pounds of cheese on top.  Oh, and don't forget the red sauce to pull your entree, beans and rice courses together into one tasty conglomeration.  We don't put rice in our burritos.  We don't use a lot of green chiles, but we do use some.  We don't know what a chalupe is, we know you're a hipster if you want street tacos, and it's best not to even mention Chi Chi's here unless you find out what it means first.  We know fajitas and chimichangas aren't really Mexican, but we think they taste good anyway.  Carlos makes a mean chimichanga.  We have flautas, but generally not taquitos.

The Carlos subspecies of AZ Mexican food is known for enormous portions.  The tamales are about the size of a can of soda and the burritos are bigger than that.  Don't forget the 4 pounds of cheese on top.

The service at Carlos is quick and friendly, and you can usually get in and out pretty quick for a sit down restaurant.

4FIy9tlLBzOC5ugNQfZtSg,j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw,3,2,2,2,"A place with a really similar menu to the venerable HK Star. They fail to execute the dishes as eloquently and inexpensively as HK Star. Located across the street from Ichiza and right next to (Pho) Kinh Do! 

I came here with a tougher critic than me believe it or not, my Mom on a Sunday evening. No one else was in here, not a good sign.

@ Soup - Included in the meal. Was good, on par with the stuff at HK Star.

@ Shrimp Tofu - The tofu was good. I saw the shrimp, but couldn't really taste the shrimp at all since it was overpowered by the tofu. Just get the regular tofu next time.

@ Sizzling Beef - This came out sizzling on a plate. While this was a good item, it was sauced fairly heavy and a little more on the salty side. Food Express got this dish right.

@ Bi Fung Tong Seabass - My favorite dish at HK Star. Even though HK Star uses frozen seabass in their dish, this place doesn't taste as fresh as them. It just lacks the spicy kick that HK Star offers. Not a bad dish overall, but could be a lot better.

@ Roast Duck - This duck was so bad, I recommend going to Sam Woo to get your ducks, and I recommend against going to Sam Woo entirely in the past! In all fairness, HK Star has fairly bad reviews on their duck as well. It lacked the nice crispy skin and firm meat that makes duck so unhealthy to eat, but oh so good.

@ Thai Ice Tea - It was whatever. I've tasted much better stuff before. 

@ Carrot Desert - It was a carrot dessert soup. I was full, so I opted out of it. It is included in the meal. 

Lobster is $10 a pound, $1.12 more than HK Star. Across the board, everything is about the same or a couple of bucks more than HK Star, but nothing too terribly expensive. They also have a $5 and $6 lunch special menu like HK Star. 

This place seems to have a wide selection of ChaoZhou dishes. Upon further research, this type of cuisine tends to have healthier seafood and veggie dishes than other Chinese cuisine. They tend to go less on flavoring, letting the ingredients speak for themselves. A similar philosophy to Japanese food. Whether this place actually follows this philosophy, I can't confirm.

This place is fairly new, having been here for 5 months. This place is NOT related to HK Star in anyway, despite the similar menu and name. The inside feels cheap with all the fans in there. But the best chinese restaurants are notorious for not looking nice inside!

Service is really iffy. In terms of getting food out, they're not as fast as HK Star. Since its only a couple of mintues slower, its still reasonable for the dishes. The waitress there speaks mainly Chinese and very little English, so there may be language barriers to those who only speak English. 

They have 2 promotions where  if you spend $38+ you get a free vermicilli dish and if you spend $55+ you get a free ~1.5lb crab. This was cool and all, but the waitress could have just answered my question of how much I needed to spend to get to $38. She was asking me if I wanted soda or thai ice tea, implying it was free. I got charged for it. When I asked her about, she says oh, its to get you to $38 to get a free item. Just tell me that I need like $3 more to get there and I'll pick my own item. Uncool to do it in a sneaky way like that. I was able to get a duck instead of the vermicilli dish with a little social engineering.  

I only came here because I'm a food whore and I like to check out my other options, despite HK Star being very good to me. I guess I'll be put my head in shame as I walk back into HK Star to ask forgiveness.

You would only come here if you factor out HK Star or wanted ChaoZhou dishes. HK Star is better than this place in every way, price, taste, and service. The only thing this has over HK Star is its more tourist/ East-side friendly since its closer to the strip and open till 3am for our late night eaters. 

Not Chinese Mom approved.",2010-07-12 04:13:06
LiKHAVV1UhKb2Zbp96lVOg,PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w,4,5,0,0,"[This review is for the nightclub.]  

Marquee Nightclub is hyped as the current 'it' club in Vegas, and for the most part, if you're willing to get through some of the pretty annoying parts of it, it lives up to it's title.  

A couple nice things about the club include three different floors with different music playing on each, a pretty big outdoor patio area with a casino, and a relatively excited crowd there to celebrate.  The sets themselves are pretty extravagant too and dancing there with gogo dancers dressed in different garb, confetti, mist, and glowing tube sticks all add up to a pretty unique experience that I've never had until Marquee.  

A couple things to note - there is an elevator (two?) that will help take you up and down the floors.  However, with how packed the club usually is on weekends, it's best to take the stairs on the side to go up and down so do expect some climbing.  Speaking of the crowd, with an excited crowd comes popularity and with popularity comes overcrowded areas.  If you want to really dance, try to get to the dance floor as early as possible.  Bouncers start to block off people from entering the main dance areas when it's deemed 'overcrowded' and will randomly let people in at times when they feel it's right so be like a hawk and try to aim at the right moment.  

As always with these popular clubs, getting on the guestlist is a 'must' for a Saturday night along with getting to the club early (even getting there around 10:30PM will probably force you to wait for about an hour).  Don't expect to get in anytime soon if you arrive late and aren't on some list.  (I'd mention expensive drink prices but really, that shouldn't be much of a surprise.)  

So again, if you love some spectacle DJ sets, a choice in music floors, and a great crowd beside you and you're willing to put up with some annoying parts, Marquee is a great nightclub.",2012-08-20 05:25:38

With the endless Mexican food options in Phoenix, it is this place and Santos Lucha Libre that are listed in Phoenix's top 5 restaurants. The latter was terrible, but PHX Burrito House seemed promising. Would this be the most disappointing week yet in my still-young Mexican food tour? 

Unfortunately, yes.

PHX Burrito House is situated in the former digs of the also-overrated Fry Bread House. I will admit, the idea of burritos in an old converted house is pretty cool (maybe that's why this place has such rave reviews?). I looked at the menu, and it was sparse. Great! A place like this should have a sparse menu.

The list of ingredients in the burrito, however, concerned me a little bit. Rice, choice of pinto or black beans, meat, sour cream. Guacamole extra. What? Rice? Really?

I trudged ahead anyways. Got the carne asada burrito with guac. With a bottle of Fanta (no Jarritos?).

Almost $11.

Everything was just OK. The chips were OK. The burrito was just OK. Sorry, but it's hard to get excited about a burrito where 50% of the mass is rice and 40% is beans. I think there was a piece of actual carne asada in every third bite. Guac was relegated to a little vein near the outside of the burrito. Sour cream was only noticeable when I got to the bottom, where all the liquids inevitably end up.

It's pretty disappointing when I leave a place with the feeling that I could have gotten a better burrito at Filiberto's.

I've probably said this before, but if you want a sure-fire way to ruin a burrito, put a crap ton of rice in it. It's just filler. Would I eat here if I live in there area? Maybe.. But probably not, there's a Filiberto's across the street, and if I want a bad burrito, I might as well only spend four bucks on it.",2014-09-26 04:06:46

n91oqAuvsFKpwZeRgxrYRA,-go-R_jzvYLYngQbfKN4_A,zitXLajbETOuHQJfok4a4g,3,5,0,0,"I was excited to try the Burger Joint after finding it on Yelp and reading many positive reviews. Their menu looks great on paper and I love how it features gourmet ingredients that you don't typically find at neighborhood burger restaurants.

After dining at the Burger Joint I debated whether or not wanted to write a review. I love supporting local small businesses, but the problem with small businesses is that people are afraid to give them honest reviews. But if this were my restaurant I would want people to give me constructive criticism so I could make the place better and busier.

When you walk in, the ambiance of the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. They did an okay job remodeling the space, but the white paint and lack of decorations lend the restaurant a generic and cheap feel. The window blinds also need to be improved to battle the blaring afternoon sun. 

The staff is very friendly and were a pleasure to deal with. Service was excellent and I would give it 4 stars! However this restaurant deserves 3 stars because of the food. 

I requested the off the menu foie gras toast that another Yelper recommended. The waitress kindly informed me that they did not have it anymore, but they could make a foie gras slider. Yay! But I was shocked when I received a slider with a cold slice of foie that hadn't been seared. Every other aspect of the slider was perfect, but nobody wants cold foie on a slider. It was almost inedible.

We also ordered the sweet potato tots, portabella mushroom burger and a bacon cheese burger. The idea of homemade tots sounded wonderful, but they arrived as large balls of mashed and deep fried sweet potato. No texture and mushy in the center. Only the outer edge was good.

The portabella mushroom burger was equally disappointing. It sounded great on the menu,  but the portabella was overcooked and mushy and the sandwich had little flavor.

The bacon cheeseburger was good, but as another Yelper mentioned it was also overcooked. My medium order was cooked well. The black sesame seed bun is a nice touch, but the bacon was undercooked and was not crispy like you would hope for. 

At the end of the dining experience I couldn't help but to feel cheated. We paid $40 for a burger meal that could have been amazing but ended up being average at best. I wish this restaurant success and I hope they learn from their shortcomings.",2017-04-20 15:22:35

i loved mine. the bisque was rich and creamy and the scallops barely seared...soft and juicy and tasty. i really did like my girls dishes, but i was so impressed with mine, it's all i remember. give me a day or two and i'll remember. a bit pricey for us, but with the coupon, dinner and a glass of wine for 2 came to just over 80 bucks (with tip). 
speaking of tip, we weren't all that impressed with our waiter. a bit (slightly) inattentive and seemed preoccupied. and it was chilly in there. wish they would turn up the heat when it's cold out.

My mom and her boyfriend were in town and I have heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out. My spring mix salad was good, but standard. Let's face it, we did NOT go for the salad anyway. I ordered the Parmesan crusted Sand Dabs with my two choices as garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. My Sand Dabs were fabulous! I had only had them one other time at McCormick & Schmicks and I think these were just a tad bit better. They were perfectly fried. I must admit the sides were a tad bit lacking. My husband ordered the Mexican coconut shrimp and they were quite good as well. Mom's boyfriend ordered Halibut Almondine and was in love at first bite. My mom had a salmon dish and she was also quite pleased with her choice. Now. I can over look the standard salad and the slightly ordinary sides but this place gets -1 solid star for the dessert. I ordered creme brule... one of my favorites. It tasted like it was from a box. A standard custard... Blech! I held out on dessert every other night we went out to dinner and this place was quite a disappointment. Now on the other hand my husband and mom both devoured their bread pudding with out complaint and the mom's boyfriend claimed his key lime pie was only second to one and that's saying A LOT. 

Now. This place COULD have been 3 stars but they got the bump up for the following reasons: 
-Fresh fish flown in with menus printed daily 
-I caught a buzz off two martinis. 
-We were all happy with our selections which is quite a feat. 

Should have been 3 stars because: 
-price is on the higher side... I'd rather go to McCormick & Schmicks for the price 
-crappy desserts.

It's tacky, themed Vegas with a James Bondesque USSR décor and post communist, ""everything western is good"" disjointed menu.  Don't let it keep you away.  The food is solid and the vodka selection, one of the largest in Vegas.

The menu is authentic Russian.  Western dishes such as smoked salmon atop won ton chips with wasabi cream and tobiko (very refreshing and delicious) sit next to a classic steak tartare.

Stick to the old school classics.  The seared foie with baked apples served on French toast with a warm, apple butter and huckleberry gastrique and garnished by  smoky, oily bacon is sublime.  The traditional steak tartare is near perfect.  Super clean flavor of the chilled beef spicy mustard, salty capers, pungent onions, oceanic anchovies and creamy raw egg yolk beautifully presented (they can mix it for you if you are not comfortable doing it yourself).  All served atop melba toast and a side of crème friache.  

For mains, its gotta be the stroganoff made with filet mignon tips.  Warm, comforting, stick to the ribs goodness, the way a stroganoff should be.  Incredible earthiness from the mushrooms.

Huge selection of vodka from around the world from the great classics to the nouveau silly (bubble gum or Fruit Loops).  All can be ordered as 2 oz, 3 oz, or even full bottles if you want the true drunken experience.  Prices are very high (Vegas ultra lounge / club)

Its 24 hours and you pretty much can get everything you need from grocery, clothes, shoes, electronics, automotive, furniture, etc. I could go on but if you have ever been to one of these ""Supers"", you know exactly what I am talking about.

Now for the negatives. 

There seems to never be any parking and if you do find one, there is usually a shopping cart or two that is in the way so you have to get out of your car to get it out of the way. Sometimes you are approached by certain people because they are either selling something or are asking you for money. Just the other day, when I got out of my car, this dude came up to me and asked if wanted to buy some tamales. Then when I was making my way to the car, this one guy is asking me for money so he can put gas in his car so he can take his family back home to Phoenix. The funny thing about that its the same guy that asked me for money last week. I asked him, ""Didn't you ask me the for money last week? Shouldn't you be in Phoenix by now?"". He looked at me like oh s**t, you got me.

Most of the time, the employees here are ok to interact with. Sometimes you run into those employees that don't give a damn about working there. I usually try to stay away from those people so that their crappy attitude does not affect me.

Overall, I don't mind going here if I really need something. I just try not to go when its 2 in the morning. I can only imagine what type of characters are floatin around not to mention disgruntled walmart employees.

The burgers are okay. I got the longhorn burger and it was too heavy. The sauce was kinda drench making the buns a bit too drench. I had a bite of the Nom Nom Burger, I would recommend that a lot more. Still, bachi's burgers are a lot better and more fresh imo.",2015-01-07 01:51:27

As far as the arcade goes, they spent the money to get all these games packed in.  Plus, they have a card system like Dave & Buster's.

The dessert trio was equally impressive and bursting with summer flavours, apart from the profiterole which was a bit of a letdown. The milk-chocolate sauce just didn't have enough oomph against the pastry and cream.

The only thing I have left to comment on are the cocktails. I am torn, because...they were delicious. I had the thyme-prosecco-gin mojito and it was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. And it was priced accordingly: $16. I had two of those, and so my bar tab was almost equal to my Summerlicious tab.",2013-07-18 16:56:08

The shop is small but filled with pastries,  cakes, breads and cookies. I purchased a six pack of pastries to experience a little bit of everything and to avoid tax. 

What stood out for me was the flaky texture and the buttery taste. Each one shared that same delicious consistently. Especially the Viking slice!

I would recommend coming a little bit earlier before the evening rush to avoid the long line up.  Do not worry about missing out, there is more then enough treats for everyone.

Our service was wonderful. We were checked on at all the appropriate times, our server was attentive but never pushy and clearly knew the menu very well. 

I started with the shrimp rice krispies and then had the classic filet with a side of mac & cheese for dinner. Everything was amazing. I still can't get over the taste of the mac & cheese. Oh, and did I mention the bread? Yeah, amazing.

My mom ordered an omelet, and I ordered a Loco Motion.
Hamburger patty with sticky rice, 2 eggs and brown gravy.
I ordered my eggs poached, and my patty medium rare.

The food came out quite quickly, and our waitress was kind.

My mom liked her omelet, and I thought that my patty was a little over cooked, but it was still good. However, it almost tasted like they cooked it in A-1 steak sauce, and it was kind of clashing with the gravy. My eggs were cooked nicely.
It came with pineapple, but I was disappointed with that. It was not ripe, and more white than yellow.
I chose a banana muffin instead of toast. 
My daughter and I ate it, but it left my fingers greasy.... Not something a muffin should do.

The women's bathroom was gross. 
There was only one clean stall. 
The first stall closest to the sink couldn't be opened.
The middle stall was clean, 
the third, and final (only handicapped stall) had fecal matter in the bowl,

There is a bar full of different sauces where you can make your own concoctions. I'd recommend asking for an egg and putting some sauces. Might sound weird but it's bomb!

You choose your own soup base. One dislike that I have about the spicy soup base is that here are too many red rectangle pepper things. I honestly don't know what it's called, but every time I tried to scoop out some meat, I got some of those things along with it too which was kind of annoying.

For Entree I ordered drum pepper chow fun with beef, it was good but it's nothing outstanding. My friend got the squid with Sa cha flavor noodle soup. He likes it a lot, the only suggestion he will say is less vinegar. Maybe offer vinegar on the side for people to add if they want more. 
Another thing I'm going to complain, which is why it goes down to a three star, is that they served us a glass of water where there is obvious lipstick ink shown. We had to return the water. It makes me question how clean do they clean their plates/glasses. However, this place is fairly new so I'm giving them benefit of the doubt, hopefully that was just one time mistake.

The menu is fun and unique. I always have the hardest time choosing. The girls got the breakfast burrito and I got the margherita pizza. Because when pizza is on special, you DO NOT say no to it. 

Pizza was just fine. A bit on the smaller side than I was expecting. Mostly because I love pizza and want all of it. But for $10, I had no complaints.

The only reason this is a 4 star review is truly about the waitress. Overall we were not impressed. Right from the start she was very standoffish and aloof with us.

The steak was tender and marinated well & the Flour tortilla was made well. 
The BF did not care for his burrito much - he thought  they put too little rice.

Among the faded boxes and labels of non-perishable foods, generic brand toys, home supplies, and hygienic products, are new, low-priced items. 

Frequently, my mom and I have found food items that are typically new concepts for established brands that are barely available in regular grocery stores. For example, Special K Popcorn Chips, Quaker Popped Chips, Lean Cuisine Steamer Meals, Oscar Mayer Sandwich Meats, etc. All for just $0.99 and once depleted, gone forever and then found in your local grocery stores for 3-4 dollars more (their normal prices). It seems like testing periods or a way to introduce consumers to products. Either way, these are good buys.

Other worthwhile products are seasonings and party supplies. I've purchased a couple seasonings (chili powder and dried oregano) due to their quantity and price. No complaints on quality either. The party supplies aren't of spectacular quality, but for plates, utensils, and decorations that are disposed quickly, it's perfect.

The layout of the place kind funnels people this way, but why do I have to order twice?  Maybe this is so they can start working on your order and have it ready when you go to pay.  I was lucky to grab a table as I witnessed several parties hovering nearby looking for a place to sit.  If you have more than two people in your party I recommend that after make your first order you send someone to snag  a table while the other goes to pay.  I ordered a cheese steak sandwich and fries.  It took a while to get my food.  You would think they would have started working on it when I first placed my order, but that was not the case.  With the volume of people in the place I anticipated a wait, but it seemed to take longer than it should to get my food.  The cheese steak sandwich was OK, nothing special, but it was hot off the grill.  I should have known not to expect too much when the menu said it came with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Toppings that are fine for a burger but that should never be mentioned in the same sentence as a cheese steak.  I left them off of my cheese steak.  The fries on the other hand were great.  They were thick cut, hot & crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Overall nothing spectacular, the fries come close, but good hot food.  The tab came to $10.46 for sandwich, fries and drink, which is not too unreasonable.",2011-01-13 13:04:09

We were feeling a little adventurous so I ordered the Antelope slider which had a raspberry jalapeno jam and the Buffalo slider which is topped with Muenster cheese, an onion ring and peach BBQ sauce; my friend also got the Antelope slider and he got the Wagyu which has bleu cheese, asparagus tips and spicy ketchup.  We of course started out with the sweet potatoe fries which come with 5-6 different dipping sauces.

My favorite slider was the Antelope, the raspberry jam added a great flavor and the meat wasn't as different tasting as I was expecting.  The Buffalo was good but the BBQ sauce was a little overpowering and I didn't really taste the peach in it.  The Wagyu was good too but it's really just like a regular slider since it's still beef.  The sweet potato fries were delicious as well.  Perfectly cooked and the dipping sauces were awesome.

The waitress was really friendly and checking with us frequently to make sure we were doing okay and refilling water, definitely a plus in my book.  I'm going to try to make it back on a day when they're serving Kangaroo and/or Ostrich, can't wait to see how those taste!",2011-08-28 22:13:31

I loved the fresh plants sitting in the front and the smaller details, like the monogrammed napkins. The menu is relatively small, but after ordering a number of things, I can attest that this place values quality over quantity.

Calamari: 5/5
Its super crispy and cooked to perfection so it wasn't chewy at all. There was a perfect amount of breading, the sauce it came with complemented the calamari incredibly well, and it came with fried lemons that were surprisingly delicious.

Margherita pizza: 5/5
I loved it! The crust was so fluffy, and the sauce was made with heirloom tomatoes so it was flavorful and sweet.

Mac n' cheese: 5/5
Mac n' cheese is the holy grail of this place. This is hands down the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. Most places add truffle oil and breading and it's good. But this place is on a whole other level. They also add kale, so maybe you won't feel so guilty for all of that yummy, gooey cheese. 

Tuna poke lettuce cup: 3/5
Not a fan. The fish was good and fresh. I thought the flavor was subtle, and it kind of lacked texture.

I finally was called to the desk around 10:10 a.m., I was a tad irritated but I am sure the walk in line was much much longer. The clerk I corresponded with was very friendly and fast.  She actually looked like she half way enjoyed her job, some clerks looks absolutely miserable to be there.  I was off to get my photo taken after about 5 minutes or so.  There was one person in line ahead of me for the photo.  The photographer was quick and very friendly.  I just wish they didn't have all of those chairs facing the picture area.

I highly recommend an appointment and what I hear from a friend, do not take long to get to the desk, if you don't go to the assigned window, they will call someone else after 45 seconds or so.  I am sure this is in place to help keep the lines moving since it is always packed but I don't think it is fair to make elderly or moms with strollers wait longer because they didn't get to the window in time.

Not too many complaints about the actual shows. The sound quality is good enough and the AC seems to be fully functional, hence the two stars. 

Last night, I witnessed some despicable behavior displayed by some members of the security team towards fans waiting harmlessly outside the venue to meet the band. Since I've been here before, I know that the security typically creates ridiculous lies to deter fans from waiting...obviously because they want to leave work early. Instead of respectfully asking fans to leave, the security threatened to call the cops...seriously? I also heard from others about the misogynist,  inappropriate comments yelled at them. 

Hopefully, the Marquee considers hiring staff who can at least communicate and act in a more respectable manner. Pretty sure at least half of the security team is composed of ex-convicts.

Kiin which means 'eat' in Thai occupies where Khao San Road is situated before. 

Upon entering the restaurant, you will be greeted in Thai by a very nice and friendly host.  

You can already tell this is no ordinary Thai restaurant judging by how the interior looks. The place itself is so lush and gorgeous with marbled floors, glass shutters and gold accents everywhere. It also looks more spacious as compared to when it was Khao San Road.

The lunch menu is very limited which consist only of three choices in different categories such as Snack, Soup, Salad, Rice, Noodle, Curry.

I decided to try a noodle dish, Pad See Ew to see if they taste authentic - and damn right it is! They got it right with the sauce, perfect balance of salty and sour. It has also has a wonderful chargrilled flavour from a result of continuous high heat cooking. And the Sen Yai noodles - so fresh and chewy. I just wish they would give you more of the noodles as the dish has more veggies and chicken than noodles.

My SO ordered the Tom Yum Gai with Konjac Noodles. Konjac Noodles if you're not familiar is also known as the 'Wonder Noodle' because it has no starch so it's no fat, low carb, low cal and gluten free. Be warned that they don't ask you for the spiciness level and it is a little bit spicy. But boy it was good! The broth has all the exotic Thai flavours and the chicken was so tender.  This is comparable or even better to the Thai street foods we ate in Bangkok.

If you also like Pandan, you should try their Pandan Ice Tea. It's not sweet but with the addition of pandan leaves, this drink is so fragrant and I really enjoyed it. 

Although it's pricier compared to other Thai resto, the portions are huge and they don't skimp on the ingredients. Plus if you want quality food, the price doesn't really matter.

Once again, the Regular's have proven that when it comes to authentic Thai food nothing beats them. You don't even have to travel to Thailand to eat authentic Thai food since Toronto has the best Thai restaurants! 

I will surely come back here to try their dinner menu and also to recommend this restaurant to friends and families.",2017-11-08 00:41:22

I maintain a higher level of casino play here, to where I get free rooms, free food, and other comps that some people may not get.

According to Caesars Entertainment, the people who own Paris,  the hotel Paris is considered more upscale than the other properties ( Flamingo, Ballys, Rio, Quad, Planet Hollywood, Harrahs) with the exception of Caesars Palace...  Yet, the past 2 times I've stayed at this property as a ""comp"" I get treated more shabby than the other properties.  Their front desk people who work the Platinum desk must be the punished ones... they don't get the Diamond / 7Stars desk, so they're demoted to help low rollers like me.

3 months ago, when I called to booked my room, I was transferred to a special VIP Marketing Department to take care of my free room.  WIth the 2 nights free room I also received free money to play on the slots.  The person booked me the ""Red Luxury"" room and told me that I'd be getting one of the nicer rooms in the HIGHER floors of the hotel.  He kept gushing how much fun I would be having.  

Fast forward to the arrival date.

When I arrived to check in,  this older lady who couldn't even smile asked me a string of questions like ""smoking?"" ""King or queen?"" which I replied Non Smoking, King, and a higher room with a view please.  She replied ""Of course"", and then promptly tried to give me the FIFTH floor, smoking.  WTF!?!   

5th floor is only 1 story higher than the ground level.  It wasn't a view of the pool, it was the pool!

I handed her back the key and said I'd like a higher room, please, non smoking, and with a view.  I also asked her if it was a Red Room and she replied ""No, its a request only, and  comp rooms are only by request.  So, you got a classic room"".  

Come on, you couldn't even LOOK to see if I could get a nicer room?  

Apparently anything I said, she gave me the opposite.  If I said blue, she'd say green.   I told her that I'd wait for a nicer room, and she said come back at 4.

The Classic room was ""Just OK"".  It was on the 12th floor (Room 1223) and it did face the Paris ball, overlooking the pool.  The room, however, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent, like they just shampooed it.  For a free room, it did the job.

I get it that I got the room for free, but I didn't like how the front desk treated me, like I don't deserve VIP treatment.  I dump a lot of money at their property (and it shows, since I'm bombarded by free offers every single week!) and yet Paris is the worse hotel when it comes to front desk courtesy.

In December I was in Flamingo, and they gave me a stunning 24th floor room with a magnificent view.  The rooms were actually nicer than the ""Classic"" Paris room I got, and location on the Strip was just as nice.  Even Ballys once gave me a corner suite, and I didn't even ask to be upgraded.

What gives, Paris?? Is recycling $20K not enough?  I guess not.",2014-03-18 16:47:40

Next we also ordered the pineapple fried rice mixed with cashews, raisins , and pineapple literally served on a pineapple. Really awesome!.

For noddles we decided to have the Silver Noodle Salad, a bit too spicy for me but still really good.

We were both kind of disappointed since the mango salad was not available. They only have it during mango season time,

I had the Panang with beef (a personal favorite at almost any Thai restaurant), and my friends had the Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai and the Red Curry. We all loved every bite. Another friend who is not a fan of anything spicy opted for some sticky rice and spring rolls. The sticky rice was not what she had expected (it was too sticky for her) and the spring rolls were good, but she had to get an order of 4 which was too many spring rolls for her. 

With our individual lunches came spring rolls, and they were perfect: thin and crispy outsides with yummy veggies inside. 

What I loved most about  my Panang was the perfect level of spiciness. I hate when food is too uncomfortably spicy, but I love when my lips tingle. My lips were tingling!

The only hiccup in the meal was the bill. When the bill arrived, it was not itemized, so all we saw was the total for all five of us. Typically, we would just split it five ways (PS - gratuity was added for us as a group of five); however, two of the girls had drinks and one just had the sticky rice and spring rolls. When we asked the waitress how much just the drinks or just the sticky rice or spring rolls were, she had no idea. She left the table and went to find out. None of these items were printed in the menu, so it was a little odd. Turns out the spring rolls were $5 and the sticky rice was maybe $3 and the drink was $2, so the one poor girl who didn't like anything ended up paying the same amount the rest of us did (and we were all full and happy). 

I look forward to returning to Thai Elephant, for lunch or even dinner.",2008-05-08 23:36:59

And even worse, it turns out that the same group I went with on Wednesday had visited the restaurant for Summerlicious in 2010 and none of us remembered.

Fried in duck fat and just the right thickness, they come with four different delicious dipping sauces (my favorite is the curry sauce).  There is also a scattering of rosemary and fresh garlic that really pulls it all together.   I can never finish mine, despite how good they are so I take them home with me and bake them in the oven.

The food didn't take too long to come out. The muffin came put first. It was good, but would have been better if it was served warmed with butter. That would have kicked it up several notches..

My dish came out nice and hot. My eggs were so fluffy. Very memorable. Probably the best scrambled eggs that I've ever had. The cheese was perfectly melted on top. I was very happy about this because nothing pisses me off more than getting eggs with unmelted cheese on top..ugh... The ham was delicious. Grilled to perfection. Not too salty either which is the case with a lot of ham steaks that I've been served.

When my friend finally arrived, we got right down to business. First we each ordered a seaweed salad and it tasted very fresh. The small portion was great for me since I only wanted a taste.

We ordered the following:
- Mackerel and salmon sushi
- Las Vegas roll
- Golden California roll
- Salmon cream cheese roll
- California hand roll
- Salmon avocado hand roll
- Futo maki

Everything tasted amazing and fresh! My personal favourite was the golden California roll which is rolled in batter and then deep fried. It was still kind of hot after a few minutes but I couldn't wait so I slightly burned my mouth.

However, just like everything else on Spring Mountain between Rainbow and Decatur I barely recognize it anymore. Chinatown is getting quite epic. 

This is a review of the food court:
In the Greenland Supermarket food court there's a Hawaiian place, a Sushi place, two Korean booths, a Tofu ""casserole"" place (which I don't think I'll ever try, it sounds kind of disgusting) and a coffee shop which serves Boba but seems to be out of it a lot. 

I really wish the Hawaiian place served lumpia and Portuguese donuts but I digress, the spam musubi was quite delish. The sushi place is pretty cheap, for $1.99 they will give you two nigiri, which is about ten nigiri for $10. I also tried Korean food for the very first time when I came to this place, just for the hell of it. I had a kim-chee and meat stuffed bun, which will have to grow on me sadly. It tastes very good at first but the aftertaste is pretty odd. 

In conclusion, I had a pretty good experience here. I wish they had a little more variety (such as a Vietnamese booth or more offerings at the Hawaiian booth) but I will definitely return.",2011-01-10 19:42:28

I booked a reservation online for 7:15 pm. The process was easy and straightforward.

We got there a few minutes after said time. We were promptly greeted by a polite woman who seated us in a booth.

I got the following items:

- Diet Coke with free refills
- Complimentary bread with delicious garlicky oil dip
- Crab cakes
- Blackened fish tacos with greens
- Chocolate lava cake with strawberries and whipped cream on the side

My friend and I shared everything, except for my Diet Coke and blackened fish tacos with the side greens. The funny thing is that I don't recall what she ate for dinner.

The crab cakes were amazing. There are lumps of crab meat delicately seasoned and made to perfection. The remoulade was so good that we asked for more.

The blackened fish tacos hit the spot. Grill the fish and place the portions in soft tacos, without dunking them in batter and making me figure out where the fish is. The dressing with the green salad was yummy, too.

The chocolate lava cake was incredible! So good. It was one of the best lava cakes that I have had in years. The strawberries were fresh and naturally sweet. My friend ate all the whipped cream. She was good to remember that I don't eat it.

Our server was personable and helpful. He promptly got me drink refills, which was nice.

Meals can get pricey. However, I have yet to have a bad meal here. I don't mind paying a bit more for decent food. Until we meet again, Bonefish Grill!

Loved the food and the service, but what I didn't like is the decor. Holy moly, I get it, you're a New Orleans themed Po-Boy sandwich shop. I don't see the need for cheesy gold and purple Mardi Gras decor to hit me in the face everywhere I turn. This place sort of looks like a forgotten Mardi Gras storage unit from Party City. Ok, now that I've given birth to that brain baby, on to the food...

I came here with few friends so I was able to try a multiple things off the menu; The Big Easy, The French Market, House Cajun chips and Cajun Fried Mac n' Cheese balls. I normally just highlight the few stellar items from my visit, but everything I had was amazing with deep rich flavors; crunchy, spicy and filled with heart and soul. 

The French Market, Andouille sausage with slaw and creole mustard. Pure classic flavors, the Andouille sausage was juicy all the way through and the bread was light and didn't bury any of the sausage snap. 

The Cajun Chips and Cajun Fried Mac n' Cheese Balls were a pair made in crunchy, greasy heaven. Crunchy on the outside and piping hot and gooey in the center, I bow to you Mac n' Cheese ball. I think the Cajun Chips are sprinkled with magic, a magic that doesn't allow you stop eating them or maybe it's Voodoo? 

The Big Easy matches it's name perfect. A large sandwich that's amazingly easy to devour in a matter of seconds. Lightly fried large shrimps and spicy mayo on a soft French roll. The bread is so soft it almost disintegrates in your mouth. 

Great service, great food, but it can be a little pricey. Definitely a Streetcar Po-Boy I did desire.",2015-08-21 21:50:43

I had never been here before and of course they were about to change to the Wisconsin Brewing Co Tap Haus the following week.  so everything was taken with a grain of salt.

My brother ordered the special sandwich of the day.  It was a fried chicken sandwich, bacon, ranch, and lettuce/tomato/onion but he only had the chicken, bacon, and bun.  He thought it was okay.  I ordered the BBQ Brisket sandwich.  It was tasty.  Our server was friendly and attentive but we were the only ones there for almost 40 minutes, so I assume it was as much as good service as trying not to be bored.

But the real reason you go to a Tap Haus is for the beer.  But when you go to a business that is switching from Capitol Brewery to Wisconsin Brewing Company beers, the taps are not replaced when they run out.  I ending up getting the Amber and brother got the Pumpkinatur.  He liked his beer a lot.  I think the Capitol Amber is a good solid beer but I was really hoping to try something new.  

So to the first and last visit to the Capital Tap Haus, it was a solid choice but not a Coopers or Great Dane.  It will be nice to see how it adjusts to the Wisconsin Brewing Co beers and menu changes.  I will probably check it out in the spring some time.",2016-01-05 18:39:31

On both occasions the service has been indifferent and impersonal at the bar. When I tried the food I was sufficiently uncharmed. The tacos were honestly terrible. I was actually too embarrassed and too hungry to complain, and I realize that i should have brought it to the manager's attention, but none of the staff seemed to really care. These were legitimately the WORST tacos I've ever had. The fish taco didn't smell very fresh the ceviche tostada was overwhelmed with overripe guacamole and the chorizo taco was very close to dog food. Dog food might have been better, depending on the brand. Food was cold, bland and the textures were actually a bit icky.
Margaritas are not a shaken cocktail but a mix poured from one of the taps. 
Also, I've never visited a Mexican Restaurant that didn't have a hot sauce that was HOT! At least with the poor quality of the food, some really kicking' hot sauce could have masked things a bit.
We asked for hot sauce and the bartender gave us his hottest. Tabasco is hotter than this stuff! We asked for some chopped haberneros and he looked perplexed. He said no one had ever asked for that before.  We asked him to check with the kitchen, but they only had sauce that was  equally as bland as the first one. 
This place is all location and zero substance. Music is obnoxiously loud to distract from the staff's lack of people skills and the subpar food. Definitely not worth the $$ for dining out as the tacos are super expensive and it's very easy to make better tacos at home and skip the weird, unbecoming vibe here.
Boo.
I will not eat or drink here again. La Carnita ought to be ashamed of this outpost. I feel bad only giving one star, but I didn't find redemption in any corner of this place. There are so many places to get tacos in Toronto-- GOOD TACOS. This definitely isn't one of them.",2017-11-07 02:56:03

This thai restaurant was located in the Bally hotel and casino- somewhat really hard to find. We got there pretty late @ around 10 pm, but the staff was very accomodating and still took out order even though they were near closing time. Since we came in late, we ordered our entrées to go. However, the decor was breathtaking with a man made pond sitting in the middle of the restaurant with Thai statues. 

Food: we started with appetizers: 
Po-pia sod (2/5) fresh vegetarian roll wrapped in rice paper served in pieces and a chilli dipping sauce - I didn't find anything out of the ordinary for this dish -very typical flavours;
Stuffed crab Rangoon (2/5)- crab and cream cheese filled fried Wonton- I really didn't enjoy the cream cheese, it didn't compliment well with the crab.
Our main entrées: (these entrées were not served with rice which you had to order separately)
Seafood combo (2/5)-shrimp, scallop, Tilapia curry- I found the scallops were not well cooked and seasoning was lacking. This was one of the more expensive items on the menu that was recommended by the waitress- I didn't enjoy it at all.
Tofu Pad Thai (3/5)-came with flat noodles, raw mango strips and cooked red peppers. I liked that this dish came with noodles. Mango was a fresh touch to the dish in combination with the red peppers.

I ordered a carne asada and chicken combination plate. It came with pinto beans, a generous serving of freshly chopped steak and chicken, a pile of grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno, with a choice of corn or flour tortillas to go with it.

I opted for corn. There was a stack of 6-7 of them and they were warmed and slightly crispy from the skillet. As I was handed my food, the woman in the trailer added the condiments over the meat with a ladle. It was good !

I ordered the strawberry lemonade and fried zucchini to start. The lemonade was sugary goodness! The zucchini were fresh and hot and we read they were hand breaded. They came with a side of ranch and a side of marinara. They were well liked at our table.

For lunch, I ordered the pot roast sandwich with fries. Friend 1 ordered a salad with fresh fruit and chicken breast with a cup of corn chowder. Friend 2 had a chicken parm sandwich on ciabatta bread.

Friend 1's salad came with a fresh baked muffin of her choice. She chose carrot cake. When all of our food arrived, Friend 2 ordered a muffin for fear of stealing an unapproved bite of Friend 1's muffin!

After doctoring my sandwich with creamed horseradish and salt, it was passable. The meat was tender and warm, but that's all it had going for it. It came on a thick sourdough bun which was good, but I ended up taking most of the bun off to just eat the meat, lettuce and tomato. The french fries were crispy and hot and the ranch I dipped them in was good! I'm very picky about my ranch.

Friend 1's meal was ""eh...ok."" She said the chicken and fruit was supposed to be on the side and not all cubed up. The corn chowder she got with her meal was tasteless. She said she didn't even taste the corn.

Friend 2's meal was ""Decent"" he said that he was starving so he just wolfed it down, but his favorite part was the fries, not the sandwich.

1&2) Milk Foam Oolong/ Wintermelon Tea at 50% sugar- ""milk foam"" is basically their take on ""crema"", which is a thick layer of frothy cream on top of the tea. It has a rich & almost buttery taste w/ a hint of sea salt. I liked how it was sweet & salty, and that the tea offsets the heaviness of the cream. But the tea itself is just something that you can brew at home.

3) Peach Green Tea w/ qq jelly at 50% sugar- this is by far the worst drink out of the four. It might be an off-case, but I was taken aback by the sweetness; it was to the point of being syrupy, and even the slight tartness couldn't cut it. The taste of tea wasn't particularly strong either. You'll be better off buying a bottle at the mart (e.g. Tao Ti 道地) and adding your own jelly/ tapioca to it. 

4) Brown Sugar Oolong Milk Tea w/ coffee jelly at 30% sugar- I've come to realize that their milk teas are sweeter than other bbt places. But even at 30% sugar, it was still way too sweet; it might be b/c of the coffee jelly which was soaked in syrup.

Thank you for introducing me to bacon wrapped gnocchi with the most delectable cream sauce and very meaty and flavorful meatballs in an awesome and rich gravy. 

Although my house bourbon beverages were not not prepared in a heavy handed manner like I normally like and too much cherry juice was placed into one of my two drinks, the amazing food made up for those issues. The next time that I visit you, I will explore your wines on Happy Hour and more of your culinary pleasing tapas.

BTW, the A.C. was blasting and the temperature outside was only in the mid-eighties, so maybe being a little more aware of the temperature outside is something to look into  and possibly expanding your beer on tap selection, because that is very limited.

I don't know if you can grasp just how many scorpions 342 scorpions are unless you see them in a big pile, but I was keeping count of what I was killing when ineffective pest control people were coming out weekly to spray.  Every.  Week.

I was thinking about moving my entire family out of this rental we had just moved into.  I was trying to calculate in my head how much money it was going to cost me to move out.  We were only there for a couple of months, but my kids were terrified, and so was I.  Checking the house every few hours with a blacklight, then walking the perimeter of the house for the same things.

Oh, and then that's when I noticed the roaches.  Not a whole lot of roaches in the house, but outside the house?  Wow.  Crickets too.  It was a scorpion buffet, and they were lining up.  Giving 5-star reviews to the large amount of insects around this house.

Then Green Mango shows up at my door.  I was skeptical because the last guys failed MISERABLY at assisting with this problem, but my girlfriend signed us up anyway.

They sprayed, and I wondered if this would work.  Then the guy offers to come back at night in a week, with a blacklight, to see if we can find more scorpions.

I didn't pay much attention over the next couple of days - until I heard my daughter scream.  Not because she had been stung, thankfully, but because she had just looked out the back door that we NEVER opened because we were afraid of letting bugs in the house.

Dead scorpions.  Dead Roaches.  Dead black widows.  Dead crickets.  Everywhere.

Amazing.

And yeah, he did come back at night, and he sprayed.  Excellent followup.

I went from finding 342 scorpions in two months, to 1 or 2 a week.

I was happy when friends suggested we meet there for dinner. Pulling into the strip mall, you wouldn't expect anything special beyond Chada's door, but you're in for quite a surprise. The decor is sexy with dark woods, crimson accents, dim lighting and a wall of wines. The list of Rieslings go on for days, ""Chada Thai & Riesling"" could very well be appropriate. You'd expected nothing less from Bank Atcharawan at the helm, who gained fame as former sommelier at Lotus of Siam. 

Don't sweat it if you're not a fan of Riesling, there are whites, reds, beers, and sake to choose from. The menu specializes in Southern Thai cuisine, with a focus on seafood. It's a little overwhelming at first, but our group settled on Pad Hed, mushrooms with brussels sprouts ($8), Spicy Herb Fresh Roll ($8), Por Pia Tod, vegetable egg roll ($6), Pou Nim Ma Karm, crispy soft shell crab with tamarind ($19), Shrimp Pad See Eiw ($10), Chicken Pad Kee Mao ($8), and Chicken Pad Thai ($8). 

We thought we'd try a mix of unique dishes and standard Thai fare. The seafood dishes were better than those with chicken. The brussels sprouts were a bit soggy - I like crunch! and I anticipated bold flavor, but it didn't deliver. The fresh roll, on the other hand was bursting with zing from the ginger. The shame of it, was that it was so potent it overshadowed the other ingredients. The vegetable roll was crispy and on point. Overall, I was disenchanted with our choices.

I've also sold a bunch of my CDs, and the most I got for one was $7 -- it was in the packaging and everything. That was $7 more than I paid for it, so I was a happy camper. Odds are, the majority of your CDs will sell for around $2-3, which is better than nothing if it's just a bunch of old crap that you'd be throwing out anyways.

The window displays are always eye-catching and interesting, and if that's not enough to draw you in, the great deals and cool atmosphere should be enough. And that it's open late!",2008-12-15 16:35:41

Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the company as a whole. The servers are always patient and careful with people who have food allergies (like myself) and the ingredients/recipes are top notch. That being said, this location is a MAJOR EXCEPTION.

Every single time I have eaten here, the dishes are made differently and they always include an ingredient I have specified as a severe allergy. Because these allergies are so severe, I make sure to repeat them at least twice, and usually friends emphasize this as well. 

This last visit was ""the straw that broke the camel's back."" I will never be visiting this location again and here's why:

When we ordered a loaf of the gluten-free, vegan flatbread for an appetizer, the server argued with me for 5 minutes about how it's not their policy to serve a loaf. I explained that we visit other the locations in Scottsdale, Flagstaff, Sedona, and Paradise Valley frequently and they all give the full loaf. The manager came out to explain the same thing and they didn't offer a solution.

When my cauliflower alfredo pasta arrived, I immediately noticed that it had peas in it, which were explained as a severe allergy. I don't necessarily blame the server because the kitchen should be responsible for preparing the dish exactly how it is described. She apologized profusely because peas are NOT part of the recipe, and had the kitchen remake it. Later that night and the following week I dealt with an extremely severe reaction, only caused by peas. It's hard to say if they just removed them from the original dish, or they were added to the sauce already and no one cared, but either way, that is absolutely unacceptable.

Besides having a reaction to the contaminated dish, it tasted extremely bland and not at all like dish normally does. Plus, the slice of gluten free vegan flatbread that comes on the side was also undercooked and tasted awful. Good thing we weren't given the full loaf!

I'm not sure why this location is so terrible in comparison to the others, but I sincerely warn those with food allergies -- DO NOT RISK IT -- drive a little farther to one of the other locations!!",2016-10-03 19:45:50

I'd been to Brio twice before (once here and once in California) and this time, out with friends, will probably be my last time. While our waitress was very nice, she was forever missing in action and when she would take our table of 8 drink orders, she'd return with only 5-6 drinks, the others would sit thirsty. We'd flag her down and politely ask if our drinks were coming and she's look through her notepad and look confused, then 10 minutes later deliver our remaining drinks to our parched friends. Salads and appetizers ordered, again, a salad is missing and as two of the three appetizers are brought to the table, the third elusive appetizer never arrives. Meal orders placed, all miraculously arrive. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo, which, by its name alone signifies it is a spicy dish. Ugh, no. Quite flavorless honestly. Bland as the napkin on my lap. My husband ordered the Under the Brick (or something like that) Chicken, he said it was not very good, again, lacking in flavor and depth, he was disappointed. Other items ordered was steak which was said to taste very gamey and sat on the plate next to the watery mashed potatoes. Lobster and Shrimp raviolis were said to be okay, but not fantastic. The friend who ordered the Blackened Tilapia said it was very good, however the plate next to her was the Chicken Milanese was not good at all, overly salted and dry. 
Our check took forever to be delivered. Once we paid it was $113 per couple, including a cocktail each. I usually am not super high maintenance, but I felt like I had to beg for a refill of water or the check. The food was not toothsome as one would hope. Big let down.",2015-11-08 05:21:09

The pud thai is definitely something that caught me. Most pud thai dishes have a ketchup base and you can taste that they are very ketchupy so I usually never order it however I stole a little of my sister's and wow was I amazed the flavor is unlike any pud thai I've ever had, absolutely no trace of a ketchup taste. We had the small pork buns and those were to die for. We also ordered the crab rangoon and the flavor was great and they had that satisfying crunch you look for from a fried food.

But am disappointed u cannot purchase those chocolates. (I've tried) and recommended they offer them for sale! Since they won't really give you any extra..

I would not call this a restaurant, more like a 'self serve cafe', the place is generally very busy, but I manage to come inn during down times. At times the service can be a little slow (when busy), although it is mostly serve yourself. And some of the staff could be a little friendlier... 

How it works; You make your order and pay,  Grab a seat. Wait for your name to be called, pick up your order - enjoy! and once your done with your meal (if your sitting inn) you leave it on the table and your free to go... I personally don't mind it at all, simple- straight forward. No tips,  Or waiting for the bill... Only downfall is when their busy they don't clean up all the tables which need attention and you might be stuck with someone else's trash

We chose this location using Yelp and based on the reviews. Well it must be all the employees friends and family eating here and writing reviews because the rating does not match the quality of food nor the level of customer service we witnessed today. 

First, the food did not seem fresh at all. Everything that came to the table had very little flavour. The tempura shrimp was all tempura and no shrimp. It was also very oily. The texture of the rice was horrible. Let's just say this was the worst sushi we have ever had. We did not even finish the items we ordered because it was so bad. Also, one server kept refilling our cups with watered down green tea every second. We realized they use this trick to fill us up on liquid so we don't eat as much food from the AYCE menu. 

On top of it all, we showed the server the 10% off our bill offer from the Yelp app once we checked in. The server said we could only claim the offer if we paid cash. One out of the 3 of us had cash but the server was adamant about giving us the discount only if all 3 of us paid cash. Since my other 2 friends were paying by card none of us were able to claim the discount as per the server. I have never heard of this ""rule"". Additionally, because I showed the server the discount on my phone, without my permission she pushed the ""claim now"" buttons on my phone screen as if we had already claimed the discount. So even though she came back to the table and said we can't use the discount she already claimed it on my phone so we would not be able to return and try to claim the discount again. Well not to worry because we will NEVER come back to this spot even if we had a 50% discount. Horrible food, and horrible service. If I could give them zero stars I would.

The atmosphere was inviting. The restaurant is in a house built during the 1800s which has been renovated into a chic space. The entrance is on the side. There is street parking in front and a small parking lot in back. The decor was inviting and interesting. There are a couple of different rooms in addition to the kitchen. It's not a big space and the waiting area always had patrons waiting for a table. The bar was packed. The clientele was mainly 20 somethings.

The drink menu includes a variety of good beers, a few wines, saki, and a variety of Vietnamese inspired beverages including some excellent cocktails. The menu is composed primarily of various varieties of dumplings, steamed buns and ramen. 

Our waitress was prompt and polite. Originally we were all planning to do the Restaurant Week menu: pick a bun, a dumpling, a ramen, and a mochi for $25. Based on the menu we originally guessed the main advantage was getting the mochi included in the price. However, after close inspection of the menu and questioning the waitress, it turns out the Restaurant Week meal was only 1/2 the bun and 2/3 of the dumpling. There is no savings for Restaurant Week. The waitress explained it as a chance to try a little of everything. I guess my expectations for Restaurant Week were that you were getting a discount for going out in the middle of Winter but that was not the case here.

The sweet buns were all excellent. Chewy sweet buns, tangy fresh insides. We tried 3 different types. I thought the BBQ was the best, but all were tasty. We also enjoyed 3 types of dumplings. All were best with the soy vinegar sauce. The spicy sauce didn't add much flavor, nor spice. The ramen was the biggest disappointment for me. The broth was bland. The texture of the noodles was good, but although I ordered the tonkotsu which was described as a rich pork broth, it really tasted more like miso but with very little depth.

Although I would return to Umami Ramen for drinks, I think you can get as good of buns and dumplings elsewhere and as for the ramen, I've had much better elsewhere.",2016-01-31 18:49:15

Some find this daunting. Others confusing. But after a quick tour with me, they know what to do.

I urge everyone to begin with the sauce--not too much, but not too little. I aim for anywhere between 3-5 scoops of sauce depending on how flavourful and saucy my cohorts enjoy their dinner. I also accept the challenge of trying to be upgraded in bowl size. I know this sounds terribly trivial, but I see it as a personal challenge to fill my bowl as much as possible to thereby ""win"" at the table when they bring our cooked food. This can be achieved by lining the outer rim of the bowl with a veggie that essentially expands the height of the bowl. Broccoli works well as does cauliflower, and once my mom used mushrooms with some success. 

If dessert pleases you, I suggest the peanut butter blonde or the chocolate spring rolls--both are delicious and entice sweet teeth of all sorts.",2013-04-12 03:46:13

Yummy fried onions on the sandwich, and the meat was nicely smoked. He was quite pleased!

It had been a while since I had dinner at Morton's on paradise Road.. I dropped in recently for dinner with a buddy. I love the feel of the more 'classic style' rooms. I know that Morton's is by no means an icon on the food scene in Las Vegas, but it is definitely a nice change of pace to dining on the Strip or at one of the pricier steakhouses (which I also love, too much;) 

Morton's was recently acquired by Landry's, and thus a few things changed.. nothing really in terms of quality, just a few more promotions and a few additions to the food menu. 

I drop in for Happy Hour now and then, and sometimes for a full dinner. The room is comfortable, the drinks are stiff, and some of my favorite servers have been there for years. Every time, the staff is warm and smiling and the food is consistently good. What else can you ask for?

the FAZOOLI'S CAESER ($8) came suuuper spicy. I didn't even need to ask for it that way! it almost too intrusive as a drink with my meal, and the pickled green bean was weird as a garnish. the ice melted way too quickly, and ended up turning my drink way too watery. bleh!

the SHORT RIB RAVIOLI ($17.88) came with about 5 or 6 pieces but ended up being rather filling. there was a good flavor, but the meat was awkwardly pulverized. Not bad, but I think the concept it sounds a lot better than was executed.

the pizza looked amazing and the osso bucco appetizer smelled bomb.

Thankfully they seated us really fast and served our food fast and were out of there in 30 minutes in time to make our show.  I had the classic cobb salad which was fresh and tasty, and the balsamic (that has beer in it) was pretty good.

My husband had the Marzen BBQ chicken sandwich and he inhaled it but later said it was ""just ok.""  He didn't like the garlic herb fries.  I ate some of them but I prefer my fries with just traditional with sea salt or kosher salt on them.  I wish they would give you the option of not having anything but salt on them.

Anyway I'm giving this place three stars because I liked it (even though husband wasn't thrilled with it) and they served us a decent meal before our Joshua Tree show.",2010-05-20 07:05:43

-The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar.
-You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them.
- Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too!
-You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed)
-Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them.

No. But that's mostly because this place isn't for me. This is a place for someone looking to drop some serious coin on a very good (maybe even great) dinner before heading out to the club. Being as I haven't been to a club in this millennium, and driving house music isn't my bag, I won't be back. That's not to say that this is a bad restaurant - it's just not for me.

Now, as for the review.

Well - the only way for me to review this place is to tell a quick story. My wife and I stopped by looking for a nice dinner before heading out for a show. We were suited/dressed up, and quickly realized we were well overdressed, despite what the prices on the menu would seem to hint in regards to dress.

We were seated at a booth/table combo with the booth facing out to the restaurant and the chair facing the wall. I, being the gentlemen (on occasion, really), let my wife have the view of the restaurant while I chose the view of her. And that was the defining decision of the night.

Unbeknownst to us at the time we were seated next to the rejected cast of the Jersey Shore. Or at the very least the mother/daughter combo. Thick Jersey accent, drunk, and full of drama. The daughter went on for a good 15 minutes about how awesome it was that I let my wife have the view of the restaurant and what a gentleman I was. The mother didn't say much - I'm assuming she was simply too drunk to communicate. The daughter was interrupted by the brother coming in (for apparently the third time) to start an argument with the mother/daughter about the fact that they needed to leave and he was tired of waiting. He came back once more during dinner to do the same. And having to watch them eat (they were seated right next to us, so you couldn't avoid it) was both comical and disgusting at the same time.

Fortunately they left before our appetizers arrived. The waitstaff, who really should have thrown them out, made it up to my wife and I with champagne. Fortunately, I'm a man that can be plied with free alcohol. The little adventure gave us a great rapport with the waitstaff. They took great care of us for the remainder of the night.

As for the food, we started with the foie gras French toast and the shrimp ""rice krispy treat"", which was really a bisque with toasted rice. The bisque was fantastic with just a bit of a spice to it. The foie gras French toast was very good, but the bread was a bit thick, which overpowered the foie gras.

For dinner my wife went for the filet (peppercorn crusted), and I did the ribeye with the same preparation. We both went rare. The filet was perfectly done. The ribeye, well, it was bordering on medium. When the server came back over to ask how everything was, the fact that I didn't immediately say ""it's great!"" let her know something was wrong. She immediately scooped up the plate, apologized, and had the kitchen fire a new one. The second one came out cooked perfectly. In fact, when they came out with the second steak they brought out a new thing of potatoes, which was our side. I give them full props for fixing the mistake instantly.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I don't think I'll go back. That has more to do with the music/atmosphere than with the Jersey Shore rejects. If you're looking for a club dinner before a club outing, stop by. If you're looking for a reserved steak dinner, this is absolutely *not* the place to go.",2012-12-05 21:53:03

They also were running a check in special for a free appetizer so be sure to check Yelp the next time you go.

We ordered the Avocado Egg rolls for our free app, my lunch companions ordered a burger and the chicken sandwich.  Both were happy with their food.  Even though it was lunch, the portions were enough to feed two people.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Poutine which was NOT traditional poutine. The dish was more of an open faced sandwich with a slice of bread on the bottom, pulled pork on top, then a scoop of mashed potatoes topped with cheese, and finished off with gravy.  The dish was good, just not what I was expecting, especially since the gravy had chucks of carrots and celery in it.  I did enjoy the pulled pork and would like to try that on its own as a dish.

Side note: cell reception (att iPhone) is almost non existent. Good luck, iPhoners.

First off, we were starving. We had just gotten back from a camping trip and were ready to gorge on our silverware if we had to. Started off with a couple of beers. OMB and Blue Moon. Always amazing. Let me say that presentation of water is never anything to bat an eyelash at, but Cowfish makes you think twice. Served in a glass milk bottle. Uhh...hello, badass! 

For apps, we ordered the sticks, sweets and strings. If you have a small army of fried food-loving people to feed, this is the appetizer for you. Piled high with sweet potato fries, onion straws and amazing seasoned fries. 

Entrees:

My wife got the green monster, veggie style. So good and topped with an array of chiles and fried jalapeños. Cucumbers were a nice touch and relief from the inherent heat. 

I ventured into burgushi land for the first time. Went for the taste explosion as it was our server's recommendation. I'm at a loss for words. The texture: odd but welcomed. The composition: pretty large. Nicely done and plated beautifully. The flavor: this is where I struggle. So many flavors. The nori, sticky rice, beef, jalapenos and bacon were so savory but separate. Right amount of heat. Just hard to land on whether or not its groundbreaking. Let's say my interest has been peaked and I'm ready for the next roll on the menu. Bring it on, burgushi!

The Cowfish is worth anyone's time. Charlotte native, visitor, what have you, you need to stop in and sample their vast menu. Service is professional, fast and friendly. Warning: be prepared to wait on busy nights! That patio is hot to trot in the Southpark scene. Get in there fast!

The lunch buffet is decent. It doesn't vary much so I know exactly what I'm getting every time I go. Since it's the only Indian place downtown, if I'm craving Indian, this is it. It's standard Indian. Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular.

""I love sushi""

""I meant ramen""

""Oh""

I wrote a bunch of paragraphs about how the ramen here is between decent to great. It's probably too salty for Midwesterners. It might be too fatty, too. For me, I'd rather have more salt and fat. The bao, mantou, or steambun however you want to call it - those guys were good, too.

But I don't really write reviews to tell people what's up and convince them to go to places.

Food inspires me to talk about things. And Japanese noodles in Wisco is a good start. Asian noodles riff off each other all the time, and they're constantly changing and evolving. Ramen itself was an import to Japan, and it has been undergoing more changes to its formula than almost any food. But Madison doesn't seem to take many food risks. This is a ramen shop that would be equally at home in Milwaukee or Chicago, but it's here in Madison. This place could be uniquely Madison by sourcing its products more locally (go RP's) or it could portray the idea of what Madison food *is*.

That second idea is interesting in that to me Madison food at the moment is Wisconsin food in general. It's the Old Fashioned. We have a burgeoning 'food scene' but that's for hipsters and exclusionary. There are a few standouts like Pel'Meni or Banzo, but in general it seems like most places in Madison that have tried to do something different and not established can't find any traction. I was going to bring this back to Umami and how I wish they did hipper ramen like you see in bigger cities, but I think that's an unfair burden. This is Madison, and foreign food is foreign food. We can't have too much of that.

I digress. I'm sure I'll eat here again and I'm sure I'll talk more about Madison food. Some other time tho.",2014-02-24 20:41:28

ONE - To sit on their terrasse and people (or tourist) watch along Crescent street.
TWO - For their 5-8 happy hour (unlike most that are 5-7).

They have great specials on beer and house wine, they even have a few tables in the back that serve free popcorn, pizza, sandwiches, chips, and veggies with dip. If you want actual food, then I'd recommend the wings (one of the best I have tried in Montreal), or their burger. The pub is also great for watching sports, as they have a few TV's dispersed inside.

Prior to my visit, I have seen several people post pictures of their macarons online, but I never knew that it was within walking distance away. I didn't see the storefront until I walked by it; on my way to barre at Barre3. My other half, J, decided to take me to Delysees for a birthday treat, and I didn't hesitate to go. The space was rather contemporary, and clean looking with a lot of white (walls, decor, and chairs/tables).

To the right of the bakery was a long and narrow glass display case, carrying all sorts of delicious baked goods such as macarons, cheesecakes, eclairs, and croissants. I came here mainly to try out their macarons, so that was my main objective. Delysees offers an assortment of flavors of macarons, and it was rather difficult to select only 10. Each macaron is individually priced at $2.25, but you can also get 6 for $13.50, or 10 for $22. I absolutely adore the sturdiness of their box, as both the macarons, and cheesecake remained intact from the walk back.  

I opted to get the 10 macarons box for $22.00. The flavors that I got was praline crunch, red velvet, marrakesh mint tea, salted caramel, vanilla birthday cake, coconut raspberry, blueberry buttercream, roasted pistachio, strawberry cheesecake, and crème brûlée. The macarons had a slightly crunchy shell, but its generous filling was nicely chewy on the inside.

Absolutely delicious! I don't know how they do it but it is bursts of flavor on a Mexican bun. A true Mexican bun, as well. They are imported from Nogales. I was a big fan of their mild (chunky) salsa, bean dip, and queso. The hot was a little too hot for me but my company enjoyed it.

Ed Mirvish was a toronto icon and an icon in terms of torontos theatre community.  for better or for worse, he obviously loved the performing arts so much so, that he managed to build and save large theatres within the city in which we now enjoy blockbuster musicals and the occasional straight play.  He also was a very generous man, as stated above and below my review, with his doling out of turkeys and such.  so, lets just say, that a man like this doesnt go unnoticed both locally by rich or poor alike.

The BF and I have eaten here four times since it opened last summer.  The food has always been exceptional and the décor is stunning in its simplicity.  It's no surprise this restaurant is linked to one in London.  The minimalist décor is reminiscent of the simplicity of Ozumo in San Francisco.  It's worth a visit just to sit in the serene setting and enjoy its aesthetic perfection.  ""Bon Appetit"" magazine named Roka Akor one of the 10 best places for sushi in the US in its April 2009 edition.  

The good news is that the pricing has been adjusted to better align with the current economic situation.  Don't get me wrong.  Roka Akor is still spendy.  Dinner for three ran over $300.  The great news is that they now run a happy hour special every day from 3:30 to 6:30 and again from 9:00 to close.  You have to sit in the bar or on the patio, but they offer half price apps and drinks.  The BF and I are stoked because this means we can frequent this place without having to justify the expense.  The Salmon Avocado Roll is a steal for $5.  The Roka Akor Burgers looked awesome and they are just $1.  As far as the drinks go, this place specializes in shochu infusions.  The Hani-P'ru is an amazing combo of honey comb shochu and fresh pineapple.  They go down WAY too easy and they've even better during happy hour at $6 vs. $12 on the dinner menu; especially when you have three.  Yum!

Our most recent meal was superb.  The food was literally pitch perfect.  The Butternut Squash with Japanese Pepper Broth ($8) was excellent.  Ask them to make the pepper broth spicy like they used.  The spice creates a perfect balance with the fried squash.  Also, don't let this dish linger on the table as the fried pieces can get soggy if you leave them in the broth too long.  The Seasonal Vegetables and Seafood ($15) tempura offered up three delicious prawns as the stars of this dish.  The 3 Sashimi Chef's Selection ($17.50) offered two pieces each of salmon, yellowtail and big eye tuna.  The sashimi was utterly perfect, but don't believe the menu when it classifies this dish as a ""large"" sashimi plate.  We had to order two of them for the three of us.  For sushi, we selected the Salmon Avocado Roll ($12) and the Crispy Prawn Roll ($12) and both were excellent.  We then moved on to items from the Robata grill, which is the main feature of the display kitchen.  The 8 oz. Grilled Prime Beef Fillet with Chili Ginger Sauce ($28) was utterly fantastic and I could have had just this dish as my entire meal.  It was superb, beefy perfection!  We added some of the robata grilled skewers and I really like that the restaurant now offers these by the piece so you can mix and match your sides.  We had the Sweet Potato with Ginger Teriyaki and Sesame skewers ($2.50 each), the Cremini Mushrooms with Garlic and Butter skewers ($2 each) and the Sweet Corn with Butter and Soy skewers ($2 each).  The corn skewers were delightful with just the right char on the niblets.

We decided to try a dessert since they wisely re-vamped this part of the menu.  Previously, the desserts were fairly dreadful in the traditional Asian dessert way, but that has been thankfully addressed.  We tried the Warm Toffee Cake with Peanut Butter Ice Cream and Caramelized Peanuts ($12).  The peanut butter ice cream was amazing and actually tasted like peanut butter with a super silky texture.  The caramelized peanuts were also excellent and had great crunch.  The one area that needs work in the toffee cake.  All three of us noticed it was a bit grainy and gritty.  When I mentioned this to our waiter, he went to the kitchen and came back to the table to tell us it was made with almond flour and chunky peanut butter.  I suggested they work on the texture as the taste of the dish was spot on.

The service is also superb at Roka Akor.  Our waiter has served us three times now and he is attentive and helpful without being intrusive.  He is excellent at helping to navigate the menu and his recommendations are utterly reliable.  When I spilled some soy sauce on my silk shirt he immediate appeared at the table with a wash cloth that had been soaked in club soda for me.  That's service worthy of 20% tip on a $300+ check.

Roka Akor has hit its stride for sure.  Try this place and hit the happy hour to appeal to the recessionista in you.",2009-06-02 19:58:05

A place to hide away from newly-turned 21 year olds, hipsters and soccer Mom's from Mentor who don't get enough attention from their husbands. It's a great crowd. Saturday night boasted live music, a full house and a packed patio. I'm not sure if you can call ahead for the patio, but I'd try because in the summer months it's busy--with good reason.

Although I haven't tried much food here, I did manage to sneak a sweet potato fry from my  cousin, who was paying way more attention to scarfing his chicken sliders. I was divine and there weren't any complaints from him, either. It's likely known they have a great wine list, but I'm loving the integration of those great wines my family loves from Geneva! In fact, the owner works closely with a lot of those vineyards out there, so we get the best of both worlds! 

This is just a great wine bar with an even better vibe, inside and out. And don't miss out on their insanely awesome happy hour prices. Cheap, delicious food AND house wine pours bigger than your face for $4. Melikey. Oh, and ample, free parking!! 

Keep up the great work, Mike and staff!",2012-07-03 00:23:11

Pros:
Ample parking
Bigger selection on items than the other Galleria

Cons:
Food court not as good as other Galleria
Not open 24 hours

This review will be more of a comparison to the other Galleria than anything.  Both Galleria's are pretty great, don't get me wrong.  I just like the Yonge and Steeles location a little better for the upcoming reasons.

First the good things.  I find this Galleria has a lot more selection than the one at Yonge and Steeles.  There were products here that I don't see at that location.  It feels like this location is also larger and able to carry more items.  

The parking here is also tremendously better than the other location.  They have a humongous parking lot in the back of the plaza it is located in.  You don't think there would be this many spots looking in from the street.  This is great because this location shares the plaza with a lot of other places so you do need parking to be ample.  

Now, the things I don't like as much.  The food court was a little disappointing to me unfortunately.  The other location has 4 different stalls to choose from.  Each stall has different types of cuisine.  This place only has the one stall, albeit a really big one.  The seating is also not as good.  There are bar like seats situated around the stall which is great if you're eating alone.  If you come as a family, you have about 10-15 tables to choose from at that's it. I came for mama's chicken and quite frankly, you can do better for Korean fried chicken.  It's good, but didn't match the hype.  Home of Hot Taste blows it out of the water.

Lastly, this location is not open 24 hours.  I have stated the convenience of having a supermarket available at all times during the day.  Most of the Korean supermarkets I find are open 24 hours so it's strange not to see this one as well.  I'm thinking it's about the location more than anything.

To finish, you can't go wrong with either Galleria.  I myself just prefer one over the other.  You will have your opinion as well.  We can both agree though that Galleria rocks!",2015-08-20 12:24:17

She then described every cider that was offered on tap. She told us about the different flavours and notes. She was extremely knowledgeable and i was impressed.

Next we place our order and indicate that we wanted to start with the Gyoza, followed by the Dynamite Roll and the Seared Yellow Tail rolls.  The rolls come out before the gyoza which sort of defeats the purpose of the appetizer. Strike 2.   The rolls themselves aren't really rolls, rather cucumber rolls with piles of fish and other toppings heaped on top of them which makes them hard to eat.  Both of us ended up eating the meat first and then the roll after.  No cohesiveness at all.  Finally, the Dynamite Rolls are chopped pieces of shrimp that on at least 2 of them had all tail and no meat.  Strike 3.

- Pretty cheap
- Very nice modern facilities
- Loads of menu options and they are helpful with customising for those with dietary fusses.
- Communal tables are great for individuals/pairs 
- TASTY TASTY CHILLI NOMS. Ask for a pot of chili for your table too, just to add more insanity.

CONS:
- No reservations and no turning up a little early to grab a table while you wait for your dining companions
- Can sometimes take a while to get a server's attention, and the wait times for meals at lunch can be not so snappy
- I know the ""vegetable lovers"" section isn't specifically labelled vegetarian, but it would be nice to have a mention somewhere that some of these don't have the option of removing fish sauce.

Why pay for the brand at regular price ($80- $125 for watches seen at department stores like Macys), when you can get it all here for way less- watches (including other brands like DKNY and Adidas), leather wallets, leather purses (the sale prices can be high since the retail price is generally pretty up there and the bigger purses can be pretty heavy, just a warning), canvas bags, leather wristlets, belts, jewelry, and sunglasses (except clothes- check the website for that- on a rare occasion, there will be a rack of clothing)- sometimes you will see other accessories like scarves and cosmetic cases. There are many items on the floor that you can touch and feel for yourself but there are items in the glass cases- like the three band watch bundle (just ask an associate for assistance). 

Battery replacements for Fossil watches cost $10.00 BTW. The largest selection of the items are the watches; especially the ones marked $39.99- usually on three tables and in stacks and stacks. Whenever I browse, I always see several styles/colors/bands that catch my eye. 

Everything is neatly arranged. The store is always clean. The staff always greet you as you enter. One of the managers there knows us because we are frequent customers. (But my husband has more Fossil watches than I do.) Nice place to get gifts for yourself and the fashionable hipsters on your Christmas gift list. Busy popular place. Long live the Fossil outlet.

The one on Dobson and Chandler is practically invisible unless you know where to look, but once I found it I thought it was kinda cool that it was hidden away like some manner of Indiana Jones treasure (there's a timely reference for you).

The people inside are BEYOND friendly.  Like, super friendly.

They really do give you a crash course on how to order, and give you samples of everything.

I got the machaca beef and the emerald chicken, with jerk rice and refried beans.  Dear lord.  Talk about scrumtrilescent.  The machaca was so flavorful and delicious, and the emerald chicken was just the most amazing thing I've ever put in a tortilla (beside the one time me and this girl were messing around using food, and I...nevermind).

This review is based upon the macaroons, milkshakes, smoothies, and cupcakes. I have not tried their coffee as I am not a fan of coffee in general, but my co-workers have no complaints!

The decor is super modern, cute and trendy! Very nice touch with a big flat-screen TV in front also, talk about eye-catching. The cupcake displays are so cute! Big clear cases, with sleek cupcake holders! Definitely a grab-and-go sort of place, seeing as there is no real seating area, but there are chairs and 2 small tables just in case you'd like to enjoy your cupcake right away.

I have to say, the first time I got to try a cupcake from here, my boss bought a dozen. I thought they were a bit dry at first, but I gave them a pass seeing as they had JUST opened, and we expected them to be working out kinks in recipes and etc. 

Fast forward to the present..

I must say, Don, the owner, has definitely stepped his game up within the past half year he's been open! I don't know if he's changed the recipes around, or something, but, it's much better than my first experience!

Three days ago, my boyfriend and I stopped in to by a half dozen just before closing. Of course, he bakes fresh everyday, so there weren't as many selections at the end of the night, but the ones we came home with were AMAZING.

I have to say, the ""Wedding Cake"" cupcake is SO LIGHT AND DELICIOUS. It looks plain, and maybe too sweet at first, but it was not overwhelming at all! The right amount of flavor, texture, and yes, it was MOIST! I also tried a ""German Chocolate"" which was promising already because there were coconut shavings all over the top, and it did not disappoint. Again,moist, and not overly sweet, like The Cupcakery's cupcakes can be at times. I was quite happy with our selections. 

On other occasions, because I am lucky enough to work so close, Don frequently comes in to give us some leftover cupcakes, since he bakes daily. The Pina Colada is SO GOOD. I always grab that one first! My co-worker likes the Mint Cupcake, most.

Also, we tend to get shakes and smoothies quite often. I've become a fan of their Strawberry Chocolate Banana milkshake (minus the banana, so i guess it's just the Strawberry Chocolate) and the Hawaiian Holiday. I also got a Vanilla Bean once, and I loved it! It may take a bit for the shakes to come out, but I happen to think they are worth the wait.

The macaroons, are another success IMO. My manager loved their strawberry macaroons and let me try some. I had only known of coconut macaroons up to that point, and I had never tried a french style macaroon, so this was definitely a treat. They were delicate and YUUUUUUUUMMY. They also sell lemon flavor, and if I'm not mistaken, vanilla. I have not tried vanilla, but I prefer the strawberry to the lemon any day!  

I wish Don and Project Cupcake all the best! I will continue recommend this place and send all my customers, family, and friends over!!",2011-08-01 13:03:50

I arrived around noon on a Saturday and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad considering I've heard horror stories about the wait. 

I ordered the classic hand pulled noodles with sliced beef. The first shock was that the bowl of noodles that arrived looked completely different from the picture on the menu, which showed a bright red soup base deeply coloured by Chili oil. In reality, we had to add chili oil ourselves. After getting over the initial shock, we devoured the noodles. I liked the texture of the noodles, and the soup base was decently flavourful. It was also extremely filling. But overall, it wasn't special enough that I'd be willing to wait for more than 15 min for. 

I also tried a meat bun (gou bu li), which they offer individually for $0.99 each. It was pretty good and also quite filling.

The last two days have simply been the straw that broke the camel's back. In the past, I have unhappily tolerated missing items that I have been billed for. I have tolerated twelve packs of beer that that were delivered empty. I have tolerated mixups where I've received sugary pomegranate drink instead of bread. All of these without refund or apology from Von's, simply because delivery options in Las Vegas are so limited.

However, no more. I will gladly pay more for delivery done right.

My reason for the 3 stars is because of a few things. I hate how all of their floats are deflated and gross and they don't seem to keep up with the maintenance on them regularly. Also, their misters on some of the lines need some cleaning out or repairing because while you're standing in line, they are constantly spraying(not misting) ice cold water on top of you, which sounds refreshing in the Arizona heat, but in reality, is just unpleasant when it's constant. Also the lifeguards just seem a little bit young and (for lack of better word) dumb....as they are always putting the rafts up the conveyer belt wrong, because they get caught literally ALL the time.

All the restaurants are pretty much the same decor- a little similar to Hash  House A Go Go- metal elements/industrial central to their restaurants. This one seems bigger/spacious than the one near the University, because it is long- shaped like a rectangle, rather than a square. No drive-thru window. There were three other patrons (more empty than the one near the University which is hoppin') and four people working there. Though there are other Fast-Mex restaurants in the area (El Pollo Loco and Baja Fresh- each one has different favorites), I hope that this one finds success at this historically unlucky location. 

Finally went here over the weekend for takeout. I bought a chicken burrito and a chicken salad for a little over $12 (regular price). I love how all the meat is naturally raised (""Food with Integrity"" is part of their mission statement), at these restaurants. I also love that it is made right there in front of you (kinda like Zaba's & Q-Doba). This way, one can customize. I had the chicken (perfectly seasoned), crisp romaine greens, corn, pico de gallo, peppers and onions, and cheese- comes with chipotle-honey vinaigrette. It's so good, but doesn't need much dressing since I also had the pico- but thinking I might just get the peppers and onions because I noticed my super-oniony  (from the raw onions in the pico de gallo) taste in my mouth afterward. Most of the greens were fresh, just had one leaf that was not good. You can get beans, but I skipped them this time. My husband's stuffed chicken burrito had the white rice (no cilantro), pinto beans, cheese, and sour cream. It took him a couple attempts to finish it. I told my husband we should come here more often. This one's more convenient to us since it's just one street away.   

Adult menu is basically three prices- $5.50- vegetarian, $5.85- chicken, $6.10- carnitas, barbacoa, & steak. Select Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Tacos (3), or Salad.

The fries were good, but the burger was eh.  I expected it to be better/juicier/more tender.  It was cooked more well-done than medium, which is how I ordered it.  Bacon was also a little skimpy.

I haven't eaten here in 4 years because the last couple of times were gross, but I decided to give it another try and after tonight, never again Buffalo Wild Wings. 

We ordered 15 spicy garlic and 15 Asian zing traditional bone-in wings, large fries, veggie sticks, and 3 ranches. The quality of the wings seemed lesser than those of Wingstop; they were small, tough, and over cooked. The spicy garlic sauce was a typical hot sauce with a bit of garlic flavor and the Asian zing was sweet and boring topped with red chili flakes. Although neither of which were actually spicy like their names implied, I definitely prefer the ""spicy"" garlic. 

The large fries looked like a medium from McDonald's. When we order a large fry from Wingstop, I've had 4 adults and two children work on it but never managed to finish it whereas my husband and I alone were able to kill these fries. The veggies had really stringy, strangely bright green celery, and baby carrots. The tiny ranches, which cost 60 cents each, tasted like they came from a bottle of Hidden Valley. 

When I pulled up to pick up my food at 8:30 PM, the place was packed with people parking in the adjacent desert. The girls in the front tilted my box of Asian zing on the side so all of the sauce spilled over the boxes and the bag. Since I haven't eaten here in so long, I thought that the box was holding something which should be stood vertically, but if I worked here and saw to-go bags going out constantly, I would have noticed it and fixed it. So I guess some people like to come here for the scene and the game, but if you're looking for a good wing meal to-go, this is definitely not the place to get it from.",2011-06-01 05:04:28

The VIP experience was worth it as the Zappos sponsored Recharge Retreat including all complimentary cocktails, massages, braid bar, candy bar, and more. The retreat stayed open throughout which was great for getting drinks and VOSS bottled water on a hot day.

You don't get the high quality of food at music festivals like the kinds we saw at LIB. Most dishes at the Culinary VIllage were $10/plate and were from some of the biggest names such as Nobu Las Vegas and Tom Colicchio's 'wichcraft.

The layout was massive with multiple stages and a scale that I heard was even greater than Coachella but with a less crowds. It made for a lot of walking but there was so much to see that even going from 12pm to 11:30pm, we still weren't able to see everything the festival had to offer.

Imagine Dragons put on a great homecoming performance of ""Radioactive"" with Cirque du Soleil cast members performing alongside the Las Vegas based band in what they exclaimed was the true Vegas style of ""doing it big.""

Dawes put on one of the better performances of the day and they are definitely a band to keep your eye out for. They sounded amazing!

I've partied at Marquee many times and have gotten bottle service with my friends 4 times. It's so much better when you have table reservations. You get in a lot quicker. Even if you're all guys. Haha. It's Vegas so expect to SPEND. We have gotten a cabana at night during the summer and that was really where it's at. We had a big group of guys and girls so the cabana was the right call. It was our first time at Marquee and Kaskade was DJ'ing that night so the club was packed not too long after doors opened. You have 2 bottle service cocktail waitresses pouring your drinks. You have 2 tv screens that show you what's going on in the main room. You have storage areas for the ladies' purses/slippers. And mainly, you have a place to chill and sit. Yes, youre gonna need at a megaclub that goes on all night into the morning hours. You will spend money but it will be worth it.

We've gotten table reservations around the pool area as well. Smaller than the cabana but more central to the party. We had a small group of friends in town that weekend so it was perfect. 

There are 3 main areas inside the club. You have the main room where the headliner DJ obviously plays. You have the Boom Box which is the hip hop room. You walk down the stairs and follow the signs. It's always TOO PACKED in there. It's claustrophobia inducing and I'm not even claustrophobic. Go see for yourself. You've been warned.... The last area is The Library which is upstairs and more on the loungey down-tempo tip. There is even a pool table in this part of the club.

Marquee has it all. Attitude at the door, big name DJs in the main room, hip hop and trap in the Boom Box and chiller sounds in the Library.. I'll stick to bottle service outside by the pools. DK Skratchy, DJ Vice and Eric D-Lux are our favorites to come see at Marquee.

If you want to make your tastebuds happy, you can here.  But any main dish worth chowing down on will dig into your calorie purse big time.  And don't get me started on desserts:  The rich and crazy chocolate and raspberry layered cake is nearly 3,000 calories.  The mini size is over 300 calories.  That's just a snack for someone like olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, but for the rest of us that spells diabetic coma. (Tip: Don't broadcast the calorie count of every single menu item.

There were 6 of us at a huge table and we ate and gabbed for so long that the waiter did a cute little sit down and said hi and then got up quickly and left.  I thought he was being flirty and getting off of his feet for a second, but the more wise and knowing in our group realized he was politely saying ""beat it, we need to feed others."" (Tip: it's called a lazy susan.  If you have a big group at a round table, you're gonna' see one of these.  We had zero lazy susan skills all night.

It seems like there's several theaters that have at least 10+ screens and tons of seating. When I lived in San Francisco we had two theaters like this (okay, there was a couple others somewhat close by). 

The thing I really like about Camelview 5 is that it's the one theater in town that plays the ""artsy""/independent movies, yet it's still a Harkins. Same admittance prices, same soda/popcorn deals, etc., as with all other Harkins. 

It's a clean theater, with nice seating, good sound, and yet has a somewhat ""old-timey"" feel to it (although the seats are comfortable, they're not high-back, but they do have drink holders). 

I'm not sure the exact sizes of the 5 theaters here, but two of them are ""bigger"" & the other 3 are quite small. Honestly, I've called ahead a few times to ask which theater the movie I want to see is playing in because I know I might have to get there earlier to see a movie playing in one of the smaller theaters. 

A couple of things to note: 1) The movies here can get quite crowded. I don't mean just night-time movies on the weekends. I've been to several matinees here on weekdays (I'm talking first showing of the day) where the theater (the larger ones) are 3/4's of the way full. 2) They have limited handicapped seating. I often times go to the movies w/my dad who is in a wheelchair and there's been a couple times where this has been an issue. I bring this up because for whatever reason this theater does attract a lot of seniors (who let's be honest...often times have physical ailments that require handicapped seating).

Ordered the Poke Signature (the most expensive one!) which should have Tuna, salmon, tropical slaw, seaweed salad, crab salad, cucumber, edamame, red onion, roasted sesame sauce, ginger, furikake - there was no Tuna nor tropical slaw (I'm not sure if there was cucumber & ginger either). It was replaced with pineapple instead, which was actually pretty good with the grains blend (purple rice(?)). Salmon was a good size - fairly large chunks. Added nori which was just a few shreds, barely noticeable.

For the base, I enjoyed the half grains blend and half zucchini noodles. Regular size portion is just right, not as big as other healthy box places I've tried.

We got there at 8 PM when we had reservation and the restaurant was not even half full. In a city where popular places need reservation it could be because of the location at the fairly new SLS hotel far down in the north end of the strip close to Stratosphere where theres not that much action. 

Anyway when seated our waitress Jennifer tells me about the 50% of Sake bottles and i say we will think about it.  She comes and takes our order and again tries to sell us on the sake bottles where some bargains could be bottles that normally go for about 250 $ only is 125 $. We kindly decline since i dont like sake at all.  

We order 2 appetizers, another small dish to share and 3 mains. We ask Jennifer if the dishes are big as we had eaten a few hours earlier and she says that ""Its a good start"" and that we can order more afterwards.  

For the food:  

*Wagyu Sliders +2
We where informed by Jennifer that this little baby was cooked through since it was pork inside? Hmm why put pork in a slider with the expensive wagyu beef meat so you would have to cook it dry? What does people who dont eat pork out of religious reasons think about a beef slider that includes pork without it beeing mentioned in the menu? Anyway, the sliders where dry and tasteless and the taste of ginger was all we could find.  

*Sticky rice with spicy  tuna +3
Nice fresh tuna and the rice was ok on this signature dish though we couldnt call it spicy even if we tried. 

*Steamed lobster in broth +3
The lobster was cooked in a proper way and tasted ok but since we are from scandinavia we are used to exceptional seafood and this was more ""ok"".  The broth was tasty. 

*Wagyu Carpaccio +4
This was one of the best dishes where the gorgeous meat was the star. Thinly sliced and with lightly seasoned it was a hit dish.  

*Bass with szechuan sauce +4
By far the best dish of the evening. Superb cooked bass that well in pieces when touched. It had a crispy skin and an amazing szechuan sauce with a tangy nice kick.  Order this and thank me later!   

Our little Jennifer came by a third time to sell us some discount bottle Sake and asked if i really had tried it both hot and cold. I really dont like people who cant take a hint and her pushy ways was part of making this dinner one of the worst of our 6 days in Vegas.  I would rather eat on Fatburger or Dennys where the service is nice and with a smile. 

The price with 4 beers was a hefty 141 $ with tax but without tip.  
While the food was not bad but rather mediocre the price and Jennifer was what brought our experience down. And im not very sensitive to high prices as long as the quality of the  food is the same level. We had a +400 $ tasting menu at Alize a couple of days later that was worth every penny.

I've been going regularly since they opened, and it really reminds me of the taquerias in California more than anything. Easily better than Burrito boyz, big fat burrito, etc.

They don't keep much of the meats prepared, which means that more often than not it's cooked to order. They offer 3 types of tortillas iirc and 4+ types of beans. The meat options are also plentiful, and vegetarian orders get pickled onions + jalapenos. The guacamole is worth adding as well, in my opinion.

The sauce bar is well stocked as well - there's tons of variety and the best part is they're all good.

The dessert section of a taqueria is usually pretty overlooked but I strongly recommend the dulche de leche cake and the dessert nachos if you're looking for a little extra. The horchata is definitely worth trying as well.",2016-02-25 19:54:52

*One of the Firkin Pubs all around Toronto
*Same menu everywhere

When you walk/drive around Toronto, I am sure you've seen at least 1 Firkin Pubs around. To be honest I didn't even know they all had different names and then Firkin and that they were all same franchise/brand.

Flatiron and Firkin is the one that's closest to my house so I decided to check it out one night.
All the Firkins are pub style and it has a laid back atmosphere with wooden interior and dimmed light.
They don't have many servers and we had to find ourselves a seat once we walked in.
When we walked in, my friend had to chase down a waiter to find a seat for us, and she def wasn't the friendliest.

Ordered: Irish Fries 4/5

*Waffle fries served with sour cream, diced green onions with melted cheese on top
*My friend was raving about these waffle fries so I had high expectations
*They are indded very delicious, crispy and crunchy on the outside
*For what it's called, there kind of cheaped out on the toppings
*It would have been so much better if it came with more toppings on top
*This was really good with ice cold beer

Ordered: BLT Sandwich 2/5

*Whole wheat bread and lots of turkey meat in the sandwich
*Mayo was served on side and the sandwich was really dry
*Big portion but the sandwich was just average
*Substituted regular french fries for waffle fries (extra cost)
*the sauce that was served with the waffle fries were really good

Dinner combos come with fries which were good and a choice of mashed potato, gravy, cole slaw, cornbread, or absolutely excellent baked beans heavy on coarse black pepper for great flavour.

Fish was way over cooked and the pasta did not taste fresh. I couldn't send it back because I would've had to wait another 30 minutes. I don't know if they had to actually go out and catch the fish.

I was instantly in love with all the products, the amazing quality - the CHEAP prices!

Trader Joe's is like your neighborhood store, except it's not Wal-Mart (YAY.) and it's l much smaller than Whole Foods, which I appreciate. I like to enjoy my shopping trips and not feel consumed by the store I am in. Often while I am at Whole Foods I feel a little uneasy because I have a hard time meandering through their multiple aisles not finding what I am looking for. TJ's is easy to navigate and set up much more like say, Albertson's or Vons. 

Their products are wide-ranging and they offer things you will not find anywhere else. For obvious example: Cookie Butter. 

I also love when they are offering samples and pop up out of nowhere to allow you to try a new delicious cookie they happen to have that day. What's better than surprise cookie? Um, not much.

Their flowers are also pretty much the best you're going to find at any super markets/grocery stores AND the prices are rock bottom. I purchased a sunflower bouquet for $3.99 as opposed to Fresh & Easy who always sell theirs at at least $5.99 but usually more like $7.99+. On my last trip I scored an entire basil leaf plant for $2.99! Yes, that's super cheap, plus the basil plant was in perfect condition.

How does this Lee's get it right, but the Cali locations can't? We had plans to come here to just pick up a few fresh french baguettes for our lunch during the week, but it seems like Lee's had other plans for us. We ended up ordering a whole slew of things.

5 baguettes - somehow their bread at this location wasn't rock hard and didn't cut the roof top of our mouth. Even after a couple days and after toasting, the bread was still tasty and tasted fresh. Great for making toast points for bruschetta, wine and cheese night, or making homemade banh mi sandwiches. 5/5

1 banh mi dac biet (special combination sandwich)- we asked for extra veggies and meat for an additional price. They did not disappoint, they packed the meat and the pickles on high. The sandwich was stuffed to the brim. 5/5

1 nuoc mia (cold pressed sugar cane drink)- this is the most refreshing drink on a hot day if it's done with fresh sweet sugar cane. Maybe the sugar cane they used the day I came was on its way out and way too ripe, it had an off taste to it, like it was almost ready to rott. We didn't enjoy it and couldn't finish it. 1/5

2 cha gio (Vietnamese egg rolls)- this is my favorite here, they are small and always crispy and hot. They are addicting! 5/5

3 banh tieu (hollow donut)- this is also one of my favorites growing up. I love the slight sweetness to them. Either eat it fresh, or take it home and toast it till its slightly crispy. It's good when it's a little crunchy. 5/5

2 pate chaud (pork pie)- the pork pies were all dough and barely a dot of meatball inside. It also tasted like they should have baked it for a little while longer since the dough inside tasted raw. 1/5

1 pate container- great for spreading onto thier toasted French baguettes, or when you make banh mi at home. 5/5

2 day old croissants for 99 cents- any of their day old bread is a good deal it's all 99 cents. 5/5

I'm not Japanese, nor a chef, and I haven't had the luck to visit that land yet. However, when I get to like something that I can eat while getting some kind of comfort, I become an aficionado.

I ordered the spicy veggie option with extra mushrooms.

There was a 10-15 min. waiting time for the magic potions to arrive, but it was worthed. The noodles have a solid recipe and quality. They must be very proud of them because they offer an option of some special ones... I need to try them!

Although my Ramen was vegetarian the broth didn't lack flavour at all. It was rich, delicate, aromatic, balanced, not overcompensated with salt or garlic. It was spicy, not oily, and I enjoyed every single spoon I had. 

My only complains aren't food wise, just some details they could handle to improve the customers' experience. The spoons are too tick and don't allow you to finish every single drop of that delicious soup without taking it straight from the bowl...

The Light Cafe Special Coffee was very interesting, it came in two huge test tubes, one coffee and one milk with nice cups and brown or white sugars cubes for you do DIY your coffee.  I really liked this concept and it was VERY Instagram worthy and as a bonus, I was very happy with the coffee taste, it was perfect for me in terms of the bitterness level.  The lobster rolls took a while to make, but it did not disappoint at all.  Two lobster rolls and the lobster portion was generous and fresh, the breads were also toasted to perfection.  The side dishes, potatoes and salad with Sesame dressing were amazing as well.

Out of all the dishes we ordered, I was super impressed with how the Philly Cheese Steak Croissants was displayed.  It was beautifully displayed and apparently it was super delicious too! I really regretted I didn't steal a bite, but I'll go again next time to try that and order some desserts.

We finally get a waitress to take our order and than we get moved to an inside table. So now we're inside, another 25 minutes or so goes by and we finally get most of our food except the shrimp tempura roll. The food was great, got the viva vegas roll, edamame, and a few other happy hour rolls. We finish all of the food and the shrimp tempura roll still is not out. Asked multiple times about it and kept getting the ""right away"" response. When it finally did arrive, I literally looked at the plate and said we waited all that time for this? It looked so scrawny. I think they used half a shrimp for all 5 little pieces and more rice than I've ever seen on a roll.

There aren't a lot of options for decent dim sum in Chinatown so when we're meeting friends that can't drive to Markham or Scarberia, we suggest Rol San because of it's easy accessible location.

We'll generally try to go a bit earlier than prime dim sum hours but on this particular Saturday, we arrived right at noon.  We were directed to the back room and given a number.  Surprisingly a table for 3 became available after only 10 min. of waiting.

I like the check-list style of dim sum because all the food arrives hot and fresh.  I did have to keep an eye on dishes coming to the table because I've noticed that there's an issue with bringing either the wrong dishes ordered or not bringing them at all.  So we counted up the number of dishes we were expecting and mentally made note of how many arrive.

About the food - traditional Italian fare is freshly and expertly prepared before your eyes (well you can see the cooks but not the cooking).  The short ribs are particularly well done, and I recommend the platter version because the onions, greens, and other fixings are perfect for the dish.  The pasta is freshly made and tastes like it.  Another recommendation: the arancini (fried rice balls in a red sauce).  Hint: don't order the pizza; it might be really good but you don't want to miss the other menu items.

There is a decent wine list and a number of beers, including Italian offerings.  The prices seem high for beer but low for wine, which is a bit odd.

Service is pleasant, although on crowded nights it can be a bit of a wait for your food.  But don't worry -- you will be entertained by the other patrons: NoRTH is kind of a meat market, both at the bar and at the tables, so people watching can be, shall we say, diverting.",2013-08-05 21:45:40

The wings were good, once we sent them back to have them actually tossed in buffalo sauce, though these was something subtly weird tasting about the buffalo sauce....not enough to preclude my enjoyment of them.  They were crispy, just like I like'em!  The cheese fries were awful. The cheese was bad, and the fries were (burnt, overdone, weird tasting) worse!

You can enjoy movies or other performances at the Union Theatre, music in the Rathskellar or on the Terrace, take classes in all sorts of things through the Union's Mini-Courses program, and utilize the Craftshop if you're in need of tools to create things you can't do at home.

A lot of local groups hold conferences or other events in the Great Hall, and while on campus I spent a lot of time exploring all of it's nooks and crannies for studying or otherwise hanging out with friends.

If you're looking to enjoy an evening out on the terrace, keep an eye on what sort of music will be playing -- there's a wide variety, and if you're picky about what you're listening to, you might want to plan ahead.

I would've really enjoyed to see photos of the dishes we enjoyed afterwards, although they do show you the printed menu. Seeing what the dish looked like and comparing it to what our imagination has created throughout the experience would've been the icing on the cake! I hope they take this into consideration as time passes.

By accident, I found this restaurant in the Core Mall downtown Calgary on last Wednesday and had a quick lunch there.

Environment:

I arrived restaurant around 12 pm, which was right at the lunchtime. There were so many people in the restaurant. I had to wait for a table outside the restaurant about 10 to 15 mins. After a while, the server took me inside the restaurant. The restaurant designed into two parts dining and bar. since it was super busy. I had to sit on the bar side of the restaurant. The restaurant was very nice and clean. Inside the restaurant had modern style design. It was a very fancy restaurant.

Service:

After I sat down, the server guy brought the menu and water to me. He was very nice and friendly. He has provided a very helpful suggestion for me to order.

Food & Prices :

TONKOTSU RAMEN for lunch.  It was a little bit pricey around $ 13. The ramen was including pork belly, red ginger, arugula, fried onions, and pork broth. After waiting about 5 mins, my food came out of the kitchen. It was in a big fancy bowl. Looks like it's a very small portion of food. However, I felt super full after I ate them all. The soup was very tasty.

I know that movie watching is more about the film in front of your eyes than it is about its surroundings, but there is something off-putting about seeing a movie in a theatre that needs to drown its lobby in noise, video games, Burger Kings, and gumballs in order to get society through its doors.  At least the Royal, an independently owned theatre with one screen and one candy counter, does not blast your brain with over stimulation so that it is too numb to absorb the offensively inane film that is about to play in front of it.  

The Royal usually plays independent films but it also screens films that have been critically touted and have disappeared from multiplexes (probably because they were too smart for the masses).

Up_xIqP9wTSSyoa2yXJ9eg,Xoqo8B_5bZ_JvmSXt644Uw,UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg,5,4,2,3,"Banjara is a freakin' Christie Pitts miracle.  I am a regular there and I can vouch for its consistency and total deliciousness.  

Here's my top ten list for what makes Banjara great:

10. It's cleaned up the neighbourhood.  That store used to be a seedy Coffee Time.  Then, it was a seedier, ""Coffee Top"" - yup, the new owners didn't bother changing the sign.  Then, if you can believe it, it was a ""Coffee Tip""!  (That was the last straw).  Banjara rescued that little restaurant space next to the park from being forever only a place that only truck drivers or very, very stoned high school students would want to go.

9. Friendly staff.  I've met the owner of Banjara twice and he is lovely.  He is humble and friendly and clearly aims to please.  The waitstaff there are quite warm (if not particularly boisterous) and they do a bang-up job playing tetris each night with the hordes that crowd into the restaurant at dinner time.  Sometimes they actually don't do a great job, but we forgive them.  The food is really worth it.

8.  Hot means hot.  They've toned down their spice quite a bit from when they first opened (no doubt to sooth our wimpy Canadian tongues), but they can really crank up the heat on demand.  And they always ask how you like it.  With a Kingfisher and some Naan?  Perfect.

7. Whole tandoori cauliflower.  Tender, flavourful, sizzling.  Did I mention sizzling?

6. Variety.  Daal Makhani is creamy and rich, a typical northern Indian sauce.  But Daal with spinach is light with south Indian curry leaves.  Aloo Baingan sees big chunks of eggplant left in tact, along with creamy pieces of potato, while their Baingan Bharta is super smokey, rich and buttery with tons of ginger.  The spinach fry is spicy and full of spinach flavour not masked by other spices.  

5. Convenience.  This area is dying for more good restaurants and (as the dozens of reviews attest) Banjara is in walking distance to those of us living in the area, it has free parking and is right next to the park to boot.  So you can walk off your ghee filled stomach watching kids making out by the swings.

4. Rustic spices.  I love dishes that are both complex but you can also taste the individual flavours.  Eating through a dish at Banjara, you bite down on a cardamom pod, a bit of star anise, a crunch of ginger, a dainty curry leaf.  Each flavour is pungent and just right.

3. You can tell that each chef has their own unique flair.  We order a lot of the same dishes frequently and each time, while clearly the same recipe, they have a little something different.  One chef loves more ginger, another makes the eggplant a little smokier, you get the idea.  We really enjoy those little differences, since the quality stays high.

2. Mango Lassi.  Sour, sweet, cold, creamy.

1. Leftovers the next day!

Vegetarian score = 9/10.  Large variety of flavours and dishes and no doubts about hidden meat buried in sauces...",2011-04-27 01:29:34

So, we made reservations to try out this restaurant since we had family in town.  We got seated and waiting 10, then 20 minutes before having anyone approach our table for water even.  I asked the hostess walking by for assistance and she was super apologetic and quickly got someone to serve our table right away.  The server took our order and gave us the perfect amount of attention--not too much or too little--but made sure we felt acknowledged and was quick with any requests we made.  The Restaurant Manager, Sean, stopped by our table and apologized yet again!  The fact that the hostess even brought this oversight to his attention was absolutely not necessary, but was just enough to win us over.  To know that this busy, successful restaurant actually cared enough to notify its manager, and for the manager to come and personally apologize, is what's missing in customer service these days.  He asked us if we wanted anything else like drinks or desserts.  We passed on both, but the server was insistent, and so we settled for the bread pudding.  Ok, so I forgot to talk about the food up to this point since I was blindsided by the amazing customer service.  It was DELICIOUS!!! I'm from the South and every piece of chicken, pork, and biscuit was perhaps one of the most delicious renditions I've ever tasted.  The icing on the cake?

Disclaimer: both my partner and I are of Indian decent and we eat a lot of Indian food on the regular so our standards/expectations are quite high. Also we prefer a certain level of spice for our indian food. Please keep this in mind when interpreting this review.

Environment: on a Saturday night it is very busy and if you show up without a reservation you can expect a wait. They are not very accurate with their estimates of time. We were told 20 and it was closer to 45. The environment is low key. Not much for decor. Seats and tables are close together. There is no music (probably a good thing) however due to the crowd it can be quite loud. Not an ideal place for an intimate date night. 

Food: I ordered a chicken quick combo which came with chicken madras, Nan,  rice, rice pudding, aloo gobi and veggie pakoras for about 15. My partner got the same thing but veggie with paneer makhani. We ordered medium spicy. Our food came quickly since we ordered prior. Both orders were quite mild by our indian standards (so if you prefer spicy order spicy explicitly). Overall the food was ok nothing special as far as indian restaurants go.

Service: staff was friendly but overwhelmed with customers and orders. However if you order your food before you are seated your food can be available for you as soon as you sit down which is nice.

There were a few notable mentions such as the Tuna ceviche and the trio of desserts (O so satisfying!). The jerk fried chicken tasted like flavorless, soggy, overnight orange chicken from Manchu Wok.

If we talk about food quality, service, price this place gets demerits in all three:

Food Quality: 
I tried nearly every type of beef and lamb they had to offer - and frankly they were just ok. The sort of OK that you'd expect from an AYCE hot pot place, except this place isn't. In fact, if you travel two miles to the palms, there is an AYCE hot pot place that blows Chubby Cattle out of the water - the quality is good, and theres even more variety of vegetables and meats to choose from.

The broth, which is critically important in a hot pot place was just okay. So far, no one has lived up to the pretty mild standard of Little Sheep (I wish we had one of these in vegas!)

Service:
Service was pretty bad, but I did go opening week so perhaps they will work this out. Slow to check up when I was out of meat (which you can only get via ordering, because the conveyor belt only carries small items like little pots of veggies or small things like an oyster).

Price:
Way too expensive. I ended up leaving having spent around $80 for myself, trying all the items I wanted and actually was not that full. Each plate of meat costs like $10 (or so) and only comes with perhaps 5-10 thinly cut slices. I would've rather gone to any of the other hot pot places in town, namely the AYCE at the Palms or Yojie and would've had a much better meal for my money.



Long story short: This place is okay, but its overpriced. The service wasn't great, and you have tons of better alternatives: namely AYCE Hot Pot at the Palms which has better service, better food, better price, better options, or Yojie (which is more japanese style) but has significantly better quality.",2016-10-02 22:57:19

Was it thin enough for me to be satisfied that it was that ""crispy, crunches when you take a bite out of it"" crust? No, absolutely not. Pretty chewy and thicker than I would like. But, was the sauce delicious and did the pizza overall do it for me? Yes and Yes. 

I agree with PW in that I will likely ask for it well done the next time I go to see if it helps make it a bit crispier, but more than being a NY style pizza fan, I am a PIZZA fan and this was good pizza.

The prices were too high for the lunch I was getting and the service didn't even exist.  Perhaps they work better as a gourmet store?

I came here last min and made it just in time to catch a glimpse of Capital Cities at the Ambassador stage. I didn't spend too much time there but the crowd participation was lively.  Lots of thoughts went into the production.

Next up was Imagine Dragons at the Downtown Stage which I believe is the main stage just a few blocks away. Navigating was easy since they had directory at every intersections with time slots as well. Or you could take your chance and follow the crowd if you're THAT lazy.

I didn't get to eat anything, but there were plenty of food and beer (Heineken) booths around. I see a lot of people eating pizza and corn dogs.  Think it was $5 a beer 
for a ~14oz glass which is reasonable. 

If you want liquor avoid El Cortez.  Their bartenders were slow with poor attitudes.  Took us 25min for our dranks. Also prepare to have a plan C as they're very limited on their selections.  I suggest going to any bars on Fremont Street instead. We were in and out of Insert Coins within 5min and it was cheaper too!  

I wasn't there that long and pretty much came without a game plan, but still I felt this was a successful event.  Maybe a little understaffed with the P.A.D. (Public Area Dept aka cleaning crew) as trash cans everywhere were piling up. At least the massive porta-potties area were adequate though.  Shuttling from World Market Center didn't seem to be a problem either since most my friends used it.  Plenty of things to do and money to spend stuff on.  I'm rarely downtown but all the space were well utilized.  Easily the best block party I ever been to. If whomever decide to host another LIB event I would most def make arrangements to attend again.

I came here to try their Pho without any expectations. I was starving, and Pho always hits the spot. I ordered a large bowl of their combination Pho (#1 on the menu), Cha Gio and Iced Vietnamese coffee.The coffee arrived first but was surprised, and a bit disappointed, it came premixed. I was hoping they would bring the Vietnamese coffee strainer and all. I wasn't impressed with the coffee. It didn't taste fresh. I suspect they brewed a big batch and mixed it up with condensed milk and refrigerated. It tasted like a stale coffee with crushed ice. The service was friendly and polite though. The lady took my order within quick minute I sat myself down.  However, it took them half an hour to serve the soup and the egg rolls considering the place wasn't busy/packed on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't complain for the long wait as I was watching the bus girl as she cleared, cleaned and sanitized the tables, and the older guy (maybe the owner) admonishing the cashier while he ate his lunch of rice noodles with sriracha and hoisin sauce and broth on the side.

My soup arrived, suprisingly, lukewarm. They were a bit stingy with their fresh herbs and bean sprouts. The herbs for my pho didn't come with ""culantro"", the jagged elongated green leaf. Even the herb accompaniment to my cha gio was lacking slices of cucumber, and had only 5 sticks each of pickled daikon and carrots, and just one lettuce leaf for 4 rolls. The accompanying nuoc cham was very watery, and to say the least, bland. I had to add a teaspoon of chili paste oil for extra kick. Though the soup came lukewarm, the broth was good.  It was beefy and rich but I didn't taste the subtle presence of star anise, cardamom and cinnamon.  I had to add a teaspoon of sambal olek and few drops of nam pla  and a drizzle of hoisin sauce to make it somewhat close to the broth I've tried and savored in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.   Pho Saigon's was/is not as good as Los Angeles' Pho So 1, Seattle's Pho Bac, or Denver's Pho 79 or Fredericksburg, Virginia's South Vietnam House . I usually finish my pho, broth and all but this time, I left half of the broth.

The cha gio was smaller and thinner to what am accustomed to. I didn't taste the presence of the ground pork skin or the rat's ear mushrooms. To me, personally, it didn't taste like a Vietnamese cha gio. It tasted more, and if it was skinnier and longer, like Filipino lumpia.

I should mention that I haven't had poke in Hawaii, so I could only compare Kahuna to Pittsburgh Poke downtown. I'm a big fan of Pittsburgh Poke and so I had the same expectation for Kahuna. 

I'll start with the positives of my experience. I appreciated how clean and bright the restaurant was. It's small and narrow, but since it's a fast service restaurant, the limited tables weren't a problem. They also have a juice bar, which is pretty cool since I don't know of too many juice bars in that area. Pricing is also affordable, which is always a plus in my book. 

And to the negatives. The rice used in my bowl was cold and hard, which didn't taste fresh to me. I'm not sure if Poke rice is necessarily supposed to be warm, but I would have liked my rice to be softer. I chose the kahuna sauce (soy sauce based) for my flavoring and it didn't do very much for flavor. It was quite strange actually, there were some bites in my bowl that tasted like absolutely nothing. I had all this texture in my bowl, but it tasted like nothing. I wondered, did something numb my tastebuds? Odd, right?

I'm sure Thai Basil can do  good business off the assorted Club Central crowd, as either a before or post happy hour eatery. Open till 9pm on Saturday is good for me too. 

the Menu is typical Thai fare. the spring rolls i really enjoyed. they have yellow corn stuffed in side. i was quite surprised by it. I'm used to cabbage, clear rice noodles and various carrots, but CORN!! it was freaking delish. the dipping sauce was accompanied by a small salad.

i ordered Red Currey (Medium Spice) it was very flavorful..but..medium?. i didn't notice any heat. not like in a mild. but like a missing heat. next time I'm going hot. and i pray they deliver the goods. i want scorching. tongue tingling action here.

my homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken, (Mild) we both figured go weak on this one cause she's not a hot person. and if it was weak. toss on some chili sauce. so..yea chili sauce was added.  the flavors were on point. garlicky and full of taste. not often do you see green beans in Asian food. i think the playful touches add allot. 

like David S.B. noticed in his review. Thai Elephant was much hotter. if these two restaurants are indeed related. i wonder why the flavor variations?? 
the decor is also quite different. there was only one image on the wall. and it looked like a WW2 Era picture of a family member who was serving in the Thai Liberation army or something. (i just made that up)
which is a juxtaposition of most Thai restaurants i have been to which have random Buddhist idols and what-nots. honestly i like the change up.

total on the bill for two entrees and an order of spring rolls was 36.Change which is pretty good.

if Thai Basil and Thai Elephant are related. i think they have little twists that make each place different. i look forward to returning.

I really didn't understand what this meant, so asked for more information, and was told, ""Well, we have another seating for that table an hour after you, so you will only have time for appetizers."" 

I asked what they would do, kick us out? The answer was, ""No, we'll find somewhere for you."" Since I could only imagine that this meant standing in a corner, I declined.

After hearing wonderful things from others, I attempted a second time, and sucessfully made reservations.

They called the day of our reservations to confirm, and then cautioned me to be mindful of the time, because I would only have an hour and a half.

At this point, I should have known better, cancelled the dinner, and gone elsewhere...but, I didn't...I know, clearly my fault!

The restaurant is beautiful, the view is nice, decorations very homey and sophsicated at the same time.

We ordered the stuffed quail and pate for appetizers. 

The stuffed quail was wonderful, one of the best things I've eaten anywhere...and is the primary reason for 2 stars!

The pate baffled me...why serve 3 icecream scoop sized lumps of pate with three tiny toast points is just beyond me. A plate really should make sense...and asking for extra is unnecessary. 

For entrees we had the cold pressed duck and the lamb chops.

The duck was nicely medium rare, but I usually enjoy a crispy duck skin and this was soggy and bland.

The lamb was barely edible. The chef recommends medium rare, so this is how I ordered it. It came more than well done. When asked, I did show the waiter (and later the manager) the meat, they saw it was obviously over done. Of course they apologized and offered to re-fire...it was then that I told them of our 1 1/2 hour time limit, and I didn't want to get kicked off of the table!!! 

More apologies, they were very sorry...the manager said she had no idea how the time limit thing happened...but would definitely address the situation.

Dessert was ordered, coffee and donuts. This was a little cup of coffee pudding and 3 beignets...Again, I'm puzzled why a dessert ordered for 2 people had 3 beignets, instead of 2, or 4, which would have made much more sense. But, they were delicious.

The price was above average for Charlotte, and most meals and restaurants in this price range do a much better job.

The menu is reminiscent of much pricier Denny's or Norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.  

Service is just alright, nothing to write home about. In fact I think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. Eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item. 

I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. 

Oh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.

The chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?

I was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  I also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. LOL. Firepits and loveseats.  Maybe I'd give it a higher rating if I had checked that area out.

I'm giving this place 3/5 stars for 2 reasons. 1) service was lacking and 2) portion size is too small. 

My friend and I ordered the mini potatoes and mushroom flautas to share which are small deep fried corn tortillas stuffed with mushroom and potato filling. The tortillas overpowered the entire filling - the best part of the dish was the green spicy salsa and crema on top. But overall small dish for the price! 

For our mains, my friend ordered the tofu bowl and substituted quinoa for the rice. It was good but was missing  'bold flavours'. I ordered the verde chorizo tacos which comes with 2 (not 3 which would be a better portion). The tacos were delicious and our fav from all 3 dishes we ordered. The cucumber pico de gallo that was on the tacos was a perfect topping.

It was literally a conversation of its own the entire time we were eating it. The appie of the 4 little dumpling things I don't even know how they coax the flavours out so well every bite is divine. Yes this place is pricey for a reason! If you don't have resos just walk in at 5pm but maybe with 1-2 ppl max. Otherwise good luck getting resos ahead of time!",2018-08-05 11:55:39

After being enticed post bagel bliss, I arrived at 9:30 am with friends and asked for a gel manicure and a toe polish change. They wouldn't seat me until the last one of the three arrived (Fine), so I picked my nail color and waited. My friend arrived 5 minutes later and we were all seated at the nail bar with mimosas (yay).

Three manicurists came to take care of each of us. When my manicurist got to me, I said hello and she wouldn't even look at me. She grumbled the whole time that taking my appointment was affecting her ""regulars"" to the other manicurists.  Honestly, we were all there and it was a bit humiliating. Here I am paying for my nails to be done, and this woman is rushing so she can get to her regulars. Maybe better management planning?

After noticing a few mistakes, I asked her to fix them, and she sighed and took care of them. When she was done, she confirmed that I wanted a toe nail polish. I agreed. She then asked if I wanted to pay all at once. I said sure. I paid for the manicure, which I thought was odd, and she walked away. The other girls were given massages (I was not), and I was waiting 15 minutes for my nails to be done. For some reason I looked the other way and realized my manicurist was now working on one of her ""regulars"". I calmly asked one of the other manicurists if someone was going to take care of my toes. She then proceeded to yell across the place ""Rue? Ruth? you have to take care of your client!"". My manicurist proceeded to yell back ""I don't want to. I want to talk to this one.""
This proceeded for a few minutes until I was so embarrassed I just asked for a refund for my toe polish. The girls were already drying from their toe polish post manicures, and I was just sitting at the nail bar dumbly. I talked to management and they just rolled their eyes and said they couldn't control their employee.

Pros: Mimosas in the morning, the manicurists are fast
Cons: The manicurists rush you, and the paint job is sub par

I left feeling frustrated, humiliated, and feeling like I had wasted this nail tech's time even though I had paid $35 for a gel manicure and her services. Location is great and they could have a good thing going for them, if they start acting professional.",2016-03-07 14:05:31

The only reason this place hasn't been reviewed yet is because they do a great job of hiding themselves and being as discreet as possible. I have no idea why they insist on doing this, because this place could be one of Cleveland's most pizza place if they did a better job of advertising and promoting.

First of all, the prices are fantastic. On a regular day, it's ""buy one get one free, and a third pizza is half price"". On Tuesday\Wednesdays, it's $5.50 for whatever pizza you want. I think it's cash only on these nights too. Be prepared to wait an hour or so from when you call in because the demand is so heavy...but it's worth it, trust me. Just plan ahead. Life's not so busy that you can't plan ahead to ensure that you'll have mind-blowing pizza for dinner! (And if yours is, you probably need the culinary healing that Pizza BoGo can provide...)

The variety of pizzas they have is incredible. They have traditional pizzas with red sauce that are loaded with flavorful meats, pizzas with Indian topppings, pizzas with Asian-style toppings, and everything else in between. I've never had anything that I wouldn't get again. They don't scrimp on the toppings either! Our personal favorites are the Napa Valley, the Bangkok, and the stuffed-style pizza which is incredible. We haven't noticed any drop-off in quality on the discount days either.

There's no place at which you can eat in, so you'll have to practice delayed gratification (which is tough to do with food this good!) and wait to eat until you get to your destination. I sorta wish they had a place at which one could eat in, but if that means higher prices, I can definitely live without it. 

Pizza snobs may say that Cleveland isn't New York or Chicago and that pizza you'll get in Cleveland is nowhere near as good as pizza you'll get there. Well, unlike those two cities, you don't have to fight through traffic to get to Pizza BoGo or spend an arm and a leg to get a pie either! Besides, I've had Chicago-style pizza from Chicago, and honestly, Pizza BoGo gives it a serious run for its money. Enjoy!",2010-10-09 15:01:24

I like to order the All dressed picante with extra red sauce.  Always fresh and made with really good ingredients.

I am not sweet tooth but I have tried some and they are good as well.  The one thing I never forget to buy is the spicy eggplant in oil, found in jars near the side door, this is the best one I have found so far and goes great either on pizza, or just as a snack or on sandwiches.

The unique thing about Blue Sky is they have lots of covered parking.  Of course they also are a bit more expensive, but the Groupon really helped with that.  They give you a ticket at the gate, and another slip in the shuttle indicating where you parked.  Don't lose that slip as it has their number to call for a pickup if you get back after hours.  The shuttle showed-up pretty promptly.

For shorter trips this beats using a shuttle service like SuperShuttle.  For longer trips a shuttle service would make more sense since the per-day parking charge will exceed the round-trip cost of the shuttle after more than a week or so (depending on how many people you're traveling with).

The restaurant is dimly lit for a more romantic feel or when visiting with family and/or friends I would describe the lighting as intimate. It makes everyone feel like they are sitting at a table in one of the participants house and very comfortable to talk and laugh and have a great dinner.
The FOOD: Tasty and prepared to perfection.. We have made this place one of our signature restaurants to take guest when they are in town and interested in a nice glass of wine and good Thai food. 
We had Ginger Tofu with veggies - Seafood Basil with Veggies & the teenager had Chicken Fried Rice (Go Figure).
Our favorite appetizer is the Shrimp Spring Roll it is so FRESH and flavorful especially the dipping sauce which compliments the flavor perfectly.
This place is a really popular restaurant all days of the week and especially on the weekend as you should ensure you call ahead and make reservations to avoid a wait. The servers are very friendly and helpful, they are quick to offer up suggestions and provide honest feedback on the items on the menu.
The VIBE: Very trendy small bar atmosphere when in that area, however in the dining area you can get anything from business lunch/dinner to datenight feel.

When we had family in town I walked to the restroom with a friend and she was curious so we stepped on the other side and a manager quickly came over to walk us through and answer our inquiries about the additional space.

The restaurant is small in size with a few awkward seating arrangements. The atmosphere is very casual versus the usual fancy schmancy restaurants that Yorkville is known for. I've tried making reservations online but when I called to confirm a few days later the lady didn't know about my reservation. I think there was a glitch on their website so if you are looking to make reservations it is probably best to just call ahead or maybe walk in and be seated. Unfortunately, I experienced slow service the times that I went to this restaurant. I believe they are short staffed as I only noted 2 people working behind the counter making the food and another person taking orders. It took a while to get our orders in as well as our food and bill payments to be processed but due to the lack of staff it was understandable. Our waitress was really friendly and apologized profusely for the wait so we could sympathize with the situation. Hopefully they were able to add more staff to help wait on tables.

The savoury foods on their menu aren't something to rave about. Menu options consist of basic breakfast and brunch items (bacon, egg, waffles, etc) as well as sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The food was simply okay and truly there was nothing special about it. It was not bad in taste but I would say it is not really a place I would go for breakfast food or if I wanted to eat a full meal. This restaurant is more of a dessert place. The cheesecakes are incredibly delicious! I've had the turtle cheesecake which was rich and chocolatey with a decent amount of caramel goodness. The classic new york naked cheesecake was also heavy but oh so good. It is decadently rich in taste and fluffy in texture and you can choose a topping to go with it! I definitely plan on going back to try more of their cheesecake flavours soon.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something sweet to eat. The cheesecakes are definitely worth trying a slice... or two! Hopefully the service isn't as slow as it has been in the past but I guess the cheesecakes are worth the wait because they are that good.",2014-01-04 21:13:30

Having tried to visit Caked once prior, when a sign on the door pronounced them closed ""on 11/28,"" during a day that was in fact the twenty-eighth of April, I decided to give the small bakery a second chance on the Saturday before Mother's Day, the result an experience I'll not soon forget as snooty service, limited selection, and truly awful product collided in disastrous fashion.

Limited in seating and unpleasant in demeanor it was to the Starbucks next door that I proceeded for my tasting and sampling each item in the warm sun a ""get what you pay for"" theme soon emerged, the copyright-infringement skirting crispy fried croissants tasting suspiciously of old oil while cupcakes proved dry and dull beneath competent, mildly sweet frosting - my unconfirmed suspicion that ""slow sales"" meant I was purchasing Friday's unlabeled leftovers from people unhappy to be at work on a Saturday.  One of the worst bakeries I've experienced in Las Vegas or elsewhere I can only assume something has changed dramatically at Caked in recent months as older reports suggest both variety and skill.

Firebirds was the best place IMO to eat in Ballantyne back then.

Appetizer of the Lobster Spinach Queso AKA ""App of the Gods"" which was chock full of lobster and cheesy goodness, it's a bit steep at $11.95 or so but well worth it.
As a purist, I ordered the NY Strip, loaded baked potato and Firebirds BLT Salad.  Being a customer 10 years ago, I remember certain things...the BLT Salad is one of them.  It's not the same as it used to be.  It was still good, but it was MUCH smaller than years ago and the $4.95 add on charge is way to high for less than $1.00 worth of salad.
The NY Strip was also tasty and the inside was cooked perfectly.  The grill was a tad bit hot and the outside of the steak was a bit charred for my taste but overall it was a solid steak that I enjoyed.  I enjoyed the potato also and it rounded out the meal well.
One of the highlights of this place, which hasn't changed is the freakin' awesome bread that is served with the meal.  it is an individual loaf of hot, doughy perfection and to cut out a middle slice and smear the salted butter that accompanies it is something I imagine I will be doing in heaven, if I ever make it there.

We stopped in around 7:30, and there was a decent line, but it moved quickly.  To make it easy, we ordered a family pack for the 4 of us, which includes 16 small tortillas, a pound of meat in a styrofoam container, and another container of cabbage and onions, for $25.  We chose steak, but chicken, al pastor (pork), and birria (shredded beef) are other choices.  We also ordered chips and salsa and drinks.  There's a salsa bar with radishes, limes, pickled onions, and liquidy looking guacamole in the middle of the restaurant.  We weren't given plates and rather than go up and ask, we just used napkins instead.

We ran out of tortillas quickly and still had a ton of leftover meat, but I'd lost my appetite after biting down on a big chunk of fat.

Great food presentation, great atmosphere. My waitress was friendly and chatty, but I went up to pay the bill, the manager seemed a bit stand offish as I decided to compliment the restaurant to him. It was like.....""keep moving guy, yeah yeah, I know it's great.""

The salad was awesome: Asian-inspired, with peanuts and green beans topped with a poached egg and a crab cake.  The pork belly was a fork-and-knife sandwich, piled high with pork and coleslaw.  Far too messy to eat by hand!

Service was great; we had our drinks refilled frequently and the food came to our table quickly, but it felt kind of rushed--the staff cleared each plate the second it looked like we might be done with it and gave us our check as soon as we declined drinks or dessert.

Atmosphere: Tiny, Fast Paced - In & Out eatery.
Cleanliness: Restaurant appeared to be clean, however the cushioned seating had food debris on it. Cutlery, plates and glasses were clean.
Constructive criticism: Wipe down the cushioned seating.
Cuisine: Italian
Facilities: Did not visit the facilities.
Food: My fiancé ordered the Misticanza salad to start. It came with shaved fennel, radish, mixed greens, orange, and fresh dill, excellent size portion. I ordered the Roasted Radicchio salad. It came with fruit, greens, toasted almond, and white wine vinaigrette. Excellent size portion, dressing was the right amount, and flavorful. 

For our mains, we both ordered the large size (6 squares) Soppressata pizza. On the pizza was: spicy soppressata, crushed tomato sauce, Fior di Latte, and fresh basil. The flavor wasn't bad at all. You're not going to get that authentic Italian sauce which nonna makes. Unfortunatly, it was just ok. The pizza could use more flavor. Romania pizza, is usually deep dish in style, so this replicated the roman style pizza fairly. The fior di latte cheese was good. 
Since we were there on a Sunday, Levetto has a free desert special! We chose the Panna Cotta. A seasonal compote, crumbled amaretti cookie, with cinnamon. It was delicious!


Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: We look forward to coming back with our little guy since the menu can be child friendly. Sadly this location of Levetto is not equipped for large groups. We heard about Levetto buy browsing College St. Pizzerias on Yelp.com.
Parking: conveniently located in front of the restaurant on the main road. Since it was Sunday after 5pm, parking was free/
Portion Sizes: Satisfied. We left feeling content! 
Price: Good. 2 salads, 1 alcoholic beverage, and 2 entre pizza's, came out to approx. $65.00
Service: When we arrived, we were greeted by the waiter who sat us. Server was friendly and quick to help.
Selection: Good. The menu offered just the right amount of items. Not overwhelming, and all items looked delicious.
What makes this restaurant stand out from the others: It looks like a fast eatery. In and out.

They spent the time to make sure the damper was set properly to get a nice even flow of air on both stories of the house. Only issue was 5 or 6 broken tiles on the roof.
  Put the heat on Christmas eve and noticed that the unit would only heat up to 70 and then started blowing out cold air and the house was filled with a fog.
  They sent a tech out immediately and he said he needed to replace a part that had to be ordered.  He came back a few days later and replaced the part, but later on in the day the unit started to shut off again.  
  To make a long story short they ended up sending out two supervisors to our home and found the problem was actually an duct  that had been installed incorrectly years ago.
  They went the extra mile and enlarged one duct and re-routed another.  This involved opening up walls, two techs working all day to fix the issues and then sending out a drywall and texture guy so that you can not even tell that any work had been done.
  They did not charge us for any of this work, even though it was not a direct issue with the new unit they had installed.

Must try is the beef pancake and I think it was only $5.99 - Nice soft and crispy flatbread which can be opened up so that you can stuff it with the thinly sliced beef. A little sweet sauce and some green onions and its like a beef pancake party in your mouth. 

The soup dumplings were the only disappointment but they still tasted very good. The soup leaked out on almost all the dumplings :(

The fried dumplings were also done very well. I like the long rectangular shape which makes it easy to stuff in your mouth and love the nice crispy outer layer.

The cold thin sliced beef appetizer was also spot on delicious. Its marinated in this wonderful sauce which I just can't describe and sliced so perfectly thin and the meat is soft and tender.

Finally we also got braised beef noodle soup. Beef was soft and tender. Noodles were nice and thick with a nice chew to it. Done very well once again.

Most of what i've been out to the Royal for are one-off screenings, special cult movie screenings, performances, or festival films. I guess this is what they are known for, and while it does mean that i've gotten to see some cool stuff there, it has limited my reasons for visits. (I also can't comment on a regular ticket price because of this!)

The screen and sound are just fine, and there's a gentle slope to the cinema floor which means you won't be too obstructed by other audience members. The seats are reasonably comfortable, although the backs are strangely sproingy.

Other things worth mentioning - decent lobby space for loitering/lineups at the small concession stand, washrooms are upstairs and have a decent amount of stalls, even if they are crammed in Tetris-like.

It's a nicely decorated, modern looking place. Lots of meat grinders filling the shelves. Not just a couple, but maybe 80 of them. Don't ask me why I found this fascinating. I just did. I also found fascinating the fact that there is a sink located right in the middle of the restaurant. 

My friend and I decided to go for ribs, so we ordered the Vegas Rib plate for $18. Comes with two meaty portions of baby back ribs, and 3 Short Ribs. 

Baby Back Ribs were very good, firm yet tender the way ribs are supposed to be. If you think great ribs fall off the bone, then you don't know good ribs. They come seasoned with a sauce, which was mild with a hint of pepper. Very tasty and I enjoyed them 4.5/5

Short Ribs were also cooked to perfection with a sweet sauce that wasn't korean kalbi sauce and wasn't teriyaki, but a new sauce for my palate. I loved them! 5/5

Negatives..... Cole Slaw....served in a thimble sized dish, this wasn't creamy or vinegary or anything. Lacked any imagination. We both thought it wasn't good.

Table BBQ sauce.....I poured some out and my friend asked what it was. I took a taste, and didn't know. I took another taste....still didn't know. He took a taste, and said it was ketchup. I disagreed because there was a hint of some kind of extra flavor. Our waitress said it was BBQ sauce. I'd pass on this.

Overall, this is pretty decent BBQ, way better than Rollin Smoke. Those guys should visit these guys and learn to cook ribs. Portions were great for $18. Next time I will try a burger as they looked pretty big and delicious coming out to the other patrons.",2015-06-23 00:28:07

One of the highlights on the lunch menu is the Cabernet burger.  The couple sitting at the table next to us each had the burger and we overheard their comments as follows: ""this burger changed my life"" said the man.  The woman called a friend and said ""this is the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I didn't even need to add ketchup!""  I think that about says it all.  I've also had the Cabernet burger, and it is really great.

But that's not all that is on the menu.  You can start with their pâté which is wonderful (although they could give you a few more bits of toasted bread because you run out of them before you run out of pâté).  Their salads are delicious and plentiful.  The sandwiches are great.  I had the Parisian sandwich on my most recent visit (with black forest ham, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, etc., on a baguette) and a wonderful side salad.  I've also had the Panini's, including the Cuban and the lamb.  They are both excellent.

And finally, the French fries.  They are beer battered and served piping hot.  It is worth going there just to have the fries.

Tonight, for I believe the first time a ""chef's special"" was simply that in all its sweet and savory spectacularness- SPECIAL. I order all sushi. 

The chef's special was a tempura wrapped sushi stuffed with decadent chunks of white tuna, wrapped in fresh avocado, topped with gobs of lobster salad. Seriously, does life get any better than this? It is lightly doused with mango puree. It sounds like it would be too sweet. But once dipped in soy sauce and heavily soaked fresh wasabi= HEAVEN. The pearly gates serves this dish daily. Dramatic much? I think not. I spoke with the chef, as I dined solo at the sushi bar. I raved about his food and I shared with him that I have had the first REAL chef special I have ever eaten. He humbly and plainly shared with me...sushi can be so simple: fish, seaweed, and rice. I think, I must take sushi to an elevated place. And he did. I am elated at the final products.

I also ordered the Marilyn Mon Roll. Let it be known: I am a die hard spider roll fan: fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, masago fish egg...tonight I have become a changed eater. The Marilyn Mon Roll is spider roll meets decadence. Fried soft shell crab, cucumber, tobiko caviar wrapped in avocado, topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. The avocado is interestingly wrapped on the outer side of the roll. This highlights the chef's excellent knife skills. Slightly thicker than paper thin. All the flavors are balance. Many places in the 'burgh can provide an extraordinary meal but left unbalanced and often times missing...something. Not here raw fish lovers. Come one, come all- only if your refined palette can appreciate this experience.

Don't be deceived...this is not ""fake"" sushi found at such places as the wanna be sushi joint that immature sushi seekers flock to in the southside. Loved is the art, skill, and tradition turned modern interpretation here.",2012-09-14 01:44:43

I heard mixed reviews from several folks I know, about Zinburger.   As a result, I was hesitant to ""waste"" a rare opportunity to dine alone with my husband on a place that would be 'just OK'.

THEY WERE WRONG.

We got there on a bustling Friday night.  After being quickly seated, our very cute waiter (hey, i can look!) took our drink orders and swiftly fetched a few samples of beer when my dinner companion hesitated with his choice.   Good call!

We ordered some truffle fries immediately, as an appetizer and were they ever delicious!  Super hot, thin, crisp- just the way a fry should be.  

We did dining role reversal- i ordered the beef, and he the salad.

I selected the ""Samburger"", subbing cheddar for the American cheese, and my husband selected the Seared Ahi Salad.  

I had a little of the salad and it really was excellent.  The Ahi was cooked correctly  and the salad had a perfect balance of flavors.  But I came for a burger, not a salad- just sayin'.

The burger was sublime.  The bun was perfectly complementary, not a big blob of industrial bread.  The fixins were all fresh and delicious.  The bacon was thick and crisp, the beef was obviously fresh ground and hand-shaped, not packed into a brick by a machine.

I LOVE me a good burger, and I'd rather have a knockout $10 one every now and again than some mediocre pile of calories.  This burger was worthy.  

Only because I love him did I let my husband have a little of the burger.  That was a mistake because he immediately developed Food Envy.  I had to guard my burger after allowing him that first taste.  I DID warn him, before he ordered his excellent salad, that this place specialized in BURGERS and that he would surely be sorry.  And he was.

DEFINITELY go to Zinburger. Savor a knockout burger and fries.   If you don't eat beef or are a disciplined dieter, you will enjoy the Ahi Salad.",2011-01-15 02:18:55

There is plenty of parking around Hanny's, albeit at meters, but if you go at night the meters turn off at 8 pm. The space is open, so you can definitely tell it was a department store in its previous life. The elevator shaft still freaks me out everytime I go and I am still confused a bit by the bathrooms, although I am not sure if it's because they are trendy or if because I usually have been drinking when I need to go upstairs for the bathroom.

I've had lunch twice now at Hanny's and have sampled both one of the sandwiches - the BLT Supremo (it is a BLT with hard boiled egg and cheese)- and a pizza - Bianco. While I loved my sandwich, I was very underwhelmed by the pizza. However, I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, so that is probably the reason why. The sandwich was a nice size and they cooked the bacon perfectly for me. The sandwich came with some onion straws, so that satisfied my fried food guilty pleasure. 

Prices at Hanny's are, for the most part, really reasonable. The pizza, which is a nice size, was $11, and the sandwich was around $8 or so. I've only bought beer to drink, but my Stella Artois on Friday night was $5. Domestic beers looked to run around $3-4.

Very pleasantly surprised! 

Pub food with a cajun slant.
Things I didn't like: The decor, the seats, the darkness, or their logo. Staff being in street clothes was a little confusing, I almost elbowed the busser when he reached across the table for an empty plate.

Forget all that. The food was really good!

The meal opened with fresh ciabatta bread (w oil/vinegar) and side salads loaded with cheese, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, carrots, onions, etc - or not! They customized each one! Other places would call this a cobb salad and charge you $6+ for it; here it was included with our entree.

The sirloin slider appetizers are basically little mini french dip sandwiches. Shaved beef w jack cheese topped with crispy onion strings and served with both creamy horseradish and au jus. This is a meal unto itself.

The sweet potato fries were thick yet crispy, crispy not greasy tater tots, and Sour cream potatoes au gratin were just a few of the scarfable potato sides, and they have non-potato sides too!

It's been ages since I had a blackened catfish that I would recommend, and here it is at Iguana Mack's! Nice charred crust without over cooking the fish. Not too much cayenne or rosemary in the seasoning, nice balance of flavors! Like I said before, recommended!

     "" The best scrambled eggs that I've had in a restaurant the past decade; or come to think of it ever.""

    Coo Coo's is an appropriate name. You can say that I am coo coo for their scrambled eggs. Maybe with the exception of my grandfather's scrambled eggs, Coo Coo's is hitherto now the champion of scrambled eggs (in my opinion ). The two breakfasts that Coo Coo's served me this year featured scrambled eggs. I ordered the Hearty breakfast plate ($6.99) one visit and the smaller Petite breakfast plate ($5.39) the other visit. For $6.99 the Hearty breakfast plate with a coffee costing an additional  $1.95 is a grand deal. The Hearty Breakfast Plate includes three scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese. Coo Coo's Cafe made me aware that cheddar cheese with scrambled eggs is a winning combination. The cheddar cheese was equally as tasty as the scrambled eggs. I'd choose six slices of Apple Wood smoked bacon over two thick cut slices of ham or two sausage patties. I wasn't coo coo over the bacon. They were good. However, I have tasted better bacon. I'd choose sordough over wheat toast. In my opinion toast is toast. Being adventurous I tried grits. My memory has zero recollection of ever trying grits before I had breakfast in Coo Coos. When the food is good, it is a good time to try something new because you will be experiencing a quality portion of the food. Complimenting the food was quality Illy coffee.

    When I stopped into Coo Coo's for breakfast, I left the fast-paced surface streets of Henderson to step back in time. It reminds me of a diner off US 66. The US 66 diner theme fits in with the Historic Water Street (downtown Henderson) District that is along the Boulder Highway corridor between the Freemont Street Experience and Hoover Dam. I could picture a Hoover Dam worker driving his Model T from Fremont Street on the way to working at the Hoover Dam site. In 2015, Coo Coo's Cafe with a walk along historic Water Street is a nice breakfast choice before the Clark County Museum or Lake Mead. Just pass over this suggestion on Sundays because Coo Coo's is closed. 

  The Water Street Historic District is more than the home of downtown Henderson. It is also the home of a small cafe serving first-rate scrambled eggs. This is my 4 star scramble endorsement of Coo Coo's cafe.",2015-10-09 04:27:43

Everyone seemed to congregate at the middle register. I avoided waiting in line by walking up to the clerk at the far left (empty) register to ask if it was open, which she was. Keep in mind there were 3 registers open, but the clerks at the 2 side registers weren't proactively assisting in clearing out the group of waiting customers nor were fellow customers aware that there were 2 other open registers *sigh*

Macaron was quite good. Intense taste of cassis in the filling. 
The dessert we shared was decent as well. It consisted of multiple layers, base being biscuit and  then white chocolate and fruit puree. The intense puree brought this dessert to life. 
The sandwich was decent as well and quite tasty apparently. The danish with cranberry that I didn't try was actually very good so will keep it on the agenda for the next visit. Still unfulfilled my friend ended up ordering an almond croissant.

The menu is virtually the same from Tony's Pizza Napolitana in SF.  It includes his famous award winning Margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from NY Style, Romana, California Style, and Gluten-Free.  And it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  Don't forget to check out his burgers too.

Same menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional Italian restaurant look from Tony's in SF, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for Vegas actually.  That being said, the pizza is really top notch.  And although I've been to Tony's in SF a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that I still haven't tried.  My friends and I decided on their Cal Italia and the Honey Pie.

Cal Italia -- http://bit.ly/1bGfTSF
Gold Medal Winner - Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge
Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, 
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction 
Although I've been to Tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning Cal Italia.  It's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  Very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  I really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time I come back to either here or at Tony's in SF.

Honey Pie -- http://bit.ly/1kBVpvu
Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese, 
Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers
I've had this pie before at Tony's in SF and I ordered it again to share with my friends in Vegas so they can try it for the first time.  It's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  If you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a Chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that I can compare this pizza to.  Although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  But for some reason, I wasn't tasting the honey.

One honorable mention I recommend from is their Burrata Burger.  I didn't have this at Pizza Rock but I've had it at Tony's in SF.  I think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  You get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1ePXy9t). Definitely worth trying out!  

I think what I like best is that the wait time at Pizza Rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in SF where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  Though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  It looks like Pizza Rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, I can see it doing very well in Downtown Vegas.",2013-12-30 09:00:15

I have wanted some good Hakata style tonkatsu broth ($6.95) for a while and have been excited about this opening for a while. I grabbed this with some extra chashu slices ($2.50, 4 slices) and my favorite Asian drink, Calpico. Was worried about service from early reviews but our server was nice and we had reasonably good service. The place is small, so big parties better call. Very simple, homey decor. 

Onto ""tha bizness""- 

Definitely people who do not like salt should skip ramen since it's presence is there. I do not think it was overwhelming, just the right amount and balanced everything well. The broth was thick, creamy,balanced. It wasn't as strong as some other Hakata style I've had....its somewhere between a Hakata to me and a Kumamoto which is a milder tonkatsu broth. I like to add a bit of chili oil in mine and occasionally some sesame or garlic to my ramen. I tried with and without the condiments and either way was nice. For true Hakata style try some beni shoga (red pickled ginger) and sesame with it. 

They gave me the thin style ramen (think angel hair pasta) which it never noted on the menu and sadly I didn't read Yelp first to know this bit of info. I wanted to have the thicker noodles. Tonkatsu noodles are the straight kind, but I've normally had thicker kind served to me. Oh well. Still, decent noodles, had good bite but prefer the chewier thicker ramen. Ask for the ""curly"" ramen if you like thicker ramen. 

The chashu is cut thinner than usual which was kinda a bust since I paid the extra $2.50 to have 4 deli thin pieces. It was good, nice fat rim that was melty and flavorful, but I don't think the extra was priced right for that portion. Extras is where any place gets you though. 

As for the price on the bowl itself- very fair considering the work put into making the broth, making chashu, etc. It might be considered ""small"" but I think much of us have the big bowl syndrome from pho places. Pho does not take as much effort to make the broth and is cheaper to make.

Is this the best I've ever had? No. I grew up in LA near spots like Santouka and visited and ate my way through ramen alleys of Japan. I think I've eaten the Holy Grail of ramen long ago made with love from a creaky old man who dedicated his life to the perfect bowl. 

Does that fact ruin this place for me? No way. I love that someone entered into the niche market of ramen. It still has the essence of flavors I'm looking for.

_S5CkuHV8kkYv0qcKR491g,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,nrwKiDMr4odCkjx78e5IfQ,4,6,2,3,"I'm not entirely sure what compelled Ruth Carvalho and her husband Phil Marstellar to move to the valley after decades together in the Amazon.  But its clear their partnership has brought the valley something truly special and unique.  When you think of Brazilian food (if you ever think of Brazilian food to begin with) thoughts that come to mind would likely include barbecue or one of those all you can eat meat orgies like Fogo de Chao offers.  For the most part, Carvalho's wants nothing to do with that.  Here its about a variety of traditional home cooked meals that you would sit down to at a typical Brazilian household.  Armed with a meager knowledge of Brazilian cuisine and an empty stomach, I approached Carvalho's for lunch on a Saturday.

Carvalho's is embedded in the Safeway shopping complex on the northeast corner of Scottsdale and Pinnacle Peak Roads.  On the north side of the shopping center (a few doors to the right of the Ace Hardware), you'll find Carvalho's tucked away in this busy complex.  Despite appearances from the parking lot, Carvalho's is quite large with seating for upwards of at least 100-125 inside and another 20-30 outside.  Even more surprising is how tiny the bar is relative to the rest of the restaurant with seating for no more than a dozen patrons.  I grabbed one of the aforementioned bar seats and let bartender Jose take charge of my lunch this go around.  Plantain chips come free on the house as soon as you sit down.

Not wanting to order anything that didn't resemble authentic traditional Brazilian fare, I did what any responsible foodie would do.  I looked up Brazilian cuisine on Wikipedia in advance.  Putting my newfound knowledge to work, a Caipirinha was my drink of choice.  Lime, cane sugar, and Cachaca 61 (a sugarcane based hard liquor).  The national cocktail of Brazil is indeed a refreshing delight that would be ideal for a day on the beach.  For my appetizer, I got an order of Brazilian cheese bread, known as Pao de Queijo.  Six pieces to a lunch order.  No butter is served with these and there's no need for it.  Hot, super soft bread made of cassava flour and a variety of cheeses.  The bread stands on its own as a warm, pleasant, cheesy, chewy snack.  For my main dish, why its the national dish of Brazil of course.  A black bean stew known as Feijoada.   Beans, smoked pork, smoked sausage, and rib meat with a side of rice, collared greens, farofa, vinagrette, and orange slices.  The orange slices are meant to act as palette cleanser, but otherwise just mix in everything else together.  A quick note that you will have to pick out the rib bones and some bay leaves before diving in head first.  Really hearty stick to your ribs dish.  Probably works better as a dinner staple as this dish will surely induce a food coma for some, but nevertheless a tasty mix of meats and seasonings.  And you'll want to apply every bit of that farofa and vinaigrette to enhance the flavors that much more.  For the big finish, it was the Brigadeiros.  Brazilian chocolate truffles served cold and made of chocolate, condensed milk, and butter and topped with chocolate sprinkles.  I was already pretty full from the stew so these were the perfect bite sized finishers.

Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $45.  Per Jose, the dinner portions of many of these items are larger (particularly the stew) and are priced a bit higher so bear that mind.  If you're trying Brazilian food for the first time here, I absolutely recommend you grab a Caipirinha and one of their stews to get acclimated.  I should also note they play Brazilian music in the background here and there's live Brazilian music on Saturday nights.  I'm not sure if I'll ever visit Brazil in my lifetime, but thanks to Ruth and Phil I've now gotten a taste of what I might expect to eat if I do.  And if first impressions are any indication, I'm intrigued.",2018-02-03 21:06:02

The lobsters were delicious. They are chopped up with the shells on, lightly battered and fried with ginger, green onions and garlic. The style is dry, it's not saucy, which is what I like. The lobsters were fresh and the meat easily came off the shell. I really enjoyed it.

My parents said that once they ordered the exact same dish but it came covered in sauce instead of dry. They did not enjoy the sauced version. I can't explain the inconsistency, but if you want it dry, make sure you specify so you don't get your lobsters covered in sauce.

She also said that the turkey burger is what she gets for lunch every day and it was easy to see why.  The onion rings were a let down, though.  They were scrawny, thin onion slices with a breading that was a bit too peppery for my tastes.  I'm also super picky when it comes to onion rings, so maybe that's just my issue. 

Even though we weren't there to watch any football games, it was nice how they had the helmets of the teams playing underneath the TV so you could easily see which games are on which screens.  The service was really quick and we were back on the road to shop some more in no time.  For what we were looking for, Char Bar definitely delivered.",2012-12-11 15:44:58

Elnino hit the nail on the head - WTF is with all the frosting !! 

Bought a dozen to take to my old office mates on the eastside . the ladies in the office luv da sweets big time !! I've tried to keep them satisfied with the freebies i get from the Palms coffee shop ( brownies, cannoli and this cheesecake "" loaf "" that's pretty damn good ! ) , the Eastside cannery deli ( more brownies and cookies ) and my occasional stop at the various cupcake shops. 

When i saw Mathew's review of Gigi and noticed it's about 2 miles from the old office, of course i had to try ! 

Got a variety of 8 different cupcakes and i'm not sure what bothered me more - the ridiculous amount of the frosting or how frickin dry the cake was ...is that why they pile on the frosting ?!?! 

Usually I give a place a couple tries before i throw-down an opinion but it's my sense this is the 'norm' for these cupcakes and i just can't get past the frosting pile ...please please please Retro ...OPEN A 2ND STORE IN CENTRAL VEGAS",2010-07-14 15:33:06

I had a chai tea latte as well, which really hit the spot! 

The new space is walkable to many local businesses, so I believe they will get more busy as people realize they are now here. I can't wait to go for breakfast or for a cupcake snack.

We finally had a night to go out and do something so I thought it would be nice to go eat somewhere different. 

The beer here was very nice. I ordered the Celestial Gold. I'm not a huge fan of dark beer so I thought this would be a great option and i really enjoyed it! Bobby ordered the Polaris Patersbier which is explained in their menu blonde belgian beer with minty/hop aromas and a herbal/pine finish with a little bitterness.. woah that explained it perfectly. How do they do that? I stuck with the same beer and next he tried Pious Monk Dunkel . It wasn't his favorite so he ended with the patersbier :) i noticed a few people ordering the beer sampler (as well as pictures of it on yelp) I did not see this advertised in the menu and totally forgot about it. Maybe next time :( (Where was this located in their beer menu?!)

For appetizer, we ordered the traditional perogies. The onions were perfect! I could have had them as a side dish. 

For dinner, I ordered the southwest chicken wrap and upgraded to sweet potato fries.  To be honest, the fries were not hot at all which was a real bummer because i LOVE sweet potato fries. Everywhere i've went, the restaurant served the fries with a honey cinnamon dip. CBW served with a chipotle ketchup. Dont get me wrong, it was a nice twist on ketchup, but it did not go with sweet potato fries at all. Seriously. Who thought sweet potato fries and spicy ketchup went together? 

Bobby ordered the shrimp & grits.... DELICIOUS. I was skeptic because It seems like a light brunch affair, not dinner but it was very filling and was made perfectly. 

For dessert, we ordered the frozen peanut butter mouse cake. It was okay.. nothing too special.

I found service to be average. The GM was walking around so happy and peppy asking tables about their meal. Also, when walking to the restroom all of the other servers seemed happy and great with their tables. Our server Ashley put no enthusiasm into the night and kind of seemed annoyed when we asked about the different beers. Also, our dirty appetizer plate sat on our table the entire meal even though i put it right on the end and Ashley stopped at our table a few times. It was a little awkward especially because i used to serve and a big tip is to clear the table when you see dirty plates. Whatever.. 

Service, my crappy sweet potato fries & the mediocre dessert are stopping me from the 4 star review.

We enjoyed the beer though and atmosphere.  im sure we will be back soon.",2015-04-02 14:27:12

Like the popular SongCook, this restaurant specializes in korean style chinese food. I ordered the jajangmyeon which is on special for $6.99 on sundays (if I recall correctly) and was a fantastic deal! My boyfriend and I also split the steam buns, which chinese people know as man tou. Instead of eating it plain or dipping it in condensed milk like I'm familiar with they had the store bought thai sweet chili sauce to go with the buns which I thought was novel and delicious. My boyfriend ordered something that came with the jampoong soup and that my friends was the star of the show. The restaurant was generous with the seafood in the soup, and the soup itself was extremely flavourful without being too spicy for me. It was so good I'd like to go back and order it even though jajangmyeon has always been my go to dish at korean chinese restaurants. And the icing on the cake was that portion sizes were great and prices (with the exception of dishes like the tang su yook) were very affordable. Overall great place for lunch/ dinner and a good alternative to Song Cook which is nearby.",2015-11-07 01:48:59
J8xIyyP0opcK10wbFo0LKQ,8YaFdh5fGg-M6KPIHv7ivw,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,4,1,0,0,"Overall rating is a 3.75 so I rounded up to 4.  I have been a fan of Cracker Barrel for years.  I love their comfort foods.  This is the first of their restaurants here in Nevada so there are some teething pains.  Due to its newness and location (right next to the Silverton which with Bass Pro Shops attracts the same clientele that Cracker Barrel will) there is usually a wait, often quite long.  When I went there last week I was told the wait for breakfast was 40 minutes.  It was actually closer to only 30.  Even though they were packed the service was fine and the food good.  Are there areas for improvement?  Sure, but that'll come with time and with the thrill of a new place being gone.

Now some hints to make your visit better:
1.  If you're given a longish wait time then you can kill some of that by going to Bass Pro Shops.  But since your name may be called earlier than you were told don't stay too long.  They can't hold the table.  Don't be like the whiney woman who complained that they wouldn't sit her large group because some had gone ""next door"" to Bass Pro. Be advised that it isn't ""next door.""  It's across a large parking lot.  I'm sure it took her group a good 20 to 30 minutes to get back together once her name was called, but I'm sure she would never mention that tidbit in her negative review.  Lady, it's unfair to all the other folks waiting to be seated to have your table held because you and your group was not patient enough to hang around Cracker Barrel.
2.  If you don't like the country store portion a) don't go there or b) don't buy anything there.  But that's like complaining a sushi restaurant has too much raw fish.  The store is one of the things that Cracker Barrel is known for.
3.  Don't expect to have a ""healthy"" meal here.  It's American comfort food.  If you want your vegan, glutton-free tofu salad go someplace else.  
4.  Even though the restaurant is in Vegas it does not serve alcohol.  

So in closing I'm glad it's here.  I'm hoping the crowds die down soon so I can go in the afternoon or evening.",2016-09-08 18:16:23

My boyfriend suggests Red Robin, YUMMM! We were excited walking in- he already knew he wanted the Whisky River BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. 

Cons:
1. We were seated at a visibly dirty booth. I used my hands to sweep the crumbs off the table and seat before the hostess put down the menus and didn't offer to wipe the table down or seat us elsewhere.
2. Service was slow, it took us over 30 minutes from the time we put our order in to receive an incomplete order. My boyfriend got through half his burger before his fries came.
3. The cheese on both of our sandwiches was coagulated on top of the meat and my bun was really soggy- must've been sitting in the window for a while.
4. The bathrooms were a little dirty.

Pros:
1. Most of the food was good; onion rings and vanilla milkshakes especially. 
2. Regular fries come bottomless (we usually upgrade our side though).

All in all, we probably won't be back to Red Robin for a while- if I had another choice for burgers (in this case you have at least 2- In-N-Out and Smashburger) I would probably head there. There's a certain expectation of service for $40 at a burger joint, and RR was severely disappointing this time around.",2013-04-14 01:52:45

I came here on a friday evening around 7:30 and got a table for four. There aren't many seats at this place. Probably 20 seats and a bar that fits 6-8? The air conditioning can really only be felt at the front. There is no AC near the back at the bar. The overall place is fairly no frills. The decor is minimal. 

The table is a bit sticky and the service is decent, but not great. However, considering the price point of this place, I understand why and have no problem with it. 

I had the carbonara and the pasta was cooked very well. It tasted a bit too peppery, but overall was very delicious. Pastas are generally $10-14 and is very reasonable.

So lately I have been going on a regular basis.  It's a really fun place to take guests, and a much bigger deal than one would think from descriptions of the establishment.  

Organ Stop Pizza all about the show, not the pizza.  The 2-level eating area is quite  big, surrounding a tall stage on three sides.  When the show starts, all of a sudden a beautiful and ornate organ with a musician rises in a slow spiral from the stage. The musician is incredible, not only playing a 40 minute set of show tunes, but also managing all of the buttons and plugs to operate numerous instruments around the ceiling, along with dancing cats and a quacking duck. During this time the background and various pipes, seen through plexiglass, change colors.  

Organ Stop doesn't open until 4:00, so there's often a line waiting to get in.  No worries; it goes very fast.  Some people love the pizza, others not so much.  There is a nice salad bar.  Drinks are cheapest when ordered by the pitcher, and this includes beer and soft drinks.  There are no free refills.  Ice cream is also sold.

After an intermission, the second set of music may involve patriotic songs or singalongs -- whatever the talented musician feels like playing that night. Anniversaries and birthdays are recognized. It's a lot of fun for every age.",2017-05-03 03:31:25

Once the bartenders saw us, they took great car of us. We started off with two beers since they had a GF beer for me! Then we ordered burgers. I can't even remember what my other half ordered since I was drooling over my El Gaucho Verde burger. I couldn't decide between two but the bartender steered me toward the Gaucho and he steered me right.

The burger was perfectly topped with alfalfa sprouts and other deliciousness. The sauce was just perfect. I'll certainly be ordering this burger again! We also ordered a sauce of the house made sauce, but we didn't like the ""secret sauce"", so we ended up dipping them in ranch.

-    Dollar chicken tacos on Wednesdays!

Employee of Excellence™ 
N/A. Or, María. I'm betting someone somewhere involved with this Roberto's Taco Shop is named María. Let's just say María. Yep: María.

In A Sentence™ 
Do not -- under any circumstances -- get the maximum permitted twelve [12] dollar tacos on Taco Wednesday and try to eat them yourself. 

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------

I used to live near this Roberto's. (Don't ask.) How is this germane: I used to come here habitually. Never had a problem; however, I also never tried the chicken tacos at all. Fast forward two leap years: I find myself on this side of the valley one night and I figure why the fuck not. 

Well: I'll tell you right here why the fuck not!

You might end up on your knees begging for, oh forgive me please, when you're a non-theist.  

Don't do it. Don't get the maximum allowed (per customer) dozen dollar tacos and attempt to consume them all. You'll be sorry. You'll also lose more than a dozen U.S. pounds. That's several kilos for those on the world's system.

Don't do it. 

Get a burrito or something. 

Don't say that no one warned you.

Located inside the Eaton Centre, it's big (2 floors) and bright and airy.  Everything is stocked well and clean and neat and there are several sales associates around if you need assistance.

Their main focus is their jackets - the first floor is 90% their lightweight puffy jackets...I have my eye on one but will wait a while since I don't need it now.  Their colour palate  (except for the coats) is fairly muted - don't expect bright colours or lots of prints.  It's a lot of basics with a few interesting pieces.

The second floor is kids and more women/men items and the jeans are on this floor.  The prices overall are ok - I saw a few things I liked but didn't try anything on so I can't say really the quality or fit are worth the prices just yet, but it looks (and feels!) like a lot of their fabrics are the higher quality cottons, wools, etc.  So maybe it is worth the price.

Can you say: UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ? yes, I've always wanted to start my review off like that! The sound of thumping noise! w00t

What makes this club stand out from the other places? Its kind of hard to say, but what I enjoyed the most was the DANCE FLOOR.  The LIGHTING and SMOKE effects helped create an amazing dancing experience.  I was *FIST* pumping all night! Sweat till you can't sweat no more, I say.

Wipe that sweat off your forehead and head to the PATIO.  Its more or less impressive at night (anyways).  Being that it was Winter, I was not able to enjoy the poolside much but it was nonetheless good to look at as well as the surrounding hotels with pretty glowing lights.  There's ample room to move about, so if you get tired of body bumping on the dance floor, definitely come out here to cool off before you gyrate like a lunatic again. 

One more thing to mention, there's a little stage out in the patio with a ginormous display that lets you peep into what's happening inside.

My lovely guests and I were on a guest list to their LIBRARY BAR which was a few flights up as you get past the Elevators.  Once you make it up the stairs and pass the bouncer, you are now inside a quaint bar that appears to look like a library.  And no, not like your local library, like a private home library inside a fancy home.  Hands down, a great secluded area to chill away from all that noise happening downstairs.  But if you want to checkout the action, there's a side door that allows you to stare down at the dance floor.

While all these things are great and fantastic, the most ""cray cray"" and annoying thing about Marquee was the stairway that you MUST take to depart the club.  It was long and luckily I do not wear heels! That's the only complaint I have.

If you have a crazy itch to get your dance on, I highly recommend coming here.  Happy UNTZ-ing!",2012-02-03 18:51:06

In the Vegas of the Before Mirage (BM) era, buffets were a source of cheap eats for gambling addicts coming down from round-the-clock binges.  The food was slop but what did you want for $3.29? If you hit a jackpot you could live it up with dinner at the Palatium Buffet at Caesar's Palace for $7.

With the advent of the Mirage, Steve Wynn figured out you could OVERcharge for everything including buffet slop and suckers would still cheerfully pay.  To this day, the only reason to eat at a buffet is if you're getting a deal. I received a half-price coupon for the Rampart Buffet.

Aren't buffets pretty much all the same?  I once ate at the Parisian buffet, which seemed pretty special.  Otherwise a buffet is just a feeding station, a venue for shoveling in the overpriced slop.  

The Rampart Buffet offers a decent variety I suppose.  Italian, Asian, American, and a full line of desserts. I tasted a pickle from the deli table, but it was just OK.  By far the highlight was a tasty salmon filet. In hindsight, I should have just had that with a salad.  But that's the problem with a buffet, you want to try all that crap just because it's there.

The dessert station has an impressive chocolate fountain with a large silver bowl of fresh strawberries nearby.  You can treat your strawberries to a La Dolce Vita romp in the Trevi fountain of chocolate. I was tempted. Those strawberries made me think about the tasty tidbits Anita Ekberg's lovers must have enjoyed. 

But I thought about the chocolate circulating all day in the open air picking up germs from the coughs, sneezes, and guffaws of the senior citizens.  I'm not a germophobe but for some reason my mind went there. Do you think they change the chocolate daily? Maybe not. They probably allow all sorts of microscopic critters to multiply within that gooey mass for several days.

I tried to eat small portions, but there are so many things to sample I wound up with a severely bloated belly.  Surprisingly, the macaroni and cheese was tasty.  I don't even like the dish, but it looked good.  You won't believe how far this is from Krapft.

While wolfing down my lunch I noticed that all the customers are old farts, which stands to reason since the Rampart Casino is practically a Scampi's throw away from a mammoth retirement community in Summerlin. Concievably they are the last generation for a long while to enjoy a comfortable retirement. I wonder if they appreciate how lucky they are.

The casino itself is pleasant and relaxing, far better than the ghastly Suncoast just up the street.  The parking garage is a confusing mess.  Just make sure you pass the first driveway and pull in where the sign says ""Covered Guest Parking.""

I'm giving this buffet four stars only because it doesn't seem any better or worse than the typical arena for crazed gluttony. What cured me from buffets was the Circus Circus and Excalibur buffets years ago. Those were just pig troughs dressed up with Formica and steam tables. Compared with those, the Rampart Buffet is pretty sophisticated.",2008-12-11 23:37:23

And that's exactly what we set out to do. We called it our Appetizer platter. The server named each of the sashimi and sushi nigiri that the Chef prepared for us. But as soon as she left, we wasted no time and dig in into our little pockets of joy using our chopsticks. We asked for fresh wasabi, too. The fresh and herb-y and citrusy and slightly bitter flavor of fresh wasabi is worlds apart from prepared wasabi, for sure! Well worth the try, really.
Place does get super packed. When we called, we were told they were not busy (yet), and that was at 7:30 on a Friday evening. When we arrived at 8:00, they got very full and very busy! But no worries, the staff greeted us, and immediately made us feel ""right at home"". The place is relatively small and narrow, but our table towards the back of the restaurant was comfortable and not as tightly packed and claustrophobic as the ones upfront. 
Finding parking might be a bit tough (since they are close to the Orpheum), so plan to spend some time to hunt down a parking space nearby.
On to the purple rice. There's an overhead TV by the cash register which explains why it's better than white or brown rice for you--its rich in antioxidants and minerals, and has been dubbed an anti-cancer superfood. Well, I still will remain fond of the traditional vinegar'd white rice (I prefer its sticky texture over the drier and nuttier flavor of the purple rice. But don't take my word for it. Gotta try it and then you form your own opinion about it). 
So, once again, the Omakase plate is worth every cent of the $35.00 price tag. Hubby and I ordered not one but TWO Omakase plates. It's that great!

The Capital Grille offers the best deal and the finest quality of cuisine of the bunch: choice of salad or soup, entree, including three steak choices, side dishes of mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, and creme brulee or flourless chocolate espresso cake for the relatively low price of $35, less than half of what this meal would ordinarily cost.  The bread basket contains an interesting assortment including a matzoh-like item which was delicious and crisp.  The butter pats were soft and an excellent accompaniment to the bread basket choices.  My sirloin steak was delicious, but part of it (ordered medium rare) was raw.  

The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable.  My wife and I were provided a spacious booth in a part of the restaurant that was not particularly noisy, though we were forced to wait for a good while despite there being many empty tables and booths when we arrived for our reservation.  I believe the idea is to get customers into the bar with a cocktail before they are seated at a table.

$15 for a delicious, but average-sized martini is profiteering.  I was surprised that there were no draft beers at a restaurant such as this, particularly one which has a large bar.

Our service from Koy was efficient, pleasant, gracious, and delightful.  Unlike the high-pressure tactics employed by our overbearing and overpowering server at Eddie Merlot's in Downtown Pittsburgh recently, Koy did not force us to listen to a lengthy recitation of dishes nor try to force anything on us that we did not want in order to pad the check.

I came here with high expectations and left sorely disappointed. Do you love typical Thai food flavours? Like the ones you find in most Thai restaurants in North America? Then this might not be your jam. I've never tasted Thai food like this before (perhaps this is more 'authentic' or simply a regional style I'm unfamiliar with) but the flavours were so off-putting that I couldn't even eat the food. We ordered several dishes recommended by the waitress and I didn't like any of them. The aroma and the flavours were just...no. Not for me. Perhaps it's my 'untrained' palate, but it is what it is. A few weeks later I went to Khao San Road with a group of people, ordered everything on the menu, and was in Thai food heaven. That place is just more my speed, sorry Kiin.

Also I didn't love the service. It took well over 10 minutes for anyone to approach our table after we were seated, and then the wait staff changed over (or something), leaving us drink-less for quite some time.

This is not the kind of Chinese food that I'm used to.  The fried rice tasted like smoke from burnt oil.  Some people might like that smoky flavor, I don't know.  First couple of bites of the main dish, I couldn't really identify what I was eating... it was not a good taste.  It was blah, oily, too much thickening agent, not enough soy sauce.  Is this chicken or what?

Their food is different.  The waiter explained that it was east coast Chinese food.  For example the chicken chow mien is with bean sprouts and not noodles.  They call the one with noodles something else.  Which is fine and they were more than willing to give me the other dish.

The brats were excellent. We had the spicy, the beer, and the duck. All great. But the most impressive thing in my view was the beer selection. Great belgian and german  beers to choose from, and some excellent USofA selections as well. Great beers, great price point. 

DId I mention that they serve a freaking boot of beer too? AWESOME! I will most definitely be coming back here to get loaded on huge Spaten's and great house made brats.",2012-07-19 00:27:41

I went there with a friend after a workshop at nearby FoodShare, and we were both delighted -- with everything from the knowledgeable and talkative server to the decor.
To me, these factors add a lot to the meal experience and help transport me to a different food world.
My big food politics issue these days is food waste and how we throw away so much food that is delicious just because it doesn't look or sound right. So my eyes lit up when I saw Kaleh Pacheh, a soup or stew built around the juice of hoof and brain. Talk about not wasting any part of the animal! I believe this is one of the hallmarks of genuine folk cuisine, shows something about a people who haven't always been able to eat ""high on the hog,"" as it were.
The dish wasn't only environmentally correct. It was delicious, especially with a spritz of fresh lemon and the addition of a few whole garlic cloves. Bring breath mints and enjoy!
The flat bread, also a welcome alternative to commercial yeast-based brads, went perfectly with the soup -- though I noticed next day on the scales that it didn't take any weight off me.
So this is a great way to learn about Persian food and culture, which, in my mind, is a big part of the mission of great restaurants -- to promote food literacy and social understanding by addressing the brain through the tastebuds. 
That is the argument I make in my e-book, Food for City Building, which is premised on the multifunctionality of food and its ability to fulfil many goals.
You'll even learn that the Persian word for tea is what led to the Indian name for chai tea -- all part of the fascinating history lesson we get at a good ethnocultural restaurant.
Padon the suggestion, but why not act on the educational mission of  restaurants by having a page inserted in the menu that says a few words about the tradition leading to the food we're about to enjoy?",2015-03-07 13:26:22

Spa/facility:  Located on the 8th floor of the hotel, they noticed a difference in decor and ambiance from some of the other lower end spas.  The clientele was also notably different.  From the start, the facility was top notch, clean, and very impressive.  There were a number of things they enjoyed about the facility.  They liked the ""chaise"" that was submerged in the pool.  They liked the special ""showers"" that had programmable functions (rain fall, misting, etc.).  They enjoyed the relaxation room and view of the strip.  
Service:  They noted right away a different level of service.  They were assigned their own hostess that escorted them throughout their treatment.  Everywhere they turned, someone was there either to assist, clean, or just being helpful.  They did not feel rushed or pushed in anyway.  Only negative was that our friend's therapist was very chatty and did not get the hint that she wanted to be left alone in peace and quiet.
Value:  This spa was by far one of the pricier ones...but then again, you definitely get what you pay for.  For day spa use its $80 (on NYE)!!! All in all, they enjoyed their service and would definitely recommend it if you have the $$$ for it.",2014-01-02 20:02:18

I was driving home a few weeks ago and zeroed in on what seemed to be a new bakery in my 'hood. Woohooo!!!! 
Yesterday I had off work and promised myself a trip to this new sweet spot. 

Sweet indeed!!!! Sweet ice cream, sweet cupcakes, sweet employees!!! I stood frozen, paralyzed with indecision. I was praying they would be more than just good frosting like Sprinkles. Prayers answered, Hallelujah!!!!
After asking a question about almost each cupcake I settled on the employees recommendation, the chocolate sundae cupcake. First let me tell you I'm an icing girl. At a birthday party my plate is always left with scraped/licked off icing and a plate of cake. At Smallcakes my plate was left half and half. Only reason I didn't eat the whole thing is bc it is indeed very sweet. Delicious moist cake, delicious icing, delicious filling. My only recommendation would be more center filling, but I'm pretty gluttonous so it can't be really held against Smallcakes.
I also sampled their fresh made ice cream. There are approx 8 flavors I think but I tried the Carrot cake and Cookies and Cream. Both sssooo fresh tasting and amazingly delish!

We ordered the  appetizer of cold antipasto  that was supposed to have olives Parmesan cheese and peppers that it didn't come with. It also had a poor presentation  and looks like it was just cold cuts slapped on a plate. When we told the waiter that the olives and the roasted peppers were missing he took our plate back to the kitchen and he came back with two olives and no peppers because they were all out. We also ordered the caprese salad and I asked for more Olive oil which was clearly lighter than the olive oil that was drizzled very cheaply on the salad. I guess they don't want to give out the good olive oil. We order the tortellini Alfredo and it was tasteless and we also ordered the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce that barely covered the ravioli itself and when I asked for more I was told that I would be charged extra for it!!!

My friends got some banh mi, steamed buns, and Vietnamese coffee. I ordered the combination banh mi and my hunger was sated. Nothing stood out or was overly special about it. Their bread was on the squishy side. I heavily prefer the freshness of the ingredients and crisp bread used in the sandwiches from Dakao. The Viet coffee was pretty bold and strong, but provided the needed caffeine fix. They fill the cup completely with ice, so there's not a lot of coffee, but the stuff packs a potent punch.

At the time, we thought the food was pretty decent. That is, until a while later, they ended up feeling queasy and one friend had stomach pains. It was enough for us to throw the remnants of our food away immediately. No question.

This is by far the worst place I have ever gotten an eggs benedict. The eggs benedict's hollandaise sauce was so thin and had an odd flavor. It wasn't creamy and fatty like I am used to.

BITE. There... I said it, Bite Groceteria is a locally owned independent grocer and everyday eatery. Some don't know that there is an eatery inside the grocery store...NOW you know!! They're located in the heart of Inglewood and they just had some renovations done to their dining area and it's AMAZING. Before, they had more of an open concept, you had to go to the till to order and pay then have a seat. Now, there's a wall that makes things a little more intimate as well its more restaurant style where a server comes to you. The décor is great, super sweet, simple, and casual. Booths are comfy. 

Their kitchen is open until 6pm on weekdays and I believe they only serve brunch/lunch on the weekends from 9am to 3pm! I usually hit up Bite on the weekends. This past weekend I went and was really impressed with the renovations, I really liked the atmosphere and how they changed things. It was around 12:45pm on a Sunday and there were 3 of us. There was no wait! A server quickly came to attend us and offered us coffee and gave us menus. We were all feeling brunch so two of us went with a breakfast burrito and one went with a classic bacon and eggs with a side of sausage.

The breakfast burrito had scrambled eggs, cheese, spinach, pico del gallo, sour cream and beans wrapped in flour tortilla and came with hash browns. We got the sour cream on the side. The classic bacon and eggs looked really good, came with hash browns, toast and house made jam that changes every other week. We all seemed to enjoy our meals, the burrito was simple but tasty - I love sour cream so I slathered my bites with it and the hash browns had a nice crisp. 

Service was good, our lady was really friendly. After we ate and paid, we strolled through the grocer, places like these always have really neat things you can't find in your ordinary grocery store. They have a bakery tucked in the back with fresh made goodies and loaves of bread! 

I'd highly recommend stopping by BITE for a bite! Great simple affordable brunch that won't break the bank or if you're in a rush and need a grab and go, they have a ton. Oh, and they have AMAZING cake pops....you're welcome ;)",2017-03-16 15:47:30

I actually went to Corks Wine Bar up on Erie Street of Willoughby, OH to get drinks with friends and to watch March Madness game on tv. While sitting at the bar, I started chatting with the owner and he told me he had had a store in Ohio City called Market Avenue Wine Bar. He gave me his business card and signed his name telling me to present this at Market Avenue and get a free drink on him.

With that being said... about 3 months later, my friends and I threw a surprise birthday party for our friends at Market Avenue Wine Bar. Here are my quick observations:
1. the decor of the wine bar is cozy, antique, unique, beautiful, 
2. plenty of drink selections.. more than enough
3. awesome staff, quick service, friendly staff
4. quiet place to grab drinks

The decorations in this place are so worth seeing. The couches are all unique in its own way and the place is set up perfectly for a big party or just a couple sitting down for a nice comfortable drink.

I don't love espresso based drinks but they are excellent here, and the pour over and small fresh pots of filter coffee are just exceptional. They manage to balance all the layered uniqueness of lightly roasted craft coffee with an appreciation for the bitter buttery chocolatey comfort that draws people to coffee in the first place. They make delicious homemade chai and serve perfect pots of looseleaf tea, and earlier this year they partnered with one of the absolute best bakeries in town, Rhubarbe, to get batters which they bake fresh each morning so they can offer a small and delectable selection of hot muffins and cakes pretty much all day.

The inside was clean and cute but nothing spectacular and in all honestly the menu was nothing exciting as far as drinks go.

I ordered a Watermelon Limeade because no coffee options stood out to me and my friend ordered a Tangerine Lemonade (which i guess is one of their ""specialty"" drinks.)

I tried the duck pate, duck breast and cheese board to go with a prosecco.  The best out of them is the duck breast. Duck pate is good, but it's a lot of pate for 3 pieces of bread, they should provide a proportional amount.  Cheese board was disappointing, they were low quality cheeses.  The prosecco didn't taste good too.  A complimentary prosecco from four season spa taste better than this.

Service is a problem here as others mentioned.  The server didn't offer coat check for us, I realized they had it later when I saw others got the service.  The server didn't come by for water, not once!  One of us ordered coffee and it was totally forgotten until we asked again, yet, no apologies.

We have a baby and find that it's a challenge here, this place is Not kids' friendly!  They don't have a ramp outside, it's only stairs outside.  When we were sitting at the table they didn't provide a high chair until I asked versus Toula, which I just ate on the weekend they were very attentive to my baby, they offered high chair right away.

The pool tables looked nice and the place had a good crowd at the bar just after 11am (that were discussing David Limbaugh's new book ??? ) plus a family at a table.  This wouldn't be my first choice for a family lunch but it isn't inappropriate.

My friend had the bacon burger with waffle fries and the Asian slaw.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with waffle fries.    We were surprised to see that the waffle fries were sweet potato but they were crispy and tasty.  My friend liked his burger, but they forgot to put the bacon on and brought it out in bowl, the bacon was obviously overcooked and hard.  The chicken sandwich was well cooked but had a slightly overpowering grill flavor and could have used some kind of sauce.  My friend enjoyed the slaw. My Left Hand Lager was good.

This doesn't sound too bad so why two starts?  The servers were both friendly but inattentive.  I sat with an empty glass for a long time, and it took forever to get the bill and be rang up.  The prices were also too high for the atmosphere.  It was $36 for our lunch, Guinness is $6 a pint.  Monday is $1.50 PBRs but it wasn't Monday and I don't like PBR.

BBQ truck served faster than the burger truck. I recommend bringing a chair, blanket and either BYOB or buying from Common Market. Also, had a Popsicle from the cart in front of Phat Burrito. It was tasty as well/cost was $2.50. The trucks all take cash or credit. The cart was only cash. This was probably the first time I have been to a food truck.

The next day, still craving pizza I walked over myself and decided to try again. It was open! Despite a rocky start, I loved it! It was like a subway for pizza and done in minutes! I love all the organic portions, plus gluten free dough available! I'll have to take my family who is gluten free there to try it out. I had the traditional dough with red sauce, fresh mozzarella, pecorino Romano, reissued garlic, organic mushrooms and Italian sausage. Then to finish after it was cooked I had them add a drizzle of olive oil, shaved Parmesan and fresh organic arugula. 

It was incredible! I loved the size for the price and how quick it took to make. I will definitively go back! I also really like that it is a locally owned business. And the decor was really chic!

Chompies  has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two. So bring a big appetite.  Chompies serves all the authentic deli sandwiches, soups, salads, bagels, breads and desserts.

 The sandwiches at Chompies are delicious. The  Pastrami and Corned Beef are perfectly lean, piled high,and very tender. If you make it to Chompies you have to try the Original  Jewish sliders.  These sliders are incredible. Moist lean brisket, piled high on challah roll, a mini potato pancake on the bottom,  with jack cheese, served with a side of hot brown dipping  gravy, I can eat those everyday.

My friend always raves about this place, (he usually goes Friday nights for the all you can eat crab legs) so he brought me here for lunch today to try. Friday, around 11am, no wait to get in. Restaurant less than half occupied. They were going to seat us right next to (and almost on top of) a huge, obnoxious group of people, although there were other close tables in that same little section. I wasn't going to ask to sit at a different table, but my friend did. Hostess moved us 3 tables over from where we were going to be originally sat. Menu offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, and had a lot of options!! Also several options for us herbivores! It was a good 10 to 15 minutes before anyone came over. I figured service might be a little slower since we moved to possibly a closed table/section, but this was extreme. Especially since we were located very close to the kitchen walkway and servers were constantly walking past, ignoring us. Eventually a server strolls over and flatly says ""do you know what you want?"". No ""hi, how are you, sorry about the wait"", nothing. She was very unfriendly, borderline rude. He ordered the special, steak and eggs with pancakes and cottage cheese, (huge meal) for $8.99. I ordered a personal size (7 inch, $5.99) veggie pizza. You have the option of thin or regular crust, to which I ordered regular. We both ordered waters at that time also. She brought our waters, and then we waited. And waited. And waited. A good 45 minutes passed. He ordered medium for his steak, so it shouldn't have taken that long. Our food finally arrived. This is the only reason I gave any stars at all. His steak was cooked correctly, and said everything he had tasted good. My pizza (cheese, green pepper, onion, olive, mushroom, and tomato) was great!! They did burn the outside of the crust, but everything else was fresh and full of flavor. Never were offered refills. She did ask at one point how everything was. Took a while for her to drop the check. We were at a 2 top, very small, yet our table was never prebussed. (We had several plates due to his big meal). Cashier at the front wasn't friendly at all, either.

You can easily access this restaurant, which is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel by entering in their garage parking & find a spot in the East side area. Once you get in the elevator, hit the button #2 that says Wicked Spoon and Convention Center. When you come out, walk to your right & in seconds you'll be hearing some jammin' music & see an array of colorful artwork all over this place.

I checked in with the hostess & was told to walk in the middle of the room, where another hostess was waiting to escorted me to my table. Quick & prompt just the way I like it ;) I sat in front of two nice sized flat screen tvs to watch the sports channel. It was literally a money spot. Front row view & nobody to block lil' ol' me. I like this spot.. oh yes I do.

My server, Jonathan acknowledged my presence & was greeted ever so swiftly as he finished with an order from another party. Giving me his undivided attention, he did the squat to talk to me, which I felt was a better way in interacting and actually connecting with a guest. A more personable approach I would say... I asked him if there was any way I could take my food to go, since I explained that I would like to share it with my Family and he was more than willing to oblige my request. 

He went over the menu with me & gave me the highlights on each item I was interested in trying. I appreciate his honesty on how I should get my Salmon cooked and what I could possibly add if I would like it to be more juicy & flavor in the Turkey choice that I ordered. Jonathan was very helpful and didn't mind taking the time to let me know what he thought would enhance my dining experience. Kudos to that & without even giving me my food yet & I gave him his well deserved tip. I think he even bowed & said thank you so much. Wait.. I think I bowed to him first?!?? Eh it's in my culture to bow when I appreciate & respect someone. Koreans have a certain hand gesture when giving someone a card, dish, drink, anything exchanging from one another. Don't mind me.. I'm just being ME.

Tom Turkey Sliders ( comes in 3's ) from the Tiny Buns Section - When you first glance at these trios... Adorably cute. It consists of sprouts, cucumber slaw, & Russian dressing on the side. The dressing itself is between a hint of Horseradish & Thousand Island Dressing. It gives off a tangy bite at first, then instantly mellows out like cream. The tiny buns oddly enough had the texture of taffy.. a bit on the dry side, But I ended up liking the chewy bites. I generously dipped my slider in the dressing & although it wasn't all grand slam.. I was pleasantly happy with the meat portion, which was thick & juicy. 

Crispy Pork Belly Bun - ( comes in 3's ) Think of Peking Duck Steamed Bun & instead of chives, its thinly sliced cucumber & pea shoots. I swear there was cilantro in the mix too. The hoisin sauce is more like a Chinese barbeque-like sauce that has somewhat a balanced mix of tangy, salty, and sweetness some fruity undertones. The steamed buns were fluffy and so soft. The pork belly was nicely cooked to perfection in such a way, being so tender, yet crisp on the outer portions of the meat. A combination that anybody would love.

Captain Hook - I ordered the grilled Atlantic Salmon medium as my server recommended and it looked ravishing. I would say this is a good looking burger. Succulent and vibrant. Marvelous in taste combining the house cured gravlax aka thinly sliced raw salmon atop with the grilled salmon. Together with pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo, and frissee leaves.. This was definitely a Hit for me, especially if you like textured meats. I chose the shoestring instead of steakcut fries that comes with this meal. Thin, crispy, and tasty! I have to note.. the meat was unbelievably moist and juicy. I'm Hook'ed!

My Family and I enjoyed all the burgers. The music at Holstein's is fresh. Even made me want to workout in my mouth and tapped Both of my feet to the beats. Friendly staff and wonderful service. I would recommend Jonathan again to be my server. I did observe his interaction with his guests while waiting for my food to go. He was exceptionally polite and attentive to every table he had. I even heard compliments to him from another table next to me. I did skip on the shakes this time, but the Oreo is my favorite! The artwork here is uniquely admirable.

Green Curry - Beef $8.75 Chicken $9.00 
(broccoli, snap pea, bell pepper, pea, sweet Asian basil in Thai green curry with coconut milk and Thai herbs, served with steam rice)
You can choose the spice level which is really great too. It was a very light curry that primarily had a coconut milk taste so it was really creamy and delicious. The jasmine rice is really well made. 

Crispy Spring Rolls ~$4.00
(cabbage, bean sprout, carrot, bean vermicelli, black fungus, bamboo shoot, wrapped in spring roll shell (made from wheat), deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce)
They're good. You can't go wrong with these. :) If you grab one of those hole-punched card coupons you find at almost any hotel or tourist destination, these can be complimentary with your meal. 

Thai Noodle Soup ~$7.95

Haven't been here in a while (maybe a year) and it seems the food has gotten worse. 

The Currie and laksa were seriously lacking coconut milk and didn't seem as flavourful as I remembered. Vermicelli had less ingredients and mostly vermicelli noodles. 

Prices were consistent (~$7-8 per dish) so this may be a result of cut backs in ingredients from rising food costs... But I'd rather pay a little more for the quality to remain high.

Cookies aren't cheap-the lowest priced cookie was $1 a piece! 
I will say, you see quality.
I opted for a lemon cheesecake (mini)-for $7-and prior to that asked if it was a creamy style or heavy ricotta (true NY is thick and heavy) as I prefer the latter.
I was told it was ricotta, but found when I ate it leaned more towards a cream base.
The lemon flavoring was not derived from the cheesecake but a topping of lemon glaze :-(

The dining room was very nice - black and white colouring, soft lighting, lots of windows and mirrors. It is a very nice atmosphere to enjoy quality food.

The many components of each dish complimented each other perfectly. The beet appetizer included an excellent cold goat cheese that, when mixed with honey, made for a creamy, somewhat sweet dish. The cod dish was excellent. Fish was cooked perfectly, and the carrot-based sauce had a mild curry flavour.

Dessert may have been my favourite course. The creaminess of the white chocolate with the intense fruit and tart flavour of the raspberry granita was perfect. I highly suggest saving room for dessert!

I stumbled (no, I wasn't drunk despite the stereotypes that exist about the Scots) across a flyer for Churchill's during a visit to The British Shop on Thomas and Hayden (SW corner) and thought I'd pay it a visit one night with my family and satisfy those cravings I'd been having.

Overcoming the fact that this pub was in a strip mall (unusual as anyone from Britain will tell you), I stepped in and was immediately greeted by a very friendly co-owner with an authentic, English accent. ""Boy, they weren't kidding when they described this place as quintessentially British, were they?"" I thought to myself. True to form, premier league (English) soccer (or football as we Brits tend to describe it) was playing on every television set. A dart board lay off to the side and a pool table occupied the space adjacent to the bar. I also noticed some posters, which were advertising the pub/restaurant's quiz and karaoke nights -- both hallmarks of a decent establishment back in the old country believe it or not. The next test for me was the menu.

I wasn't going to be disappointed. All the classic, British pub favorites were on the menu, e.g., bangers (sausages) and mash (mashed potatoes), bubble and squeak (tasty concoction of potatoes, cabbage, and leeks), shepherd's pie, and of course, fish and chips (fries -- you'd be surprised how many people screw that up). I chose the fish and chips and thoroughly enjoyed my meal with a little malt vinegar and just a dash of salt and pepper. The organic apple cider (alcoholic -- we don't have non-alcoholic cider back in Britain -- we call that apple juice)  was quite excellent. My husband (the designated driver that evening) drank the coffee, which he swears was better than that sold at Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. He paired this with the prime rib, which he claimed was perfectly cooked in between mouthfuls. 

At one point during our meal, the owners came around and asked how everything tasted. Why is it everyone has a knack of asking you that question  when you're in the middle of chewing? Anyway, after hastily swallowing our food, we duly informed him that we would be returning for a little taste of home. I was very impressed by the overall quality of the food (yes, quality is a word that can be associated with British food), as well as the friendliness of the staff and owners. 

This is a great place to meet up with friends (even with kids -- they love the pool table) and enjoy a relaxed meal and a couple drinks and I'll definitely be doing that on occasion with my friends. Five stars!",2007-12-27 23:07:58

We were greeted and seated promptly upon arrival but we quickly asked to change tables when their air conditioner blew gusts of cold air right on top of us.  So stay away from the windowed areas would be my first tip.

We were currently having lunch during happy hour so we ordered the Italian Trio of the limited happy hour menu items.  It consisted of cold dishes of marinated zucchini, sauteed mushrooms, and caponata.  I asked two servers what caponata was and they could not describe it at all.  They said it was ""capers, mixed with other things"".   I looked it up just now and it's eggplant and celery seasoned usually with sweetened vinegar, capers, in a sweet and sour sauce.  I don't typically like to eat eggplant and I would have not ordered this if I received an accurate description.  The entire dish was okay but the bread that came along with this was hard and difficult to bite.  

My wife and I had the Chef pizza while my daughter had a typical cheese pizza that she enjoyed.  Our Chef pizza was a thin pizza topped with parmesan slices, basil, red cherry tomatoes, olive oil, arugula, parma ham, and buffalo mozzarella and light with the tomato sauce.  While the main portion of the pizza was soft and foldable, towards the crust it was a tough and bland.  The buffalo mozzarella was small, the ham a bit sparse and not consistent among the slices.  An average slice but not quite to par with a cheaper and yet tastier Settebello's. 

Service was friendly.  Attentive, but maybe a tad bit much.  Our server asked us how everything was before we even started to try our food and then asked how everything was twice more within the next 5 minutes.   Maybe that's nitpicking but sometimes I just want to enjoy the company of who I am dining with but with the peace of mind that I can find my server when needed.

Overall, a decent option for pizza in Townsquare to compete with those offered by nearby restaurants.  This is definitely the most authentic 'Italian' style pizza in the area if that is what you are craving for.

p3Mwtl2PfXHRlFo0GKKNmA,8bKpyXdiYF3ZKIB3QyEiVQ,70aGCiw6WJ1_GTs1VT5NMQ,4,4,1,0,"The One of a Kind Show is a vast celebration of unique ideas, talent, and imagination, the kind of event that reaffirms my faith in humanity despite an age of box malls and conformity.  If you love shopping at Wal*Mart or Target or the like, please, stay away from One of a Kind... you probably won't get it, and you definitely aren't deserving.

Ranging from quaint, sentimental throw-backs (crochet, handmade christmas ornaments, etc) to cutting-edge graphic design (laser-cut steel wall hangings), there's really something here for anyone who appreciates craft and artistry.  And while I would guess I was indifferent towards roughly 75% of the shops on hand, 20% were exceedingly interesting and 5% blew me away.  The great part is that these percentages will differ for everyone, and the content thereof will differ too.  I may not care for hand-carved tree-faces, but maybe you'll find them delightful!

My three complaints are relatively minor, but I think they bear mentioning:

1)  There is a distinct lack of comfortable seating in the venue itself.  This place is vast -- I spent 7 hours there -- and being able to sit and take a load off in the venue itself would be most welcome.  Especially if, like me, you've had knee surgery 5 days prior.
2)  The food court is pretty crap, and Pizza Pizza dominates.  This is the One of a Kind Show... offer me some One of a Kind food, please!
3)  Also on food, it seemed that a lot of the people selling their homemade sauces/vinegars/whatever were not particularly knowledgeable about ingredients or source.  I was turned off quite a few such vendors when they couldn't tell me where their ingredients came from, whether they were organic, etc.  I just don't trust your spicy vinegar if you don't know the age or origin of your balsamic, let alone exactly what type of hot pepper your'e using.  This may be more a staffing issue than anything.

I'll leave you with some highlights:

The Peppermaster www.pepperfire.ca/  
This man makes some of the best hot sauces I've ever tried, maintaining flavour while offering some killer heat. His hottest sauce, made with the famed Butch T Scorpion pepper (one of, if not THE, hottest peppers on the planet) is killer good.  He's also a genuinely very nice guy.  

Getz Glass alyssagetz.com and tommycudmore.com
Some seriously inspired glass work.  I particularly love Tommy's ""steam walkers"", robot-ish walkers with huge, creepy glass eyeballs.  

Charlevoix Pure Laine Wool charlevoixpurelaine.ca
Simple, well-crafted 100% wool outerwear and socks. Charlevoix is trying to re-ignite the wool industry in Quebec after it died decades ago.  Currently, the vast majority of quebec wool ends up in landfill.  Thankfully, I can now wear some of it on my head.

Gosia gosia.ca/
Gosia is a gifted illustrator who also incorporates clay and 3d elements into some of her art.  At times melancholy, often whimsical, I just plain loved her work.

Muma Fine Woodworking muma.ca
Made from wind-fallen and salvaged wood, Wayne Muma's furniture is stunning.  He had a cabinet he built from an applewood tree that had fallen on his property; he air-dried it for three years.  That's dedication to craft!

NicoNico www.niconico.ca
Nico has devised unique, hand-made wooden parlour games the likes of which I've never seen.  His website is under construction, but if you're reading this review post January 2012, check the link.  His betting/racing game, Hadz, is brilliant.

That just scratches the surface...

This location actually gives me anxiety every time I'm there, mainly because it's almost always super busy, the merchandise is often strewn all over and/or falling on the floor, and the aisles are shoulder-width narrow, at best.  Can't count the number of times I've gotten trapped between some mindless shopper's cart on one side and another loud, obnoxious shopper with five or six little kids running under my feet on the other.  Not my idea of an enjoyable shopping experience.  Plus there's almost always a checkout line that stretches way out and I don't think I've ever waited less than 15 minutes to reach the cashier.  If you want to purchase jewelry, be prepared to be treated as though you've already been caught stealing.

Usually I avoid Ross if at all possible, but today I stopped by as a last resort for a last-minute purchase I needed to make...to my dismay (and irritation), they had a handwritten sign on the door that said registers were down so only cash transactions would be allowed.  Grrrr.  Major inconvenience.  If I had to sum up this store in one word, I'd probably opt for ""ghetto"" (no, not ghetto-fabulous...just ghetto).

I hate leaving 1 star reviews, but I had to get this out there so people are aware and so hopefully management can help clean this place up. When we first walked in, the restaurant was a disaster, there was food and trash all over the floor. From the front door, through out the entire dining area. There were a ton of empty tables that had not been bused, with split drinks, food and trash all over. The place was basically empty so it looked like the staff was just lazy and was not ready to clean up yet. When we sat down I could see right into the kitchen. They had about a dozen or more pancakes sitting out on plates on their counter, just sitting there. I then watched the manager drop a towel on the floor by accident in the kitchen, then continued to wipe down the counter with the same towel. This made me cringe for I could see how dirty the floor was and then I watched a server prep food to go out to a table on the same counter he just contaminated. The staff ran around yelling at each other as if we were at a party, not a restaurant, they were yelling jokes back and forth, yelling for people to find other people and saying things like ""Ya I just ripped my finger nail off finally!"" I don't want to hear that from people handling my food! Yikes! I ran to the bathroom to wash my hands and almost tripped over the ""wet floor"" sign. The bathrooms were just as dirty if not even dirtier than the restaurant. We went ahead and stayed since we already ordered our food before we saw everything above. When our food came out I saw a different server grab our food, grab the sitting out pancakes and head our way. He said ""Here you go, we went ahead and gave you a 3 stack since we have all these pancakes sitting out and need to get rid of them!"" Why do I want to eat food that has been sitting out for god knows how long. I'snt all of our food supposed to be made fresh! If its not why are you telling the customer that?Ugh...... I cut into the pancakes and they were definitely stale and hard. I was too nervous to eat any of my food. My fiance on the other hand said ""I'm a Marine I have eaten worse"" so he went ahead and ate.

We ordered 4 dishes to share among 3 people (we even had some leftovers). We got Laing which was our veggie dish. It was supposed to be spicy but I thought it was very mild. My friend that couldn't handle any spice didn't try any more of it after one bite. If you're incredibly sensitive to spice, I wouldn't recommend this dish. It's hard to describe this dish because I've never had anything quite like it. With that being said, it wasn't a bad dish but it didn't make it to our any of our favourites list.

We also got pancit. The noodles they use were like Chinese yi mein or e-fu mein. It honestly tasted like a Chinese dish. I liked it and there were several pieces of big shrimps in there. This is a good dish to get if you're in the mood for noodles.

Next, we had the beef karekare. It again, tasted very similar to Chinese food. This was a solid dish and I would order it again.

Next is one of my favourite dishes - fish sisig. It's basically sizzling plate with chopped up meat of your choice. I think I really like this dish because it was the least reminiscent of any Chinese dish. I think this is a must try if you come to this restaurant.

Now, on to my favourite part of the meal...dessert! There's a Yelp check in offer for an ube creme decadence. I really like ube (purple yam) desserts. My friends also got a dessert which was some sort of ice cream with minty jello like toppings.

Ahhh. The Wild Wild West. Where do I start? lol

I hadn't been here for a few years before today, but I had a winning sports book ticket to cash in from the El Cortez . You see, WWW is a Stations property and the El Cortez sportsbook is also run by Stations, so instead of driving all the way back to Fremont, I figured I'd just cash out here. 

Positives-

- Most of the employees I interacted with were much friendlier than I was anticipating especially the sweet lady who grabbed me a new players card and updated my info while I was playing a machine. I know she gave me her name but I cant remember it now for the life of me.

- For those on a super tight budget, the location its self is good. You are literally less than a mile behind NY NY and the rest of the strip. Also you have The Orleans right down the street on Tropicana. Great location is basically what I'm trying to say.

Not so much-

- Damn, this place is so smokey! I'm sure those low ceilings don't help matters at all. 

- A lot of sketchy people around anytime I've ever been here. Obvious drug dealers/users, pimps, and prostitutes abound!

- Hate to say it, but there was kind of a funky smell going on there too. Have no idea what the source of it was, but I'm guessing I might not want to know anyways.


Other miscellaneous observations-

-the sportsbook is dinky and still has the old school boards up! lol I think Poker Palace is the only other place I can think of in town that hasn't upgraded to monitors of some sort. 

-They have a Denny's in house. I guess that could be either positive or negative depending on your opinion of Denny's.


The people were nice to me, so I won't hit them with a 1 star. Honestly, I won't be back. As a local, I know better. This is a place that is good for a)truckers b) people on a shoestring budget who want a cheap place to crash that has a good, accessible location. Otherwise I just don't understand what would draw you here with so many other options in the immediate vicinity.

The SUSHI was awful and even though it was cold the rice was hard and crusty ugh.  I wasn't that ""wow'd""  by the carving station either like the turkey was good and the chicken. Prime rib.. ummm I've had better.  The fried chicken was a JOKE and over fried and no seasoning. I am not completely knocking the whole buffet but I can't quite say for sure if I believe it's worth what you are actually paying I guess I was just wishing for more of better quality items.

- Fast service 

Cons:
- Brisket is the only meat I ever order in my Pho and the brisket here is way too fatty. Each slice of brisket is over 50% fat. There's different kinds of fatty too but this one is ridiculously chewy. I spend more time dissecting my brisket than enjoying my soup. 
- Sometimes the bean sprouts they bring out for your Pho looks and tastes old and withered

So let's start with the pizza: it's delicious! Certainly not the best pizza in Cleveland but not the worst either. If you're here to enjoy their amazing beer selection, you can't go wrong with one of their pizzas.

However, prices and quality for main entrees just don't seem to match up. I had a garden burger here once that was so salty I couldn't even swallow it. The penne verde I had was super fresh pasta, but the sauce was on the saltier side and the lemon was a bit too overpowering. Was it good pasta? Yes. But maybe not $22 good pasta.

My husband loves coming here for the steak frites. Not sure what happened or if the recipe changed, but this time it was coated in a basalmic glaze that just didn't seem right compared to how the steak has been prepared before.

I'm not sure if there is a different chef here compared to when we would come here before. I think pizza and the sides (their frites and dipping sauces, as well as the Brussels sprouts, were to die for) are certainly the way to go, but I'd be weary about entrees.",2018-01-21 16:11:19

I just discovered my local nirvana Mexican restaurant. Where I came from in SoCal I only had one nirvana Mexican place ... you know, where portions are huge, prices are cheap and the food is drop-dead awesome. And now here in Phoenix I've found my local equivalent, Mi Pueblo. And this review is real.

Mi Pueblo a tiny place about the size of an average living room with a handful of tables for eating there, not fancy but exceptionally clean. It is staffed by locals, no pretensions, no attitude, super friendly.  Prices are excellent and portions are huge. They use REAL ingredients, yes folks they actually care that their food tastes good, which is extremely rare for any Mexican food restaurant in the Phoenix area. PS - some people are hung up on using the word ""authentic"" to describe Mexican food. What is that supposed to mean? Mexico is a big country with lots of regional styles and millions of families who cook their food millions of different ways ... it's ALL authentic!

Another plus is that they have a menu that you can order directly from Yelp and when you arrive to pick it up a few minutes later it is prepaid and ready to go. The only way to roll.

I had a Carne Asada burrito that was almost all meat and had more flavor than you can imagine. One burrito could have been my entire dinner but it was my first time I also ordered a Carnitas Soft Taco as an ala carta side. The Carnitas had immense flavor.

They're located in a well-lighted and relatively safe strip mall with tons of parking. You can order food for pickup between 7 AM and 8:40 PM.

Trivia: they've been in business since 1999 and are family owned ... yaay for not being a chain owned by a corporate monopoly. Besides the Union Hills location they have one more restaurant at Metro Center.

This is now my #1 go-to Mexican food place in town.",2017-07-29 16:42:20

Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.

I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.

Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?

I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/",2011-02-16 13:15:05

I have seen many Cirque shows over the years and all of them are different, yet all of them feature amazing acrobatics and daredevil stunts too. Some have a solid story line, and some it is barely comprehendable. KA fell into that category. A thin story line, but wonderfully talented acrobats and gymnasts.

When I saw this show not too long ago we had center orchestra seats that offered a great view of the stage. In fact, the stage is the big star of the show. The technology use to create and move that stage into all sorts of motions is incredible. The cast is terrific and the scenes are like a mashup of ninja moves and adventure flicks. As always, the trained physicallity of the cast is beyond belief. I would be sent to a hospital in traction if I attempted any of these moves!

I also liked the venue. Nice seats with good legroom. Seems like every seat has a great view. Cranking air conditioning too.

The costumes are colorful, great set design, the Wheel Of Death is thrilling, the music is wonderful, the hydraulic stage is cool technology, and the story itself is like watching a Chinese opera. With exciting ninja acrobats!",2011-08-28 20:48:43

However a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story. The first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates, disposable plastic eating utensils, and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces. I have been to many Indian lunch buffets, but this was the first time I've seen such cheap dining ware being used. While they had several vegetarian offerings, they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. There was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so I didn't even bother trying it. The subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit. The halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross. My friend and I commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati rice.

When the bill came, I was in for another shock. $12.95 for an Indian lunch buffet?!? That has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $9.99 to $10.99. Now if this buffet was one of the best, I probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price. Come to think of it, if they lowered the price to $8.95, it still wouldn't be worth it. There are just too many better places in town, i.e. Taj Palace or Mt Everest., to waste your appetite on this one.",2011-12-05 04:57:58

Although this was my first churro experience (so may not be the best judge), I would definitely say it was very average. My friend and I ordered the 3 for $5 churros and selected the dulce de leche, chocolate, and strawberry fillings (there was also a condensed milk flavour). My favourite by far was the chocolate then the strawberry filling. The dulce de leche was just too thick and heavy for the churro. They were definitely warm and crispy when we had our first bites, but they didn't taste very fresh. 

The location is very small and a bit hard to locate since it's within a mini food court and the service was average (I mean, the cashier did give me the wrong change after handing her a $20 bill).

I actually found out about this place via Groupon. They had an offer for $10 for $20 and I love seafood and I love chicken so I bought it figuring what did I have to lose!?

Well I must say I was not disappointed! When you walk in the doors you come right up to the menu and counter and the cooks are back there whipping up amazing fish, shrimp and chicken dishes right before your eyes....and that's enough to make your mouth water....because it looks so delicious!!!

So we decided to try a couple of there top favorites, the staff was very helpful with their top favs and helped make our decision much easier!

For starters we had the Bonehead's shrimp which are Crispy fried shrimp tossed with Boneheads sauce and served over cilantro slaw. The shrimp were cooked until golden brown and then tossed in to this delicious spicy and sweet sauce that was a perfect pair....they were soooo delicious! I almost wish we had a second order!

I chose the taco combo with the tilapia, shrimp and chicken....I figured I might as well try all three so I could compare and have plenty of variety! There is no issue with portion size here! All the tacos are filled with the meat and slaw and a side of your choice! The tilapia was cooked perfectly and full of flavor you could really taste the different spices they used to add extra flavor. The shrimp again were delicious, and covered in a seasoning blend and sauce mixture....the only thing I would add is some of the special signature Boneheads sauce...that would have made these tacos complete!!! Finally the chicken was really good too! Very tender and juicy! The tacos came with a side and I chose the fries, they were hot and prepared well just lacked seasoning and crunch in my opinion. Next time I would prefer a vegetable option. 

My boyfriend chose the salmon with the pineapple salsa topping which has 
pineapple, peppers and onions mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce. The salmon presentation was beautiful, I loved the grill marks and the taste was wonderful, it was flaky and tender and the sweet sauce added a nice combination of flavors for the fish. For the side, he selected the grilled zucchini which was sooo yummy!!!  Again, gotta love those grill marks! These are definitely a must try!

The key focal point any baller-on-a-budget MUST check out is the huge clearance section, located in the back corner of the upper level. Not a particularly great place to score discount shoes or pants (all the shoes were the leftover size 10's and 11's), but for tops, it's the best!!

The staff are great. At least the girl that assisted me was. And she was SOOOO friendly, cheerful, and helpful. I wish I could remember her name, 'cuz she was awesome! If you can't find something, just ask one of these handy folks instead of pacing around aimlessly for three hours.

The steak burrito is soooo good! I definitely suggest getting it. The small size is actually really not that small.

Even though a bunch of cheap skates were at Big Wong, this tiny dining room at  Monta was still almost filled to capacity, but still; I found a seat the the counter area. 

The waitress was very impressive, and had it down on helping almost everyone in the dining room, while still taking care of take outs orders.  On the down side, looking how Monta menu is set up,  they have a nickel and dime effect on how you make an order with them.   Never  in my life I would thought of a eating a 12.00 bowl of Ramen which happen that day.

The Tonsoku stock was pretty good, and ramen could have been cooked a little bit longer, but the thought of paying extra for the corn, nori, boiled egg, and extra noodles kind of got to me.    Don't get me wrong,  I thought  Monta had  the best Tonsoku ramen in Las Vegas, because there wasn't any real competitors at that time.   My only thought going through my mind was if Monta had to match up with Ezogeku in Hawaii (which is pretty good)   This comparison would be like Godzilla battling Pee Wee Herman, because Ezogeku would  waste this place in a heartbeat for quality and value.  That's pretty sad to say a ramen-ya in Hawaii has a better overall package than this so-called Las Vegas heavyweight.. 

I never understood why anyone would wait two hours in line to eat  here, because currently  in Las Vegas there more than a few Ramen-ya that recently opened recently and all of them can trade punches with Monta.  In fact, I don't think this place has the best ramen in the Chinatown area, and for sure Monta isn't the best Japanese establishment in this shopping complex.   Take my advice, walk fifty step to the east in the parking lot, and go there.   Sorry Monta,  in my opinion your product doesn't justify the price and the time wasted.  Also, please take a lesson from your neighbor next door, and keep everything clean in the back room.  Getting nailed with a MAJOR health violations from the Southern Nevada Health District is quite an embarrassment.    I""m Japanese, and know more than a thing or two about Ramen.

The service was good  to ok most of the time. The store is a bit too busy and too packed with stuff. The prices are on the high side. The sales ladies are very pushy. 

The reason why I'm giving 1-2 stars: They announced a  treasure hunt for kids from 4:30-8 on a Thursday for their opening night. No other details. I get my kids excited as the prize could be a tub full of toys. Since the drawing would be at 8 I thought I would come in at 7:30 so we have time to wait and see who won the tub. I call in at 7:15 to just double check the address as I was already driving for 35 minutes and would be there before 7:25. They tell me they were closing up shop and had already drawn a winner. I had to turn around tell my kids the store closed and drive back 35 minutes. 

They told me this was meant to be a 45 minute treasure hunt. Who makes a 45 minute treasure hunt for kids? The lady on the phone was ok . The owner was right there next to her as I could hear her instructions saying come back over the weekend and we will have more prizes. I'm already out with 3 kids, 10 minutes away and they tell me to come back?? No regards for their clients. Very sad with this experience. Imagine that I was just trying to time right so my kids didn't go crazy waiting in the store for the drawing.

I have eaten at Fresh countless times but don't have super-strong feelings about it, so it has taken me this long to write a review. I started to think about this place... I have come here in a large group, on dates, with 'the girls', with my grandma, and alone. How many restaurants can I say that about? So, I gotta give Fresh props for always being there and being fairly reliable when you're in the mood for something nutritious and delicious. 

I find the food at this location better than at the Bloor location. 

I have tried almost all the bowls. My favourite is the baby energy bowl with soba noodles. I find the 'baby' portion filling enough for me (also, I don't understand why only selected bowls come in the baby size...). The curry coconut sauce is really yummy! The magic tofu wrap is another hit in my books. If you are really hungry, they usually have some kind of prix fixe and they also participate in Veggielicious. Smoothies are expensive, but BIG. Several serving of fruit right there. The dessert offerings are less exciting -- mostly vegan cookies that are kind of greasy. I like how they bring you a big jug of water without you having to ask. 

They are very accommodating of dietary restrictions. Brought my friend with Celiac disease here and they gave her a separate menu clearly indicating gluten-free items on the menu and which dishes could be modified to be gluten-free.

I came here with my hubby and friend during their soft-opening and the owner and cashier girl were super nice and helpful. She described the different drinks to us and all sounded really delicious but I ended up going with my comfort zone and ordering Taro Milk Tea with honey boba lol. The owner noticed that we kept staring at the hot food menu which is small but I think appropriate for a boba joint. He kept mentioning how good the honey toast is, and since I've never had any form of honey toast I actually caved in. But when we were about to pay they said their card machine was down and me and my hubby were short of like $5 in cash. However, the owner was very nice about it and said that since it was only their soft-opening, they would still give us the honey toast even with $5 short. So nice!

The drinks are served in these cute tall mason jars, I think it took me like an hour and a half to finish mine lol. The taro milk tea was delicious - not too sweet and the boba was nicely cooked. And oh my lawd when that honey toast came out, I was glad there was three of us because that thing was huge. It was so damn good!

I took a big scoop of that deceitful smoke salmon jelly looking thing (in my defense, I thought it was smoked salmon) and it was probably one of the worst decisions of my life (besides art school). I've ordered the Churrasco style cornish hen as my main course...and quite frankly, it was really dried. Maybe I came in with really high expectations, but I've had better chicken at Romado's for half that price. 

Bottom line : Water will cost you $5 and it won't come in a Fiji bottle either. Not exactly a good experience, not quite the best Portugese food, not likely returning either.",2015-07-18 16:42:18

The good stuff first: the staff was SUPER nice. The place is small, but inviting. Not very stylish, but not off-putting either. The flavors of the food were pretty decent. I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict (with Corned Beef Hash instead of Canadian Bacon). I enjoyed the taste of my meal...except the homefried potatoes; those were bland.

Now, the bad: none of our entrees were served very hot. They weren't cold enough to send back, but just merely warm. And, don't be fooled by the photos (including mine), you won't leave this place stuffed. The portions are decent, but they are by no means generous. I was satisfied after cleaning my plate...but I actually had to clean my plate to just barely get there. In my book, diner breakfasts should be big. They should have you walking out full and happy. I mean, what's one more scoop of  homefries really going to cost them? I'll tell you what one less costs them: customers.

The coffee was typical ""diner crud."" I wouldn't bother ordering it if you actually love coffee. It's the same watery, bitter mess they serve at most old timey diners. I wish, in general, these mom & pop diners all over would step up their coffee game. This isn't the 20th century anymore; people expect a good tasting cup of joe.

Started off well in that the server was friendly - I typically engage servers with friendly banter. This time about Trump - Yikes. She seemed cheerful enough and mentioned the 5 dollar special drink.  She said she wasn't sure on the price but was pretty sure it was 5 dollars and would check. I ordered one. 
We ordered - for me Lettuce wraps for my hubby the chinese chicken salad. 
The food arrived later. 
The lettuce wraps were ok - but the sauce - oh dear god - what was in that horrific sauce - it tasted like someone had pulverized leather, mixed it with mayonnaise and cilantro and butter. It was horrible. I asked if they had anything else. She brought over essentially soy sauce with sesame seeds in it - it was ok - anything but that sauce - which quite frankly ranks as one of the worst things i heve ever eaten. 
The chinese chicken salad was apparently SO BLAND. Lacking any flavour - was it even dressed, my hubby asked for some of the soy sauce too. 
Here is where it gets interesting. 
When the bill arrives - the 5 dollar drink was $7.50 and we were charged for the sauces.  The sauce that was needed as a replacement for the horrible sauce for the lettuce wraps and to add flavour to the salad. 
Whatever happened to ( in the case of the sauces) making it right? Fixing the problem. 
The drink - bait and switch. Dont sell it as a special and then charge more for it. 
When I brought this to the servers attention. She said I only charged you for one sauce - I said   "" You shouldnt charge us for any of them"". She didnt like that. 
She took the extra charges off the bill with the manager and when she returned she was miserable.  I went to speak to her and make small talk and she said nothing back. 
Her personality did a 180. How miserable. 
I would never ever return to this location.",2016-10-16 16:54:37

Arriving about 15 minutes prior to guest arrival our space was set up and ready to go. Xavier was our server, our only server but this guy has it down and he provided us with excellent service. Our beverages were never dry and he was quick with all of our requests.

Soup and salad orders taken followed by entree' orders. I had the clam chowder. When it was put in front of me I was a little apprehensive, it was so thick it looked like paste. But...this was some of the best chowder I have ever had.  Salads all looked good. Fresh greens and toppings.

Entrees came out quickly. Everyone ate commenting on how good it was.

The menu is extensive but we opted banquet menu options only. For less than $20 a person guests received bread, soup or salad, an entree choice from about 10 selections ranging from burgers, jambalaya, chicken fried steak, grilled chicken and the like with unlimited non-alcoholic beverages.

They also let us bring a cake from a outside source, providing the plates and utensils.

Grinders is freaking fantastic, and exactly the kind of local entrepreneurial eatery that our city needs more of, as boring/crappy/corporate chain after chain invades Las Vegas.  I drive past every one of those soulless merchants of prison food to chow down with the good people at Grinders!  This is authentic, tasty, and inexpensive food from some dudes that grew up in the Philly area and know their stuff.  And by the way, if you are giving a 1-star review to a place that averages 4 and 1/2 stars based on well over 100 reviews, there is a very good chance that you are an idiot, a hater, or both!  Now, on to some highlights:

(1) yes, the name of the place says ""Pizza Lounge"", and the pizza is very good (although as with any pizza place, it's always best to order a fresh pie - they make a great 6-slice personal size - than the slices sitting under the heat lamp), but look closely at the first word in their name...  ""Grinders""!  What does that mean?  That, my friend, is a sandwich (like a sub) that is heated in the oven, and comes out toasted with melted cheese.  Mmm, mmm, good!  I personally recommend the Italian, the pork (with spinach sautéed in garlic), the meatball (when available), and of course, the cheesesteak (try it hoagie style with lettuce, tomato, & mayo).  And to the genius who complained in his review that the sandwiches are $11 (the same food connoisseur who suggests that you go to a corporate chain instead), that is for a ""whole"" sandwich, which is beyond ""mega"" and way too much food for most of us reasonably-sized people.  All you need in this world is a half-sandwich (comes with fries), and maybe a tasty little half salad beforehand.  Do the right thing here.

(2) this place takes it craft beer seriously, and is one of the few restaurants in this part of town which devotes 4 of their 6 tap handles to a changing array of craft beers from great breweries such as Ninkasi, Alaskan, Founders, Joseph James, and others.  Plus, they usually have a couple of good craft beers in bottles in the back if you ask nicely.  There may even be a secret underworld craft beer society growing here, but I am sworn to secrecy!

(3) the game day football specials here are outrageous.  If I remember correctly, we are talking about $5 personal pizzas (eating a whole one will more than fill you up), and 1/2 price draft beers.  You don't even need to care about the football game that's on the TV, just come in and have a great meal & a craft beer for cheap!

(4) the folks who run Grinders are a really great group.  This is their business, and they are totally immersed in it, and will do anything to make sure their customers are happy.  Those couple of ridiculous bad reviews (I especially like the one from the Elite Yelper who basically said that the service & all the food was very good except for the calamari, but still gave them only 2 stars, and complained that $45 was too much for the mega-feast of large pizza, wings, calamari, etc. that they ordered - time to go back to Chuck-E-Cheese, cheapskate!) really do upset and affect them, and they work tirelessly to make improvements, though I suppose you can't please everyone.  The sheer amount of ""regulars"" that I see in here is proof that if you come in a few times, try a few different things on the menu, and chat up some of the friendly staff, there is a good chance that you will become a Grinder yourself!

Peace out, and if you see me there, maybe I'll buy you a pint of craft beer!",2015-12-24 01:36:00

You order your meal at a tiny window next to the grill where the burgers are cooked. Flames leap from the cooking surface as you speak your order to the...order taker? I don't know what to call her, because you don't pay here, you only order here. You walk around the corner and pay for your food.

I didn't order the gigantic burger, I opted for the big burger. With fries and a drink. I paid about $9 for it and I was told to listen for my name while I got my drink from the digital Coke machine.

About ten minutes later, I hear my name and retrieve my food. There's a toppings bar with condiments to apply to your sammich. After one bite of this big burger, it's clear that it deserves steak sauce, grilled onions and salt and pepper and not the usual condiments and toppings. The beef is tasty and delicious and I am doing it wrong with lettuce, tomato, onions, Cholula and mayo. Without the bun and with a knife and fork, it'd fit right in as a ""chopt steak"" at most steakhouses. 

The fries were not remarkable, but they were adequate sidekicks for the hamburger.

VX3zn1Zhg-UDdzkLlFWaSg,tUJJr2fvXDLbo34i3UGAvg,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,4,0,0,1,"Honey Salt is a cozy little neighborhood restaurant located in Summerlin on the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston, featuring a farm-to-table inspired menu that balances amazing ingredients available for the Las Vegas foodie that wants a little more. The menu is great. If you are looking to try something traditional, then try the Grilled Scottish Salmon served with Artichoke, Spinach and Fingerling Potatoes, or try the Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast with a side of Mac n' Cheese, Kale and Anaheim Peppers Natural Jus. If you are looking to venture out and try something different then you need to try the Caramelized Sea Scallops with Cauliflower, Vanilla Bean and Truffle Sauce they are delicious and probably the best in town. Sides like roasted Rainbow Carrots seasoned with Spicy Honey, Curry and Rosemary, or the Cauliflower Couscous with Pine Nuts, Mint and Green Onion erupt with flavor. Lastly the homemade desserts and hand-crafted cocktails are delicious and should be given a chance. Now for the reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I'll start by saying that they used to be great but somehow have slipped dramatically in the past year or so. First they seem to have a plumbing problem that they can't seem to fix at the bar & restrooms. Some days are worse than others but the fact remains that there is a problem which doesn't sit well when you're wanting to eat. Second problem is that the consistency is almost gone. They have days that the food is delicious and reminiscent of the past and other days which are more often than not lately subpar and quiet frankly embarrassing considering their reputation. Third strike is the service and just like the food there are good days and bad. A few of the servers are amazing and not only do their job but do their job very well including picking up the slack and doing someone else's job when the other servers can't seem to pull it together. So I guess the question is why do I continue to go back? Well the answer is for a couple reasons. First is, even on a bad day the food is still better and healthier than most places in Summerlin due to their fresh ingredients. When a restaurant is using all fresh ingredients and their specialty is farm to table they simply blow away the competition even on the worst of days. It's like going to the grocery picking up wild caught fish, fresh organic vegetables driving home cooking it yourself, (even though you might not be a chef) and it'll always be healthier than any chain restaurant. So this is why I continue to eat at Honey Salt and always will until they really start to make unforgivable mistakes.",2017-08-30 01:59:20

Their gelato is made like any other gelato, using the same processes but the ingredients are a whole different story. In fact, they make their gelato in house with real natural ingredients and MAN does it taste authentic. Kekou boasts Asian-inspired flavours such as Vietnamese coffee, milk tea and even my absolute favourite (don't kill me) durian!

The space is an open and well lit area and the staff are super friendly and patient as I choose what flavour to get. Samples are encouraged and you'll want to sample due to their creative flavours. For the less adventurous, there are plain vanilla lotus and red bean chocolate.

I didn't expect such natural flavours considering they offered so many different types but MAN, that durian was absolutely to die for. I could easily eat a tub of that - and you can if you want. Kekou sells their gelato by the tub ($7.50-$12.50)

This location is by far my favorite one. Why? It's warm and inviting and it's unique..... it's haunted!

So since everyone's shared their stories of service, i'm going to share the knowledge i have about the ghosts of the Mansion in bullet form:

1) House was built by the McMaster family in the late 1800's (as in McMaster University)
2) House was purchased by the Massey family in early 1900's (as in Massey Hall)
3) Underground tunnels were built because one of the sons was sick. The tunnels, which are blocked off but still exist, connected to the Wellesley Hospital. The son died at a young age, and his older brother also died of sickness shortly after.
4) Only daughter and heir of the estate died of loneliness once her husband passed away. 
5) Her nanny, hung herself of the top of the stairs after her employers deaths 
6) People experience multiple ghosts at this location - the most experiences are felt in the women's washroom on the second floor. 
7) People have reported hearing kids play on the staircase.
8) People have reported seeing the nanny at the top of the staircase.
9) Staff have reported strange activity like doors closing, sprinkler systems going on and off, pans thrown across the kitchen, etc.


So with all the mystery, history and legends, what's not to enjoy about the Keg Mansion over a glass of wine and steak?",2015-08-07 21:15:59

You tried your best to be different from all the other chain restaurants and the concept is still good but the execution has been lacking in my past few visits.

And finally, service is awful here in my past few visits.  This last time, no one knew which servers table we sat at.  One server took our orders but the real one was always off doing something at the POS system.  We really got the impression she didn't know what she was doing.

Unfortunately I didn't particularly enjoy my meal, but I do believe that was to no fault of the restaurant, I just didn't want what I ended up ordering.  So this is my fault.

The place itself is quite cute with great views of Kensington. I could see it being a very romantic date night if done right.

Peel and Eat Shrimp, Hot and Cold Crab Legs, Tuna in Dill Sauce, Fried Shrimp Patties, Craw-fish, Clams, Oysters on the half shell, Salmon on a wooden plank, and several additional seafood selections. Many traditional Buffet items were also to be found. 
Average quality seafood with poor to average preparation. Some items were over fried and tough - other fried items were barely cooked enough. Crab-legs were small - ensuring lots of work. A seafood stew was mainly mushrooms. The Clam Chowder soup was very thick with only a promise of clams. The Seafood Buffet was Pricey for the quality of the food. Very good service by the wait staff. 

I would suggest this buffet for Breakfast or Lunch - or even better with a Comp or Coupon.

If you're playing tables always ask the Pit Boss for a comp - they will rarely(if ever) volunteer one. On Slots ask the Players Club what it takes - Before you spend your money here.",2010-10-16 07:40:14

In terms of proximity to home and overall coziness, this seemed like an ideal Thai restaurant. I had the pad see eew and the girlfriend had the drunken noodles. We ordered the spring roll as well. Spring rolls were tasty, a great starter item per usual. Pad see eew was on point. I added baby corn, and lemme tell ya, they were liberal with the baby corn. No complaints about my favorite Thai dish! Flavor 100%. I was satisfied to the core. The drunken noodles were very, very spicy, but yummy nonetheless. We were warned by our server, but I only took a few bites and was done for. I would suggest ordering drunken noodles family style only...My girlfriend is a heat seeking fiend, and she struggled to eat her dish. She was warned twice that it was ""very spicy"" but agreed to it anyway. I found it odd that spice levels were not adjustable, but it is what it is. 

We dined in on a Wednesday night. It was indeed busy - plenty of dine in customers AND take out orders. Unfortunately, we had to wait 50 or so minutes for our food. This left us a tad hangry for a bit - small Asian place like this...I typically assume hot plates to come out quick.

*note for vegetarians* I was hoping to try the Tom Yum soup and the curries...(hence the reason we got two noodle dishes), but they all have a fish sauce already cooked into it. That was a big bummer, and the reason why this place loses an additional star. 

I don't think my girlfriend would return for the drunken noodles, but I'm not opposed to ordering the pad see eew again! ...I forgot to mention, the portions are HUGE! Plenty to take home. Definitely worth a try!",2017-01-06 01:49:18

Came by today for lunch, and they have quite a nice lunch menu. Prices seem to have gone up recently, but still reasonable. I got one the Bento Boxes and my mom and aunt got different noodles with sushi. 

A bit more than I would want to pay for a bento box ($15.99), but a great meal overall. The Tonkatsu was absolutely perfect, fried just right with a great texture contrast on the outside and inside. The Salmon Onigiri is on of the specialties, and definitely worth trying as it not something you get to try a lot in this area. A bit dry for my personal taste, but can always add the tonkatsu sauce! 

The noodles are awesome as well, as you get a whole maki or hand roll, as well as your udon/soba/ramen. Definitely a great deal with each between $9.99-12-99.

But OMG!! EEEEEEEWWWW! They had some video on of various ""food"" items that looked like worms and male body parts squirting uh, liquid, as they were being prepared as food. I swear it was one of the most disgusting videos I've ever seen. Stomach turning, and it makes you wonder what you're eating.

The video apparently came from their media server, which seemed to only have that video on it.

I can't fathom why they'd play it unless it's to keep non-chinese out (or make us throw up.)

Service was great. Cashiers friendly & the staff preparing the food seemed to be busy & involved in their roles too! 
I had the spicy chicken. Grilled chicken that comes with the option of noodles, white rice or brown rice. I went with the noodles. They also offer veggies along with it & you can pick & choose which ones you'd like. Choices- cabbage, carrots, broccoli, onion, celery and zucchini. 
My daughter had the kids meal: Orange Chicken ( which is not breaded) with white rice & just broccoli.
Wait time for the food was somewhat slow. However, they were having issues with their registers which delayed the whole process.
At the table they provide their own teriyaki sauce which is really good. Also, offer a soy sauce & sriracha sauce.

Now since I am usually down by Shops on Don Mills my go Landing would obviously be Taylors (which if you see my previous reviews the quality has gone down significantly) However I am really enthusiastic that Arthur's Landing is here in the town that I live in.

As you see in the photos I had posted there were options to try for the set menu. As per usual, I have the Steak Frites - There was nothing to complain about regarding this dish it was absolutely delicious. Medium rare It was cooked to perfection and the frites were soo addictive I couldn't stop myself.  It definitely satisfied the craving I had for steak. My family had tried some of the other dishes in which they really enjoyed - Curried Chicken, The Landing Burger + Fries and the Turkey burger with sweet potato fries. 

We started with the Calamari as a appetizer and we all know - you can't really go wrong with a calamari dish! We ended the night with their sticky toffee pudding - it can definitely satisfy any sweet tooth!.

Maitake ramen was something I've never seen in this diverse universe of creative ramen scene, often gone wrong, found some middle ground. Maitake is one of my favorite fungi (particularly for tempura) yet I've never thought that it could find a place in ramen. Not bad.

2x Fried Chicken was a bit overpowering but was guiltily delish. I only ate one piece at the premise and consume the rest at home next day.

Now, the Doughnuts - the purple mashed sweet potato came with a variety of crunchy nuts and that texture was very enjoyable. The doughnuts body was made of tofu, and there was nothing felt strange about it. It was just tasty.

What is even better about this restaurant concept is that you get the type of salad you want with the items you prefer.  This makes for a pretty big salad that tastes just the way you like it!  This is exactly what I get when I visit and I love that I can experiment with different fixins'.  The process is, select a green, select a protein (chicken, shrimp, tofu...), select 5 toppings, then select your dressing.  You can't miss because it is what you make it!  They have a nice, but small selection of wine and beer is also available.  On my last visit, we enjoyed the Sangria.  We got a decanter full for $10 and it was plenty!

My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas, kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita, fried yucca plant (very starchy, like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink, a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream, a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods, but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.

Eliana's is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience. Everyone can find something they'll like- low spiciness, but full of great flavors and textures.",2007-05-26 03:22:15

Their omelets are huge. Some of their items weren't as punchy with flavor as hoped, such as the breakfast burrito, but there are lots more items on the menu that I want to try. 

As a vegetarian-friendly customer, I'm super-happy to see interesting veggie items like the seitan wings, lentil veggie burger, tofu scramble and avocado club.

We made a reservation for 730pm and waited until 8pm to be seated, they kept telling us they did not have any seats for a party of 5 - their reasoning for the long wait.

We waited over 30 minutes for our food and by the time we ordered the food, the place was half empty so no real reason why it would take so long except to say the manager should have called in more help, but didn't.

The Kale and Quinoa app salad is bigger than small like the waitress said and can be a full meal in itself.  I had to send it back because they first brought it out without any Quinoa and grapes, when I got it back the 2nd time it was loaded with flavor, grapes and Quinoa plus the buttermilk dressing was excellent with it.   Also the incredible egg plant sandwich on brown bread was a hit and actually it was much better eaten alone instead of with the bread.  The Chinese chicken salad was just okay nothing to rave about as was the rest of the food - just ok - fettuccine, market burger, lettuce wraps, just ok nothing wow..  The cheesecakes again were just ok nothing to rave about - the banana cream needed more banana flavor and more cream, the mango key lime needed to be a bit more tart and the guey yellow stuff on top of the mango key lime is terrible and should be taken off.  the only cheesecake which was good was the original.

My meal was the Artichoke Joe - holy cow. Every single ingredient by itself was good, then it was placed on this magnificent pie and baked.  The roasted artichoke is so tender and juicy, the sauteed spinach has a wonderful flavor without being mushy or overpowering and the Creme di parmigiana was an interesting but delicious surprise.

Rice was a little dry, beans okay.  The chimi had a lot of beef in it, but the sauce was not that great.  The enchiladas were flimsy and drenched in this forgettable poblano cream sauce.

I thought the food was.. well like the rating says meh.  I wouldn't recommend anyone going there if they have a kick for Mexican food.  There are plenty of other places around that taste better.

I love the fact that they have actual coffee and a wide variety of it. They have their own signature coffee cocktails as well as a kick ass espresso. One of my favorite things to order is called the One and One. It gives you the best of both worlds in my opinion. Public Us serves you one shot of espresso in a sniffer glass (like when you have whiskey) this is so you can get the full aroma of the espresso before you taste it. Also, having it on It's own and then mixed with a little cream in a cappuccino gives you a wonderful flavor experience. One of their signature coffee cocktails that I enjoy is the Old Fashion. They muddle cherries in coffee and serve it with a sphere of ice. I definitely recommend it especially if you enjoy the real version of an Old Fashion. 

I love that they offer a ""farm to table"" menu as well as a standard menu. Plus, on the weekends they offer a set brunch menu. On my most recent visit I tried their meat and veggie frittata. Wow! The eggs were super moist, the veggies were fresh and full of flavor, and the bacon and chicken sausage were not greasy and complimented the veggies perfectly. Not to mention the slice of the frittata was humongous!! Their Fennel  Mac & Cheese is amazing  and so unique!  I've had their Smoked Salmon Toast which had lox, olives and was on homemade sourdough toast.

The Crazy Noodles dish is made with a base of soft, wide rice noodles that are lightly pan-fried with chicken and shrimp, eggs, onions, carrots, broccoli and basil leaves.

Oohhh my goodness....my brain can't think because it is SOO LOUD IN HERE!  Now I remember why back in the days I would bring my baby here.  Because no matter how loud she screams no one notices. LOL  I think its so loud that you actually have to yell to communicate with the person you are with so its all an ugly vicious cycle. 

Sunday afternoon we decided on a burger-lunch and thought it had been so long since we had been here.  Now we remember why. hahah The waiting area was full but must have been for a large party because our party of 2 got seated right away.  Every seat in this place was full.  Tons of large parties full of families and friends!  Maybe the after-church crowds as well.  So much I forgot about this place-not a frequent favorite just for the fact there aren't too many healthy options here.  If you can control yourself they do serve salads.  I'm just not sure how healthy they are since I'm not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantastic pictures enticing your blurred and echoing thinking.  

We were literally seated for less than 5 minutes when our waitress came to apologize for the wait.  Wait?  What wait?  Very nice girl but a little ditsy.  I don't generally go for burgers anywhere.  I usually opt for the grilled chicken for a healthier choice.  Today I was going all out.  Here's what we ordered:

Whisky BBQ burger - slightly greasy bun, topped with a juicy on the inside burger with crispy onion strings and a smoky bbq sauce.  Yes I didn't go for the lowest in calorie/fat option.  It was pretty great though.  I had to cut it in fourths so I could actually eat it in a nice non-messy way.  My once a year indulgence didn't fail me...er-until just now.....SHOW STOPPER....  Might I say how disgusted I am now that I looked at the nutritional value of this burger....Oh my freakin gawd......1138 calories 70 grams of fat!  HOLY SHIT!  My hour workout that night didn't even put a dent in that!  (not even funny right now) Sniff sniff.....Tear.

to continue....BF ordered a regular cheese burger with mustard and crispy onion strings.  He said it was the best he's had in a long time.  He ordered a side of coleslaw and loved it.

....and don't forget the ""bottomless steakfries""...its what they advertise on TV.  ...and I am not even looking at the nutritional value of these! God help me here!  I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of steak fries but I ate a few anyway.  I've seen other reviews about the seasoning on the tables.  Nothing (at all) special to me.  The fries are dry anyway and the seasoning doesn't even stick.  So ""eh"" on the fries. Maybe I will substitute them next time-FOR SALAD (disgusted still).  BTW we didn't need bottomless as there were plenty that we didn't finish....Thank God!

Customer service is outstanding.  The manager checked on our table several times.  Drinks never ran low and our server was super attentive in the midst of her many other tables.  I am often amazed when someone can juggle all that and still be pleasant and attentive.  I know.  Yes agreed...that's how it should be.

I ride with a mechanic. He HEARS the noise. Tells me probably a tie rod/bushing. I go back to the service advisor. Tell him I'll drop it off in a couple of weeks, I just wanted to swing by today so you guys can hear the problem so we have no issues or ??'s about it when I come back. I drop it off 9:30am on the 20th. Tells me it's gonna take a couple of hours. Over 6 go by. I call. Advisor tells me they can't duplicate the noise. Cars been sitting there all day. I go back to pick it up after a not so friendly phone call. I drive off and hear the noise. I go back and get the service advisor. HE HEARS THE NOISE. We drive into the mechanics garage. He talks to a mechanic. They are going back and forth. ""If we order the parts. Who's ass is it gonna be!""  Apparently ""Bob"" the mgr rode in the truck and couldn't hear the noise. So no work was authorized even though a couple weeks prior a mechanic heard the rattling. So now the mechanic that's arguing with the advisor in the garage rides with me. HE HEARS THE NOISE. We drive back to the area where all the advisors are. We get out. The mechanic and my advisor start talking agaIn. And again, who's ass is it gonna be? Bob said not to do any work on it.

The dinner was for my best friends birthday and her two sisters birthdays which fall the day before. 

We called two hours prior to make a reservation for 9 adults and 2 children. We were told we couldn't make a reservation. So we ended up getting there a 7 to wait. We told Kat it was for 9 and 2 babies. She put us down, but when she did it was for 5 people. We again told her 9 adults 2 kids. She seemed very confused by her job. After reassuring that 9+2=11 multiple times she put us down for 11 people even after continuing to get it wrong when talking to the other lady tiffany. Honestly these woman were incompetent. I'm not sure if they could even handle rolling silverware but they definitely shouldn't be running the front. 

She never asked for our name or gave an estimated wait time. After 15 minutes of waiting she told us our table was being set up. Almost 30 minutes later they came and called for our table, another group was confused for us and they gave the table we had been waiting for away to another group. After we told her she called the manager. Finally they went and looked for a place to seat us. We waited and hour all together even after being told only a few minutes for the table to be set up. 

Once we were finally seated we were thankful. We had two waiters and both introduced themselves and took our drink and appetizer orders. When one came back he only brought the appetizers and one side of the tables drinks. We asked again for our water and bread and waited about another 10-15 minutes. Still no one brought those who had nothing to drink, something to drink or bread. We finally asked two guys clearing tables to bring us  water and bread. I also canceled my drink and only wanted water because I had already been waiting too long. We finally got some water but AGAIN had to ask for bread. Even though I canceled my drink they ended up bringing it and asked if I just wanted it since it was already made. I said I guess, even though it was canceled. (They ended up charging me for it, even though i told them it was canceled twice). 

The manager came over a few times to try and set things right even though we were all extremely unsatisfied by that point. 

By the time we did get our food everyone was ready to leave and they were already about to close at 10 anyways. So we asked for boxes to take the food to go. 15 minutes and no one comes with boxes. Finally someone comes back and asks if we need boxes.... Even after we already asked. Waited again, finally after more waiting we got boxes. By this point I had enough. Honestly if you need two waiters for one table one of them shouldn't just bail out and never come back. It was one waiter for all is us but after asking other people about 5 different people had to take our requests. 

Needles to say it was a complete disaster and a fantastic way to ruin 3 people's birthday dinner.",2016-01-18 06:13:22
9RcSDjgN3ifLoSKVwErmXQ,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,4,14,7,9,"I had studied the menus online and had pretty much decided to go with the seasonal tasting menu.  However, when ordering, my server talked me out of the seasonal menu in favor of the same priced Signature tasting menu.  On his recommendation, that's what I ordered.

I was first brought a choice of rolls and some salted, softened butter--the way butter should be served unless requested otherwise.

The first course was a domestic caviar parfait with five levels with a shallot, potato pancake on the bottom and topped with the caviar as well as having a layer of smoked salmon.  A very good beginning.

The second course was a tartare of ahi tuna with Asian pear, pine nuts, and a quail egg mixed together at the table to mix the tuna with the other components.  This was bland.  There was no salt on the table.  The dish could have used some.  This was a bit of a letdown.

Third course was miso-glazed Chilean sea bass with shellfish dumplings.  The sea bass was excellent.  It was cooked perfectly and the miso broth was very good.  The two dumplings were OK.

The fourth course was Mina's famed lobster pot pie.  My server explained how this affected his career and that this was his signature dish.  The top of the pot pie is sliced around the edge and then this cap is removed to reveal the lobster stew inside.  There were chunks of lobster and vegetables such as celery, potato, and carrot.  The dish is a winner.

Next up was the American wagyu beef, three slices of tender beef with a piece of Hudson Valley foie gras and a pinot noir reduction.  There was also a small amount of mashed potatoes and a slice of mushroom.  The beef was good but steak loses something for me when it's sliced like this even though it was rare.  The mashed potatoes were so sparse they could have been left from the plate and not missed.

Finishing the meal was an assortment of sweets for dessert.  The was a chocolate whiskey cake, cocoa nib ice cream, some candied hazelnuts and salted caramel as well as Mina's famous root beer float which had a chocolate straw embedded in sassafras ice cream.  There was also a warm chocolate chip cookie.

Service was excellent.  My server, Alejandro, was a pleasant and polite.  His explanation of the dishes was interesting and his recommendation of the Signature tasting menu was great!  

I was surprised for a tasting menu that there was no amuse-bouche nor any mignardises at the end.  It's not necessary, but you sort of expect it with a tasting menu at a restaurant with this high reputation.

Another time, I'd order the lobster pot pie as the main course and get the whole lobster.  That would be quite the meal!",2015-07-04 21:26:29

Nestled in the near-Capitol cove of Madison's downtown, you'd usually perceive it to be one of the typical college bars that surround it, but instead you're presented with a walk back in time to the nightclubs of days past.

The ambiance of an old-style nightclub is perfectly created from the Frank Sinatra-isk music to the tiny tables surrounded by big circular booths.  You've also got the low lighting, pleasant conversation, an old-style bar, and the aroma of juicy steak.  It literally feels like you're in an episode of Mad Men when you sit down at this restaurant.  One of my friends said that he thought it felt very Wisconsin-Authentic, and I think that claim is deserved as you get some of the down to earth feel with all the casual conversation and comfort eats.

I've been twice so far; the first time I went with a party of about 8-10 people for dinner, and was treated to one of the best filet mingon's I have ever had.  I love good steak, and I feel if you are going to eat steak you should go all out because otherwise you could probably just get a good burger instead.  This is definitely the joint to splurge on, as the reward is a slice of succulence.

The second time I went, it was with 3-4 friends for drinks and a social hour.  The tables are well suited for this, as the circular design and center-table focal point keep you all within close range for conversation.  They're not terribly accommodating space-wise, but the good conversation promoted by this setup allows for one to ignore that aspect.  Waitresses that I've had were very cordial, timely, and pulled just the right moves to ensure that they would be receiving a generous tip.  All of us had a great time, and would definitely go back again.

If there's any drawback of the Tornado Room, it's that the prices are steep.  This is certainly not a place you would go to every weekend, unless of course your making six figures and blow your nose with $100 bills.  But it IS a steakhouse afterall, so the prices are respective to the quality of service that is received.",2010-01-11 14:55:19

I had always heard rave reviews about Ferraro's, but just never made it.  I guess it's that everyone says that Ferraro's Osso Buco is THE best.  For me, when I see Osso Buco on the menu, that is what I get.  I love the stuff and would eat it every day if I could.  But, I also don't want to be disappointed, as I've had waaay to many  bad instances.

Let's start with the wines.  After much discussion with our waiter, who either was very knowledgeable or was pushing stuff the restaurant hasn't been able to get rid of (I do give him the benefit of the doubt and think he was quite educated), he recommended the 2003 Palari Faro.  I hadn't even heard of the grape, let alone the region it comes from.  It was enlightening and tasted pretty good, too.  For a second bottle, I ordered the 2001 Pio Cesare Barbaresco.  This was a relative bargain on the wine list.  Over all, I have to rate our server pretty high for his expertise and ability to navigate the list.  Where I have to subtract is from the wine service itself.  While our glasses were never empty (definitely a good thing), our server continuously poured wine to top us off.  It felt rushed.  I would have liked to see the bottom of my glass at least once.

Anyway, I'll skip to the food...that IS why you're reading this, right?  We order three appetizers:  (1) Carpaccio Torcello, which is basically beef carpaccio - the color and texture exude freshness, like it definitely wasn't sitting pre-sliced in the cooler for days (like at some other places).  It was good; however, it just didn't have enough beef flavor for my taste.  (2)  Carpaccio di Tonno (tuna carpaccio) - this was really fresh and the accompanying salsa-looking mixture was refreshing.  The tuna itself had a nice crust that gave the tuna an earthy aroma and flavor.  (3) Burrato, Proscuitto, Rucola - this was like a salad with melted mozzarella and proscuitto.  Interesting mix of crunchy, creamy and chewy.  Good stuff and my favorite of the three.

For dinner we had the...Osso Buco.  All three of us.  The shank was nicely tender, which is where too many places fail miserably.  IMHO, it could have been a little more moist, but soaking the bites in the sauce definitely made up for that.  The sauce was really nicely done and very balanced: it was rich but not overwhelming, it wasn't salty but had good flavor and, most importantly, it did not counteract with the wines.  Impressively done.  The grains on the side (I can't remember what it was called) were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle and was a nice complement in texture to the rest of the dish.  

Ah, but how can I end the review without mentioning the bone marrow?  I picked that bone dry.  It was buttery and fatty and just was astounding with the flavor of the sauce.  My companion never ate marrow before, but convinced him to give it a try.  While I don't think he's completely hooked, I did see him picking a lot of marrow out of that bone.",2010-05-17 17:50:51

I picked up a margherita, my measuring stick of pizzas. Their pleasantly sweet sauce is very good. The crust had a nice bite to it.  The toppings left a lot to be desired. Just a few tomatoes and a bit of fresh basil buried under average cheese. I don't understand why pizza joints are so abusive to fresh basil. Put it on after the pie comes out of the oven!

Had been hearing about this place from so many people, so just had to stop by last night as we were waiting for some friends. It's cute inside- I love the artwork, the tables, the furniture- there's some real love put into that cafe.

And when you look at the display case, it just invites you to try their amazing sweets. From macaroons to gourmet chocolate or fruit desserts, coquette patisserie has it all. What was cool too is that they're open somewhat late. OH YAYYY!! I get so frustrated in CLE when nothing is open... and sometimes, you just need some sweet in your life late at night.

What's cool about coquette patisserie too is that they serve wine, drafts, and french press coffee. And it's all quality stuff. Along with my macaroons (which I'll get to in a minute), I asked them for a cup of their french pressed coffee to go. It wasn't on their menu (it looks like they serve mostly in house french pressed coffee), but they were like, ""sure, we'll do it for you!"" Out come my delicious dark french pressed coffee. The owner asked me if I wanted cream or milk (I said cream), and he even came around the desk to check if there was cream out (awwww so sweet!). There wasn't, so he gave me a little cup of some delicious cream, measured out to be just right for my coffee (how did he know??), and man, that was one delicious coffee. I couldn't stop drinking it. It was REALLY good, and believe me, I'm a coffee snob, and it was a really great cup of coffee. :)

Anyways, now the macaroons-

we just tried 4 of them:

- Giandaja: Two thumbs up (and my big toes too). Delicious, soft, just the right amount of sweetness, yep, I like that flavor.

- Cafe au Lait- my fave. It really DID taste like a cafe au lait- I bit into it and was like, ""omg, it really tastes like a cafe au lait!"". Yep- that was my fave by far.

- Lemon- this one was pretty good, not my fave though. I think they do their sweet macaroons really well, but their fruity ones are good, but not as good as the sweet ones. The lemon one didn't have as strong of a taste that I would have liked (but then again, I like my lemons real sour), so it was alright.

- Lingonberry- this was also good, but not one of my faves. I think I prefer the sweet macaroons...but that's just a personal preference.

Anyways, we chatted with the owner for a little bit about the place, and when I asked him how he liked having a storefront now, he responded with ""I love it."" That's true love and happiness in a business, and it made me want to support them even more.

So yay! I approve. When I need my fix of macaroons- no need to beg my other cities friends to send me them, I'll just take a walk over to Coquette Patisserie, where my craving can be complete!",2014-02-08 04:40:07

Had two appetizers, the cheese bread which to me was slightly under cooked but very good and fried casava which was excellent.

Since we weren't to hungry we ordered the Feijoada, which again is a traditional Brazilian dish with rice, black beans that have sausage and smoked meat with a small side of greens and a vinaigrette that perfectly balances out the dish.

The tofu and veggie sides were not particularly impressive. The pork chop was fairly thin and it wasn't very big. The fried tofu hidden under it gave the impression that there was more pork than there was. The pork itself was oddly sticky. I don't think I've ever described meat that way before. It was almost like jerky sticky, but also like gummy candy sticky. It was not what I was expecting, and not in a good way. The rice was also sticky, in an overcooked way. Yeah.

treKNlPawdE-524Jj71mow,Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,5,2,0,0,"This is the original Geisha Steakhouse which has been around for a loooooonnnggg time believe me. I had one of my first dates with my husband here back in the late 80's and we have introduced many people to this restaurant including our daughter, Mom and Dad, hubby's Dad, other family members and a ton of friends.  All is can say is the food is consistently delicious every time we come. Since we no longer live on this side of town, we only come now for special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries etc. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy especially at night but I would only patronize this location. 

Last night was no exception to the incredible food found here. There were five of us last night and we all ordered the Geisha Special which consists of filet mignon (cooked exactly how you like it), lobster, shrimp and chicken. Each dinner comes with a bowl of miso soup, a salad, your choice of appetizer of either Shrimp tempura, shrimp and vegetable tempura or an egg roll. Then you have fried rice and vegetables as well. The dinner also includes your choice of soda or hot sake. In the old days, the dinner used to include dessert too of which I always chose the green tea ice cream. I sure do miss it! Once the orders are in, out comes the chef to cook up your meal on the teppanyaki grill. We have had some really funny chefs through the years that have provided us with a ton of entertainment. Our favorite will always be Chef Jimmy - RIP. He was the original owner of this restaurant and he always cooked our food to perfection and left us laughing our asses off.

Once the cooking begins there is fire and heat and the smells coming from the food are mouth watering, you literally can't wait for your food to be delivered to your plate. The lobster was just so fresh and light. Dipping into a delicious ginger sauce just set all the flavors into an explosion in your mouth. The filet mignon was juicy and dipped into the hot mustard sauce made it even better. The chicken is always good and when the fried rice comes off the grill I just want to dive into it. 

The customer service is outstanding and our server was always offering us more drinks, filling our water glasses and removing empty plates from the small eating area. The restaurant is not that big so I recommend always making a reservation just in case especially on the weekends.

Long live Geisha Steakhouse!",2016-05-22 22:15:57

The most unfortunate thing about Little Tony's is that it's nestled inside Palace Station. A cool hip pizza joint in the middle of a depressing casino. It's a shame really. It's just like WuHu noodle house being in the Silverton. Not something you expect.

We were seated immediately as the Palace Station faithful were not crowding the restaurant on this night. This is where the night went from good to amazing.

Ordered an IPA and when our server (Mike, which I've been told 3 Mikes work there, but was assured that all the Mikes were friendly) totally biffs it and spills the beer on the empty part of the booth (we did not get spilled on). He immediately picks it up and plays it off. He starts wafting the air and says something to the effect of, ""the aroma is really going to add something to your dinner."" He cracked us up the rest of the night. 

I was sold on this place. Our server became the coolest guy in the world. We talked to him most of the night and he was probably the funniest, nicest server I've ever had. 

Oh right, the food!

The food was just as good as the service.

WHISKEY WINGS. That's the jam. Mike warned us about the wings. These are wet wings with a heat bite that sneaks up on you. Your scalp will be sweating in no time with these wings. Pain was worth it.

Ordered two pizzas, the Picante and the Tartufo. The Picante is a spicy pizza with both serrano and banana peppers with Cholula hot sauce on it as well. This heat does not sneak up on you as much. It's either you take a bite and it's fine or you get a bite and your mouth is on fire. It was more complicated than just being hot though. It had a ton of flavors going on and the heat added a nice kick. 

The Tartufo was the opposite. A more culinary refined pizza with truffle oil, Italian goat cheese and Prosciutto De Parma. This was our server's recommended suggestion. It was a great pizza that you wouldn't necessarily think was a great pizza. Definitely a must have.

We visited Harper's (after a long break) MISTAKE. They were out of all potato product other than French Fries. My dish included a Baked Potato -- nope French Fries.  Nancy's dish was to come with Asparagus first time so tough my steak knife couldn't cut it..... they brought more. Again too tough that we couldn't cut it. So she asked for mashed potato's. NOPE OUT.  So they brought coleslaw (now mind you my wife likes coleslaw)....this was so thick with mayonnaise that even she (who loves Mayo) couldn't eat it.  Then we were presented with a full bill with an $3 up charge for my steak...... WHAT? Queen's feast is your best foot forward. The steak was good .....but not that good. Nancy had the Salmon good but again neither of us got the side we were supposed to. Only after we complained did they offer a discount. Manager only approached when the first side was bad. JUST WOW.

The best time to visit, in my opinion, is in spring or early summer when all the flowers and trees are in bloom.  There are so many things to see here like the stunning English tudor mansion, the Japanese garden, the row of birch trees, the view, and the green house.

Of course, the mansion is simply beautiful.  When I was a kid, my parents brought me here for my first tour.  I was mesmerized.  I remember wanting to own this mansion badly.  I still want to live in it!  I feel like I'm stepping into the past each time I visit.  My imagination runs wild and I pretend that I live here.

The mansion has 65 rooms and 25 fire places, an indoor pool, an indoor bowling alley and much, much more.  My favorite room is the great room with all the stuffed animals from Mr. Syberling's hunting adventures, followed by the music room with the massive rug.

Some of the walls were shipped here from Europe as other tudors and mansions were being dismantled.  The stone floors were worn to make them look older!

Presidents have stayed here as well as Helen Keller.  Stan Hywet is truly remarkable.  I'm so glad to live near it to have the opportunity to visit once every few years.  I can't wait until my kids are old enough to appreciate this gem of a landmark.

the crust was strong, the bread soft, but without that things i added, i dont think id be into eating it plane at all.  i kind of find nothing too exciting about any of their breads as breads to stand on their own; ive tried a few pieces of things here and there in their store and nothing grabbed me.

i will continue to go there, however, and i will also try less healthy breads, like whiter breads, that might be a bit more fluffy or something.  maybe i just have to find the right kind of bread itself regardless of who makes it.  

now i did buy some hamburger buns here in the summer and those were fresh and great.  and id also like to try some of their tasty looking deserts and as a matter of fact, from what  ive been told on saturday they are supposed to have good cornbread, and today is friday so tomorrow...

As we walked in, I noticed an exquisite Mercedes S Class parked in front with the license plate ""NEBBIOLO"". I assumed it must be the owner's car. Only a true Italian wine aficionado would think to personalize his license plate with one of the finest Piedmontese red wine grape varieties. If this was in fact the case, I figured we would be in for a real treat.

And what a wonderful, wonderful dining experience we had. From the second we were warmly greeted by the lovely hostess, and promptly seated, things only kept getting better and better.

Our waiter Eric was not only warm, attentive, knowledgable, and professional, but he displayed a true enthusiasm for his work. I have seldom seen a waiter exude such a genuine pride in the food that he serves. He described each dish and ingredient with impeccable detail and knowledge. When the dishes were served, his positive energy was so palpable that we could barely wait to dig in. Without a doubt, one of the finest waiters I have ever had the pleasure to dine with.

Sommelier was a delightful gentleman from Torino, who went over the wine list, in perfect Italian (obviously - yet quite intimidating for me), in great detail. We opted for an excellent value San Felice that was very well received by all of our guests.

We opted for a trio appetizer of beef carpaccio, seared Mediterranean octopus, and burrata salad. The carpaccio was made with thin slices of beef, arugula, and shaved Parmigiano - delicious. The octopus was very tasty and tender; served with kalamata olives, potatoes (very nice touch) and fried capers (flavor explosion - wow!). Lastly, the burrata salad was excellent, surrounded with thinly shaved spicy carrot salad and pesto. The pesto tasted more like almonds than pine nuts. Very nice.

Primo was homemade gnocchi. Just like my nonna used to make - simple tomato basil sauce was perfect. Gnocchi were tender and tasty.

For secondo, we went for the ossobuco. (might as well since we heard so much about it). It did not disappoint. Perfectly braised, delectable sauce and served with faro, which was a nice old-school touch and a pleasant change from the standard risotto. They even had a special spoon for the bone marrow...ahhhhhh! :)

Chocolatissimo for dessert was outstanding and hazelnut gelato was perfect. We even got a tour of their stunning wine cellar. I was drooling at the selection of Gajas....

Wait other films have plenty of T and A but you don't shut those down? Hump is an amateur nude film.... made up of 5 min short nude film contest winners from the West Coast. A different take on sexuality then the mainstream-- very refreshing and humorous if you're open to it. 

So one star for that alone. I cannot review the seats because I didn't get one.... this was not the cinemas fault. Other than being an incredibly small theater and they can't do much about that (its in an old pittsburgh storefront building yo). 

Its brand spanking new--- clean, offering films like this one or pulp fiction, or other cult classics. 

It is in lack of parking Lawrenceville so you should make note of that and plan ahead of time for that. 

Lastly Beer there is a beer shop next door and I think you can bring it in the theater if you buy it there or bring your own. Not a new concept but I haven't seen it yet in Pittsburgh--- way to catch up with the times Lawrenceville. 

Warning: If you pre-purchased a ticket for Hump tour 2014 and you are not at the door or in line or maybe if you are in line. At the start of your show time. They are reselling your ticket, yup that's right the one you paid 18$ for.  Of course you can come back for another show they said.... 

I was told that this was ""stated"" on the website. I have since checked all websites affliated with my ticket and Hump2014 and can find no such mention to ""be on time or else!""  Unless they count the generic vendor agreement in the ticket terms of use which incredibly lame if they do. If its sold its sold out.

Um no I want my show now I am sorry I was 10 minutes late but there's nil parking out there its Butler st. 

Here mam break your back sitting on this stool while pissing off other patrons? Um no ill sit on theater steps. So they got me a dining chair that looked like it came out of an EatnPark ten years ago. I had mild back pains through the movie and it aggravated my hamstring injury. Buttt I got to watch the show I paid 18$ in advance for two weeks Ago--- Thanks Hump tour you are super generous!

I did my research after the show and this appeared to be solely a vendor issue not a reflection of Rowhouse. But because it affected my experience and thus my review I put it in here. 

I hope to go back and check out some other films here in the future. I just think I will skip Hump 2015.",2014-06-15 14:53:38

The view from up there is indeed pretty great. Depending on where you sit, you get to enjoy either the strip, downtown Las Vegas, or the mountains. The drinks there are also pretty good  and if you go for their happy hour, you get two cocktails for the price of one. We decided to go for the Mango vodka one and we ended up paying $15.

This place is located on the 107th floor of the stratosphere on Las Vegas Boulevard. Parking is easy since you can park for free at the Stratosphere parking structure. Note though that the lounge is rather small so it might be hard to get a table depending on what time you get there. It was already pretty hard for us and we went there at 5:30pm...

The only negative point is about service which is definitely below average at this place...

The good thing about getting drinks there is that you also get free entrance to the observation deck on the 108th floor so you can enjoy the view a little more.

We pre-calculated our bill since she gave us one bill with both our orders, but over charged us and refused to listen that her math was wrong so I gave her a low tip for my inconvenience and the fact I still over paid for my portion.  They brought our food on wrong and didn't apologize and understand why it was an issue, and told us to eat, then switch plates after we finish one taco so we can eat the other taco from the other person's plate (we're female friends and not on dates and even so why would we want to eat from each other's plate like animals?!)!  They put half of each of our tacos on the other person's  plates and I had to switch the tacos myself prior to eating, as the waitress watched us when clearly it's her job ""hello""!  Food wasn't great either.  We had tacos and the beef cheek had an odd livery taste, chicken was decent.  My friend said the pork taco  had a weird taste and her cocktail was too strong.  We didn't order fish tacos because my friend came previously and said the fish was tasteless (unseasoned bland), but the sauce was okay.  Additionally, the customer at a table behind me me had his chair pulled right up against mine the entire time and he kept bumping it.  My friend arrived early before me and she was the only customer on the patio, but the waitress tried to rush her. Everything was unpleasant except for my friend's company.

P.S.  I tried calling them and realized I couldn't get through because their phone number  listed on their receipt is wrong!  Tells you even they think they're forgettable.",2016-09-09 03:16:36

My guarantee is that there's something here to please everyone. Head to the back because their patio is lovely. Although it's not as airy on a humid day - it's still more spacious and brighter than the front.

If you're a meat-lover, try their juicy burgers with their fresh ingredients. I love the Kissing Cousins burger. If you're a vegetarian, feel free to sub any burgers for a veggie patty free of charge. Also a must-try is their veggie poutine which is heavenly with its cheese curds and gravy. It's one of my favourite items! I'm also a fan of their Classic Rueben sandwich, grilled cheese (so cheesy!), and curried sweet potato soup. They are so generous with all their portions it's unbelievable! Friends have tried their burritos, salads, and nachos and have said good things.

The servers are friendly, but depending on how busy it gets you may have to wait a while for your food. It's understandable why there's a crowd because they offer some pretty sweet deals. They have $8 lunch specials (soup, sandwich, and side) on Mon-Thurs from 11-3 pm.

I've been to a handful of other manors and estates, but I really think this one has a lot to offer. I've been back multiple times since I live relatively nearby, and there is always something different to see depending on the season or what events they may have going on (check their website calendar!) 

I HIGHLY recommend the ""Nooks and Crannies"" tour, it seems pricey at $25 a head (and it is) but in my opinion, it's totally worth it. The group is smaller, and the tour guides really take the time to show you the pieces of the house you wouldn't normally see on the walk through tour. (and there really is a lot to see in this house).

However, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner. 

I attempted to make a reservation via OpenTable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. Then I called. The hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a ""short"" wait for less than 30 minutes. Since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. Humph. Anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. A bit longer than I enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!

Most of us decided on selections from the ""Big Buns"" category (good ol' burgers and fries). I had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but I'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the ""Gold Standard"" ($17.50). Dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. HOLY TASTEBUDS. That first bite was euphoric. I can't even describe it, but I'll always remember how I felt - amazing. I was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than the burgers they were eating (Memphis Burger - very tasty - and The Rising Sun - shrug). I've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it MUCH better. Because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. Get the Gold Standard; medium rare, of course. Really, really good.

With your ""Big Buns"" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for sweet potato fries or thick cut onion rings. I got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. I also tried the Fried Pickles ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a Strawberry Milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. Overall, all the food was great!

Our server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. Then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. I figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.

I'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with Holsteins, but I can guess. Based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, I'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. Hopefully I won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!",2014-01-03 07:53:57

Both the protein and the veggies were cooked properly and neither's texture was sacrificed in the cooking process for their dish mates.  Perhaps it is my gluttony or perhaps the serving style, but I thought I could have used a little more white rice.

Cocktails: All of us got a cocktail and everyone agreed they didn't taste like they had any alcohol in them. We ended up leaving and going downtown for Cocktails at the Shangri-la where they are much better for the price.

The restaurant is small but cozy and they have a small patio perfect for warmer days. When my friend and I went on a Friday for lunch, the place was empty - we were the only customers until a party of four entered towards the end of our meal. All tortilla entrees come with Mexican fried rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo. We ordered steak quesadillas ($11.50 excl. tax): a flour tortilla with feta cheese and chipotle sauce or sour cream and steak enchiladas ($13.50 excl. tax) with mild sauce: three rolled tortillas with feta and sour cream. My friend loved the steak quesadillas and would give them a 4/5. I thought the enchiladas were just okay - a 2.5 or 3/5 at best. The enchiladas' mild sauce was too sour in my opinion and because the enchiladas are covered with a generous amount of it (the amount is a good thing, the flavour of the salsa not so much), I didn't find myself enjoying the dish too much. Overall, Planeta Mexico is a good Mexican food place. The service is super friendly and accommodating.

We both ordered the $50 Rib Eye steaks with our choice of flavored butter. Nothing comes with it so we had to order salads, veggies and mashed potatoes on the side. When our orders arived, everything was room temperature. My first initial indication was that the pat of green butter wasn't melted. My second indication that something wasn't right was size, shape and cut of the actual ""rib eye"".

The meat was thin, tough, chewy and had a lot of grissle. This was definitely not a rib eye, at least not even a $5 piece of meat. I am very confident that this was their flat iron steak being passed off for a $50 Rib Eye. Honestly, I've had better steak at Denny's. Ruth's Chris has nothing to worry about.

The margaritas were good as were the garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus spears, but the steak was really, really horrid.

He said that one time he made cinnamon rolls and no one cared for them and that no one was familiar with the french macaroons either. So they haven't been making those either. 
This place is so confusing to me, if you advertise items, those items should be available. Right now when you walk in it looks the same as it did a month ago-about 7 different cupcakes and all the other display cases are empty.

He asked what kind of cupcakes I like and I told him I like the fruity flavors...He told me that one time they had mango and lychee cupcakes but that they didn't sell. I told him they should have a cupcake schedule so that I can go when a flavor I like is there. He was nice enough to offer to make the mango cupcake on a future visit of mine so I chose Friday and he said Mango cupcakes will be there on Friday. For the mango cupcakes I shall return this Friday.

 Pumpkin with Cream Cheese Frosting-Very good- I really liked this cupcake-Yummers....
Strawberry with strawberry frosting-Very different from the last strawberry cupcake I bought here.I almost feel like strawberry jello was mixed in the frosting-the cake was way more moist than before.This cupcake wasn't overly sweet and the frosting was a bit tangy-I enoyed this one as well, I'll get this again.

I believe all their ramen has the tonkotsu broth as their foundation, and they say on the menu they cook their broth for 18 hours. I think that's what Ryoji said too...(Another ramen place in Little Italy area). Anyway, I digress. 

The special thing about this place is that any time you order anything with sesame seeds, they give you a light pestle and mortar to grind your own seeds and put into the ramen yourself. I would note though, that the sesame seeds didn't have the rich aroma and flavour I expected, so it really didn't add much to the ramen. But kudos on giving this experience to their customers.

Another special thing is, they serve menma (bamboo shoots) as a basic topping!! If you hate bamboo shoots (they can smell a bit funny), you should ask them to leave it out. When the table next to us were getting their ramen, I could smell the bamboo shoots strongly, which I don't mind, personally.

Another thing! They flavour the yolk of the egg so it's just a little sweet and more flavourful. I think they put on a bit of light brown liquid on the yolk after they cut it in half. Interesting.

One more thing, their basic shio (salt) tonkotsu broth and chashu is very ""lean"", and less saltier than other places. It's a more delicate flavour, which I loved. I am very very sure that they skim off a lot of the fat as they boil their broth, because you don't see sizable circles of fat floating in their soup, just tiny beads of it. Their chashu is about 90% meat and 10% fat, which is pretty much the leanest it can get, for chashu. And it still tastes amazing! It's tender and chewy at the same time. I think the fact that it's sliced quite thinly contributes to that.

I tried a bit of the broth of the Light Shoyu (soy sauce), and man that was good! Imagine the broth of the basic shio tonkotsu, but with the smoky fish scent, and sweet flavour of katsuobushi. I am ordering that next time. I like that the soy sauce wasn't too heavy, it was quite light in the ramen, compared to some other places.
Just a note that they also have ""Rich"" Shoyu; the only difference is that it's more oily than the Light.

Based on the Shio and Shoyu ramen I've tried, this place has a more delicate and light flavour overall than other places I'd been to, but it was still pretty rich and satisfying, so five stars for such a good balance.",2015-02-26 03:29:35

My friend had VIP for the weekend through her work, and it was somewhat puzzling. You would think VIP access to watch the concerts would be closest to the stage in the middle. They were not, they were on the side of the stage, and there were a TON of people with VIP passes!  Suggestion for the future:  Create the VIP area from the side and slide it right into the front of the stage as well to accommodate those who paid more money for the passes please.  VIP area had bars set up with cocktails, beer, wine, and separate nice restrooms. Think mobile trailer but decked out inside with laminate flooring granite countertops on the sinks. Very nice to use instead of the horrific port a potties.   I loved the vibe of the festival, art everywhere, and everyone that attended seemed to be in a really good mood. We didn't come across any mean people except for the Foo Fighters performance when trying to make our way back from the bathroom, a guy literally grabbed my friend's arm and asked where she thought she was going! How incredibly rude to put your hands on another human being you don't know to prevent her from getting back to her spot closer to the stage!  Besides that, it was a lot of fun and the lineup was great!  Parking, lol, well that was a nightmare. We parked at Binions parking garage and paid $20 for the day.  I understand what they're trying to do with the Downtown area of Las Vegas, revitalizing it and all, but this festival seemed too large to accommodate that many people. Two lanes of traffic on most streets, plus rush hour for those getting out of work going home, made for a stressful arrival into the downtown area.  Coming off of I-95 at LV Blvd exit making a left. 2 cars in each lane turning left were able to get onto LV Blvd because traffic was backed up into the intersection when the light turned green.

To start, we had a few cocktails. The cocktails were creative and delicious - a great way to start an evening.

While all of the dishes were excellent, there were three standouts: (1) fried chicken; (2) the lobster; and (3) seafood pasta. It may seem odd for me to praise the fried chicken dish for a review of a seafood restaurant. However, the fried chicken (which was loaded with maple syrup sriracha and served with brussels sprout) was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was incredibly flavourful. The lobster meat was sweet, savoury and succulent.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.

lbs. is on the pricier side. You are paying for the atmosphere, service and quality of food. If you are looking for reasonably priced seafood with no bells and whistles - lbs. is not the place to go.

OBthmMwwjdhI2hIdOzpRTA,Bf-X9oxiiRvzgrwguUWoeg,O66Zy8Y13VBm72ZDhS4fIg,5,1,0,0,"The first time I've heard about this restaurant was from my ex-girlfriend Heide, in grade ten.
She was from the upper echelon of the Forest Hill community, and I was an emerging name in the...Pacific Mall/Metro Square consensus........
I've never gotten to experience the restaurant prior to the electrical fire which forced the restaurant to completely re-think everything about the business.  I just remember hearing that I would need at least a week's notice to reserve a table.  
This intimidated me as a sixteen year old, as it should have.  I didn't even know where Forest Hill, I thought she lived in the Woods.

I imagined myself having a love & hate relationship with the restaurant over the years of frequently it, but the simple fact is that they've been nothing but highly accommodating in every aspect of service, and the food has never disappointed, or embarrassed me before.  I don't see Toronto as a world class city, but after given serious thought, the restaurant Sassafraz could be considered on par with some of the top restaurants I've ever been to anywhere in the world, especially given the circumstances of being located in Toronto, a city which in my opinion does not strive for, or demand the absolute best of anything.

In terms of real estate, Sassafraz holds the most coveted corner of all of Yorkville, and it is certainly the most distinct in architectural design--not that it's unique, but in that it is a big yellow house.
Some people use the weather system, some use the news, but I use the Maitre'Ds standing outside of the restaurant to verify whether if it's really summer.  
The girls working there are always pleasantly dressed and well groomed.  For such a young demographic to be working in a high demand business, they are actually properly trained as service persons.  
I do appreciate their professionalism, considering the Sassafraz is also a local hangout for some of the most pretentious people in all of Toronto.  There is this elderly gentleman who dresses like he is a metropolitan cowboy, and often parks his Rolls Royce Phantom outside while chatting up whoever he can find younger than him.  I don't have anything against him, and I certainly would like to be in his situation when I am older, but I don't think I'd be as garish.  And for the waiters, all I can hope is that the tip is well worth putting up with that kind of pish-posh.

There are more expensive, and higher-end restaurants in the city, but somehow I always find myself here for a special occasion. 
I took the two loves of my life here on our first date, and they've gone relatively well.  Relatively well for me is as good as it gets.
I took a dear friend here once during the time adjacent to the Stafford Festival, and I ended up meeting Harold Perrineau, and Mr. Laurence Fishburne!
Yeah, Morpheus himself!  I wish my phone rang during my conversation with him, so I could have told him to take it first...HA!
Mr. Fishburne tried to hook a brother up after my conversation with him, and commented about the woman I was with in the following:  ""Wow, you know, you two, you two make an incredible couple.""
I withheld every urge to shove out my fist and go for a props with the Hollywood legend.  

My most memorable evening was during my friend Tia's twenty-third birthday.  
I booked the VIP table on the second floor, but I received a call telling me it was double booked last minute.  We were given the centre floor in the restaurant area, which ended up being empty, so really I did have in the end our own VIP room, and bigger!  I saved $100 because that's the donation which is given to the Fire Fighters Association when booking the VIP table, which I was glad to pay.
They restaurant accommodated us with complimentary cake slicing which would have been $3 per slice, and a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine.
The service was delivered by a Egyptian looking gentleman, and the evening was just simply perfection.  

Sometimes Sassafraz do experiments, like booking a live pianist which ended up singing Britney's Spears' 'Baby One More Time' too freaking loud in the Bar area.  I could barely hear my friend while he echoed that trademark ""Ack Ack Ack AcK!"" into the microphone.  If he kept going, I swear I was going to ack right into my food. 

There are a few key points about the restaurant which I am a fan of, like the vine backdrop in the restaurant, and the cheese tasting menu.  But there's no point for me to mention it all, because I feel that Sassafraz is a place where you should develop your own experiences and stories.  It is without a doubt one of the more romantic spots in Toronto.  

Not everything will be perfect, but that's the excitement about it I guess.
Like last time I came here, it was the morning after the biggest birthday party of my life, it was around 10am, I walked to the front doors of the restaurant to see it was open for breakfast, and was greeting by an elderly Italian man who shouted the following at me: 'VAT DO YOU VAN",2013-02-24 10:57:17

The food: I ordered the octopus tapas which has me a lil confused as to what the goal was for this dish. Pieces of octopus were served over potato beds and seemed to be too over seasoned. The oxtail tapas were good, but again, a little too confusing for my taste buds. However, the dessert was just a bit of heaven!!!

We've had flights both times we've been and been impressed with the selection. They've come a long way since their Watermelon Wheat (which sounded a lot better than it tasted).

THE SPACE- Their brewpub is long & narrow and above their brewery. It's designed so that you can see the brewing tanks in the pub which  is quite cool, but the space is tight and it can be hard to get a table. I love that they have board games if you want something to do!

A few things about the food here, most of the dishes are super bland, their chicken is majorly weird tasting and the Mac n Cheese? I'd rather it out of a box than what they serve. 
What did we have? Here's a list:
Buffalo tater tots - friendly note, the chicken tastes like it was boiled or something and then shredded. It was kind of chewy. You know what I mean, that chewy chicken taste? Not good at all 
Veggie burger - ok so points because it's homemade but points taken away because it was super tasteless. 
Fries, tots: these are extra and don't come with your meal like our serve led us to believe. Sneaky on CBCB part if you ask me. So maybe you fix your ways of doing things? Talking to you management. 
Chicken wings: seriously no flavor. None. And they were sooooooo dry. 
Burger: the bun was stale, beyond stale, and the burger (I was told) didn't have much flavor to it. 
Dip sandwich: they don't serve it with ANY aus jus. NONE?! Seriously?!? We had to ask for a side of it. Positive and the bread was fresh. Negative and the sandwich was tasteless. 

See a theme here with their foods?

Note: fries DO NOT come with your burger and the servers DO NOT make that clear so it's an extra charge if you want fries with your sandwiches. 
The chicken wings are dry AF. Seriously. No joking around. So sad. 

Positives (and there aren't many): the beer selection is pretty decent and they do a rotating monthly beer special that is decent.

Come for the beer. Eat somewhere else for the food.",2018-02-25 18:07:55

One side of my cup was rich dark Triple chocolate, creamier than the Nutella but a good subtle contrast to each other.  After digging my way through the Triple Chocolate Fudge I landed in the Nutella and finshed out the cup.  

To the right of the display case are charts with nutitional information of gelato vs. ice cream.  The serving size is for 113 grams.  I am not sure how many grams are in each serving size.  Let's just say I am over the limit here.

While I am in my chocolate nirvana, I looked around the store.  It is completely immaculate in every corner, everything is so clean.  The display cases, the floor, the tables, everything was spotless.  Even the work area was spotless.  That makes you feel like there is a lot of care in food handling.

Other tempting desserts are:  tiramisu, profitelores, cheesecake, cannoli, fondant and carrot cake.  There are a few tables for enjoying your desserts and coffee outside.

I also asked the salesperson how many ounces or grams a medium was.  I wanted to compare the nutritional information provided vesus the serving size I gladly ate.  She didn't know so I took the medium cup home and filled it with water and poured it into my measuring cup.  The medium is 2/3 cup or 50 ml or about 5 ounces.  I still don't know how many grams that is.  Maybe a brainiac can convert that to grams for me.

Other people were commenting on it and trying to figure out what on earth was causing the horrific stench. In several areas of the park there are puddles of water that pool in the dirt and on the concrete that are disgusting and smell- Im honestly shocked that the health department doesn't step in and make them improve the areas with terrible drainage because the cess pools are an obvious a health hazard and mosquito breeding ground. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting- trash on the ground puddles of brown liquid- who knows what- so gross. We were waiting in line for one and were turned away due to no toilet paper. We made the mistake of eating here the first time and won't do that again- it was basically bowling alley food- they should allow people to bring in food or at least offer healthy options.

Cela n'empêche pas le poulet de Coco Rico d'être tendre et succulent, au contraire ! Non seulement le poulet est une réussite mais les portions sont généreuses.

Je recommande le spécial demi-poulet avec salade de choux et patates pour moins de 10$. Un très bon prix pour un poulet de qualité supérieure. N'oubliez pas d'accompagner votre repas avec un petit pain portugais pour un supplément de 0.50$. Il est croustillant et délicieux.",2013-03-20 21:07:09

The green chile pork was HOT, while the beef in red chile and shredded beef were mild.

Ordered the two beef enchilada special.  Their red sauce is really good, not overly tomato-y or oily, with a nice spice level (I could taste the garlic).

The salt level for a forkful of enchilada and rice was perfect.  The cheese was really great (I loved how salty it was).  It actually tasted better as I continued to eat it.

The rice was plain, fluffy, and well-cooked.

FOOD: 

I went with the ""Brooklyn Burger,"" which was topped with a beer-battered onion ring, red pepper relish, and aged cheddar, on a black sesame seed bun. Side of match stick fries. The patty was juicy enough to eventually soak through the bun - so if you're a slow eater, be prepared for a slightly soggy bun. This didn't detract from the taste too much for me though, as the toppings went really well together to add a bit of sweetness to the salty goodness. Fries where crispy, as I like them.

SERVICE:

A bit on the slow side, but this place gets uber packed on a Friday and Saturday night, so it's understandable. The server herself took time to answer questions, and did a good job sorting through our multiple bills and items ordered.

ATMOSPHERE:

My first thought was that this place has a bit of a 'Texas' vibe to it...not sure if intentional or not. Either way, it's a pretty spacious place with a nice patio and elevated seating area inside. Great to stop by for a meal, or drink on a summer day.

anyway, we ordered and were prepared to dislike everything on principle, but the manager who brought over our beers, told us round 1 was on the house due to their mistake and then later sent over a delicious and piping hot pretzel and cheese appetizer for us to try. kudos to them for quickly rectifying the situation.

we each tried a different brat (spicy, sweet, veal and wild boar) and a few different toppings (pickled onions, sauerkraut and a sweet chutney). everyone was very pleased with their selections, i think we just wish the bread was a little more traditional. the various mustards and ketchups that came to the table were great, as were the garlic fries.

We went to Honda West. It was very convenient being that it was the closest location. The guy that was helping us told us that he was not able to do the oil change without charging us and that otherwise we would have to go back to Findlay Honda Henderson to get it done. As we left, we called Findlay Honda and told them what had happened at Honda West. The lady on the phone straight up told us, (exact words) ""Um, they can do it. All they had to do was call a 1-800- number. They were probably just too lazy to go through the process. I've even just had somebody get their oil changed in Florida.""

At first it was a little bumpy. The table was not set up yet on time, and we had a select menu to choose from (but they gave us their regular menus). They seemed a little underprepared. But after that everything seemed to go a little smoother.
Our servers (we had two) were good and seemed to check on us frequently. 
Our select menu was a three course meal that included a salad (house or Caesar), an entree, and a dessert. I opted for the Caesar and it was delicious, not overly dressed. 
I got a alcoholic beverage - pomegranate martini. It was fruity, but sweet. I drank three of them! 
For the entree I ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) with the whipped potatoes and broccoli. 
It seemed to take quite a long time for the food to come out.
When it did, my steak was over cooked (it was basically well done) and the broccoli was under-seasoned - or maybe not seasoned at all?  
A little after the entrees came out there was a little situation and the medics were called. Everything is fine. But the staff (management) was helpful and responded quickly. This was why I gave them the four stars. After everything they checked up on me and seemed honestly concerned.
After the situation, I was able to take my dessert home - brownie with ice cream. 

Their food was not bad, it was just a little under-seasoned (but pepper does the trick!) and my steak was a little over done - but I'm sure they would recook it if I had asked. I have been here several times, and I'm sure I'll make my way back here again!",2017-12-17 16:56:36

The first thing we noticed is that the space has gotten smaller since our last visit last year. The place was empty, so perhaps this is a money-saving tactic. Anyway, I ordered a single burger with cheese and a pretty wide selection of toppings, while my friend ordered a combo.

We took a seat and waited. And waited. Even though we were the only customers, it took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive. When it finally did come, the fries were piping hot but the burgers were room temperature (at best). I'm not sure how long the burgers were just sitting there waiting for the fries to be ready, but the cook should, at this point, have a better system for ensuring everything arrives at hot.

The barely-warm patty was fine, if unspectacular. There was an attempt at a crust but it had either been made soggy by the toppings or it just wasn't cooked enough. The end result was an edible but far-from-memorable burger. And given that it cost me around $8, I was certainly a little disappointed. The fries were amazing, though.

I didn't want pasta, but they had a meatball sandwich and a burger, so I thought I would give it a shot.  A lunch special was the meatball burger with a side of parmesan fries for $9.95.  This is a very good deal based on pricing on the menu, but I got mozzarella which added another $1.50.  The fries were fantastic, a 4 star dish.  Crispy, and full of parmesan and garlic flavor.  I don't know if I would change anything about them.

The burger, on the other hand, was not as huge of a win.  The bun was nice and soft, but lost its integrity after a few bites of the burger when the juices began to run.  I ordered it medium, but it did not have any pink in it.  Also, the burger was dry, and only served with ketchup on the side.  I ordered some of the mushroom gravy as a side, and I'm glad I did.  This had an excellent mushroom flavor, but was a little on the thin side.  However, it definitely improved the burger and the meal overall.  I expected more from the burger, which I presume was made into a patty from their usual meatball mixture.

I will say the service was fantastic.  Drinks are served in smaller type mason jars with a handle.  I order my drinks with extra ice, and it was filled to the top, which I like.  But, it meant that with a glass this small, my drink was nearly empty after 3 drinks.  It didn't matter, because my server was so spot on it never got close to empty.  Refilled very quickly and without having to ask.  Also, he was not overbearing and trying to upsell me on desserts or anything.  Excellent service. 

I'll probably return and try the sliders during happy hour.  But, the burger did not overwhelm me.  What saves this place from getting 2 stars are the fries and the service.",2013-02-01 06:50:39

The lines move along quicker here than you'd think because they have enough staff on hand to handle the long lines. There is also a gift shop next door  to this location so you can get your in n out merch without paying shipping fees. I hadn't been to this location in a minute because I experienced some issues with my order not being correct which is hardly the case with in n out but I have been by recently several times and it's been on point. I ask for my burger different ways depending on what sounds good each time and my order has been just the way I order it. I go inside sometimes but the drive thru works best for me because getting a place to sit inside at this location can take longer than it takes to get your food more times than not. Being near the strip and one of the first recognizable signs coming into Vegas it's a given that this place will be popping.

It also surprised me that it was in the Midland/McNicoll plaza as I've been there a couple of times, but haven't noticed Magic Noodle!

But... Perhaps my expectations were a little too great because I left with quite a disappointment.

Coming in a little before lunch time, it wasn't as packed. Our waitress was on her phone and yawning while she told us to sit wherever we liked. Alrrrrright... Maybe she was from the overnight/early morning shift since Magic Noodle is open 24/7 were my thoughts to let this one part of the service slide because I found it to be kind of unbelievable even at an Asian restaurant standard.

Menus were given and Magic Noodle offers quite a number of stuff! From appetizers, to fried noodles, cold dishes, skewers, but I think they specialized in noodle soups since they have more options of those.

We settled for The Magic and the Foochow Bowl both from the Hand-Pulled Noodle category. Upon taking our orders, she seemed to not really care, but when she was talking to her co-workers, she was very loud and making a ruckus with them, all while speaking Mandarin.

Each table has a water jug filled with water and a lemon slice in them. Along condiments like chopsticks, tissues, chili oil, soya sauce, etc.

The Magic noodle bowl consisted of beef stock, sliced beef, pork chop, fried egg, braised lamb, beef tripe, pickled turnip, cilantro and scallions with chili oil on the side, but my friend opted chili oil in general because of low spice tolerance (since we're not sure how much they were going to put in).

I got the Foochow bowl which had a mix of chicken and pork stock, fishballs, imitation crab, seaweed and scallions. The fishballs were stuffed with pork fillings which surprised me, in a good and bad way. Good because it was stuffed, bad because I actually prefer regular fishballs compared to the stuffed ones.

At first glance, they didn't give us much or at least comparing to the pictures on the menu. But to be fair, it was written at the bottom of the menu that ""pictures are for illustrative purposes only. actual products might differ"". Damm straight it differed from the pictures...

It was a disappointing experience for both me and my friend. My friend's meal actually had more bones than meat... and we had both expected more meat in general as well. My meal was just alright but nothing special nor would I get it again... just didn't feel that satisfying.

The only thing we both agreed on was that the noodles were really really good. I'm assuming they make the noodles by themselves in the store considering they labelled it ""hand-pulled noodles"", and it was just really soft and chewy. But that is about the only good thing I have to say about this restaurant.

The food didn't satisfy us, and needless to say that the service didn't improve at all. Won't be back and it's such a shame because they seemed to get decent reviews and it wouldhv been a new go-to spot to come for late night eats if I had a better experience.",2016-11-13 19:06:48

That alone results in Chinese at least twice times per week from as many places I can find. On that note, I wish I could return to boost my rating. This place was really worth it, and I recommend you try it for yourself! Remember 3-stars means A-OK! :)

The Great: Honey Peppered Beef! I've never had this dish before, and whoever posted the photo on Yelp deserves mad props! I figured it looked good, and I liked the idea of asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes, and beef. The sauce wasn't overwhelmingly sweet - in fact, it had a bit of savory tang to it. Everything was prepared well, the beef was tender and delicious, and it ate in one sitting. Very delicious - a 4-star dish in my book.  

The Good: Tea. Let's be real, tea can do a lot for a meal. You have bad tea, your meal isn't as enjoyable. The tea was good. 

The Disappointment: Egg Drop Soup. While the egg itself was great and I could tell it was prepared on the spot, the actual liquid was below my lowest standards. I would've rather had the egg in spiced water vs the greasy, tasteless yellow-dyed muck it was served in. I knew I should have ordered Wonton...

Have you not been here yet? 4&20 is the my new favorite bakery/breakfast spot in town. 

Yes I have been here previously, but I have been lazy because this place was already POPULAR and busy 2 years ago. yes. they deserve to be busy.

What do you need most on a Sunday afternoon? Sweet pastries, lemonade and savory biscuit sandwich in a back to the childhood cutesy cafe. Evan is the most friendly chef I've met in a while. He had no qualms sharing the recipe for the house made vinaigrette with the hungry yelpers who hovered while he wrote the details down (yes, I was one of them). Btw, if you need more reason to visit, Evan was Tory Miller's sous chef in L'etoile before he started his own cafe!!

T and Zev kept refilling us with deilcious lemonade and coffee while we gobbled down the treats. And Evan made sure we took home ALL the remaining pastries, because he and his wife were so generous to bake enough for each of us to have 2 of each type.

Decorations were very cozy and kids friendly. Very happy and dream land like. Guys, if you wanna please a lady, bring her here! 

Food was amazing. you have to get the following:

Lemon Ricotta Muffins - ohhhh the sugar crusted top was nice and hard, inside was moist. Sweet but the cherry inside made it well-balanced. SO GOOD.
Nutella Pop tarts - house made nutella. what else do you want? the crust was so good. kinda like an empanada? thicker but good crust. not the flaky kind. 
Strawberry orange scone - nice and moist on the inside. not too sweet.
Strawberry pineapple lemonade - love it, no weird artificial aftertaste.
Biscuit sandwich - Evan, please put this on the menu!! Just use another type of cured meat because copa was kinda hard to chew apart :) Thank you!!
Salad - oh the vinegrette is AMAZING.

Evan has had ample experience catering for university groups and working within the university budget, so if you're looking for a special treat for your event, call up 4&20!! Also another reason to visit is that Evan and his wife have finally gotten permission to open up their patio! So summer hours will be longer in the evening and you can visit and hang out after work ;)

This has been the highlight of my weekend. The lovely food, service and wonderful people has shone light and brightened up this gloomy day.

We really really wanted to like it, but the whole experience just came up flat for us.

The intimacy and decor of Lola is great; it's not big enough where it will get very loud and the whole long tables to allow for community dining is nice. The color palatte was soothing and did not distract from the main focus which is the food. We were with a group of nine that evening, and from our perspective (not sure how our fellow diners felt), I thought service was spotty. Sometimes we would have to ask three times for something and it wasn't very crowded most of the time we were there. It was just like the waitress forgot. Apparently before we arrived, our group had ordered the olives which never materalized at the table; luckily we were not charged for them. Also, I really don't appreciate when waiters and waitresses cop a small attitude when you order a soda and not an alcoholic beverage. I know it's crazy, but even I don't want beer or wine with every meal!

I thought the food was the most disappointing part of the whole evening. The menu is pretty small, which surprises me for a tapas restaurant. Isn't the whole idea variety? Also, some of the dishes were good to share among four people, and others we had to really ration out the portions so that everyone who wanted a bite could have one. We also had to order four plates of the special since it was so popular with our table and to ensure everyone got at least one whole piece. I liked the tortilla espanola, but the one at Sol y Sombra is much better (and larger!). The special was also very good, but seriously how can  you go wrong with toasted baguette, goat cheese and onions? My husband tried the gambas (he likes the shrimp dish at Caffe Boa better), the steak and the pork and he said they were nothing special and were very unmemorable. My last complaint about the food is that there was no chicken dish at all on the menu!!! I'll admit I can be kinda of a picky eater, but even my husband commented on the lack of a chicken option for non-red meat or seafood eaters.

My husband and I decided that we enjoy Sol y Sombra much more and do not see ourselves making a special trip back to Lola in the near future.",2008-12-08 19:13:14

The only things I didn't like:
-The spiciness of the Buff Chick; I had quite the coughing fit after the first bite. I have zero tolerance for spicy food, though, so maybe a buffalo chicken sandwich wasn't the smartest choice.
-Both my little burgers got very wet sitting in their meat juices in their little box as I carried them to work. One of the buns was partly disintegrated by the time I could eat it. Sad.

Service was great, drinks were fast, the food was very flavorful with a nice presentation.  Price was higher than a typical dining experience, but warranted.

My first time going and it was a group from the Ferrari club that organized it.  Sometimes group sizes can be challenging, not so here.  Parking out front was reserved and seating was promptly ready at 6:00PM.  We were seated in the private glass windowed Teppan Room up front and we were quickly greeted and offered cocktails.  The happy hour menu was presented and our waiter, Andrew, kept us filled and reminded us when the discounts were about to end.  

I wavered on my first selection and asked the him for a drink recommendation.  He responded with a few and the sage and cucumber martini caught my eye which was happy hour priced.  I mated it with two sushi starters, the Sapporo Roll and Rainbow roll.  The martini was refreshing with a light herbal overtone and the two house rolls were exceptional.

Our group of four on the North side of the room also received an extra Salmon sushi roll at no charge.  Light orange in color with a very mild flavor, it was a gracious gift.  As we approached dinner the staff added two more gifts to our group, large communal bowls of mai-tai-like drink with a flaming lime slice floating in the middle.  It made for a very fun group social activity (see photos!).

Jan had pointed out the Filet Mignon and scallops at $20 so we decided to have those.  Our prep chef had a nice salad presentation of salad with ginger sesame dressing.  

Our chefs entered our Teppan room and the action started, jokes were flying as well as food!   First off was the fried rice.  Our chef expertly rolled an egg on his metal spatulas' edges, flung it in the air several times and only after 5 mins of acrobatics, just when we started to doubt it was fragile, he allowed it to crack and start the cooking of the fried rice.  As we all clapped he flung another egg directly at Carol next to me, only to find out it had been hollowed out.  The group roared in laughter from her sartled response!  

Our plates lined the Teppan counter and I never saw him dribble each one with a flammable, but the next thing we knew there was a wall of fire on our plates as he cooked the stir fried vegetables.  Main course was next and the scallops and fillet were expertly done.  Complimentary Lychee sorbet finished off the evening.",2011-01-12 12:02:10

This is the some of the best Cantonese food that Toronto has to offer. This place has gained a lot of recognition over the years for the amazing food that is served. I received very nice service from the waiters and they actually speak decent English, which is a huge bonus. There is also a special menu with combinations of their most famous Chinese dishes, but unfortunately, the special is written in Chinese.  Although we did wait a little bit longer than expected for our dishes, I was in complete heaven when I took a bite into the Garoupa with Tofu in Hot Pot, I was speechless. The chicken was moist and juicy and there was a lot of chicken available for everyone to share.

If you are in the industry (show your ID and get a little 50%off card) Tues or anytime after 10pm you get 50% OFF! That puts these at taco stand prices for some high quality grub. The food is good, but getting anything at a deal just puts its over the edge to awesome town. If you aren't industry- that's okay, there's deals for everyone else too. There's happy hour daily 4-6 daily and reverse is sun-thur 10-12am, fri/sat 11-1am and taco tuesday specials after 9pm. 

So we've taken advantage of this deal weekly since we've heard of it and have run a good range of the menu. So far, nothing has been bad though a few have been favorites. 

GUACAMOLE: 
They have a solid traditional guac if you want to keep basic. The mango one has chunks of that and jicama it, but isn't too sweet and has good balance. The tocino has nice smokiness from bacon bits mixed in it. My fave is the tocino. I enjoy the chips they give you here, it's always warm and freshly fried.

TACOS:
Langosta- this was one of our favorites. Buttery creamy poached lobster with just a bit of seasoning, shallot and avocado on top. 
Pancita- pork belly tacos are delicious! I really like the peach salsa on it with the chicarron, but the belly is tender and has a really nice spice on it. 
Camaron- has a nice chipotle rojo on it, but doesnt mask the shrimp. I like how they prepared this as it was also buttery and sweet like the lobster and the seafood still shined over the seasonings. 
Estilo Baja- pretty solid fried fish taco. Its one of the best ones I've had in this town, when I've been sorely disappointed. I'm a Cali girl who lived in San Diego so fried fish taco was a weekly thing for me there. 
Pastor- it's good, but I prefer this the street cart way off the spit than cubed and seasoned pieces. I prefer the pancita over the pastor. 
Carne- the beef is tender and I really enjoy the jicama slaw on top.

Havent had the hongos (mushroom), the espada (swordfish), and the pollo (chicken), but will update when I do. 

CEVICHE: 
There are three kinds. I've had the mixto one which had a lovely passionfruit flavor to it, but I loved the dorado as the mahi mahi texture was just awesome, perfectly tender and fresh with the orange. These came with a thin crisp bread, but honestly I prefer the chips with them! 

SIDES: 
Elote Mexicana- 1 whole corn, cut in half and put onto two skewers. I really like theirs as they cook their corn to where its easy to bite off. 

AGUAS FRESCAS/COCKTAILS: 
Their aguas frescas are yummy! Out of the three, I enjoy the pineapple ginger one best as it's just so refreshing. The cocktails here are solid. We sampled several cocktails and all were well made, balanced and not skimpy on the booze as I felt it. 

LUNCH: 
Lunch menu is slightly different as the entrees and some of the appetizers aren't on the menu. They offer tortas and tacos are 3 a order instead of 4. Ceviche, salsas, drinks are all the same.

We tried a estilo baja torta as we enjoyed these as tacos. I like that they thoroughly grill up their bread so that it was crisp and did not get soggy at all. I love tortas, but so many places do it injustice by allowing it to disintegrate in 60 seconds. It was also fairly large and came with nicely crispy fries seasoned with what reminds me of lucas powder. 

Service has been pretty good here. Our first night the server was fantastic when we came alone and chatted us up even about Vegas as we finished our dessert. As a group the server was decent with a few slip ups as it got busy. Lunch server was super friendly, bubbly and pretty good about checking on us. One of the managers recognized us and came up to greet us with welcome back and asked what we've been enjoying. 

Just a note that if you're a heat wimp, let them know. I've had a few servings that was somewhat mild and another that had some medium heat of the same item. I love spicy, but I can see how this can be bothersome to someone who can't do any spice.

After three solid meals, it deserved the 5 star rave. I think we are going to keep on coming until we get burnout or until the deal stops being this amazing. The food though is totally up my alley. It's got flavor and freshness that reminds me of some of my favorite places in SoCal and in Baja.",2014-10-29 06:30:33

1st COURSE: (Ahi Tuna Tartare) $24 on the Regular Menu. There was a $15 substitution fee but I had no regrets paying it. The Ahi is supposedly flown in fresh everyday from Hawaii.. Can't fact-check that but its an interesting tidbit to gloat about when I'm telling my friends how amazing it was. It was presented beautifully and my server, Alejandro, mixed it at the table. Sesame oil, pine nuts, and mint were the main flavors in this dish--seasoned lightly with salt, pepper, and garlic. It needed a little extra salt... I'm also not used to my tuna tar tar being served with white toast. I found it a little whacky considering it added no flavor and threw me off texturally. 

2nd COURSE: (Phyllo-Crusted Sole) $48 on the Regular Menu. Initially, Alejandro said there was an issue receiving the sole that day and they were substituting salmon. I was quite disappointed but salmon sounded better than steak or chicken at the time. He pleaded my case to the kitchen and magically a sole filet appeared on my plate. Essentially, its pan-fried in butter but its not overbearing in any way. It stays crisp and the warmth melts the horseradish marscapone into a sauce.  Its served on a bed of creamy crab brandade. And the dish is drizzled with a dijon sauce that's pleasantly citrusy.

DESSERT: $10 on the Regular Menu. I was diggin' the Sassafras ice cream Root Beer Float. It had a natural and clean flavor while satisfying my sweet tooth. I didn't have any room for the cookies. But they didn't disappoint--crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside... I took them to-go and they tasted just as good cold. As a bonus, Alejandro brought over a hot apple cider and a sugar cookie. Not necessary but I ate it!

$20.12 Wine Pairing: Worth it. I can't see myself ordering any of them a la carte. But its nice not to have to worry about whats good. And only 20 bucks? ALRIGHT! My server was kind enough to refill my glass a couple of times as well. The riesling and chardonnay complimented the seafood nicely. And the port was a treat at dessert!
    1st: 2006 Mönchhof Robert Eymael Ürziger Würzgarten Riesling Spätlese
    2nd: 2010 Domaine William Fèvre Chardonnay Petit Chablis
    Dessert: 2006 Dow's Port

Service was impeccable! Alejandro was such a polite young man. And every time I took a bathroom break, the serving assistants were ridiculously attentive on the napkin-work and water-filling.

They corrected the problem and both were delicious. The Honey Buffalo Sandwich had a bit of a kick. The Chicken Fried Sandwich was my favorite! I would have loved more gravy on it, it was so good.

If, however, I put more weight on ambience it would get only three.  This is the kind of place to go to fill your stomach quickly with great food, but it is not conducive to a social dinner.

First, the food and prices:   Very good bargain (cheaper by a dollart or more than most Thai places for the same dishes).   Despite the fact that the menu uses little Thai terminology, the dishes seemed to be authentic, as well as being very taster.  My tom yum had little sugar and one could tast the fish base in the broth, both of which seemed very positive to me.   A dish of penang curry included peanuts like it should and was excellent.  Service was quiet but sufficiently excellent.  I also liked the witty sayings on the wall and cute lighting.

The drawback of this place is the noise level  and uncomforatble seating (backless benches).  The large number of patrons and lack of acoustic paneling or tiles made it impossible for me to join in conversation with the others I was having dinner with.

A few places opt for a mix of Indian and Chinese teas, some just uses Indian tea, as there is a proliferation of ""fake"" Chinese teas in the market. Typically, evaporated milk and condense milk is used to give is the rich smooth frothy  texture. Some places will introduce air into the drink by ""pulling"" the tea, pouring the mixture back and forth repeatedly between two vessels from a height. Others may use something that resembles a silk stocking to remove impurities from the drink. 

Marathon just sticks to the basics - tea, sugar, evaporated milk. 

I always appreciate the poems on the wall of the store. It provides insights on living a tranquil way of life. I try to sit at the cafe from time to time as a reminder to live modestly and to appreciate small things in life. 

I would suggest avoid visiting Marathon after 6:00 PM. The tea tends to be slightly more bitter and acidic. If you must, request for the drink to be sweetened to mask the flavour.  Also, if you bring you own cup/mug, you get a free upgrade from medium to large!",2015-12-06 16:21:25

To start we had the polenta with goat cheese and the poached pear salad.  The polenta was great- the cake itself was somewhat bland and the portion was a little too large for an app- but still delicious.  The poached pear salad was great- wish it came with more gorganzola though.  
For entrees we had the veggie gnocchi and pappardelle- yum!  Highlights of the evening- gnocchi (veggie- not the lobster) were pillowy and very satisfying for a vegetarian entree.  The papparedelle was rustic and hearty- very simple dish.
The dessert is why I gave Lago a 4- we ordered the apple tart with zabaione off the vegetarian menu.  It was obviously reheated because the apples were cooked to complete mush.  They tried to resurrect it by placing fresh vanilla zabaione (with fresh vanilla- yum!) as a sauce.  Unfortunately this was the last thing we tasted and it didn't leave us with a great memory.  Hopefully the memory will be repaired with the leftovers of the gnocchi and papparedelle for tomorrows lunch :)",2010-01-19 03:48:33

If you like olives, you'll love the brushetta.  We then shared the Proschiutto di Parma pizza.  I love proschiutto but their's had to have been cured with a pound of salt because I've never had prosciutto as salty as this and I realize that proschiutto is a salty meat.  There was also a lot more arugula on the pizza than I expected.  I thought just a sprinkling, maybe; but ended up with enough for each of us to have a side spring salad.  I couldn't taste the sauce or cheese on the pizza.  I could just taste salt and arugula.  Total bummer.

Reborn is a garage with a sleek taproom that eliminated the wall between the brewing equipment and the tap room, and creates a relaxing, inviting page that is a nice mix of rustic, artsy, and reclaimed/vintage chic that all the cool kids want to see and be seen in these days.

Now open Wednesday through Saturday, look for a different food truck each day that makes Free Range both a spot for a clod draft and a spot to catch a quick, though tasty, meal as well.  

There is floor space for Yoga or small events and an outdoor seating area as well, a long bar runs almost the length of the tap room with a crisp, white tile backing.  Old bus seats and plastic chairs that are a throw-back to your school days add to the chill, rustic vibe that runs thru this place. 

But let's talk about the beer, which is they primary reason you go to a brewery in the first place, right?!  Solid efforts here that will run across a range of palettes.  Ales, Porters and an IPA or 2 are usual candidates, along with some seasonal one-offs that may be worth a shot.  I tend toward the IPA side of things and the efforts here are stellar- well hopped, dry but with a depth of flavor.  If you are luck enough to visit with the Double IPA is on tap, grab it and send me a thank-you later.  It is, in one word: Awesome.

And then there are their collaborations with coffee here- Free Range has parted with local roaster Pure Intentions to create some unique offerings.  Not to mention cold brew nitro on tap all the time as well.  This is a unique feature in a brewery and offers a nice alternative to those looking for something other than a beer.

In all, Free Range is a solid addition to the craft beer scene and their tap room is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Do drop in and share their love and passion for craft beer- it shows in both the space and the brew in your glass.",2015-11-20 19:41:07

We went on a busy Friday night, so in that case I try to go into restaurants prepared to make many allowances as I know that crowds of people and long waits do not make for an ideal situation. 

Unfortunately, even considering my reduced expectations, I can't really recommend Arriba to anyone. 

The room we were seated in had a lovely rock wall with water flowing over it, however the tables and chairs were cheap, and brightly colored which contrasted with the ""zen"" feeling of the water wall. 

Our server was excellent - I can't remember his name. He handled the busyness of the dining room and the various requests we had to shower on him (more silverware, clean silverware, menus, etc) cheerfully and quickly. He was well spoken and just really great.

The table was filthy - the appetizer menu and condiment holders at the end of the table had old refried beans (I assume) crusted on them, the silverware on the table was dirty - even the food presentation was sloppy and gross. 

Regarding the food - it is difficult to screw up the components of Mexican food - cheese, meat, beans, tortillas/chips.  The salsa seemed like jarred store salsa, so not a great start. We ordered the Nachos Grande to share and they were okay - the chips seemed like storebought tortilla chips and the toppings were scattered haphazardly across the pile. 

I ordered the Hatch Chile Relleno, which I was excited about because it was noted as very spicy with three chiles beside it on the menu. It tasted okay but really did not have much flavor and was absolutely not spicy at all. The temperature of the dish was lukewarm.

We also shared the chocolate chimichanga dessert, which was pretty good (however it's tough to go wrong with chocolate!) The portion size was good for four of us to split.

For foods we got Beef Cappaccio, Crispy Eggplant fries, black pepper shrimp, Crispy cheese ravioli, and Roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip. All oh so delicous! My favorite would have to be the Crispy eggplant fries which is pretty crazy because I do NOT like eggplant at all. Also I think the Crispy Cheese Ravioli was to die for. It wasn't too cheesy, it was the perfect amount of cheesiness! 

For drinks we got White Peach Sangria, Sangria Rosa, & Mango Mojito. I really liked the Sangria Rosa. Now it's really not real sangria because real sangria is fruits marinated in wine but they just put some fruit in a cup & add wine with vodka. Still good tho.

Best bartender there, hands down is Geoffrey. He accomodated each of our needs. When the door was open and the wind was blowing our hair all over our faces, he shut the doors. We were right under the AC vents which was blowing cold a** air right on top of us making us shiver uncontrollably, he made the waiters turn the vents off.

I've been so addicted to this place that it's almost embarrassing. I've brought my friends and family here and now they're addicted too. I've had gelato at other places and always felt that it was just good ice cream. After coming here I learned what gelato really is. Yes, there is a difference between gelato and ice cream!

Gelato Simply Italian is a modern and sleek place and fills up fast during the evenings. The staff is super friendly, efficient and helpful when it comes to helping you pick out gelato. They have a ton of unique flavors and they do have a nice selection of sorbet. The gelato here is very flavorful, light and not too sweet. My favorites have to be prickly pear, carmelo, tiramisu, chili chocolate, Italian wine, macedonia, frozen yogurt and so much more. You can get a cone or cup. Sizes are small (two scoops- $3.50), medium (three scoops $5) and large (four scoops- $6). The portions are good, nothing too generous though.

Besides gelato, they have a coffee bar. I like their coffee here, very strong and gets me through the day. They also have crepes (sweet & savory), Italian desserts, a fridge with cannoli's and other sweet goodies. I love their coffee granita (semi-frozen strong coffee). Ask for the granita 'Roman style' you won't be disappointed!

The only thing I don't like is that some of the stuff here is pricey and the portions of the gelato can be inconsistent at times depending on who is serving that day.

I will admit that I studied up beforehand, since some very resourceful Yelpers mentioned the complexity of the ordering system. It was worth walking through their ""How to Order"" demo on their website to know what to do.

The staff was extremely helpful when I approached the counter and volunteered that I was a Chino-Bandido virgin. They even provided tasting samples and suggestions that helped me understand what the different flavor profiles were. I settled on the combo (2 meat entrees, choice of beans, choice of rice) and chose Pollo Diablo (meat alone), Jen Red Pork (in a quesadilla), jerk fried rice and black beans. All were delicious and the servings generous. I dared not finish my quesadilla for fear the Oompah Loompahs would have to roll my fat ass out the door afterward.

I think there's a bit of a learning curve to eating here, but I enjoyed the unique dining experience. One of the staff even spotted my Chico State shirt and we instantly started chatting, since he was also from my neck of the woods (northern northern California, I like to call it). I learned that next time I'm going with the meat entrees as meat alone (as opposed to in a burrito or quesadilla), since there is more than enough of the sides to fill you up and the extra packaging only serves to mask the unique flavors of their savory meat choices.

I'll make a trip back, but I'm gonna save up some room first. The last meal resulted in a serious mid-afternoon lunch coma nap.",2009-10-22 06:04:27

Looked it up on Yelp about a week after opening and found it to be highly suspect that it had NINE 5-star reviews right out of the gate, and most of the reviewers had only written 1 or 2 reviews. Hmmm... Very suspicious. So we had to go see this overwhelming 5-star experience for ourselves.
The setup is very much like a Chipotle. Design your own pizza for 8 bucks. Cool concept. I went with the original crust, marinara sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, pepperoni, and meatball (which look like mini ground beef balls). It wasn't busy and our pizza was brought out to the table relatively quickly. I was surprised that the pizza crust was like a cracker. I thought it would be softer. My jaw actually got tired from chewing. My pizza tasted better with some oregano sprinkled on. I also tried my friend's BBQ chicken bacon pizza. The BBQ sauce tasted very sweet. Easy to eat all 8 slices since it's so thin, but I did not eat the crust... too crunchy.

The types of nigiri included were salmon, maguro (tuna), ebi (or shrimp), medium toro, mackerel, white fish, sardine, hamachi and uni.  Every single piece of fish presented that night was amazing.  They were all extremely fresh, rather large compared to the rice and very pure tasting.  Personally I thought the quality of the fish that the chefs chose to make up the Sushi for Two order was pretty good.  Where other restaurants in the past would load up an order like this with butterfish, salmon and tuna, the variety provided I thought was fair to the price one paid for this particular order.  My biggest enjoyment of the night however was not from the nigiri.  It was actually from the scallops sashimi.  The scallops sashimi was simply put amazing!!!!  The scallops sashimi were just as fresh as the fish.  It was smooth, it was slippery and it literally melted in your mouth.  For $9.99, one got to consume 6 large pieces of fresh scallops sashimi and believe me when I say it was definitely well worth the price.  Had I known it tasted that good, I might have placed a second order for it.  The argument could be made that there really isn't anything to scallops sashimi since all one needed to do was crack them open and serve them however one bite into these scallops and you could tell that there was something different about these particular scallops.  It's possible that their chefs might be taking their time and thus are choosing the best scallops for their inventory and not those that are at the bottom of the barrel which of course would make a big difference.  Compared to other restaurants, these scallops were bouncier or more jelly-liked, much larger compared other scallops that I have eaten at other places and ""sweet"" tasting as Chinese people would like to say. 

The two types of rolls that were served included the California Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll.  Both rolls were made to perfection.  The rice was perfect as it was not the really bad mushy type that some other places tend to serve.  The rolls were packed with all their necessary ingredients and presented in a nice manner. Although it was not really a major complaint on my end, the spicy salmon was actually not that spicy at all.  I have tasted some really spicy salmon before but these spicy salmon rolls actually didn't have that much kick to it.  Nonetheless, the rolls were still very good. 

I really enjoyed the sushi and the sashimi from this place.  I had heard great things from them and the fact that they are opened for only five days a week and are closed on Sundays and Mondays and still have the entire restaurant packed is a strong testament as to how well they are doing.  I would highly recommend one make reservations if you could before going as it's not that big of a place.  I don't think you will be disappointed as we certainly were not.  For any sushi lovers, this is one place you must give a try.",2017-02-20 23:06:01

We called in our order and was ready by the time we got there. They have 2 parking spots for to-go orders in which you call and they bring your order out. 

We ordered their caprese salad (different name the menu but same concept) and while it was fantastic the price for what we received was sad. There were 12 quartered pieces of red  tomato and slivers of basil with a nice hunk of a more creamy mozzarella. They give you plenty of mozzarella but a few extra tomato slices and a lot more basil would make this salad worth the $12. As it stands its a one person appetizer. 

We ordered the Do Fara Special pizza. It comes in thick crust only which was good (burnt on the edges so that was a let down), however the pizza sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce. That was something I hadn't expected and didn't care for. If I wanted spaghetti I would have ordered it. The pepperoni was small and over cooked. The basil was itty bitty and couldn't even be tasted. 

I'll give this place on more chance when we're feeling like pizza again, but after this first experience I'd have to say that even Papa John's has better pizza then what we had tonight.",2013-07-14 03:06:27

Well, they basically do one thing and they do it well--cheesesteak. I got one with provolone and raw onions and it was really great--real steak, a little light on the cheese but not too bad, and just the right about of chopped onions. The bread was soft and tasty also, obviously freshly baked. Yes, I know provolone and raw onions is heresy to someone from Philly, but since I'm from Indiana I don't care. Cheese wiz? You can have it. Anyway, with real cheese these things are good. As a bonus, they offer three types of peppers in the condiment bar, which put the place over the top for me. I'll leave it to others to judge the ""genuine"" Philly style sandwich. 

Service was also good and friendly, and the place is as clean as anyplace I've been. The only complaint I have is it is a little expensive. I spent a little over $11 for a large sandwich and a coke with no sides. Also, if you don't like cheesesteak you're kind of out of luck. But what they do they do very well. I'll certainly be back. The only reason I would have given it three and a half rather than four stars is because of the price. 

And those four and five star reviews I've been writing? I promised myself I would only write about restaurants I have eaten at since I started writing these reviews.

It's clean, staff is nice, customers aren't sketchy, and it's conveniently located by many other stores. Some things to check out while here:

(1) DVDs!!! Holy, they have some good deals. It seems like they change the discounts on dvds every 1 or 2 weeks. I'll see movies (even fairly new ones) full price one week, then extremely marked down the next. Target has created a dvd obsession in me!

(2) UP and UP products! Just as good as brand name items! I especially love up and up for their diapers, wipes, and formula. I save SO MUCH money by buying generic. The diapers work great and my son has no complaints about his up and up soy formula!

(3) Baby clothes! Just a couple days ago, I bought 4 (12 months size) shirts for my son and spent $10! 2 of the shirts were under $2 and all were very cute. Even when there isn't a sale, you can find shirts, shorts, and pants for $4 each! 

I've noticed that if you look around you'll often see items that are full price one week, on sale the next, and back to regular price not too long after. I bought my son a fisher price toy for $20 and right now it is currently back to its regular price of $35. SO have fun finding great items and saving tons of money!",2011-08-02 23:07:29

I try to swing by about once a month for steaks, as it's probably the best meat I can get my hands on.  The quality far surpasses your typical grocery store butcher and the service is spot on.

I do often wait for a few minutes, but that's largely because the butchers will spend time to talk to the customers and help give them exactly what they want.  For example, tonight I asked the butcher what steaks he'd choose to take home with him - and then give me the same thing.  He chose two perfect steaks for me.  I have never been disappointed by the flavor or quality of the meat.  The Choice graded meats are delicious.  The Prime meats are amazing.  I've had the burgers and sausages a few time, and they really are ""gourmet burgers.""  I'd eat the mushroom burgers every day if I could.

I also really like their sides and sausages.  I occasionally buy the stuffed mushrooms, twice baked potatoes, or other veggies.  

Yes, the prices are higher than you'll pay in the grocery store, but you need to compare it to a restaurant, not the grocer.  Can I have two 16-oz rib eyes with sides at a decent restaurant for under $50?  No.  It will be twice that, if not more.",2018-02-03 02:11:03

If you get a drink, or a side, you're going to pay upwards of $15 per person - which is hardly affordable for non organic chicken fingers and fries.

Combos are your best value option because they come with fries and coleslaw instead of paying $3.50+ ala cart for sides. I made sure to double check that the fries weren't those disgusting crinkle cut fries ala Raising Canes before I ordered. I chose the 2 tenders & fries combo, and subbed pickled cucumbers for the coleslaw. It took maybe 10 minutes to come out, but the food tasted fresh.

The chicken has a dry rub coating - definitely needed sauce. Luckily every table has its own sauce caddy with bbq sauce, 3 types of honey and 2 hot sauces, in addition to the white sauce that the combo comes with.

I mixed the white sauce, ancho chipotle honey and wildflower honey and put it on everything. This sauce combo definitely made the chicken over the top and was incredible on the fries too.

3 stars is in no way bad. If it was more of a value, I'd bump up the stars. Maybe things are turning around for this place as my food was cooked well and tasted nice.",2016-08-13 18:53:10

One thing I would have changed was that they served my small vanilla custard in a larger drink cup, so it made the portion seem a lot smaller than it was.  If it were in a small cup I probably wouldn't have finished it.  It's a mental thing... haha

I like to order the pizzas to go, and the consistency on the time they're ready is all over the map.

They say 30 minutes, I show up at 20, I am chastised for showing up ""early"", then I sit for another 30 waiting for the goddam pizza. This is late nite too and totally ridiculous.

We walked over there the other day for coffee and the crowd was a nightmare. At this point, I'm just sick of it. It is actually a negative that I live around the corner and can go whenever. It would be better if it were further away and therefore an ""event"" for us to check it out.

Side Dishes : Kimchi, Raw Onions, Black Bean Sauce & Pickled Raddish

Kam Pung Ki ($16.99 Small)
~ Sweet & Spicy Chicken
~ Love this, perfect sticky sauce and mostly brown chicken meat (white meat tends to me too dry) 
~ This is pretty mild, so wished it was slightly spicier. 
~ Need to come back for dinner and get this with soju or makkoli. 
~ This also comes in Large for $26.99 which is huge when I saw another table ordering it.

Ja Jang Myum $6.99
~ Veggie, beef and black bean sauce noodle
~ Rather mild which I love (no msg or overly salty) with just the right chewy noodle but though the sauce was a tad runny since it didn't cling to the noodle very well which less us with a lot of it at the end after finishing the noodles. 

Sam Sun Cham Pong $10.99
~ Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup w/ extra seafood
~ The regular one is only $8.99, I really don't find there's much seafood but mostly veggies so I would say we could have save that extra $2. 
~ This is probably their signature dish since everyone was ordering this and it was on a poster. 
~ Love the flavorful seafood soup which was not the slightest bit salty, the healthy non-msg version of a Spicy Instant Noodle
~ Same king of noodle as the black bean which I like, would be great if there's more al-dente options as well (something more ramen or instant noodle like).

Verdict:
~ Loved it, although the selections are limited.
~ Would definitely come back especially to try the Sweet & Sour Pork which I saw a lot of people ordering and look super yummy.",2015-02-24 18:13:10

We got here around 10pm and it wasn't too busy - just a couple tables but the atmosphere was really homey! There was plenty of parking spots when I got there, but I can see it getting really busy during lunch rush given that it's located in the Mississauga Chinatown area. 

For food, I ordered the pork kim chi stew. At Owls there is an option to add glass noodles in the stew, but at Sikgaek when I asked for the noodles the server actually told me straight up that it's weird LMAO!! But she still got the noodles in my stew for me so no hard feelings! I must say for $11 plus $5 for the noodles, I was disappointed. Portion was small and there was way too much glass noodles that it was absorbing all the stew!! I never had this problem at owls so I never thought to ask for a little bit of glass noodles only ... plus it's only $2 extra to add noodles at owls with a bigger stone pot.. there also was barely any pork. I only had 3-4 strips of meat tops in my bowl. Broth wise was ok, but honestly I prefer owls kim chi stew 10000x over Sikgaeks. I don't think I'll be ordering soups here in the future LOL 

The star of the night was definitely the fried chicken!! Holy it was so good I don't even know where to start. We ordered the original fried chicken wth green onions and the spicy marinated one. The original with onions was my favourite, it was perfectly fried - crispy but not oily at all. Also tons of meat! The spicy marinated one is MEH.. it's more sweet than spicy, the kim chi was way spicier but its still good if you're into the sweeter flavours. 

Service was really good too. Surprisingly the young servers knew English really well and was engaging and constantly checked up on us. I know that this is expected but there are a lot of places where servers will only take your orders, leave you alone for the rest of the night and is extremely hard to flag down.

Copper Premium Pub is open! The space is completely renovated from the last tenant and is bar/pub/dining area combo  Check in involved giving a cell phone number to be texted when your table was ready. You had to download an app to check your place in line, which I didn't do.  The hostess informed us we could wait in the beer garden outside, which included an area with picnic tables alongside an outdoor eating area. My biggest issue was the ability to smoke in this area... not so enticing for this non smoking couple. Otherwise, unless raining, the area was nice to wait in. 

We had Meagan as our waitress and she did a great job! Helpful without being over friendly and willing to answer many questions. Hubby started with a Windy Hill apple ale and enjoyed the local option and would definitely get it again, I ordered sweet tea, that wasn't as sweet as some southern places, but not to be confused with unsweet.  We ordered the pretzel with Copper beer cheese dip. The pretzel was okay, the cheese was over abundant for one pretzel and I didn't love it. My hubby said it was ok but wouldn't order it again, though he saved the cheese to dip his fries in. 

I ordered the Steakhouse burger minus the C 1 steak sauce, cooked medium with homemade chips. Hubby ordered the meatball sub with herb seasoned fries. My burger was juicy, perfectly cooked and the chips were good, but not likely the best homemade I've ever had. Hubby said his meatball sub was good, but the meat could use more seasoning and the sandwich more cheese for his preferences, and he'd probably try something new next time.  Both of our breads seemed really fresh and were quite good. 

We tried to order the homemade key lime pie and were told it was sold out and ordered cheesecake instead, also made in house. What we received tasted like key lime pie even though it had strawberries on top. We ask Meagan to double check and she was told it was indeed cheesecake,  but I truly think the kitchen staff was confused. It was good...but not cheesecake.

The noise level suprised us a bit, but given the bar area and several louder than normal patrons, we hope that it won't always be the case.   We were there about 2 hours from wait time to paying the check, they were busy, but I think it's just the ""just opened"" typical delays...nothing to fret over. 

Overall, Copper Premium Pub is on its way to being a great spot in Lake Wylie. I'll save my 5th star hopefully for the next visit!",2016-09-07 00:44:44

My expectations weren't that high, but that is okay. My boyfriend loves a good divey bar that is not so trendy and yuppie, as he puts it. This to me was just nice and surprising. The bar staff was super friendly. The beer on tap was nice and cold. Peach Ale from 4Peaks is always a win-win for me! 4Peaks Kiltlifter on tap for him. Off track betting on the tele. Pool tables around the place. For 345pm in the afternoon, it was already packed! We didn't want to mess our appetites up, so we only opted for the fried pickles and went half regular and half cajun spicy. YUMMY!

It's really big compared to most of the clubs in Old Town. There is no technical, cordoned-off dance floor, but people just get up and groove next to the tables on the floor. There's plenty of seating, on that note - big cozy booths that comfortably fit 6 people, or tables for 4 on the floor, plus the really long bar.  It looks like a warehouse with red and black ""fire engine"" decor - really cool vibe.

The DJ was playing a nice mix of top 40s music and he actually knew how to fade songs in and out of each other and not mess up the beat. He also wasn't doing little 30 second snippets of songs (a super annoying pet peeve to me), you got a solid 2 minutes of your favorite jam. Kudos for getting a decent DJ!

Plus where else would I be able to try Jackfruit? So far I havn't seen it on any other menus around town. 
There tacos are usually 2 for $7 so on my last visit I ordered the bbq jackfruit and the beet battered avocado tacos. Both were very tasty. I loved that the avocado taco came with a very beautiful and generous slice of a nice ripe and creamy quality avocado. And I'm not sure if they make there own tortillas or not but they are soft and delicious!

On my recent vacation in Vegas, one of those spots was the intimate and welcoming Chicago Brewing Company at the Four Queens. I visited them three times on my vacation, each time being served by Bob (the gentleman in Leila R's picture) I also ran into Bob once at the nearby Banger Brewing and had a great chat with him - it's always great when brewpubs employ people who have a true passion and knowledge for beer. Bob overheard me mention that I was running out of clothes due to my flight being delayed because of the nasty east coast weather, and when I went back for my final visit to Chicago Brewing the next day, Bob gave me an older 2XL t-shirt that they don't print anymore. (Thanks Bob!) Needless to say, the service here was outstanding.

Chicago Brewing's beer sampler is an outstanding deal - 9 different samples for $8.99. I enjoyed it so much, I got one each time that I went. They keep six year-around brews, plus root beer (which is included on the sampler) and typically have two seasonals. Unfortunately they only had one seasonal - an outstanding blueberry wheat brew - so the final beer was a different brew mix each time. It started with a traditional black and tan, the next was a mix of the Hefeweizen and IPA, and my last mix was 1/2 brown ale, 1/2 stout. All of their beers are great, but the blueberry wheat was my favorite. I also really liked their Hardway IPA - it had a nice hoppy flavor but not overpowering with hops. At 6.2%, it's like a ""Session IPA+"" The Black Widow Stout, an Irish Dry Stout, and the Weizenheimer Bavarian-style Hefeweizen also stood out for me. And their root beer is a great palette cleanser for the finish. 

My first visit was for the beer, but I was eyeing the food menu ... and the wonderful looking Chicago Deep Dish Pizza they were serving. So I made a second trip back specifically to get one of these bad boys. It's a personal 9"" deep dish with sausage and pepperoni. The dough was great, cooked perfectly through, and it wasn't overly saucy as some deep dish pizzas are. I'd definitely get this again. 

On my last visit, I had no intention of eating ... until I heard it was half-price appetizers for happy hour daily. One thing caught my eye - filet mignon sliders. Topped with mushrooms and onions, and served with a side of au jus, these are like little French Dip sliders of pure awesomeness. 

My expectations for Chicago Brewing Company were low to be honest. I guess it's the location inside the older (but charming) Four Queens and its old-school, dimly-lit bar vibe. But those expectations were blown away. This is one of my favorite places in Downtown Vegas, and I'll be coming back on my next trip to Las Vegas.",2014-02-28 17:50:04

It is amazing.  I had the Pick 2 deal for $8.79 which I chose the Honey Bacon Club Panini and 1/2 of the Citrus Spinach Salad.  It was great!   The salad was especially amazing!   It had a Blood Orange Vinaigrette, which was one of the best salad dressings I've ever had.  It included Mandarin Oranges, Baby Spinach, Dried Cranberries, and Goat Cheese.  The sandwich had Turkey, Ham, Bacon and Muenster Cheese with Honey Mustard.  Both were very good.  The service was VERY FAST and they had plenty of help.  The place was very clean.  The ingredients were very fresh as well.  The downside of it is that the place isn't well lit at night.  I've driven by it many times thinking they were closed.  However, they stay open until 9pm, except on Friday & Saturday when they're open until 10pm.  They need some outside lights.  One thing VERY DISCOURAGING is that they are closed on Sundays.  Lucky for their employees I guess, but I don't get how chain businesses do this?!    Other than that, it was great and will be a very frequent dinner spot.

Downgraded this tonight from four stars to three stars.  The food is incredible, but we tried to call in an order for six people tonight at work.  Their policy is no call-in orders, unless you place an advance order before 10am on the day you want the order.  I can understand if you have 15-20 people or more, but what kind of casual restaurant can't prepare a call-in order for six people in 30-45 minutes?!   That is beyond ridiculous.  Your kind of business should thrive on phone in orders.  If you don't have the personnel to handle it, then hire more people for that process.

The milk bread is amazing. The scallops have been wonderful every time we've gone.

The chocolate cake is solid, but next time I want to try their cinnamon milk bread dessert.

The brought out some 'fresh' pickles as a starter for the meal.  The pickles tasted like cucumbers.  They had not even started the pickling process yet.  I only ate them because I was starving at that point, but normally I would have passed completely.

The service at this restaurant was downright embarrassing.  Our waitress was in pajamas...I am not joking.  She came to our table two times, one to take our order and the other when she finally dropped off the check (after hunting down another employee to get it).  When we showed her we had a Groupon, she acted as if we were asking her super tasking, almost a personal favor.  We received more service from the other staff than our own waitress.

The employees are all very nice and since I frequent Aloha so many times, they have learned who I am... I really like how they also shuffle out new flavors all the time... I believe they do this either once a week or they give a flavor about two weeks... Some of my favorites are: Girl Scout thin mints, Mint, Strawberry, Ghirardhelli Chocolate... (just to name a few) 

The atmosphere at Aloha is very laid back and my younger friend and I love seeing the dogs on the patio. There are complimentary water bowls outside for dogs, and other animals that may stroll around. 

Pricing at Aloha is very fair and if you check in on Yelp, you get a Buy one, get one free offer which might be something that I shouldn't be blabbing about, but I like saving money. They even have a reward points system which is pretty cool. 

I hope to try their coffee soon, I've seen it but I usually only stop by for Froyo",2015-02-17 19:51:27

The portions are huge! Maybe it's just me, but every time I go I feel like I can maybe eat half of my meal-so you're definitely getting your money's worth. Some of my favorite things to order there are the bagel skins, tuna melt (rye and swiss-best evereverever), and the french toast. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.

We happened to be out for a friend's birthday and decided to wander over since we were in the same lot. At first I was a bit unsure since they wanted me to sign up for their text list in order to receive a ""free"" drink. I don't really like signing up for text messaging group things because it seems impossible to stop receiving the messages. I mean, I understand it and perhaps other people enjoy it for quick updates but for me, I know better to just not sign up next time.

It was very hip and trendy and enjoyable for the experience at least. Would I call it a speakeasy? No, because I have been to places requiring code words hidden behind walls through kitchens and whatnot... I'm not sure they even refer to themselves as such. The darkness basement like feel to the interior I suppose gives it that feel I wouldn't have known that was the deal had I not previously heard.

The bartenders were very attentive and very kind. The drinks are those you would find at a speakeasy, for sure. The one upset I had was that I was standing at one side of the bar waiting for service and I had already received beverages from one of the bar tenders. I typically like to stick with the same bar tender throughout the course of the evening. Little did I know that I was on the wrong side of the bar and the gentleman was visibly upset toward me for asking to have the same bar tender who had already helped me. Nevertheless, the vibe was good apart from that moment as were the drinks.

At one point the ladies room line was so long that a staff member allowed myself and another customer to use another washroom since it was taking so long to use the one available and we had been waiting quite some time to get in there.

I didn't try the food and can't speak to that. 

All in all it was a good night, although next time I think a single drink will suffice as an after dinner treat since they are heavy drinks, so beware.",2017-03-29 17:12:58

My husband thought it was cooked perfectly. I couldn't bring myself to eat something with tentacles.  The duck had a cherry sauce.

Raising Cane's is probably a better alternative on every level.

It's better than McDonald's which is why this didn't get one star. As another reviewer noted, the skinny French fries were pretty good. They should change their name to ""Blue Ribbon French Fries.""",2015-08-10 04:10:28

I had to get it to go since I was rushing to get home but I ate the egg rolls when I got home and they were still hot and crispy. I reheated my pho for dinner and it was really yummy.

The food is overpriced for what you get - I assume because it is in such a prime Old Town location. 

We sat in the back near the entrance to the kitchen. The ambience was..eclectic..to put it nicely. I feel like the paintings and oddly silver finished walls just didn't fit together. It didn't help that the place was dark, dingy, and a bit dirty (especially in the hallway near the kitchen and in the bathrooms). Some touristy food locations upsell you for the ambience .. we quickly learned this wasn't one of those places.

The food wasn't terrible. I went with baked cheese-stuffed ravioli. The sauce was great and the portions were good. I have to note that my starter salad was put together pretty oddly. They basically just dumped a huge dollop of blue cheese on top of a few pieces of lettuce and called it a day. A little bit of a rip of and just lazy service in my opinion.

Server was a bit pushy, but I wouldn't say rude. Overall, timely service and he didn't mess up anything. He actually ran out of the restaurant and chased us down the street because I forgot to sign the receipt - oops!

Our bill came out to close to $70..for 2 glasses of house wine, garlic bread, and 2 of some of the cheapest pasta dishes on the menu!

The food was pretty good- there wasn't a lot of depth of flavours in the food which normally I'm all for but it was even a little more bland and so-so than I usually opt for. They didn't have a ton of options, they had all your typical American-Italian options, we wanted to order a couple appetizers but they really had no options for decent apps. I had the Caesar salad and Fettuccine Alfredo, the fettuccine was a little bit drowning in the sauce and lacking in flavour. My bf had the lamb chops and found them very flavourful. 

The drinks as well, very average. The wine selection wasn't super great nor was the wine itself and I ordered a martini that also wasn't fabulous but wasn't awful. The prices are decent, a little overpriced for the taste of food but just where I would expect a restaurant of their category to be.

The portions were a really nice size and the service was good, we had two servers, the first wasn't very attentive and kind of just chatting with the hostess majority of the time but the second who brought us our food was fabulous, she was cheerful and sweet and attentive. There was no wait and plenty of parking which was nice and we didn't feel as if we were packed in. But I keep remembering that the food was just average and the menu was just overage.

I have heard about it for quite sometime from other parents I know and was finally able to make it over there.  My daughter loved it!  I wish I would have gone sooner for her.

TNT also has a lot of fun things to do and play with.  They have an enclosed trampoline to jump to your heart's content.  There is a great ball pit.  It is deep, so you can do a big jump in and sink in.  There is a small jumpy house that has a slide attached to it as well.  There are several play houses including a castle, tree house, and play kitchen.  There is also a climbing wall for the more advance climbers to play on. 

Another great thing that TNT has is a netted climbing place for your little monkey.  It has stairs, tubes, tunnels, and slides for your little climber.  It is set up so crawlers, as well as full on walkers can climb and explore the place.  My daughter, who I swear is part monkey, was all over this place and I could hear her squeals of laughter running around on this thing.  It was a big hit!

I am sure I am probably forgetting some of the fun toys as well because there is just so much to do and play with here.  So no matter what your kid is into, they will have something to play with and have so much fun doing so!

TNT also has stuff for the adults.  There are a lot of seating areas for parents to sit and relax and still watch the little ones play.  They have free wifi as well for you to goof off online.  A small snack bar with coffee options.  I even noticed a charging station, if your phone needs a quick pick me up.

The classes are the best feature. Zumba and Hip Hop are fun and engaging, all levels are able to attend. Muscle class is great and I love to learn new ways to target certain zones. Tabata and HIIT are killer!! Talk about sweat! Every time I leave i have to wipe up a pool from my area...it's gross, but it's effective. The only bad thing about these classes is my fear of using the bathroom (squatting is no fun!!!). 
The price is a bit more compared to other gyms, but it is a great bargain for the cleanliness and helpful staff. You do have a maintenance fee (I think it is about $35) to pay a year. I will say that my boyfriend and I signed up at different times, and each time they did not tell us about this feature. It wasn't a big deal to us, the gym sends you a reminder and then some coupons after. The first year we signed up had some great coupons, like free shakes and tanning. Unfortunately, this year, while they offered the same, the limit was much less. I am not sure if that is because it was our first year....but I was a little bummed :( Not enough to stop going, however.

Firstly, I don't eat meat very often (sorta Vegetarian) so maybe people have had some poor dishes based on that. Secondly, I haven't stepped foot into the restaurant once (in my experience strip mall Chinese places aren't always the nicest looking on the inside)...

Those two things aside, I get take out from them often. The quality is good, they're super prompt, and the food is always hot.

Orange Shrimp (I just ask them to make it) - Good
Shrimp with Broccoli - Good.

16oz sirloin steak, i prefer mine rare but may ask for blue rare next time.
it also comes with a side caesar salad, dinner roll, and from what i heard the option of fries or mashed potatoes. i got the mashed taters and added on some gravy and also bought a bottle of water which ended up costing me a little under $18 after everything? if ur just going to get the the steak special it'll b $13.49 + tax.

there are other options too, steak and eggs breakfast etc etc but i digress.

u'd be surprised how many restaurants can screw up a simple caesar salad. t-bones is not one of these restaurants. thank goodness. dinner roll is a dinner roll, not a big deal. mashed potatoes and gravy were really good. gravy definitely is they key part to that combo. and the steak. my steak was cooked pretty good. maybe not as rare as i would've liked but likei mentioned above, i might get blue rare next time, so u can kinda see that im into sinking my teeth into the flesh and tasting the blood and juices.

The sales rep brought us into one of the biggest boiler rooms we've ever been in.. They have management goons that sit in the corner and eye everything....creepy.. They have more, better free food there..  The sales rep showed us the property, talked about it, and answered our question.  We know better not to buy from the developer.

One thing I learned is to set your watch, and time these guys from the start. If they go over, you can sue them for false advertising.  I didn't bother doing this, and probably wasted a couple hours with these shysters.  We got vocal are we got tired of their tactics and they finally relented.

Chicken boneless - not cooked and cold in the middle and soggy.  Also stated that was how they serve it.  Again I asked , you stand by this?  And he looked run down and didn't care much at all.  I offered to pay for gator tots and drinks but nothing else please.  He walked away and adjusted the bill.  I had to ask to have the smelly fish removed and got that done!
Wow!  I just don't understand why no one seems to care much. Side note: thank you for the managers who respond to these feedback moments and care....you all make a big difference in the quality of food and respect for your guests!!!!!    Let's see where this goes!

Service was great and they were nice.  Could have been just one of those days but the wings crab and other food was med",2018-07-28 05:29:58

My waiter was very pleasant and nice but not well trained on the menu and got mixed up during the ordering process .

We asked our waiter about the pumpkin dumplings and he was so enthusiastic and said they were one of his favorites so we decided to give them a try. The dumplings soon came out and the plate was so pretty with braised red cabbage and fresh greens over the 3 dumplings . I tasted one and discovered it was extremely gummy, my husband tasted one and finished it also saying this was very gummy . We only had one and 1/2 dumplings left so I didn't feel I had enough to send back or make a complaint . The execution of this dish was off but the flavors worked well and maybe this dish is better most times. 

I liked the small lemony salads that came with the lunch plates.

My waiter noticed upon it's arrival by the manager that my lunch fish of the day came out as a different selection than what I was expecting and I declined the offer from the waiter and manager to make a new plate since it is a fish I eat and it was hot and fresh and together with my husbands meal . I received salmon that I think was prepared very good for farm raised and the high light was the roasted NOT EVERY DAY vegetables of root vegetables , peppers , variety squashes and potatoes , the vegetables were very nice .

My husband had the  baked chicken/prosciutto meatballs . He said they were hard and dry but did have good flavor .

We would come back again.",2011-10-30 13:43:19

The atmosphere is cozy. And yes, you will be seated near other parties, so if you are planning on having a lurid conversation you might want to choose another restaurant. Don't make any loud inappropriate jokes.

I know Rabi Doohan III has been here on more than one occasion, and I'm wondering how he coped having to spend a whole dinner session without making a loud inappropriate joke. I know for a certainty that if the two of us went and had dinner there, that we might rack up a complaint or two. Anyway...

The food is top notch. I had the veal saltimbocca, which is hard to find in the valley. I highly approve.

The service was top notch. I felt right at home. The owner made me feel like I was apart of the family.

If you go here on a date(app, entree, bottle of wine) expect to spend anywhere in the range of $75-$90. If you want to pop in for an entree you can get out of there in the 15-25 range. Well worth it in my opinion.",2013-10-25 18:30:49

I am a big fan of Asian bath houses, and also like spas, though not as much. The Spa at the Mandarin has been highly rated, so we decided to give it a try. 

My husband got the 2 hour time ritual, and I just got a regular massage. The service itself was good, and pretty much what I expected. The service rooms aren't as modern as I would expect. It was around $500 dollars before tips for the 2 of us. 

The spa area itself is pretty small, one of the smallest bathhouse/spa general area I've ever seen. When I was there on a Monday morning, there was no one else, so I freely roamed around naked like I would in an Asian bathhouse. I know even though they say clothing is optional, most people would cover up pretty well, I am glad there wasn't anyone else, I didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. I love the soaking pool they have overlooking the strip, it was very relaxing. The rain shower is not worth the try, but regular shower rooms are very good. I also appreciated that they had cold water and plenty of towels and other amenities everywhere. 

Overall, service was luxury, price is high but not too bad given the location. The spa is quite, so I don't think it would be good for a girls day out, where you want to chat all day.

Arriba (whether you can roll your R's or not), in Spanish means Go. And yes, while I like to ""go"" to Arriba's', a more fitting Spanish name is probably Caliente, meaning hot.  And since we're getting to the end of my considerable Spanish vocualry, it's probably time to start a new paragraph and stay in English.

If you're read my Carlos O'Brien's review you can see my assertion that many of the Valley's Mexican restaurants are somewhat interchangeable, Popo's, Valle Luna, CO, etc.  Arriba takes a left hand turn when most of these are going right. To put it another way, the secret to Arriba's is our neighborly neighbor to the East, New Mexico and their incredible Hatch Chilies. Many of the selections on their menu contain Hatch chilies and it raises the culinary (used loosely) level here.  The flavor profiles are worth exploring.  

The P and I visited this Arriba's on a beautiful Saturday for lunch prior to a little Christmas shopping.  It was a great choice, a couple of cervases with lime, excellent chips and salsa (hot, mild, and bean dip) and some great entrees on the patio out front.  The P went with a bowl of Hatch Chile stew with chicken and some guacamole.  She loved it and it was a generous enough portion to bring half of it home.  This little piggy went with the Hatch Chile enchiladas with a tomatillo/cilantro sauce over the top and the obligatory rice and beans.  Good thing we went over to the Arrowhead Mall for a couple of hours, I needed to walk that bad boy meal off!

Just steps from ASU we had lunch outside on the garden patio.  Evan and the service team was great and the food was surprisingly affordable.   We didn't take advantage of the full bar or the huge wine list, but I have been here before and the outdoor bar is worth experiencing on a cool evening.  

The food:
This is not your typical artichoke dip.  It has a great blend of spinach and green chili that make the smooth cheesy artichoke dip amazing with the fresh toasted baguette.  Best dip I can think of!

Garlicky smoked salmon Caesar salad: (Say that three times fast).  I like punchy Caesar dressing and this was no disappointment.  Between the capers and the garlic this salad is not for the faint of heart.  I was surprised when I bit into the cold smoked salmon.  The serving was so large I was expecting it to be a piece of grilled salmon.  This salad as big and delicious.  

Pulled chicken sandwich: My son said it compared favorably to any pulled pork sandwich he had ever eaten, and I have dragged him to tons of BBQ spots.  There was a big portion of smoked BBQ chicken on top of fried pickles.  The buttermilk bun was obviously fresh.  I am going to try it the next time I come.

I am giving the potato salad its own line even though it was a side for the pulled chicken sandwich.  The potato salad has a noticeable vinegar taste that balances the starch of the potato and the bacon crumbles put it over the top. 

Tempura shrimp and vegetables: Eight beautifully fried shrimp, pickled shitake mushrooms on a spring greens salad.  I had to pass on the shellfish, but my wife enjoyed it and everyone agreed their meals were top notch.  

One small disappointment was the lemonade, this place is too nice to serve soda machine lemonade.  Oh well when life serves you generic lemonade drink margaritas!

Above all, the spicy basil with ground beef was the clear favorite; except for my mom, who passively said it was really spicy and drank all her water quickly.

I have had Hobo's twice now because of their want to order from there or go there for lunch.  I really want to love Hobo's and I think they have potential, but it is just not there for me yet. 

The first time I ordered the grown up grilled cheese with their pasta salad to go.  I would be interested in trying this again, but this was probably my fault for ordering a grilled cheese to go, it is never really that good once you get something to go as the gooey-ness and goodness of a grilled cheese just goes away during travel.  So could this have potential - sure, but it was not good as a to-go option - even after reheat.

The second time was in person and it was the chicken and waffle sandwich.  This was huge - just give me half as an option and I'm good (really because it did awful as reheated leftovers).  I kind of left disappointed with this.  I thought the execution of the chicken and the waffle was good, but it ended up dry as there was just not enough of the maple aioli.  I would almost just prefer that they serve it as chicken and waffles and let me add aioli/syrup as I need.

I chose mexican rice to go with it, but I believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.

They also gave me some of the cassava cake.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but I tried and enjoyed it.  Also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  They were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  Served with sweet and sour, it is a MUST have!  They supposedly have to make 3,000 PER DAY!

Go try it out.  No soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  Eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  Not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be OK..",2009-08-12 20:30:47

The mozzarella and sauce were of good quality, though too light for the very thick crust.  The pepperoni was thin but fine.  The crust was not as tasty as I remembered, and didn't have the crispy, buttery goodness of a deep dish pizza.  The crust was rather chewy as well as lacking much flavor.  

The upside to the large amount of crust (compared to the toppings) is that the pizza was on the lighter side, not leaving that gross greasy feeling you get after eating Pizza Hut's pan pizza.  This was even when I didn't mop up the excess surface oil (incidentally, leaving the slice oily helped the flavor a little).

The parking lot was less crazy on the Paradise Bakery side in the evening, so I would recommend parking there, and definitely further away from the popular Zoyo.",2015-05-28 04:32:37

We went on Thursday night, so the Lee's head honchos were in all full force getting the place ready for grand opening the next day as well.

Aside from the marketing wonder it has become, I'm with other people on the sandwiches.  They are sub-par.  Every single Lee's Sandwich experience has ended with the roof of my mouth being completely tore up from the hard baguette and disappointed at the filling or lack thereof.  

1.  Thit Nuong/Grilled Pork Banh Mi - Lacked the flavorful grill and sweet flavors that vietnamese grilled pork usually has to offer.  It also seemed like there was only 3 skinny pieces of meat.  Very lacking in filling as with other Lee's experiences.
2.  Special combination (sliced jambon, head cheese, pork roll and pate) - this was more enjoyable for me because it had the nice flavors of all the sliced meats but the hard baguette held me back from devouring the way my hungry tummy wanted to.
3.  Cafe Sua Da / Iced coffee - super icey, but I can't say I hate the flavor.  Just lacked the volume.  It few slurps and it was gone.
4.  Nuoc Mia / Fresh Squeezed Sugar Cane Juice - wayyyy too sweet, like 
unnaturally sweet.

When you enter and see their offerings and menu, you realize it's a bit more fancy than a typical Chinatown place.  They've been around since 1978.  I'm not sure if that's a big deal since I'm not familiar with the history of Toronto's Chinatown.
 
I decided to go to Lee Garden, on Monday, for my first dinner on this current T.O business trip after reading positive Yelp reviews.  I would agree with the general consensus that the food is authentic and decent, but also agree that it is pricey.  I didn't see many Chinese customers, which leads me to believe that there are other restaurants that are just as good as Lee Garden, or better, that are more affordable in the area.  Lee Garden seemed gentrified, which makes sense from what I've been reading on Yelp (that the prices here have gone up a lot).

Their menus are available online, in pdf form, at:
http://www.leegardenrestaurant.ca/menu.html

I ordered Dish #44: Sauteed Shirmp with Chili Pepper & Eggplant ($16).  The portion was large, so it was enough to serve as lunch for the next day.  The shrimps were good.  However, I was disappointed that the dish was not spicy at all, which was the reason for me ordering it.

Adding in steamed white rice cost another $2.  I realize it's standard, in Toronto, for rice to be tacked on as an additional cost.  I'm just used to rice and tea usually being free, in most other places.

I'm not sure if Lee Garden is supposed to be a Catonese restaurant since I did see Sichuan dishes listed on the menu.

Beautiful architecture and grounds are very well kept, that is what your admission fee is paying for. 
The cafe and restaurant are open to the public.

F7EtWJYmdxgv3B9K8hxzOQ,ADx3PGAOX_ZaYywIf6i-ZA,FyAioPDhzS5IP4a4SXeG-Q,3,0,0,0,"The highlight of this place is definitely their rooftop terrace - great ambiance during the day and into the night. Their location right in Yorkville makes it convenient for happy hour any night of the week, and the menu is unique enough that you can't go anywhere close by for the same overall experience. Their staff are friendly, organized, and aware, which made the experience that much better. The Summerlicious lunch menu goes for $28, and has a vegan option available for every course of the meal. Unfortunately the food isn't anything special and for the price I won't be back - at least not for food.

Starter options from the Summerlicious menu were inari (vegan - sushi rice in deep fried tofu bags), miso soup, and robata shishito peppers (roasted sweet green peppers...some are super spicy!). My miso soup was flavourful and had lots of stuff in it - turnip, enoki mushrooms, tofu cubes, spring onion, and it didn't separate itself into water and miso powder if you let it sit for a while.

The mains include a grilled chicken or tofu bento box, bara chirashi (diced sashimi ""salad"" sitting on a bed of sushi rice), and (vegan) kitsune udon noodle in soup bowl. My chirashi looked small when it finally showed up after about half an hour of waiting after the appetizers, but it turned out to be a good portion for lunchtime. The sashimi variety was diverse and the fish was decently fresh. The wasabi to go with it was good - it was just the right kick and didn't leave any bad aftertaste. The chirashi is surrounded with dried seaweed shavings which entangled themselves as opposed to mix in with the rice - made it tough to eat, but otherwise I had no complaints. I was most happy with the wasabi from my main as the sashimi and rice itself were not notable.

Finally for dessert, there were a triplet of daily mochis, a strawberry shortcake, and a chocolate ""stone"" mousse cake with black sesame cream on the side. Mention that you're vegan and they should arrange an alternative for you for dessert - my table's vegan patron received a colourful and tasty fruit platter with diverse variety. The chocolate stone gets its name from the appearance - a perfectly round stone-like cake that's covered in a layer of chocolate, with a swipe of black sesame flavoured cream and candied black sesame seeds on the side. It almost looked like it should be a lava cake inside to go with the theme, but instead it was mousse and sponge cake. Unfortunately the flavour of the dark chocolate greatly overshadows the black sesame, and the seeds themselves were too chewy - they would've been better crunchy to add texture and again, play on the stone theme (eating rocks anyone?). 

Overall the experience was good and the rooftop was very nice. The food was simple and left me craving to see what the rest of the menu had to offer - it was definitely ""fusion"" Japanese in the sense that everything was reminiscent of Japanese food but ""Westernized"" to suit a general public palate. I appreciated the effort for vegan options, though silently I wondered if there was fish stock in the dashi for the udon noodles. The presentation of everything is modern as well - black stone-like plates to give the oriental vibe sometimes but also clear glass plates to serve other items. Great ambiance, great service, great for those feeling slightly adventurous about Asian food but not ready for the real deal. If you're looking for ""Asian food"" with great service - here it is and get ready to pay for it.",2016-07-25 21:01:00

We didn't wanna get samples this time around since the line was so long so, we just hoped for the best....nothing crazy. 
He wanted too many flavors but, I told him to stick with 3 flavors (cause that's what the employee told me last time) or the flavors will get muddled. He got cream soda (his favorite drink), creme brûlée, and watermelon (which he let the employee choose). The watermelon was yum and tart; VERY refreshing. Creme brûlée and cream soda tasted exactly like it's supposed to :) He, also, got vanilla ice cream at the bottom which went really amazingly with the cream soda. 
I got cotton candy and creme brûlée in XS size. It was the perfect amount for me.

They have tons of smoothie and juice options if you want a liquid meal. For others, there are salads (greens) and ""bowls"", which they call ""grains"". I opted for the latter. 

I made my own. For the grain I mixed quinoa and brown rice. My protein choice was black beans. You get to pick 5 nutrients and I got spinach, corn, red onion, edamame, and avocado. I skipped the cheese option (of course). Cilantro was my herb of choice, and I got the Spicy Almond dressing.  My meal was a carry-out order and it came in a little brown box, but the box was heavy; you could tell that they packed it in really good. 

It was very delicious and everything tasted quite fresh.  The Spicy Almond truly had some kick, which was awesome. It has a flavor that is slightly reminiscent of a yellow curry.  I also added some chili mango hot sauce to it after seeing the bottle. Yum yum!  I was very full after eating this, so I felt that it was worth the $10.  I think next time I'll only eat 1/2 and save the rest for another day.  

There are lots of options for vegans here, and many of their dressings for the greens and grains are vegan (look for the ""V"" by the name).  The acai cups looked yummy too. I'll have to stop by and have one for breakfast one day.

The only thing they're missing is vegan dessert. (They had some non-vegan cookies.)

We went at 6:15pm and it was fairly empty, but by it was brimming with patrons.  

The cocktail menu is interesting. The flavour combinations were hard for me to imagine together. You just have to pick one that has a few ingredients you like and dive in. There were a few things I'd never had or heard of before..made me feel like I've lived a sheltered cocktail life. :P 

The menu was small, but it was still hard to decide. It's nice to see restaurants stick with what they're good at instead of offering lots of mediocre food. I went with the Gnocchi and my friend chose the Tortelli. So, when I say the service was fast, I mean FAST. We ordered, our server left and came back with food. These chefs were prepared for the rush! The food was hot and fresh. The Gnocchi was smothered in tomato sauce and sprinkled with basil and buffalo ricotta. The tomato sauce was just that: tomatoes. Nothing fancy. My friend enjoyed the Tortelli; the sauce was rich with real butter and sage. 

Could I say no to dessert in an Italian restaurant? Of course not! Tiramisu is a given and this was the real deal. The bottom was soaked in coffee and it had more layers than I could count. Definitely in the top 5 of tiramisu!

I've been eating their stuff since the early eighties.  I'll the give you the bad news first:  they're a *chain*.  There are some things they do in an utterly formulaic way;  the sides, especially.  The fries and rice are elementary school cafeteria-quality, at best, and can be safely avoided.  Their yero is nothing special;  it's meatloaf.  I haven't bothered to get one of their salads in ten or fifteen years.

What draws me back, time and time again, is their pork souvlaki.  On pita.  And not with the silly white sauces, no;  with the red, *hot* sauce.  A Greek friend tells me the red sauce is a pretty common thing in Greece, but I've yet to find any other souvlaki joint in Montreal that offers it.   And that red sauce, gentle reader, is the secret.  

Picture this:  Griddle-fried pita.  Grilled pork cube kebab.

The buffet is located in M Resort, which is off the strip, but it's a very nice place.  My draw dropped at the price -- $15.  There was no line (it was a Monday after all).  The cashier lady was super nice, and asked if it was our first time (it was mine, not my date's).  She explained that there is a beer and wine bar - all you can drink!

(No thanks though, I'd rather fill up on FOOD)

I'm having trouble recalling the decor in detail, and I didn't really take pics of the place... I remember it being a very expansive dining hall, slightly reminiscent of a very upscale cafeteria.  Sorry, I'm sure that didn't sound appealing, but, like I said, I'm having trouble.

I do remember giant screens with food show clips and commercials (situated above the food counters).

Anyway, I would describe the food as very fresh and flavorful.  I remember thinking each plate was at least decent to very good... none that were a miss.  The selection is smaller than Rio, but the quality more than makes up for it.  I would say it's almost as good as Bellagio's... and considering its price, it has knocked Bellagio from the #1 spot for best buffet in Vegas, imho.

Food: I was craving something warm so I order a kalbitang (beef soup), and my group had a jajangmyung (korean black bean noodles), o-dengtang (fishcake soup), and dwenchang chigae (seafood and tofu soup). First, we had the complimentary green onion pancake. We split it amongst our group; it isn't as crispy as chinese onion pancakes are but more on the soft, oily, and chewy side. Omg so many banchans - purple rice, kimchi, beansprouts, etc. Some interesting ones I've seen at this place and not others are potato salad and broccoli. My kalbitang was not bad, pretty standard - there were I think 3 peices of kalbi in the soup. I also tried some of my friend's food. The sauce to noodle ratio for the jajangmyung was so that the noodles mixed together were really saucy. And a heads up that the o-deng tang is spicy! Didn't expect it because the broth was white in colour but there was so much pepper put it, my friend didn't expect that it would be spicy judging from the description and looks in the menu. The dwenchang chigae was pretty spicy as well. We didn't get any desserts so I think that's only for dinner?? Price is average leaning towards the cheaper side around the area. 

Service: I don't get what people are saying about bad service?? We were immediately seated and the waitress was just sitting for the front waiting for people.  The young waitress seemed super sweet and, people, you know there is a buzzer right?? She even refilled our glasses of water without asking..But then again, I came in around 3pm so it's wasn't too busy inside.

We witnessed another server that had cleared a table to which she dropped a dirty spoon and spilt some ketchup, I'm super amazed, she only took 25 minutes to pick up the spoon while she and other customers narrowly escaping the ketchup for another 8 minutes before being cleaned.  We sat on the balcony (inside, a step or so up to a higher platform.) And we were served from the other side the whole time. Not once did he take a simple step up and not help us from the other side of the fence. We saw him at the neighboring tables as well, hands in his pocket while taking orders, disrespectful!

nqMGIR4E075w0XQ3CDLx5g,bsC85AP-2NhJqBd__M-mDA,8VQbablhtEXNPfOFJVROGA,1,2,1,0,"Not sure where to begin but I'll give my experiences. I took my car in and I was given quotes that were flat out lies. The first quote I asked for, after my car was checked, the person at the service desk flat out refused to give me a print out, like reputable dealers do. He wrote it out on a blank piece of paper and refused to be specific on exactly they found as possible issues and what they feel I needed. Never in my life have I experienced a dealership being evasive on what they looked at, what they found and what they feel you need.

Since it was a dealership I gave them the benefit of the doubt (big mistake). After my car was fixed the quote that was written on the paper was nowhere near what I was being charged. When I said ""I asked for the exact quote including tax and you said this was it, what happened?"" all I got was ""I made a mistake"". 

The second time I brought my car in the same quote thing happened but this time, I did receive an actual print out with a quote. When I asked ""will this be the exact price?"" I was told ""I think so"". The same thing happened as before in terms of the quote but this time my radio was not working after the work was done on my car.

When I get home to tell them my radio was not working I was told to bring it back and they will look at it. When I arrived I was told ""how do we know the radio wasn't working when you brought it in?"". I told the service advisor ""well your guy turned the radio down when he got in my car because we BOTH heard it on when he turned on the car so obviously it was working"".

I was then told ""well maybe you have a short or something but we don't know if it was working when you brought it in"". After us going back and forth on whether my radio wasn't working or not when I brought it in, the advisor then said they would check it and see if I had a shortness the radio.

They took me to the back and as they were testing my radio they commented ""umm you don't have a short, but maybe it's a bad radio"". When I told the tech ""no, my radio is fine"" I could see the anger in his eyes because I was holding them accountable for not doing proper work on my vehicle. Right then I knew they were liars and flat out dishonest. It's my fault for assuming the dealerships would be on the ""up and up"".

After going back and forth with management on this, I was done trying to work with them. I hits decided to never go to them again.

Go here if you want but understand they are liars and if anything goes wrong they are going to put the responsibility on the customer. If your radio, windshield wipers or anything else is not working properly after they repair your car and you can't prove that it was working properly before you brought it in, be prepared to spend money to get their mistakes fixed.....because you can't prove that it wasn't working when you brought it in.",2014-09-10 15:58:50

I've driven by Go Wild a number of times and I've seen their ad saying 50% off all rolls, all day, every day.  I generally shy away from places that may increase prices only to offer 50% off, but after reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Go Wild a try.

I ordered two rolls--the baked Langostino lobster on a California roll and the Kiss of Fire.  The menu describes the baked langostino roll as baked baby lobster, mushroom with dynamite sauce on Cali roll and the Kiss of Fire as Inside-Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cucumber. Ouside-spicy soft shell crab, albacore, jalapeno topping, extra spicy ponzu sauce.

Both were excellent.  The presentation was great as any good sushi place should have.  The flavors of the lobster mixed with the California roll was very good.  The Kiss of Fire was aptly named.  It had spicy seasonings that gave it that kiss of fire, well a small fire.  I found that the rolls were so good the way they were that I used no soy sauce but merely used the wasabi.  I almost finished the portion they brought and almost asked for more so I could make more fire for myself.  As another reviewer said, they use a small amount of rice.  There isn't a huge amount used to make the roll look bigger than it is or to take the place of other ingredients.  

I had a few more rolls on my to try list, but I decided not to pig out but stop at the two and have some dessert.  I got an order of tempura red bean ice cream.  It was a pleasant ending to a good meal.  There were three servers circulating through the restaurant that wasn't very busy.  They were attentive and even after bringing the check, asked me if I wanted another iced tea.

I really liked the decor of the restaurant.  I'm not a fan of sitting at sushi bars, I've come to learn, so I sat at a table.  The music was reggae--odd for a sushi house--and the big screen TV had ESPN's Sports Nation.  It's amazing how good ESPN is when to you don't have to listen to a word of the drivel they're saying.  The TV was on mute so I watched the plays they were chatting about and tapped my feet  to the music.

I'll be back and try some of the other rolls.",2012-05-02 04:22:12

Our waitress (Kelly) greeted us and we ordered some wine. The menu has all the Italian favorites that you would expect including pizzas. We both ordered spaghetti, one with marina and primavera vegetables and one with meat sauce and a side of meatballs. Soup or salad and bread came with the meals. We had the salads and they were fresh and the homemade bleu cheese dressing was terrific. The food and service were great.

The price is more expensive but the quality of the food is superb. They have the best ama Ebi Nigiri in the town! The shrimp is so sweet and the sushi is superb. What strikes me the most is their cremini mushroom. It's just so addictive and once you eat it all the wonderful taste of mushroom and the smell of BBQ just melt into your mouth and leave you with a memorable taste that makes you craving for more. Tried their 3 sashimi chef collections and all fish (salmon, tuna and white fish) are number 1 quality. So fresh! Got to try their unique crispy rice BBQ with soy sauce too as it looks like a corn dog. And their roka akor cherrano chili roll is impressive!

You'd have a hard time beating that. Unless you only have a credit card on you. Then there's a $10 minimum. Bring cash. 

The sandwiches are okay. The bread is delicious. It's great they give you so much of it. What goes inside the bread is less impressive. They usually go a bit skimpy on the meat and they put a ton of accouterments in there like cilantro and bean sprouts. It helps fill the sandwich but sometimes wish there was a bit more substance.

The real issue with Lee's is with their drinks. Their coffee drinks, or anything they put ice in, is a total rip off. I've been to this location before and I have had to specifically tell them to lay off the ice. The cup is filled to the brim with tiny ice, so you get a few sips of drink. Honestly, I think it's cheap. You pay four bucks for an iced coffee and you get a cup of ice. Also, when I told them to lay off on the ice, the guy who took my order looked like I was crazy. Maybe they don't know that it's garbage to fill a drink to the brim with ice. Maybe it's just how they were told to make those drinks. It's horrible though. Don't order a drink that has any ice in it, unless you actually just wanted coffee flavored ice.  That's one thing I really wish Lee's would change.

My sister had Gorgonzola coleslaw, which came in a huge portion. I had a portobello ciabatta sandwich made vegan, and a side of string onions. For appetizers we had bruschetta which had more of a tapenade kind of topping, and cauliflowerwiith string onions that had the most delicious fired taste It was really good. As were leaving, my mom wanted a picture of the front of the building. As I snapped the photo I noticed a bluish baby sitting on the ledge of an outside window. I called later to ask what that was all about and was told that actually the building has multiple floors which we missed completely. The basement floor has an art gallery. Jen explained that it would be very difficult to explain the blue baby without first seeing the art display in the basement. We'll go back to see that sometime.

The waiter came back in a timely manner and my friend said she was ready to order and ordered the BBB with no caramelized onions with extra greens on the side and the House chips that come with it.  I was going to get the exact same but when I asked the waiter what all came ON the burger since my friend didn't want onions- his reply was ""you can read it in the menu"" - EXCUSE ME? Yes I can but when a paying customer asks a question about the menu items it's customary and good practice to answer them straight away instead of using snarky responses.

Some might have said ""We have Passion Fruit Tea"" but 'fortunately' her experience convinced her otherwise.

Overall, an average Italian experience for me.  They allow you to chose your own level of spiciness on a scale of 1 to 4. I said 3, but I felt more like that was the piquance level for babies. But perhaps it was more that my Frutti Di Mare does not lend itself well to spiciness.

People came around several times to ask how we were doing, which was nice/friendly but all the interruptions combined with the ambient noise just did not make for a relaxing morning meal. 

Food-wise, there were lots of great-sounding options, including multiple items for vegetarians and vegans. Deciding what to order was not easy. I enjoyed my veggie burrito - with tofu scramble instead of eggs just because - and breakfast potatoes. The sweet potato hash was not available when I was there (sad) so maybe I'll have to go back to try that.

I have managed to cycle thru the various seasonal ""wild"" salmon plus a portion of the other fish.  For me it is hard not to order salmon but will be forced to make a change in the fall at the end of the season.  Today was the Wild Kuskokwim River Coho Salmon summer salad with asparagus, tomatoes, blue cheese and fennel in an orange-soy vinaigrette.  An excellent recommendation by the waitress versus my standard cedar plank roasted salmon that masks the rich mild salmon flavor.  This time simply grilled and very, very tasty.

What I am really beginning to like about King's Fish House is excellent service in the center section under my favorite fish.  The mighty AK Chinook King Salmon...I remember catching a similar King 20 years ago on the Kenai River in AK.  My dad and I each caught Kenai King Salmon on separate days.  Each fish was 42 inches long but mine had 27 inch girth and my dad's fish had a 26 inch girth.  The scale was broken so never knew what they actually weighed (40 to 45 #).  My dad claimed his fish was larger so there you go.  The photo of us holding the fish at sunset with a background river shot is proof of their size but not of their quality.  As I recall they were the best tasting fish ever but 20 years is a long time to try to remember taste.

As far as service goes either waitress knows that I start with a Kiltlifter  but not the size - sometimes 16 oz and sometimes 22 oz.

For starters, they are always friendly, smiling and helpful, which is an absolute anomaly these days. At Southern and Dobson, it's semi-close to where we live (and they deliver). Their Massaman Curry must be tried by anyone wanting the best of this stripped-down joint (they now have tables for dine-in). It's Chinese/Thai oriented, for those who want something maybe in both of those worlds, and want it fast, delicious and (relatively) cheap. 

We always get the side order of crab puffs (you get like 10 of them! or maybe we do, for ordering them so religiously!), which are just a little slice of heaven on earth in comfort food. The shrimp in lobster sauce is also a scrumptuous choice. Grab a Thai iced tea as well, to round out an outstanding dining experience.

A few other people strolled in as we all incongruously ate ice cream while snowflakes whipped about torrentially, sporadically on this White Sabbath.

Allow me to take a moment to address axe-to-grind reviewer Tom M.

1-The parlor was far from unclean. Nor was the interior ""crumbling."" Norman Rockwell prints hung on the walls. The menu is neatly written onto a chalkboard across from the counter. 

2-We're almost out of winter as I write this, but I can tell you that the ice cream we had was not freezer-burnt. 

Kay enjoyed her Grasshopper Sundae, a cup full of mint chocolate chip ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and Oreo pieces.

I got cozy with my Milky Way, which was brimful with chocolate fudge ice cream, caramel sauce, and miniature marshmallows that were...crunchy? Methinks someone accidentally put them in the freezer. No matter. It actually added an interesting textural dimension to the sundae. 

P.S. I'm assuming that Scoops on Beverly is affiliated with the Scoops on Brookline Boulevard, a satellite that I doubt has been in business nearly as long as this one has.

This business has many theme nights like trivia and sports based, so depending when you go it can get busy or louder than usual, so when I go for dinner I like to time things just right.

This last time I visited they handed us a beer menu. I had not seen this before and once glancing at it I now know I'll be changing my drink selections from time to time, as there were some interesting less vanilla choices available.

I walk by Legume every single day on my way to and from school. Located in a busy part of Oakland, the exterior of this restaurant looks small and unassuming, but once inside, I realized how big Legume actually is! Clean and warm ambiance. There is also a conference room setup for dinner meetings. 

FOOD
Wow! Let me say it again for emphasis--Wow. I'm kicking myself for not checking Legume out sooner. Since I live so close, I figured I could stop by anytime. True, but I just denied myself extremely delicious and well-made food for god knows how long. Well, better late than never! 

Entree: Pork Shoulder with Spätzle, Beer Braised Sauerkraut, Apples, Horseradish, Dill. 
They might as well have not given me a fork! The pork shoulder was THAT tender. I don't think I've ever had such soft pork before. With a gentle poke, I was able to break the meat. I felt so powerful! I mean, I've been working out, but...I'm going to give Legume the credit here! Accompanied with Spatzle (noodles), the dish had some carbs to go with the protein. The Sauerkraut and dill added extra flavor. While the warm apple slices seemed random at first, the sweetness rounded out the rest of the entree very well. 

Side: Thinking that this entree was mostly protein, I got a side of Tallow Fries with Aioli to balance out my protein-heavy meal. Potatoes are vegetables, right? :). Pretty good, but to be honest it was quite salty. Probably will skip this side next time.

Dessert: Poached Pear-Frangipane Tart with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream. Never had frangipane before, but the name sounded fancy (if Frangipane was a person, she would be Topanga's best friend. ""Boy Meets World"" was such a great show!). Frangipane did not disappoint...Mmmm so good! The description was pretty spot on: a pear tart with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Can I have another? 

SERVICE
Very professional and attentive. The servers (even the ones who served the drinks but did not take our order) all knew a bit about the menu offerings. They helped give us suggestions and our party was more than satisfied. Although it did not feel slow, the dinner itself did take a while. Credit to the good pacing of bringing out the food; it felt like we did not have long waits at any point. I would suggest budgeting 1.5-2 hours for dinner, in case you need to go anywhere after.

IMPRESSIONS
No doubt, I'm coming back again! Such a great dining experience and the food was beautifully done. No, this is not a fancy place that serves mini portions fit for a mouse. This is a fancy place that serves regular (my stomach thanks you!) sized portions fit for a person who wants a special dinner done right.

The guy who took our drink order just stood there and said drinks? Our waiter said what would you like to order. So I am definitely not overexaggerating when I say there was no hellos, no pleasantries, nothing. 

It wasn't to just me either. Everyone was equally rude to everybody. Maybe because it was a little before 6 and they were tired. Maybe the smoking gets to you and you become mad at everyone. Whatever the case this place needs a customer service overhaul. 

Now I've got that out of the way, the food is decent. The steak was a nice size. I was very pleased for $4. I got it well done and it wasn't burnt. It had a nice charbroiled flavor. I needed to add salt and pepper, but I was very satisfied. The toast was good as well. They came lightly buttered and you can add jelly. I liked them with or without the jelly. 

The hashbrowns were amazing! They tasted like they were cooked in butter! I have never had hashbrowns out this good. I traded my eggs for hashbrowns with someone at my table and I was in hashbrown heaven!

I will definitely be back! Even with bad service, nothing comes close to steak, potatoes, eggs AND toast for $4!",2013-01-28 23:21:20

Fn1T2qzaVQIqUv7fDdrvrA,xp4dDQt-SH4MoiELGCQQqA,ywPaE5Ai8SK8TeUoeMgJ6Q,2,0,0,0,"Located in the Scotia building in financial district, SpeakEasy looks like a cute restaurant with a nice outdoor patio. When entering from the building, you go up a flight of stairs before being greeted by a hostess. There is another entrance from the street that leads directly up to the patio. Our party of two came on a Friday night around 6pm for a quite bite before an event. The place wasn't overly packed and for some reason had a luau theme where the staff wore Hawaiian-inspired shirts, leis and the walls had random tiki looking decor. 

Food 2/5
We ordered the drink special which was $5 bottled beers which was decent. Prices are comparable with downtown establishments but wow were we disappointed. We ordered the pork belly taco trios (all has to be the same type), sweet potato truffle fries and smokey brussels sprouts. Any type of fries are generally a safe item to order but these were overly salted to the point where we had to tap off excess to eat them.

Tacos were served on soft tortillas which had grill marks but weren't warm. The pork belly wasn't thin like bacon nor thick like the Korean style but was cooked to a crisp between jerky and charcoal consistency. Aside from the shredded mangos and charred tortilla there was barely any flavour in the dish.

Smokey brussels sprouts surprisingly had no smokey flavour despite looking like they were charred. Despite eating them as soon as they were served it wasn't crispy but instead soggy, retained a lot of oil and were bitter. Mmmm nothing I like more than eating a ball of oil in every bite. There was apparently a sesame miso mayo on top but the sauce literally had no flavour or perhaps my tastebuds were coated in oil to taste it.
 
Service 3/5
Service as per usual is nothing to write home about. The hostess wasn't friendly and started to lead us to our table without us realizing. The server was okay, not terrible nor overly attentive.

In all honestly I'm not quite sure how they're still in existence when there's so many other restaurant competitors a stone's throw away. Unless you're strictly drinking I would recommend going somewhere else to eat. We literally spent $40+ on food and didn't have good food nor were we full.",2018-08-07 01:33:59

I don't recommend doing a sit-down because there were few seats and tables. The service was attentive; although there was a long line, the cashier took the time to explain the drinks we were asking about, and gave us a sample of the tea as well. The drinks were sealed with fancy matte black plastic, but weirdly, they were hard to puncture with the straws. Most of the drinks in our group spilled because of the plastic. Super annoying and messy. The drinks themselves were not phenomenal at all... Mediocre at best. I got the Royal No. 9 Fresh Milk Tea, and it was disappointing. If I were to go again I might get the drink without the fresh milk, but the flavours were lacking, the tapioca was a bit soft, and the tea flavour was missing (unlike the sample they gave us...).

We came decked out in our 80's gear ready to celebrate Terri W.'s birthday. There were about 10-15 of us, I don't remember the exact count. We ended up with two booths on the left side of the stage and right below one of two bars. The show had already started as we were being ushered to our seats. And may I say, the seats were well worth the money. They were playing all the greats from the 80's and we were rocking out to every single song. Although I did not partake in the actual 80's era (I was born in it), I love every bit of the music. The good, the bad and the ugly. 
We enjoyed the show and the complimentary drinks and even made it on to the dance floor for a couple songs. Although there were signs that clearly stated no smoking, we found a few people disregarding. They had about a 15 minute intermission that they played a mix of songs on the two TV's. Our group started dwindling as the night was coming close to morning, but we decided to stay and finish it out. At the very end they were to crown Prom King and Prom Queen. They asked all the couples to come out on the dance floor to dance while they scan the crowd to pick out the contenders. I grabbed Ty's hand and we ran out there. Every girl wants a shot at Prom Queen and I had no real shot in high school. So this was my chance! Now before I continue, you have to know that Ty W. looked like an 80's Rock star and I was his groupie. He had the long blonde hair, the zebra striped bandana, ripped jeans, I mean MmmMm lookin good! So he caught everyone's attention. 

We were the first couple picked to make our way to the stage, along with 4 other couples. We entered on stage and looked out into the crowd. This was nerve racking for the both of us and a giant leap out of our comfort zone. We were then told to dance on our partner provocatively and the crowd will be our judge. ""Oh NO!"" my worst nightmare to dance in front of people, but hey I didn't know a single one except the birthday girl, so I went for it. While on stage dancing I decided to take a quick glance over at the competition and boy was that a mistake. This woman was upside down with her legs wrapped around her man and her skirt was down by her head. Hooha was hanging out everywhere. Where is your dignity woman!? Anyway, the competition ended and judgment day was upon us. We were the last couple as they went down the line and the crowd cheered for each one. Couple #4 (hooha couple) had an uproar and I thought ""oh well that's that."" As the hand came over us and I looked out on to the crowd, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Did we win? Or was that a tie? They voted again and concluded it was a tie. They had never had a tie so it was dance off time. We had to dance 80's the best. Yikes. We gave it our best shot and by then my legs were ready to give out on me. That's what I get for being out of shape. We had quite a few fans in the front cheering us on, and it came so close the second round of voting, but in the end, couple #4 took it home. 

I can say I am proud we came in second and I kept all of my body parts to myself. We had our choice of a $100 certificate to Silverado Steak House or 2 tickets to an upcoming show of our choice. Well this girl never turns down steak, so you can imagine what we left with.

Our waiter was from Italy (I can't remember which part), and had a lovely accent and was attentive and charming the entire night.

Our waiter was gracious enough to calculate which would be the better value for us.

The food was delicious as well.  We started with the beef carpaccio and calamari. I LOVED the calamari- seasoned nicely, the breading wasn't too heavy, and I could have eaten it all night.  I ordered the lobster risotto for my entree and was very, very pleased. There was tons of lobster meat, and the risotto was creamy and well seasoned.

The food was SUPER delicious and fantastically spiced. My boyfriend says it tastes very similar to the stuff he's had while he was in India. The portions were definitely not big enough. They come in small bowls and I definitely wished I had more. 

Overall, the place comes across as a fancy Indian place. They go light on the amount they give you and add charges to every single item (like rice).

The decor is very basic and reminds me quite a bit of a Chipotle, except the walls are lined with subway tiling.  The menu is a bit more extensive with plenty of tasty options to choose from.  You have your basic piada (stuffed flatbread), pasta bowl, salad bowl or a you-pick-two style.  I usually get a you-pick-two since one is never enough for me haha ;)

Their protein options are amazing- salmon, calamari with hot peppers (DELICIOUS!), rosemary chicken (so good), steak, Italian sausage, crispy chicken or vegetarian.  The toppings and mixings are enough to overwhelm you!  The sauces- pomodoro, diavolo, creamy parmesan, basil pesto, red pepper pesto and creamy alfredo are all awesome.  I usually get a mix of basil pesto with the pomodoro and its SO good.  

I ham it out with the toppings; I particularly love the pancetta. The pancetta is thin and crispy and just adds another dimension to my rosemary chicken pasta bowl with pomodoro and basil pesto.  The food is more than enough to fill you with the toppings and pasta/salad/piada.

You MUST try a piada stick with the hot marinara and the calamari fritto misto.  I had a parmigiano reggiano stick- it was hot, gooey and oozing cheesy goodness.  I just started salivating writing this.  The outside of the piada is covered in a light dusting of crispy toasted parmigiano reggiano.  The calamari is very good, but it can be sometimes overwhelming if you bite into a whole hot pepper.

Incidentally, she also charged me $4 for a bloody Mary that I think should have been $3 but I didn't find out until later so we it go. Bloody Mary's were not that good either, but what does I expect from a casino bar? 
We knew it was busy so we tried to give her some slack. She finally brought the drinks and then we never saw her again. After over 25 minutes I finally decided to write our food order down and take it to her. I found her in the service well and asked her if it would help and handed her the order.

The lunch specials are reasonably priced I guess for the amount of food you get, but it just didn't taste... good? Maybe I've been spoiled with good Chinese food at other places. 

I got the veggie lo mein lunch special. The noodles weren't very flavorful. It came with a heaping portion of ""fried rice"" that had no veggies and was incredibly undercooked. I didn't touch the shredded cabbage and egg soup. None of the food tasted fresh to me. My friend's tofu was pretty good though. I don't know if it was what I ordered, or the food just isn't good here, but I don't plan to return.

I have to say this is my favorite AYCE restaurant from all the others in Las Vegas. It's simple, fresh quality nigiri, rice perfectly formed ( not overly packed ), and everything I ate was GOOD, not mediocre... Tasty and satisfying good!!! 

Parking could be a hassle on weekends and holidays. Be forewarned.. parking was full in this complex, so I parked in the Chinatown complex nearby Seafood Palace restaurant and minding my own business.. then slap right on my driver side window.. a warning note that my car will be towed next time I park in this area. Damn serious?! This lot is empty late at night, I'm doing this lonely lot a favor by parking here kiddin' me?!!??!! I guess the security guard saw me skipping happily away to Sushi Kaya and he got jelly.. I don't blame him.. I would be so jelly too, knowing I'll be chowing down some real good eats in a few minutes. 

Sushi Kaya is tucked in the corner right next to Cafe Noodle & Chinese Barbecue restaurant. If you're not the type that reads signs and banners.. you might as well missed this place and gone to Anime Ramen. I lived here all my life and never even knew about this place until a few of my lovely coworkers decided to eat here after a crazy night at work. Fell in love that night with Kaya.. Sushi Kaya that is. Then came here again a few days after with my Family for my Brother's going away get together. 

The owner is extremely kind and welcoming. Took our names and in matter of minutes, we were seated and our server, Juno, that's another story was attentive, patient, and sound in service. Almost like he had sixth sense of when we wanted to order more, to taking finished plates, drinks refilled, to just anything we needed he came around every time to see how we were doing and if we would like to order more. Couldn't have asked for a better server, yet alone a very handsome one :D 

We didn't order any rolls, but only nigiri... Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, Scallop, Uni, and Sweet Shrimp. All were fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Salmon... never had it like this before.. melts just melts so smoothly in my mouth. We ordered ten orders of Salmon and Tuna. The cuts from the Salmon was the best quality I ever tasted.. Both my parents mentioned about it too. Unfortunately, it was so good that I forgot to take pic of it. Once I saw the dish, I devoured it.. I mean my Family and I killed the nigiri. We were like synchronized machines.. one by one.. nonstop. Finishing everything... Clean. 

Raw oysters were fresh & ended with a reviving bite. I insisted that my brother's gf and my mother to eat it all, since I'm single.. know what I mean :P Eh anyways so much more food to enjoy, I just wanted everybody to eat a lot & be happy. 

Bacon/asparagus and bacon/scallop... do I need to say more.. flavor madness.. must try!!

Shrimp and calamari tempura had such a light, crisp crunch. Not too oily or salty. The batter they make this in had to be fresh every time. I seriously enjoyed every bite! 

Cucumber, Seaweed, and Salmon Skin salad.. sum it up with one word.. Refreshing!!!

My two favorites... Ginkgo nuts and sweet potato diced skewers. I'm not shy to order 20 each and cheerfully finished every single piece. I'm the killa of these two and don't tempt me to strike again, because I will! *chomp chomp chomp

We ordered desserts consisting of: five orders of mini cheesecakes, mocha almond/green tea/red bean ice cream, and green tea/red bean mochi. 

In waiting.. I completely forgot I ordered  three orders of baked green mussels and the food runner goes.. ooooh are you done with dinner?!!? We all said Yeeeees. Then she goes oooh, but I have your last order of these mussels? Then my whole family looked at me haha I go... it's okay... no problem.. I'll still take it :P Done. It had a caramel finish in taste and cheese topping. Very yummy for my tummy. No problem...

Desserts all came and I ended up finishing all the mini cheesecakes, since my family warned me they couldn't hang anymore.. what I say... No problem.. I'll eat them for you. My Brother keeps saying out loud.. Damn my sister can eat!! Damn right. Weak sauces... nah just kidding. We all did a great job in finishing all our dishes. 

From start to finish.. it was a great experience in dining here. Food and service were on point and never at any given moment was it a disappointment. Food came out promptly and never once were we just sitting there without anything to munch on. Always busy eating away!!! Ha! :P 

The price is so reasonable and exceptionally affordable compared to other AYCE places. Don't forget to ask for a punch card to redeem after 10 visits :) And best of all.. it's open late hours.. last call I believe is 2:30 in the mooorning, seven days a week.

The textures, the cake, the mousse and the bottom biscuit were all the same quality as the french ones I have come to love. The BEST surprise. Even the presentation is comparable to the best shops in Paris.  I went and asked where the pastry chef went to school and of course she did an internship in Paris! Everything makes sense now :)

This one is located at the corner of Cactus and Tatum in a shopping center. Came here yesterday as I needed to pick up a few items from Walmart and I was across the street already. 

This location has a pretty good size parking lot, but never understand why they put bushes at the end of each lane as it's always hard to see around them when checking for traffic. Actually saw an almost wreck as one person was pulling out and the other zooming straight!! No thank you!! Crazy enough just having to drive here in Phoenix, why make it harder to just maneuver a parking lot?

Don't this this building was built originally for Walmart as the whole layout is different than all other locations. One thing I noticed is that they only have one set of doors entering and exiting the store. Also no garden center or Car Lube area. Store is smaller and more compact as they try and fit the same amount of stuff into this store as in others much bigger.

I did notice as I was buying a few groceries that this location does offer discounts on items if the package is damaged. Several cans of veggies were dented and discounted almost half of what they originally are. Same with other dry goods. This is a nice feature for this store. 

This store only has 12 registers and a self check out area. All registers seemed to be open when I was here. People that work here are so friendly. Had many of the workers say hi with a smile. They do hire older people here, so the lady that checked me out was super slow!! Overall tho, this is an okay location.",2017-10-05 18:17:19

Well after waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes to place my order I didn't know what to get so I ordered 1 of every meat. I have to say they offered a pretty big selection of bbq meats, pulled chicken, pulled pork, rib tips, pork ribs, brisket, and hot links. Unfortunately none of it really stood out. I might be crazy but while waiting in line, people who received their food were yelling about how good this was and I dont know what they are talking about. I guess I'm spoiled to have had Franklin's in Austin, Tx multiple times, but this doesn't even come close and not worth the 40 minute wait. 

BBQ meats aside, this place makes, hands down, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. I don't know what they do but it was sent from the gods. I'll probably go back for the Mac and Cheese, but for BBQ there's only 1 place in Vegas that reigns supreme.",2014-04-02 04:09:26

Always always stay down when comes to local food not only because from 808 but best comfort food ever two scoops rice, mac salad, and entree. I must admit had my reservations cause over the past twenty years living in Vegas (or locals know call Vegas the ninth island) almost over saturated with local spots. The ones that truly stand out for me is individual family own restaurant nothing to do with chains (not that hater still good). Not only does Fist of Fusion Island Grill stand out writing it or saying it out loud. It truly embodies Ohana. I never had conversation with Ronnie or Lisa but reading other reviews. Chef Ronnie was making the rounds asked me how was everything I had for lunch. A new business when see the owner takes time out to come out get feedback from every guest. Not only does it show his passion for his food, also like past review shows that each customer is not customer but part of the Ohana, and felt like living back in the 808.

So first impression was talk about feeling the Aloha spirit! Not only on the wall with coolest sign that the world needs more of. The staff shouting out Mahalos and welcome. They were consistent with every one that came in the hour chilling having my lunch. It small restaurant but has lot of personality in it. The art work on the wall soon walk in. It pretty much covers that whole wall. It looks very much original. It vibrant colors that screams at you. Hula girl with ukulele. Just chilling on the beach. The shaka sign from the logo to the open and close sign on the door. The sit down counter area. It screams personality but very much 808. Above they have three wide screens. The music!!!! So awesome!!! It totally local style Hawaiian music.

The food the menu has nice diversity to it. It not huge menu. It broken down to bowls, burritos, tacos, salads, apps, and ono grindz. It was my first visit not sure where to start. I know the Crispy Torino Span Musubi. One of the reasons came. I have been in this non spam musubi style kick. I seen the katsu style spam musubi but never had one. Talk about WINNAH. I know seen others that the whole musubi is deep fried. Never had so no going compare. I feel Crispy Torino Spam Musubi. If going katsu style this does Spam Musubi right. Only the Spam that breaded katsu style with the panko action. The rest of it is normal spam musubi. The part that separates Crispy Torino Spam Musubi from nothing had before is the tocino sauce. It perfect compliment to the crispy breading with what tastes like aioli based sauce or am guessing. Good. My entree went with the Sesame Chicken Bowl. The bowl comes in three different sizes. I went with the large. Talk about choke food. I was hungry after morning swim set. The amount of chicken give you is local style, the two scoops of rice is mound not scoop, and bowls come with choice of sides. I went with mac salad (cause dah two scoops rice mac salad need I say more) and stir fry vegetables. The mac salad was solid and the stir fry vegetables was nice medley of all fresh vegetables nice crispy and tell fresh vegetables. I was loved the sauce that coated the chicken and then get some on the side. All good stuff.

Little touch comes details. All the bowls or notice all the bowls coming out that day. They had flower in them. It nice one that see back home. All I was thinking if going out of way make it feel like Hawaii that nice touch.

Food~ I've only been for lunch, is Always Delicious, price, quality and quantity wise.
Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics) 
The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)

Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all. 
Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar. 
I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.

Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.

*Notes*
~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe
~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters
~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees
~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile

Atmosphere:  Ok, this was my first visit since Golden Turtle moved their operations on Nov. 8th.  It's currently located at the old After Rain location, so there's booths.  However, I think After Rain took their nice chandeliers/sconces, so the replacements are too small and sorta shabby-chic look for the restaurant.

For some reason, the windows surrounding the new location were also filthy, filthy, filthy!  It looked as though someone ""cleaned"" them with a spit rag.  Quite unappealing for an eatery.  

Also, I noticed that there was NO SIGN of the restaurant.  No familiar wait-staff from the old location.

Food:  I've noticed that prices of pho has been increasing.  A small here is $6.95 and even though this is what I ordered, I was given a large (& obviously charged for a large as well)!  :S  Pho tasted phine, but noodles were all broken.  Tasted better than '99' up the street, although not as good as Mekong River.

Rice/vermicelli dishes are better VALUE.  Rice with pork chops was quite a large portion at $8.95.  Vermicelli looked big as well.

I suspect that with the move came new management due to the different staff.  For a new location, they really need to clean up the outside, get an actual sign to show they care.  Otherwise, I would prefer to go to Mekong River.",2014-12-21 00:34:10

Funny how those windows are so much closer to the ground now, and those steps were smaller (yet far more laborious to climb!)

I wasn't sure what to expect; even as a native, my perception of the mob in Las Vegas mostly stems from the movies ""Bugsy"" and ""Casino"". I was pleasantly surprised to find three stories filled with a variety of exhibits- some interactive, some on video, and LOTS of reading,

Normally, this would not be a deterrent for me; I love to read and would be perfectly happy to while away an afternoon browsing away, but it was so @#$! crowded in there! I guess that's a good thing, but it was hard to jostle your way up to an exhibit, and then you feel guilty standing there too long, so it wasn't conducive to a leisurely read.

Also, there was an interactive exhibit about becoming a ""made man"". The guy on the video asked a series of questions about what lengths you would be willing to go to in order to achieve that status. At the end of each, you pressed a button. ""Yes"" would continue the presentation, a ""No"" ended it. I patiently waited until a crowd cleared so I could watch it. I was about 2/3 through when an annoying woman and her two offspring parked themselves in front of me, and she smilingly encouraged her little spawn to press the ""No"" button over my too-friendly objection, so the whole damned thing cut off and started over, and they strolled blissfully away.  Grrr.  Had to get the voodoo dolls out on that one when I got home.

Anyway, there did turn out to be a surprising variety of things to see, from the actual St. Valentine's Day Massacre wall, to Walter White's hazmat suit, to a police line up room, so I do recommend going, but try to find out when it's least crowded, or at least when that awful woman and her dreadful children aren't there.",2016-05-08 00:30:31

Service here is generally pretty decent in terms of drink turn around time, well-trained, friendly baristas, and I frankly love the location and appearance of this particular Starbucks: The Pagoda style roof/building is charming.  

The GM is super cute and friendly, super chatty about the company, and has done some pretty awesome things such as helped me condense and transfer all of my funds around from one gift card, an old Gold Card that would store but not ""Read"" money, and my new Gold Card and put it all into one card.  Horray!

Not only that, but the crowd here is fun.  Since it's in China Town, it only stands to reason that you would have a lot of Asians: Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and even Vietnamese.  So it's a great spot to go and people watch.  (I drive a Honda and parked in the middle of a 7-long row of Honda vehicles in the parking lot, hahahaha.) And an occasional drag queen pops up here, to boot.  Yeah, interesting crowd!

So anyway, my main issue with this place is the fact that over the last four years that I've been dropping by, the DM or someone has been a little too overzealous with the state of employment in this store.  Every time my co-workers and I get to know a barista at this location, they're GONE!  They've been transferred off, or just ""let go"" at the drop of a hat, with no warning or notice to us.  As a company that just dreams of becoming a frequent habit in your lifestyle, it's a little offputting for this to happen not just once or twice but ALL the time!  One of the reasons why I love the Starbucks by me at Tenaya/Crag is because the individuals who are up there have been there for some time and haven't been transferred out - I know them, they know my drink preferences, and so on.  

So yeah, it's a decent Starbucks but don't get too attached to any of the staff, they never seem to be there more than year.  :|",2012-01-05 02:42:51

The Filet Mignon sliders are amazing, you can literally cut into it with a fork, that's how tender they are!

I'd like to give this a better rating because the service is so good but the food is way too inconsistent.  Yes its always cooked well but I find the steaks really lack in seasoning a lot of times.  They are in desperate need of salt and pepper.  The first time we visited the steaks were cooked perfect and well seasoned on our second visit they tasted very bland as if they had just been seasoned and thrown on the flame. Since then it has been hit or miss, excellent to mediocre.

That being said its a great place to go with friends or a date, and the service is always top notch which is why we keep going back.  I can tolerate an average meal with great service because its still a nice night out, but lousy service makes even the best meal taste like $&I* and ruins the night.",2013-05-30 18:10:25

It's casual and cozy, and it's the perfect place to take a friend (veggie or meat-eater) for lunch or brunch.  It's open for dinner, too, but I tend to go there more during the day.  I've had many a hangover meal there, in fact.....

The best thing about the menu is the substitute option: vegetarians and vegans can sub in soy-based protein (breaded faux chicken or grilled soy nugget thingies, like the So Soya stuff), and even soy cheese, for the standard animal products.  And the servers are all very savvy to veggie needs.

If I feel like being reeeally naughty, I order a vegan version of the chicken quesadilla with the grilled soy & soy cheese, and ask for fries instead of the salad & rice and beans.  I'm not saying it's a healthy meal by any means, but holy crap is it good!!!

The menu has a lot of unique burrito and sandwich-y type fare, plus meal-sized salads and burgers, etc.  The prices are good and the portions are excellent.  And did I mention that the gravy at Utopia is vegetarian and delicious as hell?!!  I'm not sure if it's vegan....will have to double-check that.  So far, it's been one of those ""don't ask/don't tell"" things for me.  Shhhh....

Also, the bottles of yummy Utopia hot sauce on every table are more-flavour-than-heat, and go well with practically everything.

The charcuterie board was good overall; we enjoyed all the meats except one that was a bit too salty for us. The (delicious) Bruges frites are listed under ""Small Plates,"" but the portion was quite large. They fill a regular plate up with fries and it is served with aioli. The crab cake po boy was a little sweet, which my boyfriend enjoyed more than I did. But the best part of the meal were the green curry mussels. While the mussels themselves were average to good, the green curry sauce was AMAZING. It is probably the best sauce I've ever had with mussels. The mussels were obviously delicious in them, but I also loved dipping the bread into it as well as the fries, and, honestly, I also just drank it straight out of the bowl.

As you walk in you can't figure out how this is supposed to be a classy French restaurant decorated like they took notes from a traveling carnival.  You are seated less than three feet away from the next couple which is less than romantic.  However, within a few moments of being seated, you are formally greeted by a knowledgeable server who then offers intelligent suggestions for your dining experience.  After going over the menu several times with different servers, we decided on the 5-course with a wine pairing, at the suggestion by one of the servers.  To my delight, the food was presented in very creative ways that I had not seen before.  For example, the risotto came in a miniaturized cast iron pot.  Overall the food was better than average and the wine pairing was fairly good, but the atmosphere unfortunately took away from the overall experience.",2006-04-11 07:04:28

I have a pretty mixed take on this place...some good, some bad, some inbetween.

The COFFEE:  Underwhelming.  I've bought beans for take-out here, and despite the presence of a coffee roaster right next to the counter, they never seem to be freshly roasted.  I wonder if it's only for decoration?

A recent gripe.  The coffee condiment station was absolutely disgusting on my last visit (see the photo I posted). The white and brown sugar bowls were 95% empty and what was left was crusty and gross.  The towel they'd left on the station was disgustingly dirty.  And who knows how long the milk and cream had been left out without any refrigeration and not in a vacuum sealed container.  Poor hygiene.

The FOOD:  The crepes can be pretty good.  They're reasonably priced and pretty tasty.  Nice mix of savory and sweet.  Not exactly haute cuisine, but it works.  The honey balls are pretty sickeningly sweet...unless you have a crazy sweet tooth, I suggest avoiding it.

The STAFF:  The staff seem to live on another planet.  They rarely seem happy to serve you and often the most simple requests flummox them.  On my last visit, the woman behind the register had such poor English that we had to resort to writing messages on a paper pad.

OVERALL, I would have given this place 3.5 stars when I first started going there, but it's on a downward trajectory.  It used to be a nice alternative to all the chain coffee places nearby.  Given the hygiene issues and the poor coffee, I may start finding other nearby places to patronize.",2014-04-03 21:30:10

From the photos posted on the windows outside, this place is also in Hong Kong. Their selling point is they make their own tapioca and it comes in different kind of flavours such as Black Sesame.

Tried their Royal No.9 Milk Tea (since they ran out of tapioca the fist time i came) on my first visit, and tried their signature Polka Deer (Black Sesame tapioca) on my second visit. The Royal No.9 milk tea was interesting because it had a blueberry aftertaste but wasn't too overly impressive.

The Polka Deer was a total disappointment. How can you not allow customers to add Black Sesame tapioca in other drinks?  Anyways, thanks to this restriction, I had to try their signature Polka Deer. The tea itself was very tasteless (I rather have the Royal No.9) and their Black Sesame tapioca just tasted like black Sesame pudding cut into small pieces. It has absolutely no texture, not even chewy like the regular tapioca. I literally drank half of it and didn't want to finish it.

Decor is very hipster but very limited seating with only two 2 person table and one 4 person table. With the amount of people lining up, sitting here does not feel comfortable at all.

Overall 3 stars for bringing more competition into the bbtea market in Toronto. Royal No.9 milk tea was surprising with an interesting aftertaste and it did taste decent.",2016-07-04 14:33:20

Not to the consistency of a Slurpee or crushed ice.

In contrast to DDC's cozy little bar, Bellwoods is a big, open space with gleaming brewing equipment and white walls that only make the place look bigger and more open. 

We were there on what had to be one of the last nights that the (white picket-fenced) patio was open, which left the brewpub open to the street, which created a neat atmosphere.

Although my favourite beer was the Muggleweisse, I also tried the Hellwoods, the Roman Candle and the Witchshark and enjoyed them all.

Although the food looked good, we had just come from dinner and did not order anything, but I approve of a menu that's so obviously aimed at snacking with drinks. Since I'm sure we'll be back for drinks we'll have to try the food in the future, at which point I'll be sure to include an update. In the meantime, definitely give this place a try.

NB: Bellwoods warrants a five-star review because it's obviously a place to go to have a few beers and maybe a snack, and it does that very well.

It was a pleasant evening so we decided to sit outside and wouldn't have had it any other way. Though the inside looked fine (with most seating upstairs), dining alfresco was the right move.

It's been said before and I'm sure it will be said again - the milk bread is unbelievable. The best free-bread-delivered-piping-hot-to-your-table that you are apt to have. So soft and chewy, with a salt crust that is perfect. It was so good, we begged for a second loaf.

We decided to have a number of small plates. My wife started with the Heirloom Tomato and I had the Salumi - these were delicious starts to the meal. We augmented it with fresh Grandfather's Pickles and a bottle of chardonnay. We took our time and were never rushed. Attentive service for sure.

For our secondi, I had the Gnocchi with basil and garlic and my wife had the Squid Ink  Conchiglie with shrimp - both delicious. We ordered that second loaf of milk bread to sop up the delicious sauces with each.

To finish, I had the lamb loin with grits that was fantastic, and my wife had a tasty black grouper dish. They were both elevated dishes that demonstrated a mastery of flavor profile.

Decided to try this place out during restaurant week so I could get more of a complete experience. My friend and I made reservations for a Thursday evening at 6:00 and were able to be immediately seated. I'm not sure if the night was typical or not but it completely filled up within the hour.

The parking situation for Fern is pretty nonexistent so your best bets are parking across the street in the Healthy Home Market shopping center. Fern is a cozy spot that's heavy on decorative charm: mason jars, twinkle lights, and the heavy placement of ferns (naturally) around the restaurant.

Back to the food and drink: We decided to go the cocktail route and started off with spiked teas. I found these pretty blah. The tea was quite weak and there just wasn't much flavor.
For appetizer, we both chose the beet and goat 'cheese' crostini - a very delicious bite! The 'cheese' was really creamy and perfectly balanced the beet. First course: we both chose the butternut bisque. This was my favorite part of the meal. The bisque was hearty and topped off with pepitas (my favorite). It was also pretty to look at. Second course: fried tempeh with mashed potatoes and kale (I think it was kale). This wasn't bad, the fried tempeh had a nice crunch but, honestly, I did miss having meat during this course. Dessert: I went with the turtle cake and my friend went with the pineapple bread pudding. She absolutely loved her dessert and couldn't stop raving about it. I thought the turtle cake was all right.

My husband decided to get the steamed dumplings and the crab rangoon. He loved the dumplings and said they were ""the best ever,"" but could take or leave the rangoon. I tasted it and thought they were flavorful, but a bit strange to eat. Where do I start? Do I save the inside for last? Etc. Maybe I'm just a bit deficient in my rangoon-eating tactics.

The wonton soup was very good -- not the best -- but had the following under control: broth (chock full of pork and scallions) and wonton flavor and size. The wonton dough was a bit on the softer, slippery side, and I kinda like when it's a bit chewier and thicker (and harder to just cut with your spoon, making it more difficult to eat, but hey! I'm a weirdo). There was still a lot of dough, though (does it actually qualify as ""dough?"" Maybe I should be saying ""noodles""), and for that I was appreciative.

Chicken and broccoli was a winner. Great sauce, LOTS of food. Had those crinkle-cut carrots as well as mushrooms. Did I mention I hate mushrooms in Chinese food? As well as in most other foods, except on pizza. This dish was just a BIT overseasoned, though -- I guess I just mean salty. I've been watching too much Top Chef again.

The food was absolutely phenomenal. We ordered pandan iced tea, roy thai (an assortment of dumplings), khao yum (a rice salad), gaeng boombai (beef short rib in tamarind sauce), ice cream with an assortment of fruit toppings (such as jackfruit, palm seeds, coconut), and condensed milk roti. 

I enjoyed trying the various dumplings in the roy thai, but my favourite was the chor ladda which is the blue dumpling made with butterfly pea flour, which gives it its colour, and is filled with a peanut and coconut filling. The khao yum was also very interesting with lots of different herbs and colourful rice. The presentation of the khao yum in a large golden bowl was very instagram worthy. The beef short rib was delicious and very tender, and the sauce was amazing with roti. The desserts were good, but in my opinion, not as special as the appetizers and mains.

Lastly, the service was excellent. We were fifteen minutes late for our reservation, which would usually mean we would lose our reservation. But we called in and they were very accommodating.

The kids however had TONS of fun and that's really what's important here! 
We also hit the Midway. First I had to take out cash though. The ATM charges you an arm and a leg of course and it spit out a $100 bill. I asked one of the midway attendants to break it for me, and she said I needed to go to the Midway office to break it and then they will give out 2-4-1 coupons to play games. So there is a bill breaker machine in the Midway office and then the woman working gave us a bunch of the 2-4-1 coupons. A pretty sweet deal just for changing up some cash.

Salsa?  The only good thing on our table.  A little runny for my taste but good enough to smother the taste of bland chips.

Guacamole?  Green, bland paste.  Needed something to punch it up.  More garlic, maybe?

Beef Tamales?  90% masa, 10% beef.  No bueno.   Sauce was decent but a little tangy. 

Beef Tacos with Beans and Rice?  I had to smother my tacos in salsa because the meat was bland and a little overcooked.  My rice tasted like it came straight out of an Uncle Ben's rice box.  The beans were terrible--black paste with no flavor.

I came with a bunch of co-workers for some drinks. The couple of us that arrived first grabbed a booth out on the patio. The server was really friendly and quickly got us some drinks. She was on top of our table all night as more people arrived and she kept the drinks coming. Unfortunately a little ways into the evening it started to rain and we were forced into the covered area around the bar. We settled our tab with the waitress and hung out while either waiting to see if the rain would subside or if a table would open up.

Eventually a large booth in the corner did open up. Much to our disappointment another group had already booked the table when we attempted to sit down. Though, about 15 minutes later the group told us we could have the table as their waitress seemed to be ignoring them so they left the table for us.

As soon as we started to sit down this random douche bag of a waiter (I want to say manager but I'm not totally sure) comes over to the table and the following conversation ensued:

Waiter: ""GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. HOW MANY OF YOU WILL BE DINING WITH US TONIGHT?"" (it's all in caps because this guy was clearly making sure everyone in the bar could hear him because he was such an important person).

Co-worker: ""Uhhhhh.......I think there's like 10 of us"".

Waiter: ""WELL CLEARLY THIS IS A TABLE FOR 8"".

Co-worker: ""No problem, we'll just squish in or just pull up a couple chairs"".

As I was counting exactly how many of us there were (there were only 8), a little banter back and forth with the waiter happened where he continued to be a complete ass.

So I've been with this gym and location for almost a year. I'm debating if I should renew it for another year or leave it. What I love most about this gym? It's all about the weights!!! The reason why I don't like this one is because it's always pack when I come (5:00pm-8:00pm) because it's rush hour time. Including the one in Henderson. I do always make time to go but when I do... It's disappointing because you can barely use anything when it's packed. So I end up leaving early which is frustrating because I want to work out and sometimes majority of the machines are out of order. I don't understand that part because I'm always seeing them getting a lot of people to sign up for the gym and yet they can't replace some of the machines that are always out of order???...

KIIN is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the stomach. Diners will immediately notice its dedication to aesthetics upon entering the open and beautifully decorated dining area; this commitment to beauty is also reflected by the presentation of each dish. Described as specializing in traditional and Royal Thai cuisine, Kiin's offerings are distinct from the fare one would generally expect at a Thai restaurant. The restaurant specializes in sharing plates, and we would agree that dining with a larger party gives more opportunity to try a variety of dishes.

THE FOOD:
We ordered a selection of the described ""small"" and ""larger plates"". It is worth noting that even the larger plates were somewhat stretched among our group of five, and many of the smaller plates were quite small for what we paid. Although we were all satisfied by the end of the meal, I wouldn't recommend Kiin if you are starving.

What We Ordered:
- Roy Thai (dumplings) - 5/5
- Chor Ladda - 5/5
- Wing Bean  - 5/5
- Pork Jowl - 4/5
- Khao Yum - 2/5 (1/5 for flavour, but boosted for beauty)
- Gaeng Boombai w/ Roti - 4.5/5
- Chuchee Tofu and Mushroom - 4/5

Standout dishes were the Roy Thai dumpling platter, which was both delicious and absolutely beautiful, as well as the wing bean salad. Although the Khao Yum makes for a lovely picture, we would recommend skipping it as it was relatively bland and overpriced for what it is (a selection of mixed rices). Everything else we ordered was both delicious and beautifully presented. 

THE EXPERIENCE:
As mentioned above, the dining experience at Kiin was extremely enjoyable.  Our waitress was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. The restaurant has great ambience, and our food was extremely fresh and came quickly (a huge bonus, as we had a concert to attend).

OVERALL: Kiin was an enjoyable dining experience that is perfect for special occasions and larger groups that enjoy sharing. Despite being pricy, I would definitely return to sample some of their other offerings. 4/5 STARS

I don't know that I need to take a class to eat chocolate and drink wine, but I was amazed he actually set something like this up!  I later learned it was his buddy's idea, so thank you Derek for bromancing my husband!

I decided we should check out Avalon beforehand as a possibility for dinner the same night.  Situated across the street from a strip mall on McDowell, I wasn't expecting much.  But the gorgeous fountain out front gave me hope.  When we walked in, I was in love with my surroundings.  This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been in lately.  Dark wood, glass tiles in shades of blue, beautiful lighting...this is exactly how I want to design my home...not that anyone should really care about that.  

I ordered a breakfast quesadilla which included cheddar and smoked gouda cheeses and was topped with an avocado pico de gallo.  It was far too much for one person, even when said person is me.  I also ordered a side of rosemary herb potatoes which were really flavorful, but a little on the salty side.  My husband had the farmer's market frittata which included artichoke, grilled asparagus, and havarti.  He really enjoyed it as well.  The best deal of brunch was the mimosa.  A split  of champagne and a small carafe of fresh orange juice for $9 yielded nearly 3 drinks!

Since I'm not a huge fan of breakfast/brunch, I will definitely return for dinner soon.  As it stands, I completely agree with Andrew F in that it must be the location that has kept Avalon under the radar.  Although this may not have been the best brunch I have had, it was certainly better than many places that seem to be much busier.",2009-08-10 00:35:48

(This was during the summer however and I will say that based on the 6 years of living here in Tempe, many of the restaurants that stay open during the summer start to falter with the quality and freshness of their food.  A problem which I hope will be rectified this summer.)   But, given that it has been quite chilly lately and school is still in, I recently decided to give this place another try.

I agree with all the other reviews about this place.  The pho, the portions, the price, and the service are all very good.  No problems with the freshness of the veggies this time.  But I am still adverse to the water (I think it is non-filtered tap water) and one of the lettuce leaves that came with my egg rolls still had some dirt on it.  

Also, note that this place, given the weather and its size, was packed during the usual lunch hour when I visited.

They usually have great entertainment with everything from social events to amazing musicians and even live artists painting models. Wonderful spot to have a post convention gathering or a party of your own after a wedding or reunion, etc. Absolutely worth checking out the next time you are in Las Vegas!",2015-07-29 19:08:19

I noted that most (if not all) of the subpar reviews are from unhappy dwellers that were assigned a room on the ""freeway side of the hotel"". Let's do the math.... Freeway = Noise and Noise = Sleep Deprivation.

I don't see the rocket science in that. Request things in advance and minimize problems. Smfh,

In any case, we arrived on Saturday afternoon right around the check in time and as someone noted within a previous review, this place sits within its own little vortex.

With exception of the few businesses, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE AROUND for at least half a mile. No restaurants. No bars. No nada---

Moving forward however, I secured room reservations through Booking.com and received an exceptional rate for a Double Standard Suite, thereon to realize a bit later on, that we only needed one King. 

Reached out to Booking.com and had them contact the Hyatt simply to confirm that we could get the room for the same rate. All was said to have been taken care of..... so imagine driving 6 hours out, directly from Cali- and being informed that there was NO ROOM booked for us AT ALL!!!!

What da' hell???!

After awaiting the resolution of some sort of technical glitch for people waiting in line affront us, to be resolved by a gentleman by the name of Kevin, who, I'm going to presume to have been the manager, we were seen. Kevin then, complimented our patience in waiting (not that we had a choice). He quickly observed the problem and took no hesitation in resolving it.

What he did next was extremely unexpected!!!

This saint of a man, reduced the rate of the room to so low of a number that we seriously could've stayed there an extra night or 2!!! Then....Mr. Kevin went on to comp' our drinks from the bar!

Yazzzzzz! This, ladies and gents, is Hyatt customer service!!!

The room, facing the parking lot (as opposed to the freeway) was gorgeous let alone QUIET. There was honestly enough space for us to have invited the ENTIRE family ......but of course we all know better than that, right???

Instead, ....we opted to do cartwheels and jumped around on the King-sized bed!!!!

Thanks again Kevin. Sorry about the foot print on the pillow! Hands down, we'll be using Hyatt again within the very near future.",2015-04-29 21:00:09

Checked out the reviews on Yelp and saw they did same day resizing. They measured my finger and said it'd be 4 days before we could pick it up due to their jeweler having a backlog of customers because he had just come back from vacation. We told Mark, the owners' son, that we were from Vegas and were leaving the next day. He said he'd see what he could do.

Less than an hour later my vintage engagement ring was perfectly sized, and the triple banding was seamless. You'd never know that it had been cut apart with more white gold added in. And it only set us back $45!

The customer service was fantastic. Mark was very friendly and chatted with us about Vegas the whole time. We ended up getting Brian a vintage channel set diamond band to wear on his right hand (not as a wedding band) just because the price was right.

When I'm in this area, I'm usually craving a light vegan meal (at Go Raw) or good bar food (at Lake's Lounge). I was nearby on a day when neither option sounded good, so I gave King & I a try.

KING & I STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS: A familiar dish done really well, wings stuffed with pork and glass noodles. Not too greasy, four piece order for $8. 
DUCK NOODLE SOUP: Duck plus noodles, in a savory brown soup with cilantro and bean sprouts. The best and worst part was the broth, which was extremely rich and flavorful, but entirely too greasy to enjoy the entire portion. 
KING & I FRIED RICE: Fried rice with the usual mix of meats (shrimp, chicken, bbq pork) and the addition of pineapple and cashews. The last two ingredients made me hesitant to order this, but they made the dish! The nuts added a nice texture and the citrus helped cut the excess oil. Menu describes this as spicy and I didn't detect any heat at all, added in an entire cup of chili oil and it was just right.

It's small, and nicely decorated- definitely a neighborhood kind of spot, I really enjoy the ambiance. Opted for a large takeout order, flavors were good and prices were fair.  Unfortunately, the excessive oil/grease used in a few of our dishes turns me off to coming here  frequently, but it's a solid option for rice and noodle dishes.",2015-12-06 08:07:17

PRO TIP: Sam's has really great deals on alcohol - from what I've seen they have better deal's on wine (like Stella Rosa, for instance) than Lee's!

Every time I make a trip to Sam's Club, you can bet your ass I'm going to eat at the food court. The only vegetarian meal offered is a slice of cheese pizza, but I'm fine with that. A pizza and a drink will cost you about $2.50. Churros are only $0.98!
TIP: If you're going to eat at the food court, make sure you order at least an hour before closing. Employees close up shop early. I tried to buy a churro and a frozen yogurt 20 minutes before closing, but they were all out and not about to start making them either.  

MEMBERSHIP: I actually bought my annual membership to Sam's from Livingsocial.com. I paid about $40-45. With my sign-up, I also got a $20 gift card to Sam's as well as vouchers for free food items like free cookies, a free rotisserie, and a free package of lunch meat to name a few goodies. The membership nearly paid for itself! 

PROS: Competitive bulk pricing, cheap food court, cheap alcohol, and free food samples given out to shoppers.

CONS: Crowded parking lots, DirectTV salespeople stalking you in the electronics section, and long lines.

The standard dim sum dishes are in the carts being pushed around but their ""special"" dishes are behind a counter where you walk up and order. The order then gets brought to your table.

We shared the two chicken tacos plate that is served with rice and beans.

The chicken they used in the taco seemed like a decent quality chicken that was prepared well and the chicken itself was tasty. I really didn't care for the way they grind up the vegetables in the taco. I thought it was weird and never seen anyone do such a thing anywhere here or in Mexico. But my least favorite thing about the taco was the avocado dressing. It was disgusting. This brought down the taco a few steps for me....sorry but the avocado dressing is awful and there was a lot of that dressing on my taco. It would have been better if the dressing was squirted on like in a thin drizzle so I wouldn't notice it so much. The taco also didn't have the fresh lively flavors that you usually taste in a taco. 

Beans are sort of spicy and above fast food standards. Rice seemed average.

Way better quality than Taco Bell..........

The people working there were all nice and the person that ran out our plate took the time to run me my own plate.

If you avoid the avocado dressing you will have a better experience than I did.",2017-06-29 11:50:47

I ordered a fish sandwich with no bun. It came with tri-colored nacho looking chips that I ignored, did try the salsa and it definitely was 'overworked' it was more like a sauce then a salsa.  But the fish was pretty good...pretty sure it was previously frozen but you aren't going to get 'fresh' Mahi Mahi in the desert. I put some lemon on it as it was a little plain [maybe order it blackened].

Friend got the fried fish tacos which he said he liked. I will have to agree with Mark Z here, he also got black beans and rice and boy were they bland!  Definitely not cooking it up Cuban or Mexican style, it's white boy bland. A little Goya Sazon would do these up much better, maybe some peppers and onions [talk to the Havana Grille they got some black beans going on!]

They have always served consistently delicious fare that is always full of flavor. You NEVER feel like you're eating bland, greasy, food court Chinese food. You know your getting your order freshly cooked, because they cook it there in front of you. The seating is okay, standard tables and booth style seating. It can get crowded at peak hours. And the line moves slow while people decide what to order. I recommend grabbing a menu while you wait. In fact suggest this to EVERYONE in line. Once in awhile they fall behind cleaning tables and you get the odd sticky seat. Other than that this is one of few places I don't mind dining in to eat. 
I have tried so many menu items. I love their General Tso's Chicken, it is crispy, spicy, and the sauce is perfect. I always order their Crab Rangoon and Chicken Egg Rolls. They are both tasty and addicting. The Rangoons are curried and have the perfect spiciness. My faves are Pork Belly Steam Buns, WuHu Fried Rice, Roasted Duck, Won ton soup, Beef Chow Fun, and gyozas. 

TIP #1 - The wooden spoon they give you displays your order number and is to be placed in the holder at your table (The red holder with the sauces).

Both times I made reservation through open table, and neither time did I have any issues. Upon arrival we were seated at an adorable table in the dining room. I love the look and design of this restaurant; with it's mix of shabby chic and vintage. The service was great, The food was delicious, and both times overall I had a wonderful experience. I recommend ordering a monkey bread for the table to share, you will not be disappointed. They do bottomless bloody Mary and Mimosas during brunch. They have an excellent variety of food on their menu. They do fresh juices, coffee, cocktails, and all their food is farm to table-esque.  A brunch for two people will set you back around $40-$50.

It's an interesting venue.

The location is great for downtowners, and it's an incredibly spacious setting. I think the bar is a little larger than it needs to be, for the amount of seating it provides.

I had a long island ice tea that was delicious! We were not there long enough to order food, but I will probably be back for that later.
(It was already on my list)

The bathrooms.

Wow. That was a frustrating experience.

I mean, it's neat, and it's certainly unique, but dammit man, I had to go.

We were seated on the upper level of the restaurant.  Service was prompt with drink orders taken right away.  They have a few local beers on tap so we each ordered one and an old fashioned cocktail.

For starters, we had the scallops...delicious and done just right.  One of us had the whitefish potato salad which was also good.

For mains, we had an order of the snails on polenta (very good but a tad salty), duck with pork belly (excellent and I would say the standout dish) and the steak, which was a huge disappointment.  It had the consistency of pork and the meat itself was dry and tasteless, despite ordering it medium rare.  I can only compare the steak to the likeness of eating a huge slab of Chinese BBQ pork.  Not that BBQ pork is bad but when you order a steak, you would expect it to taste like beef.  Apparently, it was strip loin cut but we've had better strip loins at breakfast in cheapy diners.  The steak does not come with sides so we ordered the gnocci (good) and turnips (meh).

The highlight of the meal was dessert.  The lemon tart was simply amazing and the warm apple tart with ice cream was also good.  The chocolate pot du creme paled in comparison to the two tart options.

Overall, a great meal for those who didn't order the steak entree.  Not sure how it turned out so horribly wrong.  Great apps and fantastic desserts to end puts Woodlot on our 'maybe' list for a second visit.  

Mentioned our comments to our waiter about the steaks so hopefully he will relay the message to the kitchen.",2011-04-27 14:41:26

I recommend the jalapeno hush puppies. They aren't spicy, like the jalapeno would indicate and are addictively yummy.

I've never had the pulled pork sandwich, but my husband has and says it's really good. 

They make home made sweet potatoe pie, which I have yet to try, but I certainly will soon as it looks soooo good.

I purchased a marshmallow shake and was pretty surprised to see the young man using regular big fluffy marshmallows!!

My husband had made the request to dine here for his birthday night and whatever the birthday boy wants, he gets!

We got to Black Sheep about 1-2 minutes before their happy hour ended and they were nice enough to continue to honor happy hour prices for us. Happy hour runs from from 5pm-6pm. Their deals include $1 oysters, $5 wines, and $4 bartender's choice beers. They only have one cocktail on the happy hour and it's $6. 

We started off with a dozen oysters, a cocktail for me, and a beer for my husband. Their cocktail of the day was a raspberry mojito and their bartender's choice beer was an IPA. We also got their beef crisps for an appetizer. For entrees, we went with their smoked clay pot salmon and beef short ribs. 

Their oysters tasted really fresh and for $1 each, it's a great deal. The only problem I have is that I wish there were more brine in the oysters and whoever shucked them needs more practice. I forgot what kind of oysters these were but they had a creamy texture to them. They were delicious.

My raspberry mojito tasted really light. If they never told me it was raspberry, I would never have been able to guess what it was. 

The beef crisps are dried thin tendons that are deep fried, sprinkled with Japanese seasoning, and then a lime sauce is poured onto it. They sort of reminded me of the shrimp chips. I really liked the sauce they poured on it but other than that, I don't really care for them. It wasn't mind blowing or particularly memorable. Honestly, just have some chicharron.

The smoked clay pot salmon is a piece of salmon on top of farro. You can definitely smell the smoke. The salmon was delicious. It was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. The flavoring is just enough -- not too salty. The salmon does still have the skin and the skin was crispy ... perfect. The farro was not my favorite. I think I would've preferred regular jasmine rice with it. 

The short rib was perfectly done. The meat just falls apart. It was very tender and juicy as well. Their short rib dish contains a bit of Asian influence since they use Asian pears. Despite all that, I've never been a fan of short rib so I can't say that their version of the dish changes my mind. If you're a person that doesn't care too much for braised short ribs, then please don't get it. I'm pretty sure you won't like it.

We also ordered a dessert and it was really delicious. It was like a chocolate sponge cake drizzled in sweet milk. Very easy to eat, not too rich, and yummy.

Overall, their execution on their dishes is good. The quality of their food is good as well. The creativity is a nice twist to what we normally know. However, taste-wise, I feel it could be better. Other than the oysters and the salmon, I didn't care too much for the rest. I would definitely come again for their $1 oysters! :)",2017-10-13 05:05:04

Atmosphere: it was quaint and I was quite surprised by how cramped we were all seated. The decor was lovely but sometimes a little arm room is appreciated in the dining experience (bumped forearms a couple times with the person beside me who was not a part of my dining group). The arrangement for the tables are small so the larger a dish the more tetris you will have to play to ensure nothing falls off the table or spills on you.

Service: We started with one server and thankfully ended with another. Prior to my arrival at this establishment, I called to inquire about allergies and dietary restrictions. They promised that they would make adjustments and removals in accordance to my list of restrictions. Escatic as I was since I thought as being the brain child of Pai (which is amazing beyond belief!) I was in the clear. Well...wrong. My first server would look at me annoyed about my inquires and refused to explain what was composed in a dish. Furthermore, when I stated what I could not eat, she just rolled her eyes and I doubt informed the chicken. I reiterated that certain spices could not be used or at least to inform me. She didn't. Can you guess what happened? Well! My allergies flared up to the horror of my boyfriend and myself. I called her over and demanded to know what was in it and once she told me, I explicitly re-conveyed that she said there was nothing that would harm me on the plate. She hurridedly scurried off to leave me to my internal hell. Thankfully, a male server saw the face I was making (pain and nearly in tears because of it) and inquired what was wrong. I told him how the server did not disclose the nature of the food and I ate it unaware and was experiencing significant pain. The server took over our table immediately and catered to us immensely. He explained thoroughly every component of every dish and so I was able to eat a little of something. I unfortunately did not get his name but he was fantastic and improved my night. 

Food: My boyfriend liked what he ate. I liked the gourd and coconut rice. Would I recommend anyone with any allergy or senstitivity or dietary restrictions to go for dinner even if you call to make sure they can accommodate you? NOPE. Go to Pai. They will take care of you.",2017-12-03 15:14:51

There's plenty of parking and I love how you don't have to travel to Spring Mountain to indulge in yummy sweets and drinks. The decoration is adorable. Since the last time that I was here, they've added a Zen Pod (as pictured). It's a start up company based in San Jose that offers a convenient pod with a computer in order to conduct business. From what the company's website said, it's the first pod to be placed somewhere public. Besides that, the environment is very peaceful. There were a few parties studying and there is plenty of seating!

The only dessert that I've tried here is the taiyaki. The ice cream and filling is great. You have the option to choose your ice cream flavor, filling flavor, and topping. We ordered the matcha green tea ice creaming taiyaki with Pocky and red bean filling. Everything about it was good except that the shell was way too hard. Taiyaki is typically soft like waffles; however, the shell was like eating potato chips. There are plenty of other desserts that I want to try, in addition to the savory snacks, so this won't deter me from coming back in the future. 

We ordered the lychee rose and the orange yuzu drink. The butterfly pea tea wasn't as flavorful as it typically is at other places, but it wasn't bad either. The lychee rose was super refreshing.

That being said, I came here on Friday night about 8:15pm, because it was open late (until midnight) vs 9pm for my friend and I's intended spot.  I've seen the pictures and read the Yelp Reviews, and wanted to try something different since I found that Orchid Garden anytime after 11am is horrible, dumplings that are dried and stuck to the metal canisters, steamed cakes that are hard and could take a tooth out, etc, and East Ocean will only sell you what didn't sell at lunch time, unless if you're chums with the owners/managers (once was told that Har Cheung/Cheong Fun was sold out, only to see a couple they knew well and were chums with come in 20 minutes later and get it served fresh and hot).  

So first thing we noticed was that the people in front of us wanted ""cart service' and left because they don't bring the items out on a cart after 2:30pm.  I also noticed that there were 3 round tables and 1 side booth, and 2 side tables that only had drinks at their table, so it'd be an understatement to say I was a bit leery about what was to come, as all the complaints about service and pricing (I saw the menu, $2.88 for regular items to $5.98 for specialties looked a bit steep) from other Yelp Reviews were starting to come to the surface.

Ok, that's about as bad as it got, and totally unwarranted!!  Ordered the following (as best as I can recall):

From the Dim Sum Menu ($2.88ea):
Har Gow (Shrimp Dumpling)
Lo Mai Gai (Sicky Rice with Chicken & Chinese Sausage wrapped in Lotus Leaf)
Pan Friend Dried Shrimp, Pork, Chive and Ginger Dumplings (aren't these just a Fried Potsticker?)
Spinach & Shrimp Dumpling
Jian Dui (Red Bean Sesame Balls) - SOLD OUT

From the Delicious Dim Sim Menu ($3.98ea):
Xiaolongbao (Steamed Chinese Soup Dumpling/Bun)
Liu Sha Bao (molten sweetened salted egg custard in a steamed bun)
Lo Bak Go (Turnip Cake with dried shrimp and pork)

From the Chef Specialties Menu ($4.98ea)
Shrimp Ball - SOLD OUT

From the Dinner Menu:
Roti Canai (Indian Flatbread with Curried Potato Dipping Sauce) $3.98 (ordered 2)
Salted Fish Fried Rice, no chicken by request (salted fish, egg, onions, frozen peas and carrots fried rice) - $13.98

The Lo Mai Gai and Har Gow were the first two dishes to arrive, and that set the tone.  There is no cart service, and we noticed that each Dim Sum dish was being prepared separately, so we were getting 2-3 dishes at a time.  I know this would be and was a turn off for some of the customers (some wouldn't take a table, others were getting peeved at seeing other tables getting dishes while they waited), and it would have been for me, except that the food was excellent!  Everything was fresh to order:  the Lo Mai Gai was steamed and hot, came off the wax paper easily, did not stick to the metal canister, and was not dry and gelatinous like most you would (expect to) find at 8:30pm.  Everything was on point, and that was because of the labor intensive practice of bringing food fresh to the table, so we treated it like eating a 7-course tasting menu or tapas, so neither the lack of cart service, nor the absence of seeing all Dim Sum items at once at the table was missed. It was actually a relief to receive each item as hot as the tea that accompanied it, which leads me to the discussion of pricing- yes, it's a little steep, and I can understand why others would complain about it if they received cart service (ironically), but for dinner, to see the labor intensive effort to prepare and bring each dish fresh to order to the table, it was worth the extra amount!

My personal top highlights from the Dinner:  The Lo Mai Gai is my favorite Dim Sum dish and this one didn't disappoint, nice and sticky, but not too chewy.  The Pan Fried Dried Shrimp, Pork, Chive and Ginger Dumplings had a flavor that was popping off the charts:  you could really taste the ginger and chives and get the saltiness of the shrimp.  Roti Canai was excellent, the curried potato dipping sauce had enough heat to be noticed but not overpowering.  Serving the Salted Fish Fried Rice without chicken mean more salted fish, hooray!; and it was the perfect salt dish to compliment everything else!

But the best highlight and biggest surprise was the Liu Sha Bao!  It had a sandy pudding type texture to it, but the semi-sweet custard filled bao was awesome!  The staff also brought us two dishes complimentary:  Gai Mei Bao (chinese cocktail bun with butter and sweet coconut filling), and a second type of Liu Sha Bao that was made with a pastry roll instead of the steamed bun, both excellent ""sweet"" compliments to our Tea Service.

We stayed until almost 11pm, and spent time talking to the staff, especially Elaine who was being apologetic for the ""slow service"", but she need not have to, the food was well worth the wait!!!",2016-10-17 16:33:21

Looking over at the tortilla chip warmer, several large buckets of industrial cleaner were stored.   Nothing wrong with that, I guess, but could they not find a space in the back?

The special $7 guacamole tasted store bought with a few goat cheese crumbles scattered over it while the queso fundido bubbled in a 2-3 inch layer of chorizo grease.    Beef in a taco also tasted old.   Refried beans that accompanied my Pollo con Crema tasted ""off"" and/or rancid.

A little embarrassed to admit it, but with a toddler and a dog, we absolutely killed the terrible builder grade carpeting in the family room.  It was so gross and dirty and impossible for us to get it clean with one of those Rug Doctor rentals that you can get at Home Depot.

Anyway, when it came time to move out, we called J2 Cleaning based off Yelp Reviews.  The process was super straight forward.  I called, they gave us a fair quote on the phone based off the square footage of the house.  They came by the house and got the carpet looking like new again in about 2 hours.  All the food and pet stains... gone!  The place was lookin fresh again.  The man who came to clean (sorry, forgot his name!) took his time and was very nice and respectful.  He even helped me take some last minute things off the wall like curtain rods since I was too short!  

I actually lost the receipt they gave us, so I had to call them since I had to show proof to the property manager that we got the carpets cleaned.  I called them and they immediately emailed me a copy.  Easy!

If I didn't know what the burger was, I would not have guessed it wasn't a beef burger.  If anything, I may have thought the burger was made of a very lean beef, as it can fall apart a bit, which I have experienced with regular beef burgers in the past.  

But otherwise, it was a great burger.  One thing interesting about this burger, during cooking it creates a bit of a crust around the burger, which tastes awesome!  The Counter may want to take advantage of this crust for other recipes or offerings.

It is hard to differentiate between the staff and the customers, but that is kind of Postino's thing.
I haven't had the best service here always, I don't fit in. I'm one of those old school hip hop guys so when I come in here, I feel I kind of stick out but it seriously is a good wine bar, and good wine bars are hard to come by. 

I do enjoy people watching thou, and this place is definitely good for that, it's good for dates, you are sure to see allot of first daters and couples without kids here that have been together for ever just staring at their food not talking...awkward!!!!

The ambiance is always good the lighting is just right. You can smell the love in the air... then again maybe that is the bruschetta...I love the Bruschetta...only place with better Bruschetta might be North...also in Arcadia...BRUSCHETTA WARS!!!

Sometimes they have live music here. Always a plus...love live music, I wished more places did this. 

Anyhow besides the snooty staff, this place is pretty cool. 

I'd give it five stars if I looked like I walked out of a JCrew catalog or if  had the latest thrift store Macklemore look going on, maybe I could relate better to the staff...but I grew out of that trendy shit in like 2004. I look like I came from the gym when I come here...and I just assume the staff assumes I have no money and give me attitude. 

I just don't care. But still a good time.",2015-07-18 22:27:12

Food was pretty good if you are not looking for the authentic Indian taste. The samosa had a good balance and did not have the over powering taste of fennel seeds or cumin. The lamb was excellent and very tender. The chicken 56 was spicy but was good. The ginger drink was very ginger but their guava drink lacked guava. Put down 3 but it is more like 3.5.,2015-05-30 02:31:33

It's tucked away and not easy to see from the road, but it's worth the bit of a scavenger hunt.  The staff greeted us warmly the second we walked in and helped us place our order and held our dessert order until we were ready.

I had the Pesto Chicken pizza and he had the Meaty Italian. Each was ~$8 each and could easily have been shared with a side salad instead of ordering two pizzas. Pizzas here are all made with 11"" crusts.

The fire grill flavor was great! The pizza crust was thin and crispy, but not crunchy or cardboard like at all.  The pesto sauce was excellent and the meat pizza was exactly what you would expect it to be and they were happy to put pepperoni on only one side since I don't love pepperoni and wanted to try his pizza.  

We finished it off with the Pookie (pizza cookie - if you've been to BJ's think Pzookie) which had a full side scoop of ice cream for just $3. Delish and cooked only when we asked for it so the cookie part was nice and hot to melt the ice cream.

We ordered 24 Jumbo Wings for $19.89, and a medium Godfather pizza for around $17. The Jumbo wings were the biggest wings I have ever tried. Very plump and full of flavor. Though for Honey Hot, they did not seem very spicy. The Godfather pizza's ingredients were Italian sausage, fresh garlic, grilled onions and Rosati's hot giardiniera. The pizza was more spicy than the wings and we loved both! 

We ordered off of GrubHub, which gave us a $3 (delivery fee) discount for spending over $20. I really enjoy using GrubHub because I can pay for the food and tip with my credit card ahead of time. The delivery boy was also very friendly which I appreciated.   I did sign up for coupon offers, but the other discounts did not seem very appealing to me. While it is pricier than I usually spend we received amazing pizza and wings, so this will be a once in a while treat for us. Quality over quantity!

*Also, I know we ordered a big order of wings, but they did not skimp on the ranch sauce which means a lot to me! I hate when pizza places get greedy with the sauce. The delivery driver also offered extra cheese and pepper packets for us also.",2015-05-15 17:05:54

My friend and I both started with the tea which is a house blend. We really liked the flavor. For a starter we shared the Spicy Wonton appetizer. The homemade noodles definitely stood out on this dish. The wonton was delicate and the flavor was perfection. The spice level was perfect. 

I had the Shang Beef Noodle Soup with knife-shaved noodles. My friend went with the Pork Belly Noodle Soup with hand-pulled noodles. The hand-pulled noodles resembled udon noodles while the knife-shaved noodles were thicker and wider. Both were delicious! My Beef Noodle Soup was a great dish. Everything in the soup tasted fresh and there were generous amounts of noodles and beef. The bok choy, cilantro, and green onion were delicious with the noodles and beef. There was enough to save for lunch the next day. 

The inside of the restaurant is very clean and the décor is minimal. All seating options allow for watching the food being prepared. Seating options include tables and counter seating next to the kitchen. Pricing is more than reasonable for the quality and fresh nature of the food. 

Our server was excellent. He was great with answering questions and took great care of us. As the night went on the restaurant filled quickly, but he kept up with everyone well. Most importantly, he made sure our delicious tea never ran out.

For any other displaced Chicagoans, it is comparable to the swanky ICON theater, except instead of there being any kind of fair division between VIP and regular seating, 90% of the theater is VIP and the crappy two rows right in front where you have to crane your neck up to look at a much-too-close version of the movie are the only ""regular"" seats.  At least, that was the setup in our theater.  However, as a plus you don't have to sit in the VIP section in order to get drinks.  

Families beware: after 7 PM, nobody under 21 is allowed (at least that's what was posted above the ticket counter).

The menu is quite varied, and I think that a large group would be satisfied with the options. We decided to go all out, getting an appetizer, dinner, and dessert. The appetizer we chose was very good, jalapeno peppers stuffed with chicken and wrapped in bacon and fried. These were served on top of bluephie's 'tortilla salad', which is tortilla chips with (extra) oil and onion and peppers. This was a bit awkward to eat, but it was tasty. I had the duck tacos, which consisted of duck confit with pickled ginger slices, asian slaw, and black bean 'crema' piled into 3 flour tortillas. On the side was more 'tortilla salad' and a heaping pile of black beans. I felt as though the sides didn't really complement the asian style tacos, and there was an awful lot of liquid left on the plate from the asian slaw. I wound up eating my meal 'salad style'. All of these minor issues aside, the duck confit and slaw were fantastic. My boy had the 'wisconsin sushi' which was meat aplenty, served with mashed potatoes and lightly sauteed spinach. He was very satisfied with his dish, and licked the plate clean. For dessert we were served the largest slice of carrot cake I've ever seen. Somewhat of a carrot cake aficionado myself, this was very good and VERY moist. We took most of it home and enjoyed it the following day (still as moist as it was the previous evening). 
My biggest complaint is that the bread served in the complimentary bread basket was clearly the same type of frozen prebaked roll you can find at the grocery store. However, the tomato/herb compound butter served alongside was quite tasty.
This is not 'fine dining', but the food is solid and has unique flavor combinations. The people are nice and the desserts are fantastic!

Mind you, I have lots more to see/taste. Kimchi Korea House is clean with ample seating and has cozy booths as well as tables.

So first, the service was incredibly friendly and accommodating, but not overbearing.

Two of us ordered the bulgogi bibimbap, and the third ordered the pork bone soup. The dishes were filling, hot and fresh. The bibimbap was perfect, but the pork bone soup could have used some sort of acidity or vinegar or spices to cut through some of the thick, fatty flavours. The ""fixins"", as we call them, were interesting and had some different flavours than what I'd tried before at other establishments, including tofu, kimchi, bean sprouts and potatoes. Our menu items were reasonably priced but I did notice several items outside of the soups and stews that seemed slightly steep.

61_j8ToXJ0O-4uHwacdkCA,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,VEFtI92ux6Q9PwMMrm0T-g,4,8,4,8,"A new contender has emerged in the desert dessert scene. 

346 Patisserie is a new business that just opened in Henderson last week. Some issues with printing and deliveries have resulted in a marked lack of business cards, photo decorations on the wall, and stickers for the windows, but they have their products and they have some comfy armchairs and chairs.

Amber greeted me and explained that she and her pastry chef husband, Arthur, both consider this a frozen patisserie. They offer coffee, macarons, cinnamon rolls, cookies, and basque cakes (the latter a new introduction to this area) alongside a case of up to 12 flavors of house-made gelato/sorbetto and an array of liquid nitrogen-prepared treats/toppings. I inquired about the roasted marshmallow, which she is apparently like a marshmallow ice cream on the inside but is still toasty on the outside (and she sounded almost a bit too eager to use a blowtorch). The frozen honey strand topping also sounded interesting in that it starts frozen and eventually warms up to a liquid consistency as you eat the gelato.

As I started tasting the gelato, she offered a grand tour of all of the available flavors. Naturally, I accepted. The lychee sorbet and balsamic were standouts. Greek yogurt, rice pudding, espresso caramel, and Valrhona 72% chocolate were also quite good. Raspberry gelato, pistachio, and milk chocolate sorbet were okay. Finally, I didn't really get as much flavor as I would have liked out of the Szechuan and the jalapeño grapefruit sorbet.

I settled on two scoops ($3.50 base, $1.75 additional scoop) to enjoy my favorites from the sampling. By the way, I do disagree with but accept the implied premise of the ice cream scoops being a portioning tool and not a cover-up of textural flaws. The spoon is definitely larger than you expect to use for gelato, so I deliberately slowed my pace by not filling the whole spoon (and I suggest the same for others). The balsamic had a strong but not overpowering flavor and it was quite smooth and creamy except for a few crunchy ice crystals that I tasted throughout the scoop. The lychee sorbet was also smooth and did not have any ice issues, and was also delicious. Neither flavor is very common at all, and I hope that they keep both in their rotation.

I decided on a four-star rating (with much love and hope for success). Yes, there were minor issues, but it's also not ""as good as it gets"" in Las Vegas. In another market, I'd completely sing the praises of 346 Patisserie, but there's a reigning gelato champion that they have yet to dethrone.

Regardless, I still highly recommend that locals stop by when possible to check out this business run by a Vegas-born couple. It's probably the best frozen dessert in the immediate area and it gives you opportunities to experience something different and delicious (except on Wednesdays, when they aren't open at all). You should know that they rotate in different flavors of pastries (fresh daily) and gelato (stocked for up to a week) every few days or so for variety. I'll definitely be back soon to try some of the items that I forewent on my first visit.

(QUICK UPDATE 2/10/15: Some decor is up now. Hazelnut gelato and blackberry-sorta-gelato-but-made-like-a-sorbet were both delicious. The shattered chocolate mousse [$2] was worth the experience, in which Amber pours liquid nitrogen into a bowl, extrudes mousse into it, and breaks it into smaller solid pieces. It's also a nice way to get chocolate that doesn't take too long to melt onto your frozen dessert.)

(QUICK UPDATE 3/2/15: Was in and out in a hurry, or as much of a hurry as I could muster with two customers gabbing it up in front of me, but did notice that the menu now discloses that ice cream is served alongside gelato and sorbet. Will have to investigate further. Earl grey sorbet was fantastically flavorful, lemon berry was a great rendition with interesting frozen raspberry bits, and Madagascar vanilla bean was full in vanilla flavor but actually too sweet even for my sweet tooth. Sorbets both fell victim to textural inconsistency, i.e. icy chunks.

(QUICK UPDATE 3/9/15: We'll see how many more of these small notes I can add. Cinnamon pecan streusel, described as a gelato base but spun like ice cream, had fantastic flavor and crunch. Basil & sweet cream was nice but a little too sweet for me, and Szechuan milk chocolate was enigmatic enough for an order but not something that I truly understood by the end.)

(3/17/15: Did the streusel again. Also got a sorbet of passion fruit and apricot, which was largely the former but with a subtle flavor of the latter, and a gelato-based / sorbet-spun Bing cherry that grew on me as I ate it. No textural issues.)",2015-02-03 03:27:40

My friends have hookahs so I can smoke it their houses. All in all, everyone I basically know has one and we always smoke it together whether just to chill or when we have a pahteeeee. 

I started coming to Paymon's years ago. The hookahs were always real good and didn't taste burnt. The guys would come around to make sure the hookah was still hitting well and constantly replaced the coals. The happy hour all day Tuesday was the best with half off hookahs and lots of drinks to choose from.

Nowadays, I hardly ever go here, because the hookahs are always burnt and die really fast. The service is lacking now - I literally have to wave my hands in the air and do a little dance to get someone's attention. The drink refills dont come fast anymore so I'm always contemplating if I should just order two drinks instead of one. 

I used to like the other location on Maryland Pkway better, but I always came here due to distance. The other location is just the same now - the hookahs arent's as great. I'd advise you to just smoke at home where you'd get the best service haha",2015-01-06 01:45:16

The New Yorker had a bit too much sauce and not enough cheese. The pepperoni, although tasting good, is the kind that curls up when it's cooked, a sign of a cheap product. The Detroit was good. Nothing special though. My daughter and son are allergic to cheese so we got them a pie with just sauce, pepperoni, and bacon. According to my daughter it was the best cheese-less pizza she has ever had. 
The atmosphere was questionable. It was a Saturday night around 8 when we got there. It was crowded which is a good sign. Lots of TVs  that had the college games on. My big complaint was the music. It was bumping so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other without having to scream across the table. Not cool. It was like night club loud. Then around 9 o'clock, they turned the game off and put music videos on. Music was still just as loud. That was a big let down. 
Overall, it's a good place to try out. The pizza is WAY overpriced for the product which is average at best, but given the location, it's about exploiting the tourists. They have a carry out counter up front to get slices at, which is a nice idea.",2016-09-07 02:49:39

Here is the thing. The food was ok. But most dishes didn't blow me away. The bread to start, very nice. My french onion soup... fantastic. My dining partner's salad? Lacklustre. My porkchops? Very juicy. Salty, but juicy. My partner's duck cabbage balls. Sorta not that good. Which is disappointing. We had heard a lot about them, but some bites were overpoweringly orange flavoured, while others bites didn't have much flavour at all. We didn't finish them.

So half of the meal was pretty good. Half wasn't so good. The service I should mention, was fantastic.

Nando's chicken is either good or excellent, depending on your preferences. Some of my friends love it and swear by it. I don't, but I still think it's 1000x better than swiss chalet.

If you are craving chicken, then come here and order chicken. If you order only chicken, you will be satisfied. Don't forget to add sauce. It's an essential part of the experience.

However, there isn't much else to offer. The sides are expensive and underwhelming.

Furthermore, the restaurant is sometimes filled with tables of dirty plates. Plus, you are basically serving yourself.

We went and it looked like a standard sports bar--not the kind of place I'd usually go to, but it was late and our options were limited.

We sat down in a dimly lit booth and looked skeptically at the menu. We decided to go with the Fried Pickles, the Fingers and Fries, and the Buffalo Chicken Burger. I expected standard greasy bar food, but Holy Jesus, it was AMAZING! The fried pickles are huge and the batter is wonderful. I'll eat 3 of them (they come in orders of 6) and start feeling full. The Fingers and Fries are also great, the chicken is some of the most tender I've ever had. You can very gently pull it apart with your fingers. Absolute bliss. I think they use corn flakes or something in the batter; it's very flavorful and thick. I usually get the Fingers and Fries with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.

The Macaroni and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken is also worth stopping in for. I always have an internal battle about whether I want that or the Fingers and Fries.

With a name like that, of course I need to see what's really going on.  Located off Eastern Avenue near LVAC and Gold's Gym, Protein House is another restaurant that offers healthy eats with a ton of protein. But to me, PH is not just another healthy meal stop. PH offers smoothies, breakfast, burgers, bowls, and salads. To order, you can either go straight to the counter and place your order off their menu. Or, you can take their order checklist, select your meal, and then hand it to the counter.  You also have the option to build your own burger, salad, and bowl.  Because this was my first visit, I decided on their biggest and baddest burger, their Muscle Builder Burger. This burger is 12 oz of ground Bison, onions, cheese, and Canadian bacon all served in a whole wheat bun. I had this medium well and swear that this is one of the best bison burgers I have ever had.  Most exotic meats like bison come gamey and with no taste. Here at PH, they found a way to create this burger with flavor.  By the way, trying to up your protein for the day? This burger has to be close to 70 grams of protein.  Yeah buddy!

As for the restaurant itself, I felt that it is a little small. But I love the ambiance, decor, and service. One things for sure, there's a ton of fit peeps eating here. I also got the opportunity to meet one of the owners, Andrew Bic. To be successful in any venture, it comes down to how you treat people. Andrew got this right. He took the time to chat it up, ask for suggestions, and gave a little insight of what PH is all about.  I didn't get the chance to meet the other owner, Larissa  Reis, but look forward to it on future visits.  If you're use to the taste that a 1000 calorie burger joint has to offer, then maybe Protein House is not for you.  If you're looking for some quality macros with high amounts of protein in a burger, then give Protein House a shot.  

Wish List:
-Ostrich:  With about the same amount of protein as steak and with calories/fat that rival chicken, I think ostrich should be on their menu.
-Nutritional Information:  For a place that specializes in selling healthy meals, I think this information is necessary.  Per the owner, this is in the works with a dietitian.

PS: Like all other healthy eating locations (i.e Whole Foods, Greens & Protein, etc), expect a higher price tag here.  But through their build-your-own, you can actually get a meal fairly cheap.",2013-06-27 07:27:49

Our server was note-perfect---personable, informative and on-the-ball without being over-attentive.

The place is fairly new so of course it is super clean.  They have options for booth or chair seating so it is handicap friendly.

They seem to have a full bar but I haven't tried many drinks since I do have to study after dinner.  On Wednesday to Sunday they have deals on domestic and imported beers.  For domestic beers it is $2.00 and import beer is $3.00.  On Fridays and Saturdays they have all house wines at $3.00.  Their martini and cocktails are buy 1 get 1 for 50% off on Fridays and Saturdays.  The bar area is limited seating and can only fit 10 people.

The sushi is very fresh and made right to order! As soon as we got our sushi, you could tell it was freshly made from the texture of the fish.  The spider roll was still warm as soon as we got it which was awesome and crispy!

Overall the sushi was deliciously fresh and quite affordable compared to some sushi restaurants.  The service is super fast when you come before rush hour so you don't have a long wait time!

Fresh mixed greens, fresh toppings. My only issue was the chicken. I could tell it was previously grilled, then let to cool, sliced and then reheated for my order. Bummer.

When I got there the receptionist let me know that the Dr. was running behind but it wasn't too long of a wait.

Oneida, the nurse, took us back to a room and got my kitty's vitals, history, and an explanation of what brought me in that day.  Dr. Anderson came in a little later and did a check and we discussed what the issues may be.  She worked up what she would suggest to make a diagnosis and Oneida went over it with me.  They took x-rays (because we both figured it might be asthma which my other cat has), did a senior blood panel, and the exam for a little over $400.  Dr. Anderson went over the x-rays with me but wanted the radiologist's review before a complete diagnosis.

The Doctor called me back when she said she would (a big plus for me since I had to chase my last vet for information) and unfortunately it looks like my kitty has asthma, which means that now both of my cats have it.

Interior has been completely changed since last time I was there.  It was late morning and pretty empty.  Waitress - not a very friendly person - came up and asked if I wanted anything to drink.  Yes and what I wanted.  Mind you, there is hardly anyone in this place.  She disappeared in the back and I didn't get my drink until about 12 minutes later. I saw it, my drink had been sitting there waiting to get served for quite a while. Pretty pathetic. That drink done, it just sat there empty for quite a while in plain view.  She went by to other tables but didn't even bother to ask if I needed something else, much less to take my order for food.  

After quite a while a manager comes up.  You need anything? Looked him square in the eye and told him you have terrible service here. I didn't ask for a manager, don't know why he came to my table, but he took responsibility for it right off and he went to bat.  Was there every 5 minutes.  I'll give him kudos for that and it made the experience not too shabby.  Still, that waitress........",2014-03-15 19:49:18

One of my coworkers was in the mood for Thai after a work function. Though I'm not super familiar with the cuisine (I've maybe had it 2x ever), I'm not a picky eater so I figured I'd give it a shot.

The vegetarian yellow curry dish was ABSOLUTELY amazing. The creaminess of the curry and coconut milk paired with the veggies and rice literally melted in my mouth. 

Service was wild fast for lunch time. As soon as our butts hit the chairs, we were served ice cold glasses of water along with menus. A few minutes later, we were served a side salad that came with our meal. Honestly, the salad couldn't be anything much more than bagged iceberg lettuce, but it had the most amazing peanut dressing on it. It wasn't hard to gobble up and I can see why they sell it by the bottle for customers to take home.

About 10-15 minutes later, our entrees were served. Super yummy food and great experience all around. Definitely excited to return!",2016-03-17 23:21:03

We came in and sat by the bar for happy hour and I was kind of worried it would be too hot since it was hot outside , but the bar area is shaded so it worked out fine. Even if you do sit by the patio by the walkway and street they have misters and umbrellas. 

I decided to have a white peach Sangria which is $4 on the happy hour menu it was so refreshing and perfect for the hot weather and presented very pretty. My mom had a virgin Italian Lemonade because she was scared to drive with a drink in her :). For food we decides to go with Crispy Eggplant Fries ( recommended by a friend on yelp Thanks Nieves ! ) crispy ravioli and Tomato Mozzerella Salad just to start. The eggplant fries were perfectly crispy and super yummy. The pomodoro sauce for both the ravioli and fries was so yummy. The raviolis lacked flavor in my opinion. The tomato Mozzerella salad was really fresh and the balsamic glaze was perfect. It could have had more basil and glaze but that's ok. I just asked for some more glaze ;). I'm glad we only ordered those three dishes because a few raviolis in and some fries later I was stuffed. 

All the servers were friendly and food and drinks came out fast. Despite how busy it was. I suggest coming early and seeing if there is a wait because it filled up fast for happy hour. I will definitely be coming back to try the regular menu as I'm lasagna lover and I'm out to find the best in vegas. That I'm yet to find maybe it's hiding here at Brio.

As another reviewer mentioned, I am not especially 'jazzed' to be writing a review for a chain like this.. but it is what it is. 

Had this never been a part of Town Square I would not ever have heard of it I don't believe. So having said that.. I had come in for dinner a few times. I am that guy when it comes to a non-belief in ""American Style Italian"" or whatever Brio claims to be.

As for the quality of the food.. it isn't bad.. just nothing spectacular. Lately My friends and I have been dropping in for Happy hour on Thursdays as they have a $5 'martini' menu along side their daily happy hour of $2.95 'Tuscan Tasters'' .. 

The thing is, they get so swamped with customers during happy hour, that the service gets seriously patchy. I'm totally down for someone hustling amongst the tables they are waiting on, just trying to do the job and make some descent money.. in fact I can appreciate it. It's the consistent mistakes on the bill, the negative attitude, especially fromt he bar staff, and the disregard for any style of customer service from the staff. There is constant conversation about everything but work, and in a very loud way. 

I honestly know that this is literally a step in some direction from a place like 'Chili's"" or 'Friday's"" but with the environment of a bit higher end restaurant that they are trying to create.. you would hope for more is all I am saying. 

In the end of it all, I would be back for the Happy Hour.. as it's good prices and descent nosh when you are shopping or heading to a movie.. but I think I will be looking for other options when I am next down at Town Square. Happy Eating!",2011-08-26 08:01:55

Mad Greens made me Mad!!   
It's a salad bar where the staff makes the salad for you. There was some pretty tasty options so I had gotten the Crazy Ivan salad and my two children ordered 2 create your own salads.

So they started off creating my daughters salad, I then paid for the whole 3 orders after they completed only one salad. The one employee who made it said for me to just go back to the beginning to finish the rest of the salads. By then a few customers had came in and my order got pushed behind theirs. I had to keep reminding them what I ordered. I was getting skipped around although I was there before everyone else and had paid before everyone else. This would of been unnecessary if they would of had a better organized system. The guy that finished my order was a completely different guy that started it. He had asked the other employees what happened to the ticket and all the other guy could say is I got busy. While the girl in front stood there waiting to get off work. Talk about annoying.

We met a friend from Toronto who was in town for 2 weeks for bridge tournaments and gaming.  This is one of the places he hits up every time he comes to Las Vegas.

We had reservations for 5:30--not needed as it turned out--but there were more people there than I had expected.  We were quickly seated, brought menus, and our drink order was delivered.  We then ordered and the server split the order into two checks as we requested.

My wife ordered the Chicken Cortez and Jack and I each ordered prime rib.  Each dinner comes with soup or salad and choice of starch.  I got potato leek and a baked potato.  I asked for my prime rib to be blue and the server said very rare to which I nodded.  We also ordered a side of scalloped corn with prosciutto to share.

Bread was brought to the table along with two plates of pastry piped butter.  There didn't appear to be any difference in taste among the three.  The lavash was not as flavorful as some I've had and the pretzel roll was somewhat dry.  It seemed like the bread was a little on the old side.

The soup was good.  One of the bus people came to grind fresh pepper which was a bonus.  There was a good separation between courses so we could chat and catch up with what our friend had been up to since we saw him a few months before.

Our mains arrived.  The prime rib was red as I wanted and Jack's was a medium rare which was what he ordered.  Andrea's chicken was, well chicken with cheese melted on top and some avocado.  My baked potato was large but needed a bit more baking time.  I got the normal accoutrements--butter and sour cream and the waiter left extra horseradish if we wanted to charge up the creamy horseradish served with the prime rib.  All three of us liked our meals.  The scalloped corn was very good.  Creamed corn with lots of cheese baked until the light bread crumb top was browned.

For dessert, I got carrot cake which was quite good.

The Cortez Room is OK.   Service was OK if not a bit nonchalant.  The price was good because the casino had mailed a BOGO to my wife and we used points to pay the balance.  For the price of gratuity, we had dinner for two.  The A-OK rating is apropos  because while nothing stands out about the whole evening, the food was OK and done the way we wanted.",2014-07-30 18:26:36

The food is ok, just ok.  Thus the one less star . . . it's bar food, though they try to make it better than bar food.  Though we only tried breakfast items, so I can't judge too hard.  :) 

Beer in a bucket was the special -- $20 for 5 bottles domestic of your choice.  Not too bad . . . don't order draft, those are something like $8/ea and after a bucket's worth, that gets a little pricey for football watching. 

They do have some minimums though -- if you come during the early games and stay for the late games, there is a $40 food and beverage minimum that needs to be met for the afternoon.  We had no problems making this with the price of the food/drinks, but just a good thing to know. 

P.S. when you've had enough of the games, there is a bull you can try out too. . . . if not for you, watching is always very entertaining!  We did laugh our a**es off at a woman who thought the had it down, but didn't.  Ouch!",2012-11-07 19:04:13

On the tables are multiple plates as entrees are to be ""family style.""  I ordered the cashew chicken and was thankful we weren't the sharing type or else I might have only had a couple of bites!  The portions do seem small, especially for the price.  I guess you pay for the ambiance.

The taste overall was OK.  There were hardly any cashews (my fiancé had the same problem with his kung pao chicken and peanuts) and the chicken's texture left a lot to be desired.  The vegetables were good at least.  They pile on the onions which I love but my fiancé didn't since he's not obsessed with onions like I am, so be wary if you're anti-onion!

My water glass was always full, so one star for that alone.  -:P  I don't drink water because I'm cheap, I drink water because it's healthy and I love the taste more than any soda.  So having constant water is a HUGE plus for me.

Such was the theme of the night.  Trying to get good service here is nearly impossible.  Servers would walk past our table without even a second glance causing us to have to scream and flag them down.  Ugh.

We stopped in for some drinks and dessert, after an early dinner elsewhere in NoSco.  After our experience I'm not sure that I would return for lunch or dinner....and it makes me wary to try North.  The mini cannolis had a very overpowering lemon flavor.  Cannolis are my favorite dessert....in my life I have had about 50 billion of them.  My wedding cake had cannoli filling.  I have never had lemon flavored cannoli before. It was half gross and mostly disgusting.  The chocolate and hazelnut ""cake"" was really a brownie in the shape of pie with a lot of whipped cream and some hazelnuts on top.  Not quite what I was expecting.

The drink selection is pedestrian as is the beer and wine selection.  Then there is the water.  Holy cow I felt like I was drinking a glass of the chemicals my parents put in their pool.  It smelled awful and tasted absolutely disgusting.  I forced it down but oh man, they need to adjust their water filter.

Its all open seating according to the server we ran into on the way in.  Although when we made the move to a newly open table we were told it was reserved.  What is it? Open or reserved?  Once we got a spot on the patio we were treated to parents letting their children run through the fountain at Kierland at 10pm.  I don't know...when I was 7 years old I wasn't running around crazy at 10pm at night.  (And I was most certainly not in Bar North after that having dessert and whatever.  Who brings a kid into a bar at 10pm on a Saturday night?!) 

Then came time for the check.  We waited so long for our server to pick it up that I actually had to go to the bar and pay for it there. 

All in all I was completely unimpressed.  Given the bizarre cannoli and the mediocre ""cake"" combined with the terrible service I'm not sure I would go back.....the only reason its getting the third star is because the pickings in North Scottsdale are slim.",2008-05-11 06:30:36

Atlas is a hidden gem within a strip mall complex, part of AZ Wine Store. I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant and the fact that it is limited to about 10 tables.  It is fun to be able to bring in our favorite wines to enjoy with the meal and you can always go buy a bottle once you decide on your meal. The service is a little to slow though, which is why I took off half a star.  Granted I don't like to be rushed, but the time it took from being seated to actually taking our order seemed like a bit much.

The antique stores of yesteryear were antique stores, with some collectables.  This place was mostly just an old second hand store, few antiques, few collectables and, plenty of modern junk.  My thoughts strolling through this place - well, it's better here than in a landfill or a dumpsite.  An ""antique store"" should not have an overwhelming majority of junk, modern junk and just plain junk. I guess they have no requirements. Someone leases a space and all they care about is what money the stuff brings in.  I guess if you want something cheap, you could try here but, I won't go again.  It totally lacked in antique merchandise and that was what I was there for.  I gave it two stars instead of one because, at other times, perhaps, they get antiques. I would hope.

The weather was perfect and the animals knew it! They were all out and showing off, it was so cute.  The elephants!! Oh my goodness, they were a hoot. 

The actual place itself was nice, clean and pretty well structured that you followed a path to go around. They have awesome exhibits like feed the giraffe or go into the bird cages to feed them. The giraffe experience was in high demand so they ran out of leaves but maybe next time.

I know I'm such piggy lol... anyways the reason I gave this location a 3 stars are as followed: 1 star for nice decor and friendly staff, 2nd star is for variety of food offered and I had yet to find out their dessert menu.... and 3rd star goes the mood and setting of the place(ambiance) as the place seems to be trendy and all age are welcome as I saw there was baby, young adults n some more mature client... what they missed is that this place's food are lacking sauce.... for example the Karaage rice was really dry on the rice as there's no sauce for it. The udon or ramen it's quite bland so not enough flavour.... Their appetizer aren't bad, I enjoyed the cheese takoyaki. Another miss is that they did not offer credit card service as this impact on me a lot as I normally don't carry cash. I understand credit card take more charges to their store to use the transaction than a debit card but hey, allowing credit card might just increase ur targeted audience. Just saying lol...Overall, I will still go back to this location since I haven't try their dessert yet...  however I wouldn't order anything with rice or udon or ramen, I would prefer to order a bunch of snacks( but they aren't cheap either).

A few notches above Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, and even Maggiano's. While I don't usually like to eat at ""chain"" restaurants, this has been my saving grace for informal lunch meetings, dinners with unadventurous eaters, and satisfying a group of people with various dietary preferences (low carb, low fat, gluten free, vegetarian).  

I highly recommend making reservations for the evening when you have a party of 6 or more, but for lunch I usually have to wait 10-15 minutes.  They give you a pager and you have the freedom to occupy your wait time with shopping in nearby stores.  Once inside, the setting is a pleasing ""Tuscan"" style and the energy/noise level is bustling, but usually I like to sit outside because I usually have my nicely behaved dogs with me. They require I tie my dogs to the outside of the restaurant fence and sit at a nearby table,but I have seen dogs sit on their laps with their owners.  This discrepancy kind of bothers me, because my dogs are well behaved, but like to sit at our feet...many don't notice them but if they do it is because they are cute and well behaved.

Usually I order a flatbread and bruschetta for the table as an appetizer. I usually order the steak salad for lunch, which is phenominal, especially since most places end up making the meat well done or not using a tender meat. The pasta is decent here, at least I never heard my guests complain and usually give raves.   The portions are generous for the price, and usually lasting me two meals.  I have had the steak and vegetables for dinner, which was prepared and cooked nicely. Service is always polite, but sometimes a little slow when it is busy. Again the food is no culinary feat, but it is solid and unoffensive.  While not unique, no one is going to complain and your guests will definitely think it is solid food and come out satisfied and full.  

Again a great place where everyone can find something they like and enjoy themselves in a casual, relaxed Italian style.

One other comment, I think they have done a great job with their wine menu. By the glass, plenty of unique and affordable wines covering a range of varietals both whites and reds, but also many familiar, easy drinking wines.  Further, many ""gem"" bottle that are well priced...about 175% markup rather than the 200%+ markups...that can mean atleast $10 -20 savings per bottle.",2012-10-12 04:04:45

The CrackBerry event included an alcohol/beer so I had one of their beers. I'm not a real beer drinker which is why I've never gone to this place. I will have the occasional beer if I'm with friends and they order a beer or if I go to a pub or if I'm offered a drink while playing in the casino. The event also included some small appetizers (finger food).

Since I had just finished work before showing up to the event, I decided to order something to eat. I decided to go with the poutine. I found the portion size of the poutine to be small for the price (it was roughly the size of a McDonald's poutine) and with my bacon add-on was $10+taxes+tip. Between the 2 beers that I had and the poutine (along with the free small finger food appetizers), I felt satisfied (although not stuffed).

I found it to be very loud in the place and could hardly hear myself talk or hear my colleague talk. I didn't have any problems with the service and the staff serving the beer as well as the server who took my poutine order and the person who brought me my order were all friendly.

It was super salty and had mushrooms? I'm all for reinventing the wheel but come on why not just call it mushroom bisque? It was probably the worst soup I've ever had. I was excited to try the crab app but it was bland and I had a sinking suspicion that food poising may result and I didn't touch it. The chicken wings were the best thing we ordered because the cheese platter was practically inedible. I looked at the menu online before we went and the menu they had in the restaurant was completely different. I asked what was up and they said they had a new chief. I suspect this is the cause very obvious change in opinions over the past few months.

I come on a regular basis, once a week at times.  Their food has been inconsistent and drives me crazy the most is how the food comes at different times, especially drinks. I know they get popular and busy and maybe their kitchen staff and baristas just can't handle the flow, but I'm not even talking about during peak times or when it's super packed. 

Numerous times my friends and I would place the order together and one of us would get food way later than the rest. It makes it awkward for the rest of the party to wait for one person or ..etc. And many times the drinks would be worst than food. One time, I literally about to finish my food before my latte showed up, and NOT because they forgot to make it.  It doesn't take that long to make a drink!  The speed how things come out is just getting annoying especially you're there with some friends.  And this annoyance has become more like a regular thing there.. :(

Although I still like their food at times, one time my soft scramble was the hardest and toughest egg I've ever eaten, definitely not SOFT,  I wish they could improve how the food comes out, especially in one party.

And please, can we hang or make a sign to help people where to order, where the menu is and how to line up?

Buffet style menu and then drinks were ordered and paid individually. BJ's is very accommodating with their catering options and if they can't, they'll try to take care of ya the best way they can.

BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family. It's low lighting may put you to sleep (as it does for me sometimes) but it assists when you're trying to have a little more intimate/private mean/drink as it makes it harder to see those around you lol.",2014-03-02 05:44:16

It doesn't get much in Vegas for gourmet pizza though; always fresh and super creative pizza styles!
I have tried many of their pizza's but currently my fav is the Vedura veggie pizza, something about it is incredible. Another good one that is award winning- Cali Itlia, super unique pizza and tasty. If you really want to step outside the box- try the one with quail eggs, it is actually pretty good. 

Our issue: We put in an order for two pizzas (at the bar on a Tuesday non-busy evening) and 15-20mins later the bartender walks up and says ""Oh guys, I totally forgot to put your order in..what were the pizza's again?"" Ok..these things happen, not a huge deal as long as you do something to make up for it..I don't know- free bread or salad or a discount or something? NOTHING...I was pretty surprised by the fact that she did nothing to make up for the situation and obviously this had to reflect in her tip (we are very good tippers). 
Besides that, we always get service at Pizza Rock but typically go to the GVR location. 
Another example of the fact that service usually gets better further away from the strip and/or touristy areas..

UPDATE- 8/03/2016 
Went into this Pizza Rock location last night. Enjoyed three of our fave pizzas and some beer, and with the same bartender but this time she was great (: no complaints at all. I am always craving Pizza Rock and encouraging newbies to try it out.

The first few times I went, an old Asian woman--the owner--followed me around. I won't lie to you guys--I was kind of terrified. Now that I'm there every couple of weeks, I've earned her trust. Hopefully.

Yue-Wah is similar to Asian Midway up on West Washington, but it's 5x the size and has way, way more variety. Their Indian aisle is spectacular--a pound of curry for $3?! I mean--DAMN! What a bargain. 16oz of tahini (amazing for hummus and falafe) only runs $4-5. Fenugreek, coriander, anise, asafoetida--it's all readily available and wonderfully inexpensive. The variety of Asian foods and spices is simply amazing.

If there's one place to go for spices in Madison, this is it. If there's one place to go for ethnic foods like curry pastes, coconut milk, Asian vegetables (they have a great--and cheap! produce section, too)...this is it. They even have red bean and mango ice cream!

Don't be put off by the location or the way it looks inside--this place is simply awesome. When I make curries (Thai or Indian) or any sort of Chinese food, this is my first stop for ingredients. You must go there. Now.",2012-11-13 15:02:25

I purchased a 2005 F-150 and traded in a MINI Cooper S that I had been trying to sell for some time now. The BEST offer I recieved on the car private party or dealer was $16,500 in over a month. 

Moving along, they were willing to sell me their truck for $10,000... paying off the MINI and giving me the truck. This would make the price of the truck about $6670 - $400 doc fee - $300 title/license - and no tax since the trade was a higher value. I owed 18800 on my MINI so the ACTUAL value they gave me for the mini was 16200. If that confused you, they gave me a steal of a deal. There is NO WAY they are going to unload that car for any profit, and their truck was $2000 UNDER wholesale book. I just looked at Manheim auctions and I got it for less than a dealer can buy it at an auction. In other words I came out so victorious I feel like a champion.

So all that aside. I get a call today from Sam Cumbo, the used car manager, stating to make the $10,000 cashiers check to him. Sounds fishy to me so I called the finance department and asked them to look into it. I got a call 5 minutes later from the Controller at the dealer saying in no way is a check EVER made out to the salesman/manager/anyone except the name of the business. 

We are working on trying to figure out what he pulled, but I think the dude gave me an unbeatable deal on a truck that had not been put on the lot yet, with hopes that he can manipulate the system and walk away with $10,000 leaving me with a car that isn't paid off, the dealership without a truck, and a whole lotta fraud.

Everyone else in the dealership was extremely cool/helpful/nice. I was lucky to have got the deal I did and be smart enough to not write a check to the guy. Most people would have, and would be in some serious crap.

Plus we got dessert!  I really enjoyed everything. I think my least favourite was the korma but I know I've had a lamb dish I was crazy about before but can't remember which!  I usually order vegetarian when I'm there so remembering a lamb dish eluded me.
I find their food has been consistently good over the years. And I've done take out, dinner dining in and lunch buffet.
I never thought their prices were cheap but I have always found the quality there and I'd much rather quality over quantity and have been disappointed with other places that just lowered the quality.

Located south of the City, a neighborhood spot serving Northeast Ohioans since 1937, it was straight off the plane that the GPS was pointed to Jack Frost Donuts, a recent rebrand of the ""every batch from scratch"" destination showing signs of artisan aspirations with prices that likely would not have been accepted just a few years prior.

Found at 4960 Pearl Road, a busy intersection seemingly only trafficked for fried dough at 7:00 o'clock on a Saturday morning, Jack Frost boasts featuring over 200 varieties of Donuts depending on date and season, arrival bringing patrons face-to-face with at least forty on this particular morning, a friendly woman attending her first day on the job nonetheless offering excellent customer service.

Known for styles including fritters, cake and yeasted, many piled high with housemade frostings and all ingredients both sweet and savory, it was in letting three families place orders that the options were evaluated, a half-dozen plus one truly enormous fritter costing $16 after tax and tip, everything boxed to go as Jack Frost does not offer any seating.

Trending smaller than many with the rings, four cake and two raised comprising the order, those fancying tradition will be happy to know that Jack Frost's Blueberry is not the traditional mix-base but rather stuffed full of natural flavors, the German Chocolate standing tall and proud with bittersweet cocoa note finding its foil in subtly sweet whip and a layer of Coconut Praline Frosting.

Rare to order Maple Bacon, but told by an elderly gentleman that this one was 'really good,' first tastes of the yeasted ring yielded a wispy crumb with a surprisingly natural sweetness amidst the porky sapor, a Salty Caramel follow-up unfortunately a bit more cloying with any 'saltiness' lost amidst all the sugar.

More than a bit impressed by the moisture and richness of Red Velvet, the Cream Cheese Frosting just sour enough to know it isn't Buttercream, S'mores proved a mixed experience as the Donut itself was good while Marshmallows were unfortunately a bit stale, the nearly 2lb Fritter saved for last truly one of those ""you need to see it to believe it"" creations with a grease-free Monkey Bread-like base swirled with Cinnamon and topped to order with a ladle of Pie-filling style apples.",2016-10-28 15:09:53

I politely brought this to the attention of one of the staff when I returned another time, and I got defensive, borderline hostile attitude, and no offer to make anything right - this after being a loyal (2 X/month for 2 years) customer, bringing in an armful of suits and shirts each time.
The next batch of clean shirts smelled stinky in my car on the drive home.  I pretended I didn't notice it, and wore one to work the next morning, where a coworker expressed her concern that I had B.O.  We attacked my shirt with some Febreze somebody fortunately had in the office.  When I got home that eve from the office, I noticed that the stink from my ""clean"" shirts had escaped my clothes closet and was filling the bedroom.  So I threw the shirts in my laundry (guess what - they don't stink anymore) and today I'll iron them myself, pending finding a new dry cleaner.  
Be sure to check out LaMar's Donuts in the same shopping center - they're real good, some of the best I've ever had.",2011-01-17 19:36:01

We wanted something quick and easy that provided Veg options (thanks to Steve Wynn, we don't need to worry about that anymore). The deli is close both to the theaters, as well as the sports book. The line moved pretty quickly, but the food took forever. I am glad that we had about 1.5 hours before the show started when we arrived. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food. 

The prices are substantial, as it is a deli inside the Wynn. However, I found the food to be very good. I had the matzo ball soup (a bargain for around $6.50). It was a very large bowl of very flavorful soup with very nice size matzo balls. I was very impressed. It was also quite filling, more so than my wife's veggie sandwich and fries. 
My parent's and brother were satisfied with their food...other than the prices, as my parents are a bit thrifty.

I'm slowly trying to convince them there are so many places that are worth a try... Work in progress. Anyway... the only reason I've decided to write a review is because our server was excellent. Truly excellent.

I can't for the life of me remember her name but will go out of my way to call or stop by next week because she was that impressive and deserves recognition. 

Service = 1star - the server deserves 10 stars but I refuse to contribute to the overall rating with that.

Rolls = 1 star - fresh and fantastic!

Sirloin steak. Sad and pathetic tiny piece of meat. AKA McSteak. Actually, that would probably be a better value.

Grilled chicken. Dry. Killed repeatedly and if that wasn't enough, drowned in sauce in a sad attempt to make it better. Did not work.

Catfish. Mother in Law loves it. I've never tried it so I remain neutral.

The location is a bit odd - it's down Queen Street East, a bit off the main Yonge area. The hostesses were very friendly, and checked our coats for us. I really like that they take your coats, so you don't have to deal with all of the bundles at your seat. We made a reservation and were brought to our seat right away. I was a bit surprised that the restaurant seemed quite empty for a Friday night. There were still enough people to make for a good atmosphere though. 

The restaurant itself is gorgeous - it reminds me of a restaurant you would find in Vegas, and not a traditional BBQ restaurant. The ceiling are high, and the decor is dark. Our server was pretty nice, but could have been a bit more attentive while we were eating. 

To drink, my husband got a beer and I wanted to try a cocktail, so I got the 'Strait' Outta Hudson ($13), which I would recommend. It had blood orange in it, which was unique, and a bit sour/sweet. I thought it was decent value for the drink. 

To eat, we got the pit master platter ($30 per person), which comes with brisket, fried chicken, ribs and fries with chipotle mayo. There are also pickles and two types of BBQ sauces. Everything was delicious, and thinking about it is making me drool! The brisket was crispy on the outside, but was falling apart because it was so tender. I really liked the ribs too, but it was probably my least favourite out of the three options. The ribs were meaty and not overly fatty. The fried chicken really stole the show though. There was no bone in it, which I appreciate, because I feel like you get more meat! There was a good batter to meat ratio, it was so juicy and the batter was nicely seasoned. To die for! The fries were also quite good - fresh, hot and crispy! My one complaint with this is that the sauces were barely filled in the ramekins. We barely got any chipotle mayo for the fries and the two BBQ sauces. Because our server had not come over, I asked another server for more of the two sauces, and he only brought us one. We finished it off so fast. It really annoys me when there is delicious sauce to go with something, and they don't bring you any! There was so much meat on this platter and not nearly enough sauce. Next time, I'll ask for like five of each to start off with. 

We also got the korean fried cauliflower ($9), which was really excellent. You can't go without having that! I would love to say we had room for dessert, but that wasn't happening. I basically had to be rolled out.

In going back and forth with friends trying to decide where to go, you quickly find that either everyone's either trying to get you to go to places near them, or are pushing a place that no one else has heard of.  Typically the point that I cave in and give up is when I say ""FINE!  Let's meet at the E&C!""

Just off of University and King, no matter where you are in the city, the location meets the criteria of either convenient to all, or is probably central to all the homes or offices your friends are leaving.  It's also a place that everyone's heard of, so there's no mistaking that.  There is the chance that someone may ask about the other Elephant & Castle (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/elephant-and-castle-toronto) but really, why go there?  This is by far and away more convenient, and certainly the more pubby of the two.

It does look like a pub with shelves of old books, a patterned carpet typical of most British-style pubs, and a passable run of taps.  The menu is of decent size and shape, if not slightly pricey for the food that is served.  Portions are adequate, but the food itself is nothing to celebrate.  It's passable to adequate.  That said, if you are in a rush, the kitchen is fast.  Whether you actually want bland food fast is up to you.  At the very least, you'll have all your friends together in one place.

Now that they've got it, the back area of pool tables and the back satellite bar they call ""The Office"" (""Where you going?""  ""The Office.""  Geddit?) is actually a nice hybrid between the front bar and restaurant and the second E&C location.

We had the soup pork buns as an appetizer.  I liked them, but would venture on to something else next time.  The boyfriend had the short ribs with spicy sauce.  I sampled one and gave it the seal of approval.  It was crispy and flavorful and just spicy enough.  He did say that a couple of pieces were spicier than the one I tasted, which he appreciated.   I got the chicken basil.  I actually didn't love this dish, but it was mostly because it was a poor impulse choice given what I was actually in the mood for.  It was a well done dish, though, so I can't blame it for my being unsatisfied.  

My main criticism would be that there are actually too many options.  The menu was 5 or 6 pages long, with just basic descriptions.  I had trouble sifting through it all and I definitely had trouble picturing what some of the options would look like.  Some of that is my own ignorance of the cuisine, but I appreciate a restaurant that attempts to help a girl out.  I don't need a picture menu or anything, but a website with some photos or expanded descriptions would have been helpful.

I was so astonished by how bad the service was here, not to mention the RISK that I made a yelp account just to warn others. Coming from a native New Mexican, I will echo what so many people here giving the one star reviews have said (and if you read on you'll see why), the service... 

I came here for mine and my girlfriend's one year anniversary. It was suppose to be a special day. We are both originally from New Mexico so the idea of being able to order the food we grew up on sounded great. We were very excited to go here, but that was very short lived... As I walked up there were two girls and one very young boy at the front counter. I saw they had a very nice patio and asked if we could sit out there. They said that it might be a problem, that a party would be coming and when they got there we would be asked to ""leave."" I found her choice of words very odd and the other girl tried to explain we would have to relocate. I looked at my girlfriend, already with a bad feeling about the place and asked if she wanted to stay, which she did. 

Now this is when things get important, remember this: I said ""I guess we'll eat inside."" and the girl replied ""Okay, I'll seat you in the bar then."" I looked at her crooked and said ""Um, no...? Is there a table in the dining room? We don't drink or smoke..."" I looked around and the dining room had plenty of tables, not even half full. The girl sighed and grabbed some menus with haste, then took us to the very back, in a gloomy little corner and tossed them down on the table. I was amazed and almost walked out but my girlfriend was still excited some how.

I will say, our waiter was very friendly but he was a terrible waiter. It took him well over 10 minutes after my drink ran and me having to actually get up (flagging him down didn't work) and ask him for a refill. About 5 minutes after that, I finally got one, the thing is... There was something INCREDIBLY strange tasting about my drink. It was non alcoholic, a simple glass of water that tasted like swamp water. I gagged and spit it out. The smell of it was FOUL. 

To add on, the food was VERY mediocre for being in the $10-$15 a plate range. It was very bland and the spices weren't done quite right in my opinion. Again, coming from some one who grew up in New Mexico. 

The entire time, the manager kept giving us these odd looks, staring us down and making us feel uncomfortable. I thought it was all over, but it wasn't...

I had a family member pass through Phoenix and decide to eat here, they told me their story a bit too late however, I should have checked with them first knowing they've been through here. He told me that when he went here on a trip, they insisted on sitting him at the bar because he was alone and were very rude about it. They would not sit him at a table, even though he didn't want alcohol, only food.

The place is very poorly managed and that makes me very sad. I wish my great home state was better represented here in the Valley of the Sun. 

PLEASE BE WARNED, before eating here. You will be treated terribly and who knows what they might do to your food (or drink) if they don't like you.",2014-03-15 05:23:56

The udon noodles were firm but not too soft or chewy.  There were shrimps, mussels, clams, and calamari in the bowl.  The shrimp was just slightly overcooked for my taste but it was still decent.

We asked for a cup with a lid and got one, and had to ask for a spoon for her macaroni but never got one, so we went and got one from the counter. Meals came all at different times. My egg on the Croque Madame was undercooked, meaning the white of the egg was clear, so I brought it back up for a little more cooking. They said sorry and took it back, and I let the expediter/runner know what happened and she said the french undercook all their food, ""but thanks for letting us know"". Hahahaha. The Nicoise salad is not grilled tuna, it's tuna salad. We had to ask for the french fries we ordered. We never got the fruit that was supposed to come with the kids meal. The waitress said the macaroni is cooked from scratch but it's Annies shells n cheese (I don't care but it made me laugh). The croque madame is over seasoned (thyme?) so you can't taste the ham, egg or cheese.
My friend found some crayons and coloring pages to occupy my daughter. I felt that my friend was more helpful than the actual waitress.

We ordered their prix-fixe menu that came with lobster, fish, fried shrimp balls, fried rice, e-fu noodles, scallops & squids and shark fin soup to share. Food tasted okay and all 11 of us got enough portion to share. Until my husband found a dead fly that was cooked in the food that we were having. And sucks for him, he was the unlucky one who got served a dead fly while the rest of us cleared our plate unknowingly. We told our hostess about it, she immediately apologized and took the dish away. 10 mins later, the manager came to check up on us to see if everything was okay, so we told him it was all good until we found a dead fly on our plate. Surprisingly for us, his first reaction was to crack a lame joke on my husband for being a sweetheart so sweet that the fly was attracted to him. What kind of idiot would think it's okay to make fun of someone who almost ate a fly?

Obviously, we weren't impressed by his sense of humour, we felt grossed out. And his unseemly laughs certainly didn't make us feel any better. Not to mention that he didn't even acknowledged the fact that this shouldn't even happen in the first place but he also tried to rub it off with his laughs as if nothing had happened. 

We were so put off by his attitude towards the situation that we became speechless. And that was when he finally decided to apologize for this. Yet, he put no effort to compensate the customer or to ensure that it won't happen again. And this came from the person who was supposed to manage the restaurant? No Thanks.

I paid the small(ish) fee to upgrade to the VIP club (thanks, Sean!) and it was well worth it.  I believe the more crowded you expect a show to be, the more value you'll derive from the upgrade.

Great view from the VIP area, exclusive bar with friendly and unharried staff, separate restrooms, and best of all, not being crammed or jostled like one would experience in the general admission area.  Front row seating is also negotiable, but reserved.

Since this addressed my only hold-back from an initial five star review, I am awarding the fifth star.  Even with the VIP upgrade, it was still more affordable that the typical concert out at Verzion Wireless Amphitheatre, and more more conveneintly located (at least to me).

I also like their special. They have $5.50 pizza on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (take-out only). That's a pretty darn good deal for unlimited toppings. But be forewarned: the quality on those days tends to be lower than what you get during the rest of the week. But even the regular price is pretty decent: 2 large for $16. Their large pizza is also not as large as many other places (I think it is 12"" rather than 14"" like Papa Johns).

Update: I measured the pizza--don't judge me, I can't help it. I'm an engineer--and it came to 11.5"". That would be fine, except that the day we got it, they gave us about 1.5"" of crust, meaning that the area with toppings on it was actually the size of a small pizza. Ooops.

However, I can't name any other place that serves $5 pizza with toppings. Plus they have a wide array of toppings and sauces and some pretty unique pizza ideas. It is definitely worth my 5-spot and is a stand-by for Tuesday night pizza.

I'll give this to Chino, it's an original idea. Mexican, Jamaican and Chinese fusion, but it's not executed well at all. Like someone said before, the whole ordering process, especially for first timers needs to somehow be streamlined, it's ridiculous, like they need a help desk or something. But part of the initiation is you get to taste test before ordering, so I guess that is good.  The location is waaaay back in this weird building, and weird weird, not weird good. There is also way too much space inside, gives it a very cafeteria feel. 

Now to the food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good, as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice. My lunch on the other hand was a disaster, so I ate half of his. I ordered the emerald chicken, then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla, I chose the dilla. Well, that was the wrong choice. See the pic I posted, my quesidilla was glistening!! We could not eat it. It was in a pool of grease. Gross.

So Chino, I have some ideas for ya. Get it together, this is a cool concept, but learn how to make your food consistently good, maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying? Hire a professional to look at your menu and give suggestions for prep. Second, the ordering system needs attention, it's confusing.

I got a Caesar salad and  we decided to get 2 individual pizzas, Tim went for the BBQ chicken and I made my own gluten free personal pizza with artichokes, mushrooms, feta and bacon.  They were pretty stingy with the bacon and feta and the sauce was super heavy and sweet, I wiped a bunch of it off.  The salad was not the best,  the dressing was lumpy and oily and was on the side,  there was maybe 2 or 3 shreds of cheese on the salad, not worth the $6 at all.  

The gluten free pizza crust was decent (California Pizza Kitchen has the best in CLT), it was slightly sweet as most GF pizzas are and it didn't help that the sauce was also sweet.  It held together surprisingly well and had more dough to it than most, it wasn't a crispy flatbread.  

Hours after dinner Tim said he still had the tang of the BBQ sauce on his tongue, I didn't try it but he said it was just too much vinegar for a pizza sauce.

When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!

I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino.

I first went when it was new and they were still working on their skills. But the last few visits have been nothing short of spectacular. 

First, I am a huge fan of craft cocktails (and craft beers and wines, I just like yummy liquids,  ok?) If you come here,  keep in mind true craft cocktails made with fresh squeezed juices and muddled herbs take time to prepare properly.  Come here and enjoy the ambiance and your friends. Slow down. No need to be in a hurry. 

My personal favorite is the Mexican Monk made with tequila,  lime,  egg white, and something spicy. There's also an Herbal Smash that's good for those people who like mojitos but want something new. And theres a drink named after what sounds like could be a greek god that is posted on the chalkboard (cannot remember the name).  Its made with OJ and ginger and they made mine with bourbon, because, well bourbon.

If you can't find something you like in the large book of cocktails,  ask your mixologist for a recommendation. They usually can steer you in the right direction. 

The atmosphere is cozy and somewhat romantic or posh, depending on your company that evening.  Couch seating and intimate tables are everywhere. Reservations are wise, but honestly,  I only had one night where it was a close call without. But if you have your heart set, best to be safe than sorry.

They have a full menu of breakfast and lunch items but I ordered one of the Scotch egg pasties out of the display cooler along with a lemon bar and Highland shortbread. That, with a large latte, was just over $12. 

The pasty was pre-made and warmed in the oven so it came out fast and was so good. Very soft, perfectly baked pastry crust with a sprinkling of pepper and salt on top. The Scotch egg inside (hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage) was delicious. The sausage was perfect and not at all greasy and the egg was cooked just right.
The lemon bar was more of a type of lemon curd oat cake instead of just being the typical lemon-y gel stuff over graham cracker crust and was really good. I like that it was more hearty than your average lemon tart. The shortbread was a little harder than I like but has nutmeg and cinnamon in it and was great when I dipped it in a hot coffee I made myself later.
The latte was great too. It wasn't anything special but wasn't too milky and the coffee wasn't bitter which is all too common in less-commercial coffee places. Just right.

I got my dog pretty fast and wow was it amazing. I got the Aiko with a Hot Beer Dog. The spices were perfect and soo tasty. The Aiko had Mango Chutney, Jalapenos, Mayo, (something else but i can't remember). This was served on flatbread/pita or whatever you want to call it. It was quite different way to eat your dog, but wow I love the idea and it was super good. 

Got my food in about 3 minute wait, there isn't really too many tables to sit at so prepare to be friendly with some strangers or learn how to stand and eat. I am not afraid of strangers yet soo i sat with one and ate. 

Be aware if you have big sleeves food will fall in it ... mango chutney was in my jacket sleeve...soo my arm smelled REAL good after. I did get a ""complain"" that my breath smelled like mango chutney...but whatever i think they were just jealous of me getting some good food :)

Decent little spot for Hawaiian/Filipino fusion food. I haven't really tried their Filipino inspired items yet so I can't comment on that. 

My favorite is definitely their garlic shrimp bowl. It's packed with the garlicky flavor, and they give you a generous amount of shrimp. 

Recently, I tried their garlic chicken wings, and they were amazing! It had the right amount of sweetness, and it was perfectly crisp on the outside. It was their weekly special, but I'm really hoping that they put in on the menu for good. I also had their kalbi (short rib) bowl. It had good flavor, but it was really chewy, almost like jerky. My friend commented that the short ribs at a lot of places here in Vegas are generally chewy so I won't knock them too much for that. 

They also serve elotes, including one covered in Hot Cheetos or even rainbow Cheetos called the uni-corn.

They offered the same great service and excellent food (at a very reasonable price) that we expect from Stack's.  It was worth the drive.  

I ordered one of my ""usuals"": the Tuscany omelette.  Filled with sausage, provolone cheese, red peppers, and spinach, it satisfies my breakfast craving.

The very thing I paid twice as much for just a few days before.  

The lines seemed to get longer with very visit and to top everything off they changed the way the lines worked on our last visit.  Now to accommodate a new express wristband the line were no longer going up the stairs.  Instead they were on the ground, often, in the sun with nothing to cool you off.

We waited 20 plus minutes for our favorite ride and only 4 people used those wristbands.  To be honest that did not bug me.  It was however madding to stand in the sun burning up waiting to get on the ride.  It was so bad that after just 2 rides my 8 year old said to was too hot to wait on any more.  So we left.

At the end of the day it was just ok.  I'm not sure if I just built it up so big in my head, but I was slightly let down.

The positives... the dining room is beautiful and classy.  It's a great place for a fancy date or upscale celebration.  The staff is also top notch.  They are extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Their scallops were cooked perfectly and actually renewed my love for them.  The cheese was also a delectable  end.

The negatives... I was disappointed with the hamachi ceviche.  I have a huge soft spot for ceviche, and it's pretty much a ""must order"" if I see it on the menu.  I felt like it was lacking flavour, and the corn nuts were just weird.  They added a weird, hard crunch that kind of cheapened the dish.  In hindsight, I wish I'd tried the tuna tartare instead.  I'm not sure why, but the impression of this dish just stuck with me, and unfortunately it impacted my overall impression of the restaurant.

We stopped here to grab a few things from the drive-thru and the line was not bad at all. There were lots of cars in the parking lot but plenty of space to get around to place our order. 

We ordered the roasted vegetable panini, the grilled chicken sandwich on focaccia, the three cheese cauliflower soup, an ooey gooey bar, a fruit tart and a loaf of honey wheat bread.

We didn't have to wait too long for our order and everything was organized and correct and the girl who gave us our order was sweet and professional.

We came home to eat a feast! Everything was just like I remember it in Utah and all delicious. I love the grandmother's kitchen feel of their dishes. The fresh bread, homemade soup and delicious desserts. The veggie sandwich was so good! Zucchini, mushrooms, roasted red pepper and ricotta all layered on toasted bread.

Parking is A HOT MESS! You'll spend 10 minutes circling the lot trying to find a spot semi close to the entrance. 

The warehouse like location is too darn small for all the stuff that comes in!! They really do need to be in a full blown warehouse.

All you parents with 10 children, do they really need to accompany you, and sit on the benches that should be used for people like me trying to try on shoes? I want to smack those people. If you can afford a $500 Gucci purse, pay a sitter and keep the kids at home. Seriously. The store is so small and crowded as it is. I cannot be the only one who thinks that way. 

To avoid tears at home, check every single inch of the item you want to purchase. Some items (mainly shoes/purses) have been worn and could have damage. Triple check the item, as there are NO RETURNS.

Thank god they expanded the dressing rooms, the lines move much quicker now. Yeahhhh! Small victory.

Overall, heck yes I recommend this place. I have gotten amazing steals on brands such as Dooney & Bourke, Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, and many others.

Therefore, the toppings and bun of a veggie dog must be really spectacular to make it an enjoyable. Short Leash succeeds at this with all their creative combos and delicious naan. I've tried a few at their truck, but I'll always be partial to the first one I ever tried, the Igby. The spicy barbecue sauce, coleslaw and blue cheese makes my mouth water.

At the restaurant, I was finally able to try the green tomato stack, something I've been seeing on instagram all summer. It definitely lived up to the hype, and I'm sure the bacon I left off takes it over the top.

Eggslut is an LA import that's set up shop in a very prominent second-floor corner space just off the East elevators of the Cosmopolitan. It's quite easy for locals to access from the underground parking structure (which is set up with red and green lights to indicate occupied and free parking spaces, respectively).

I'm not sure whether it was the conference being held upstairs or just the usual busy traffic, but I spent 40 minutes waiting in line starting at just before 10am on a Thursday. The food came out fairly quickly after that, and seats were somehow available at the long communal high top (in retrospect, I can see why).

Gaucho ($15): seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, seasoned arugula, egg over medium, warm brioche bun. Steak was tender, marbled, and pink. Arugula was the most distinctive of the veggies. Brioche was a bit insubstantial, but I enjoyed every bite of the rather small sandwich.

Slut ($10): coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Gotta mix thoroughly with the provided spoon for full effect. It's a silky mixture that is seasoned just right, but perhaps reads a little more of the potato than egg. Also, a fourth slice of crunchy bread would've been right for this portion because I couldn't see how we would've heaped all of the jar's contents onto the crostini that we had.

Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($4.50): house-made dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt. This is on the large side of cookies but is still a pretty outrageous price, especially considering that it's just good. There's plenty of chocolate, but I don't get the same flavor in the dough as other great cookies and it's annoying to have to spread the salt around to get it in every bite.

I was happy in the moment with the flavors of the food, but it left me feeling regretfully unsatisfied when I got hungry again at lunch time (having split both entrees evenly with my friend). In a way, that makes a Eggslut a perfect symbol of Vegas.",2016-09-08 22:06:05

The wine list is filled with Italian wines and nice descriptions.  I ordered a Coppola Cabernet Sauvignon, which was described as having notes of cherries and wild flowers.  And good it was.  My friend and I ended up having more than a glass a piece.  Next time, it's a bottle when she and I go out.
The server brought us delicious bread with a pesto dipping oil.  It also featured thin, crunchy breadsticks.
My friend ordered a spicy crab pasta in a tomato sauce.  She said it was a bit too spicy for her.  Wish that I had ordered it.  My selection was Rigatoni alla Norma.  It featured egg plant in a tomato sauce.  The menu stated that it was served with buffalo ricotta.  The cheese that came on my dish must have been a grated version of ricotta.  I am a cheese lover, and I found the cheese portion skimpy.  Plus, the pasta sauce tasted like something I could have made at home on the fly after work.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special.
We shared the tirimisu for dessert.  Again, nothing special.

My 1 1/2 years old Persian cat started having discharge from her right eye, was pawing at it, and something just wasn't right. The veterinarian looked and said she saw nothing. I took my cat back again about a month and a half later, as she was developing a black spot on her right eye. The veterinarian did a slit lamp exam and gave her an antibiotic and recommended an ophthalmologist, which I also asked for. The problem was that she said that it was not an emergency. When I called the ophthalmologist to make an appointment, they were about 4 to 5 weeks out. I said OK and made the appointment. I watched my cat's eyes slowly worsen over that time despite an antibiotic. It turned out that she had herpes Simplex keratitis, which can become very serious and very damaging to the eye if not treated early. The antibiotic given does not treat herpes, which cats are easily prone to. She never told me about what this condition can do to the eye and never gave me proper informed consent. What she should have said is get to the ophthalmologist right away. My cat needed surgery and it was major surgery of both eyes. By the time she got to the ophthalmologist, it was advanced in the R eye and it had now also affected the left eye. The procedure cost $6000 yet that was not the concern. The concern was the suffering that my cat had to go through. I initially was very upset and requested to see all of the medical records as I was seriously considering writing a complaint to the veterinary board. I chose not to do that because I too am in the healthcare field and understand that mistakes can be made. Still, informed consent should always be given and it failed in this case. 
I would have probably given this review two or three stars, but it gets one star for the following reason: you should seriously ask to read the charts because you never know what they were put in there. In November 2017, my cats had appointments and I brought all three in. I was there on time and the front desk receptionist was extremely rude. She did not look up at me or acknowledge me or apologize for anything, while giving me dirty looks and rolling her eyes. I finally simply asked to speak to the manager and asked if we could be put in a room and that was the extent of the conversation. No yelling. Sadly for this young woman, I had witnesses with me that day. So, imagine my shock when I'm reading the medical record and this woman, who I am now told by the owner was fired and no longer works there, put in a note claiming that I was rude to her and yelled at her but she apologized to me and that I was also rude to other clients in the clinic... What??? 1) I never made any contact with other customers/clients there nor spoke with them. 2) she claimed that I yelled at her and that she apologized to me? I wish that would've happened because I would have felt bad and apologized, but instead I actually kept a low voice and was taken aback by how inappropriate she was towards me. 3) she lied and put in a demeaning and derogatory paragraph about me and it was under the veterinary doctors note in the medical chart! Being in the healthcare field, that is an absolute no no. You can email a bad interaction to your boss or manager, but unless that bad interaction is between the actual nurse/veterinarian and the patient, in the examination room during the visit, it should never be documented in the medical chart. Not only was it false documentation in a medical chart, but it was false documentation made up that never happened and my friends, who were witnesses, wanted me to consider getting a lawyer because of this. I am not going to sue and I'm not going to anything... I am so disgusted at this point that I just don't plan on going back.
I have spoken to many friends and none of them take their pets to this clinic, and now neither will I. Very disappointed. I really believed and thought this was a top notch place. They are good for dental cleaning and they're great for preventive. I find that when cases get complicated past that, I have not been happy with outcomes and decisions. I will be taking the care of my cats elsewhere to a clinic that all my friends are highly recommending.",2018-04-17 05:50:07

There's more room at this location but I feel that the veggies are less fresh. I usually end up buying a cart full of veggies to stock up for the week, buying that much this time without carefully inspecting each item was a mistake. 

They were having a BOGO on the packaged salads and I bought baby romaine which was fine, expiration date was going to be in 3 days and it looked fresh. But then I had a very very limited selection on my free salad so I grabbed a baby kale container, which also looked the most decent out of the bunch. I got home to find all the leaves very very dry/withered and discolored, so I checked the expiration date and it expired 4 days ago. Yes, my bad for not checking but I have never had a problem at other Sprouts locations with produce. I bought 2 bell peppers for my salads, one red and one green and when I cut open the green one it was rotting on the inside! ): Also, it was impossible to find a hard cucumber in their pile of cucumbers... i like mine on the crunchy side. 

I was walking around looking for coffee filters for a good while and no one offered to help, on the other hand if I was walking around looking clueless at other locations, an employee would ask me if I needed assistance. They didn't have any coffee filters, but I did manage to pick up a cheap 4pk of eco friendly sponges for only $1.99. They had some granola bars on sale for only $0.79, and when we went to Albertsons to pick up some coffee filters, we saw the same bars for $1.49!

I've never had meatless food with so much flavor.  My girlfriend is a self proclaimed ""pescatarian,"" so she was excited to find a menu with so many options for her.

She had a vegetable ramen soup with a that had a great broth.  Not being the most well versed vegetarian, I went with the veggie burger.  It was a well seasoned/marinated tofu patty topped with all the usual suspects.  It was super fresh and tastier than expected.  I added goat cheese that was well worth the $2 up charge and had a side of fingerling potatoes to go with it for additional up charge ($4?).  The potatoes were great, but it would have been nice to get a small side with the burger.  A small pasta or potato salad maybe?  That was my only gripe really.  Paying $15 for a burger and side is pricey.

Food wise it wasn't bad, but I honestly prefer doing hot pot at home better. I do love that they have tons of sides and meat choices and that you can get your own individual pot. As a group we definitely ordered too much food so I recommend starting with a few items and ordering as you go. For the broth I went with the spicy entry level. I personally did not really care for it. My boyfriend had the mushroom which I tried and thought was much better.

Pros
- They actually serve seafood. Salmon and the shrimp was the best. Mahi Mahi was over cooked. 

Cons
- Portion size is too much. Like another reviewer said, it's all about quantity vs quality. If I'm going to end up paying $130+ for 2 person, I'd stick w Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao (it be cheaper and way better food)

- Majority of the meat I had was too well done making it hard and chewy. BBQ pork wreaked of BO aftertaste. Thank goodness it came last cause I lost my appetite. I literally thought the smell was from the waiter but I was wrong lol

- Floor is super slippery

- Bar selection is not great (food and space wise). The layout and area is so small that you have people running into each other. Most places give you certain appetizers (bread, mashed potato and fried banana) but it was served buffet style. The fried banana was gross because it just like they breaded a regular banana vs using plantain.

I'm sad to say that they have gotten rid of some of my favourite dishes! :( I loved the dragon bowl with the peanut dressing and while I thought their peanut sauce was their most popular sauce, they have since gotten rid of it! Another favourite of mine was their puesdo sushi, but I'm not sure if they simply switched up the name or they changed it around entirely as it is now the forest mushroom sushi. As far as other dishes go, the queen of green salad and greenhouse effect are delicious!! (100% recommend the maple balsamic dressing). Their yam fries with tzatziki are also unreal and you can basically bathe in their sauce. They usually post their daily feature on their instagram account if you want to check it out and get an idea of what you're in for! As it is with any restaurant, there probably will be some dishes you prefer over others. If it's your first time and you didn't quite like what you got, I would say at least give it another try like I did and you might be surprised and change your mind!

Fun place that the kids will absolutely love.  Cost is a factor.

Last May, I had my son's end of year football party there.  One parent brought cupcakes.  It worked out well with the mini golf and the laser tag.  The kids and two coaches had a blast.  One issue was that the parents, who did not pay, ate some of the pizza, which won't have been an issue except that two kids (who showed up late) had paid and there was not enough pizza.  The hostess was great and the event really flowed well.

In June, we had my Girl Scout troop party.  I was pretty annoyed with the place.  Instead of bringing cake, I bought fruit.  This was a problem.  The hostess told me that I couldn't serve it to the girls.  I went to the manager.  Why, if they don't sell fruit, is it OK to bring in cake and not fruit?  Also, as a part of the party, we were supposed to have 4 adults play for free.  Only one parent wanted to play mini golf, while we walked the 18 kids through the course.  The hostess told me I would have to pay for the adult.  Again, I went to the manager with this issue.  

Manager's responses: they could have offered fruit, if we had told them in advance.  No outside food other than cake.  Also, the nonprofit booking does include the free adults, so hostess didn't know what she was talking about.

In the end, we all took home too much crappy pizza because 6-7 year old girls eat alot less pizza than 9-10 year old boys.  

Recently, I took my kids back with husband.  We all played mini golf and laser tag.  Husband and I played laser tag once and the kids played twice.  Get the specials that they offer.  The food is not worth it.",2015-01-19 17:20:54

The menu is intimidatingly gigantic. i wasn't sure if i go with a simple buffalo chicken sandwich, a burger concoction, a burger/sushi sushi roll, sushi rolls. i decided to go with the Bib burger (chili, cheese, bacon, onion) and it turned out pretty good. Your standard bigger-than-your-mouth burger that you probably won't want to eat in front of a first date. Be warned, they don't actually give you a bib with your bib burger, but you may end up with chili all over your hands. The chili didn't really add too much to the sandwich and the fresh jalapenos 

i am a fan of a sauce mixture suggested by my wife* mixing the cowfish sauce (shrimp sauce?) with some of the chili sauce on the table.

The 'seasoned' fries have very very minimal seasoning, basically like Steak n Shake fries.  

i'll probably try something different next time, but i'm sure we'll probably be back. The service was very good and being our first visit, the manager did come by and check how things were and gave an appetizer coupon for next time. 

Yes, the bathroom did have a fun language lesson.

They get 3.55 stars in my book. Service and atmosphere were great, extensive menu, but my burger didn't really thrill me, but based on the service and free app to come back, i'm sure i'll like the next thing that i try.

And I'm not gunna pick on you, guy. You guys do a lot of good things. 

We--my different minds & I--like you. And we really wanna like you guys more, cos you're close, affordable, and you're not a fad, or trying to be a trend. Can't stand restaurants trying to be what they're not. 

But I just can't give you 5 stars. At least not today. Ok?

Taco's are everywhere in AZ. And yours were promising where I was almost overlooking the lack of seasoning in the Carnitas itself. And it had browning in it but as advertised (Crispy) it was thoroughly not. Stewed? I'm mean it didn't taste boiled, but it was almost, soggy-boggy, wet?

Marinated onions on the tacos (Visually appealing) were just kinda meh. I would suggest using rice wine or apple cider vinegar. And maybe a pinch of pickling spice. 

Ok, now that that's over, now we can be friends again. 

we loved your Cuban sandwich. I'm not gunna say I bit into it and my eyes rolled back and I could see the Florida beach and feel the sand between my toes or smell the cocaine beneath my nose, but I did get some horripilation outta that, yeah.

Some of the food is prepared with a heavy hand (i.e., a bit overcooked, flavors not as bright and distinctive as one would like) and the portions can be a bit overwhelming. Nevertheless, our large group of family and friends that tried this place for the first time walked away (or I should say, waddled) quite satisfied.

Highlights: Good beer selection, friendly staff, extensive menu with the emphasis on meat and pork, stick-to-your-ribs German comfort food, gemütlichkeit (ambience).

Lowlights: A long wait to be seated, even though seating was available and I had called well in advance to put in a reservation.

I just had to try the Gulaschsuppe (Hungarian gulash soup) because I have such found memories of it from Germany. It was a meal in itself and had much more stew meat than I was expecting. It did deliver on flavor, however, with just enough paprika-forward peppery goodness. Best to share this if you are saving room for an entree.

For my entree, I had the Bauernschmaus ($17.95): combination of pork roast, roulade and smoked pork served with sauerkraut, dumpling and mashed potatoes. This seemed like the best ""sampler platter"" to satisfy my desire to try an array of flavors. The roulade is ""beef roll"", or a thin cut of beef stuffed with pickles, onion and bacon. The pork roast and smoked pork were a bit overcooked, but I realize this is how pork is traditionally cooked (unlike nowadays, where trichonosis is not an issue, so you can actually serve it a bit rarer). The sauerkraut and mashed potatoes were just o.k. This was a monstrous plate of food, most of it meat!

Others at the table weighed in with satisfied yummy sounds upon digging into their tasty meals. These included the Wurst Peanne ($13.95): polish sausage, bratwurst, knackwurst served in a pan with sauerkraut and fried potatoes; and the Forsterkotelett ($15.95): sauteed pork chops covered with portobellos and mushrooms, served with herb potatoes, bacon (green) beans and applesauce. Although the schnitzel (breaded pork cutlet) covered half a plate, it looked a little less crispy than what I would have preferred.

All in all, you get a solid German meal experience here. If I had come with fewer people, I would have shared more and maybe ordered fewer entrees (since many can feed two). But mom was throwing down the plastic and it had been a while since I overindulged, so we all let our German appetites run wild.

If you can only eat one meal today, you will be über-satisfied with a meal from Bavarian Point. Prost!",2010-03-31 04:15:53

This cafe has gone from good to mediocre and now just plain bad. A few recent visits has confirmed that this place is now sucky (is that the right spelling? LOL).

I have ordered different kinds of food during recent visits and noticed they were pretty low quality. The steaks and prime rib have smelly and weird taste, under seasoned, and wasn't cooked property (under seared, etc..). They added a few Asian entries back on, but stay away because it doesn't taste anything like their names and they were so so so so so bad.

You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.

I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. 

La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.

But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. 

Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.

On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.

Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.",2011-08-28 11:52:30

The food however was shit. No wait, let me rephrase that.
The food was as if a huge pile 'o shit walked into their kitchen, took a shit on the floor and one of the kitchen staff came hurriedly rushing over, scooped it up and plopped it into five serving dishes, loudly announcing to the servers;

          ""ORDER-UP, TABLE TWELVE!""

We were table twelve.

Corn and asparagus succotash was dry, with no semblance of anything asparagus, not even the flavor. it was orange. ORANGE for christ's sakes!

The creole soup was as if someone in the same kitchen where shit just took a dump, emptied a can of tomato paste into a bowl, threw in some uncooked okra and for effect, one little tiny bay shrimp. Curious.

A burger ordered medium arrived table side, drier than a nun's hoo-ha.

The house salad dressing so odiferous, it reminded me of my armoire after my dirty boxers have steeped in it for a few days.

And the hummus. Before tasting it, my wife said something cute and upbeat, something like;

""This has mango in it, it should be delicious.""

It wasn't. I never tasted mango or any hint of mango.
Instead, I felt like Napoleon Dynamite where he tastes onion in the cow's milk.
The hummus was overpowered by onion and had a strongly acidic bite. 
Completely inedible unless you're a hobo or something.

Basically, that's five for five, making me long for the use of Yelp pentagrams with which to rate this place instead of stars.

Three beers, five appy's, a fruity cocktail of some sort, a friendly server, flat screens mounted so high you'll crane your neck to watch them, and a drunk couple next to us PDA-ing themselves into the record books with the world's longest and sloppiest tongue kiss ever.
The couple was pretty entertaining however, as he groped the back-meat sausage-ing out from her way-too-tight sundress.
And all this for fifty bucks. 

I'm never going back.

There are 2 servers that seem to consistently let me down, where as the other 2 are always great and work together well to make sure they always check up on us.

The Chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, IMO it is better than the chasu at the well known Daikokuya in Los Angeles. Oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are ASSIGNED to the type of broth you choose and they will NOT let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. I prefer the noodles they use in the miso ramen, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth. The lack of flexibility is a bit upsetting and leaves the foodie in me yearning for food MY WAY. 

Fortunately, I tried all of their fried rices and rice bowls and have been pretty happy with all of them. My favorite is the pork belly bowl. YUM!!!

The layout of the restaurant is not conducive to take out orders.  You wait in line with others, regardless of dining in or taking out, place your order, pay at the register, but then there's nowhere to sit/stand to wait for your order.  You are either standing in top of staff blocking their path to and from the kitchen, standing in front of the tea/lemonade stand, or forcing diners to stare at your butt/junk while you stand right next to their tables waiting for your food.  I'm not sure what the answer is besides removing an interior table, but we all know that's not going to fly.

Manager, Donovan

When we arrived there were about 3 parties in line. The hostess came over and asked us how many in our party. She didn't mention it would be a 40 minute wait. When  I asked how much longer they said another 10 minutes, they were busy with a party. 

I asked what could be done for the inconvenience of an hour wait at a coffee shop that has never before had a wait and she got her manager. Donovan was less than helpful and didn't even apologize for the wait. Basically he said too bad. 

We sat unacknowledged at the table for 8 minutes before we were offered a beverage. The quality of the food has severely declined since our last visit. The sandwich was dry. The bread was hard and the french fries inedible. When the waitress eventually returned to ask how the food was, I told her ""not as good as past visits"" she said ""I know. I guess it's because we are busy"". So she knew the food was bad and still served it!

We come here on a regular basis on the weekends to enjoy our two favorite drinks: the Hamhattan (*cured pork belly infused bourbon involved here) and the 4th St Sour (*rosemary infused vodka). Both are Society originals so good luck finding it anywhere else. The vibe of this place is also super sleek (Imagine Boardwalk Empire, but just with people of today instead of the 1920s). Often, the live entertainment is a jazz artist or crooner, which adds to the speakeasy environment. When we have out of town guests (anyone not living in downtown cle), we talk everyone into at least one drink at Society (the downside of the drinks is that they are expensive). Society would be best for a date night or a small, intimate gathering of friends. Large groups would not work well in this place, unless you reserve the party room. And ladies and gents, this is not the place to bring a rowdy group of bachelors or bachelorettes so please save those shenanigans for West 6th Street.",2014-04-21 03:18:53

Brat Haus has also done a bit of renovating since I was last in and they managed to add about 10-12 seats inside the restaurant.  The best part of their new menu might be the poutine. Yes, hand cut fries with a pork gravy and cheese curds. Their poutine is just a tad different in that the gravy is LOADED with meat.  I shared it with a friend and I probably should've called it quits there.... but I didn't.  I forged on and had the duck brat with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. The spicy peppers are red bell peppers, pickled to be spicy. They are fabulous!  You'll feel your core temp rise after eating a few.  And the kraut is homemade, served fresh and crunchy, not overly briny... Meaning its actually good! I added their dijon mustard too ... whoa! It was a party in my mouth. FYI, they have about 5 mustards on the table, all of which are housemade and all are pretty darned good. Then, as if I hadn't stuffed myself already, we decided to share a butterscotch root beer float. The server suggested making the float ""adult style"" which meant we'd be adding root beer vodka to the mix!  It was difficult to share, but very yummy. 
Service was good, not great, but not awful.  My beer was gone for about 6-7 minutes before she came around to check on my thirst.  It won't keep me away, I'll just be better about making sure I get a water at the beginning to tide me over any dry periods.",2013-08-07 17:31:30

In fact, I almost fell asleep after all the mimosas I had here.

Came here one morning and was quite surprised at how cute and quaint this place was.  
Kind of dark inside with frames and curtains on the wall. Decorated like you were in a country home versus a strip mall in Las Vegas.

The man who took my order was very friendly and recommended various items as it was all our 1st times there. 
Funny thing is the 1st thing we ordered were the mimosa samplers. 3 samplers for each of us: guava, blood orange, watermelon, strawberry, grapefruit, coconut, pineapple, and 2 other flavors I can't recall. 
Each flavor was pretty good and infused well with the champagne. Problem was it was giving me the burps before I even got my meal. 

I'm more of into savory crepes kinda gal and the guy recommended the Sonora (asada steak) or the Pirate (albacore tuna) but, I was intrigued by their special of the day, Reuben crepe with the roast beef, sauerkraut, etc... UGH, it was like a sandwich...so. good!!!!! My sandwich, also, came with a chicken tortilla soup. LOVEd it. I'm pretty sure I could have just ordered that and be a happy camper. 
My friends ordered the Marco Polo breakfast crepe (sausage) and another special of the day that had chicken in it. I wish I knew the name as it was quite tasty. So, was the Marco Polo.

This place is so great that I wish I could eat here everyday so I could try a new savory crepe. Exciting flavors! Can't wait to come back!",2013-11-17 21:31:44

The lake views from the restaurant are gorgeous.  The service is quite good and the food came out quickly.  We were there before noon so we ordered our dim sum from the menu, which I usually prefer b/c all the food is hot and fresh when it arrives, vs when it's been pushed around the entire restaurant before getting to your table.

We ordered quite a lot of dishes for 6 people and the bill was about $150.00 plus tip. In my opinion that is hefty for dim sum but given the quality and the location, I would come back for a birthday lunch or some other special occasion.  I guess I'm used to the prices in Richmond Hill/Markham for equally good dim sum.

My favourite dishes were the scallop rice noodle roll (which I've seen in HK but not in Toronto) and the bbq pork pastry. Everything else was really good too.  

I have to say that for a Chinese restaurant, the service was good.  We received a discount on our bill because there was a problem with our food. Usually at Chinese restaurants when this happens, you wouldn't even get an apology let alone a discount.  It was a nice gesture.",2014-04-21 18:30:16

Here's the story, of beans and burritos... some black beans, others refried. Both of them were very tasty, but also guaranteed to keep you on the pot all night.

So, this one day when the chicken met the beans and burritos... they knew that it was much more than a hunch... that this group should somehow join together, and that's the way they all became my greasy lunch.

While I was developing this article I tried to categorize Chino Bandido. I went back and forth between Mexican and Chinese over ten times before I just put it under both categories. However, Chino really isn't Chinese, Mexican, or Chinese-Mexican Fusion; it's really its own type of food. Speaking of Fusion, what the hell is that? The only Fusion that comes out of Chino Bandido is the mix of ethnic food in your stomach that will prohibit you from any sort of activity while it's digesting. Anyway, let's get into it.

Chino is nothing fancy. It's discreetly hidden behind a Walgreens off the main road. When you walk in you will notice that it is furnished with Costco folding tables and chairs, exposed duct work, concrete floor, and very little decoration on the walls except for an autographed Guy Fieri poster in the back. It's pretty simple. Gentleman, a word to the wise: don't expect to get laid if you bring a lady here on a first date.

As usual, I checked out Chino's menu on their website before I left the house. I'm no rocket scientist, but you need a quantum physics degree to figure out their ordering system. However, Chino has attempted to make ordering a bit easier by implementing ordering instructions and a simulator on their website. The staff at Chino's is awesome and will guide you through the ordering process and let you sample everything on the menu first anyway. If you read my previous post on Costco samples, you know that Chino giving samples wins hearts and minds in my book.

My first time at Chino I tried the Jade Red Chicken, the BBQ pork in a burrito, refried beans, and Jerk Fried Rice. The Jade red chicken was decent. It was like a General Tso's Chicken on steroids. A fried texture; super spicy and super sweet. The BBQ pork was alright but a little bland. While reading Yelp I remember running across someone's Yelp review that stated he loved the Jade Red Chicken so much that he was pissed off that the BBQ pork had to share the plate with it. Uh yeah, it didn't bother me that much. The Jerk fried rice was pretty good as well... it included jerk chicken and green onions. Chino's gets props for originality, giving you a lot of food, and making it easy to take home the leftovers. Once you slap on the cardboard lid you are all set to take it home and have it for breakfast the next day.

The best part about Chino Bandido (and best value) is the bonus they give you; the Snickerdoodle or Chocolate Volcano cookie (baked during weekends).

I opted for the Chocolate Volcano cookie and let me just say that thing was damn good. I will admit that the food was probably not enough to bring me back to Chino Bandido that often, but that cookie just might make it happen. And as for fusion, maybe next week I will try some Korean-Ethiopian-Chilean mix. You just never know.",2010-05-20 04:38:15

This place has become our neighborhood takeout Viet. They've installed window treatments since, it's soften the ambiance a bit which was well needed. Also there's a new takeout menu, which is shorter but no less confusing.

#13 Pho Do Bien ($9) shrimp, squid, fish ball and fish pate. The shrimp was dry but aside from that an excellent, strong flavored Pho, we loved it. 
and
#7 Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit ($13) Lotus Stem salad w/shrimp and pork.
Very tasty ""salad"", could have used a bit more of the chili/fish sauce in my taste but I'd definitely order it again. I wouldn't want to make a whole meal of it but it's great for sharing as a side - albeit a bit pricey

The menu is simple...you have a few choices of specialty hot dogs or you can get some plain ones (a great option for the monkeys). They also have combos that you can purchase...I opted for the 2 hot dogs for $6.47 (give or take). I chose the Chicago and the Chilean. The Chilean had to be my favorite because of the spicy mayo and avocado. I liked the Chicago for the tomatoes and pickle spear. If this review was just about the hot dogs...it would only get 3 stars.

I went in earlier this week to drop off my prescription. Upon entering the pharmacy I felt I was transported into an old fashioned drug store. The whole layout of the store reminds of something you might see on ""Leave It To Beaver."" 

There were a few people ahead of me, but once I was greeted the service was very friendly. Since it was my first time getting a prescription filled they got all my info and told me my order would be ready the next day.

I didn't get a chance to look at everything they offer in the store, but looks like most of the things you can get at Walgreen's or CVS, plus some great stuff like bottled soda, aroma therapy oils, home made soaps...

So far I am very happy that I switched to Melrose and look forward to continue to use their services. Sure, it's easier to use Walgreen's or CVS because there is one on every corner in just about every town, but I appreciate the friendly and helpful service that Melrose provides.",2008-12-12 16:24:43

Standard Chinese place with all of the usual suspects that your grandma would expect from such a place. Heck even Vogons would have loved this place if it weren't for that stupid hyperspace express route. But back to the restaurant - looks like kind of Chinese restaurant my parents would have taken to me back when it wasn't one of many choices but THE Chinese restaurant in that part of town where everybody in that area went to get their Chinese fix. Back when asking someone if they preferred Hunan to Szechwan would get you a response like ""what'd you call me?"" So my usual dining companions decided on this place when we tried to go to Beavers Choice but they were closed for lunch due to some odd circumstances. Place is in a mall right near the 101 and has plenty of parking. We entered and were seated right away. Looked like the lunch specials were the thing to go with so we each got our own lunch combo. I got the sweet and sour pork and it came with an eggroll and egg flower soup and also some white rice. Meal was decent and filling - the type I would expect from a place like this. The layout is a little weird - we were seated in a raised area. If you want to get up to use the restroom, you have to cross tiny walkways which also act like delivery express lanes with servers carrying plates back and forth so it ends up being like a game of Frogger - you gotta cross quickly and at the right time. Good times. Price - it was very cheap for what you get - like the prices got stuck in another decade - so my coworkers want to come back here again. Myself, not as enthused as I felt there wasn't anything really that special about the place or the food. Of course, my coworkers were also entertained by our neighbors at the next table whose conversation overpowered ours. Several old gals who talked about past husbands sparing little detail - what little we heard was enough to make my coworkers want to introduce themselves so they could hear more at a future date. I had to drag them away back to work. Would come back if in the area and out of other options and if my coworkers really start working on their script for Fifty Shades Of Grey-haired Bastards.",2015-02-17 01:01:00

When I arrived, we had to wait 15 minutes, which is tolerable. 

Parking can be a problem in this area but we Uber'd here this time so we didn't have to worry about that. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. Starting prices were pretty cheap and there are extra toppings for you to add. I added extra tamago (egg) and extra pork. Long story short. These add ons can definitely add up the costs to your ramen. 

We ordered the fried rice also which was really good and the pork belly which comes in small or large. In all honestly, food was good but the BROTH is a different story. The broth is too thick for my liking and it was too creamy that I couldn't even drink all of the broth. I feel like the broth was on the salty side and I asked my friend and he agreed. 

Funny thing is, whenever my group of friends crave ramen, we would always separate and go to different ramen joints. Half of them would go to Monta and the other half would go to Ramen Sora. But in all honesty, it depends on the person because we all have our different takes on ramen. Monta, is good but the broth just ruins it for me.",2017-05-02 00:45:06

Now, what exactly is a Chilean Hot Dog?! Pure deliciousness is what it is !  But on a more serious note, its a hot dog topped with mayonnaise, mustard, avocado, tomato, and sauerkraut. 

The Lunch Box provides a great alternative to UNLV students that are tired of the usual eateries. This place probably has the smallest menu I've seen, but EVERYTHING on the menu sounds great. On top of the Chilean Hot dog, I also ordered the ice cream waffle sandwich [which was the best decision I made that day]. He uses a homemade waffle recipe and adds chocolate chips to the batter, puts ice cream in between two slices and tops it off with a little bit of powdered sugar. 

The prices are great. There's nothing over five dollars, if I remember correctly.

Went to lunch for Dad's 98th birthday.  He said that he was not hungry.  OK...been there before so this was a test of his resolve.

On weekends Bravo! offers both lunch and brunch menus. Excellent way to satisfy diverse tastes as both menus have plenty of choices.  Their best option is the salad plus main course with $11.99 and $12.99 options.  You get a nice sized house salad plus an array of mains.

The bread is served with a herb and sun-dried tomato olive oil with is excellent with the herb-ed bread. The orange color is magnificent.  And so flavorful that you will OD on bread alone.

 I ordered the lasagna, as I had it before but was not greatly impressed, but this time it was excellent, well-layered with meat and cheese.  I came piping oven hot and bubbly.  Excellent.

Wife had a rigatoni with a creamy mushroom sauce which was super.  Ate wife's mushrooms, as she does not like them, but I did and do.  Very flavorful and a generous portion.

Dad reluctantly agreed to ravioli with Alfredo sauce.  Mr. ""I'm not hungry"" was seduced by the dish, calmly eating every bite of the four ravioli plus two pieces of bread that he used to sop up the sauce.  He is certainly sold on Bravo! and we came back on a following Sunday for a repeat experience and he really liked the linguini carbonara, also in Alfredo sauce, which got got the bread follow-up phase underway.

I had the ravioli but this time it was a three piece serving with squirts of red and green pesto sauce.  Dad ate half of a ravioli from my plate.

The manager knew it was his birthday, so comp-ted a three part dessert.  What a great dish with three monkey dishes, each different:  a pudding, a creme brulee and a ice cream sundae.  We each tried them all and dad opted for the creme brulee, eating it all.  This is by a guy who was allegedly not hungry!  

A coupon for a free item came with the bill, which we certainly kept.

It was so awesome inside!  It gave me a pleasant little reminder of what the Olympia Farmer's Market was like.  There was beautiful, fragrant, fresh fruit everywhere!  There were loaves of fresh baked breads and rows of jars full of honey or yummy preserves.  It was almost an assault on my eyes with all the color flying around in here, but I loved it.

As we checked out at the counter, the girl was pretty funny, telling us that if the peppers started to fade in color we could just spray paint it, but to not eat it afterwards.

The rooms are definitely modern and spacious.  $149 per night on the strip is a good deal.  The remote that controls everything (lights, curtain, TV) took a little playing around to get used to.  People who hate technology may not like this feature.  They do have buttons on the walls as well to control the curtains and light.  Room service did a very good job every day cleaning up our messy room.  They even organized our shoes.  If your room is on the side of the building, be prepared for a long walk.

That being said, the prices and the not-great seating situation keep Gold Bar from earning a solid five stars in my book.  I know they have to make money somehow, but $3.00 for a ""short"" latte?  Substitute soy milk and add tax, and I'm up to almost $4 for a pretty basic beverage.  The flavor and overall quality are definitely there; it just seems a bit over-priced.

For those wanting to stay and sip/chat/kill time, there are a couple of tiny tables in the front area, a small back room with limited seating, and some plastic chairs outside on the sidewalk overlooking the parking lot.

Bottom line: get your beverage to go, and be sure to use a Gold Bar punch card -- buy 9 drinks and get your next one (your choice) for $1.",2008-05-07 03:52:59

The pie came out in a reasonable amount time given its thickness. The crust was good. Stuffed with cheese and very flaky and crispy - in a good way. The veggies were cooked well and didn't make the sauce too soggy.

The interior was eclectic, with old records and memorabilia on the walls, but warm and romantic.  When we walked in, the music was quite nice, but as the evening progressed, it got worse.  By the end of the meal, it was obscure and beat driven, which seemed out of character.  

We had been told that the serving staff was quirky and interesting.  Our server were difficult to communicate with (didn't seem to understand some of our requests or questions), and offered little advice or recommendations on the menu, which was not as original as I had hoped.  Only a few of the dishes sounded interesting.  

As the food arrived, I found that most of the dishes were under-seasoned; the tomato and bocconcini salad came with only two very tiny basil leaves, large unripe (and therefore tasteless) tomato slices, and was drizzled with only olive oil.  That being said, the quality of the cheese was creamy, fresh and fantastic.  The blackened cod was nothing special, paired with a sauce that was too strong for such a mild fish, and the portion was quite small.  Maybe instead of changing the menu selections every day, as they boast, they should find a few dishes that they are actually really good at, and stick to those.

Chompies has been serving East Coast style breakfast in the valley since 1979!  Located close to ASU Campus this place is packing with tradition and memories.  

Breakfast is served throughout the day.  Pick up some fresh made pastries and bagel on your way in or out!  Last first time came I ordered he All American Breakfast -- YUMMY! Crispy bacon, warm turkey sausage, crispy hash browns, and over easy eggs. I'm a sucker for good breakfasts.  The 2nd time I came I ordered the Breakfast of Champions.  Let's just say I wasn't a champion this time around.  I finished my eggs and bacon, but man those pancakes or ginormous!  I think I ate 1/3 even though I was trying to carb load for my run that day.  Eaters be aware; the portion sizes hard HUGE!  

The place itself is made like a deli shop.  I don't think much has changed since the open since it seem pretty dated.  It was fun searching for the different Broadway plays painted on the walls which brought back great memories.

Our service was excellent and the waitress seems to know a lot about the large menu.  Yes, not only were the portions huge....the menu itself was HUGE!  First timers I would definitely stay with breakfast.  You can't go wrong there! - Enjoy!",2013-05-13 16:40:29

 When we did get to sit and eat we were served family style where one big dish comes out and you serve yourself. The chicken dish had far too much soy sauce and I can't even remember the name it was that bad. The pasta dish that came out was cold and thin sauced.

And when I got there they were ready to go for me.  The place was really clean, alot of space, and the atmosphere was very welcoming.  The only drawback is when speaking to the young lady at the counter you really can't hear her because of the tvs that are on and the noise from the meals being prepped. I think maybe they need to shut that part off to eliminate some of that extra noise when speaking to someone at that counter.  

I didn't get any combo meals because I didn't want my fries to be sitting there although they had my wings ready when I arrive but the fries probably wouldn't be cold.  I ordered the 20 piece boneless wings alone and ordered 10 hot and 10 of the Louisiana cajun rub.  The wings were a pretty descent size but nothing as big as Buffalo Wild Wings but they weren't too little.  The hot wings were pretty good and the since it was my first time trying to Louisiana rub it was pretty good too.  However one of them seemed to have too much salt on them and it probably was the Louisiana rub.  My tolerance for salt has significantly been reduced because of my high blood pressure so I'm not a big salt fan anymore.  So I'm not sure if it actually was too salty or it was just my taste buds.

SInce this is the closest one to my house I probably be returning on service alone which goes a long way with me.  I usually prefer the other wing place (Buffalo Wild Wings) because their wings are alot bigger and meatier.",2016-10-27 19:27:00

If I had reviewed them on my visit before this last one, I would have given them 5 stars, however they fell quite short on this last visit and unfortunately I've only become obsessed with Yelping recently.

The service was great.  We got seated right away despite it being pretty busy.  The server was attentive and nice, although they didn't bib us, to my great disappointment.  In fact, they brought out all our food before giving us bibs so then they had to bring them out and we put them on hurriedly while holding back from salivating all over the table. 

My number one complaint is the food.  I ordered shrimp and king crab legs with the Whole Shabang sauce.  It had been a while since I had eaten there but I remember the taste of the Whole Shabang sauce like it was yesterday.  The sauce from the other night was NOT the same.  It was tasteless, like the chef forgot to put salt in.  I had coat my seafood with lime juice and use the salt and pepper shaker.  The shrimp were a little overcooked and tough.  

On the bright side, the meat from the crab legs were tender and yummy but it just wasn't enjoyable because the sauce lacked flavor.  I was severely disappointed because since my friend and I had nailed down our plans the night before, I had been dreaming of that delicious stinky salty spicy flavor and it just wasn't what I had built up in my mind.

Today however, i wasn't feeling up to a pound of shrimp. As I am a fan of their Cajun fries as well, i decided to order their Fried Shrimp Basket. There was a basket of their tasty tasty cajun fries topped with fried shrimp, unfortunately 10, but perhaps you may request more by paying more? Will definitely ask next time. The Fried shrimp was just really good. I requested a mild spice on the shrimp and it was just perfect. I think i just found my favorite order here! lol

Unfortunately she left while we were just about to finish eating and we left the tip for him instead. But he was nice as well. But feel the tip should be the first waitress.

...knowing this...I'm about to piss myself off and break my own rule...because I'm going to do the exact thing I hate; as described above. Damn me. 

My brother and I went out on a week night a while ago for some reverse happy hour grub, and just so happened to cruise by this place. Upon seeing the uber-cool iguana wearing sunglasses on the sign which instantly reminded me of those cool 80's IZOD shirts, we knew we had to stop. Sadly, upon entering the place just had this grimy look and feel to it, the kind of feel you get when you stop at a Dairy Queen in some one horse town on the way to Vegas. The experience that followed is summarized below: 

-We park and enter the front door. 
-There is no hostess or visible employee anywhere. 
-We wait for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do. 
-Still no employees around...we wander the whole place...and to our shock do not find a single waiter/waitress/hostess/bartender/cook anywhere. 
-We go back to the front room, standing there confused about what we should do. 
-Wait five minutes. 
-Walk around again...still not a single employee of Iguana Macks to be found anywhere. 
-Leave to find a better establishment...in this case...Applebees. (Which is saying a lot because I hate Applebees.) 

...can someone explain how a restaurant/bar like this can be devoid of any/all employees around 10 o'clock? I was tempted to go and ask one of the inebriated bar patrons, but it just didn't seem worth the hassle. I would have liked to try Iguana Macks; but sadly wasn't given the chance. It shouldn't be a challenge to eat somewhere...an establishment should be courting you for your business, and this was the complete opposite. 

Now the bigger question is this...where were the employees? Some of my theories: 

-An all at once employee weed smoking break 
-They were transported to an alternate timeline and are now living in a parallel universe where they work for a classier restaurant. Kind of like 'Lost' for wait staff. 
-Employee Orgy 

...eh, who knows...but I'm just not too jazzed about going back to try this place. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even have any of the food; that's saying something.",2010-05-19 22:15:19

Good pizza comes down to its crust and Pizza Rock's crust was great!  It had nice crispiness, chewiness, and a little bit of char that served as the perfect medium to top with a perfect amount of pepperoni, linguica, chorizo, banana peppers, green onions, serrano peppers, and ricotta cheese.  It had plenty of spice and saltiness that in my mind made for a perfect pizza to go with beer.  Alas, I didn't have a beer with it.  Next time...  As pizza by the slice goes, Pizza Rock's Picante slice (and likely its other offerings, too) was a bigger slice with a better tasting crust and toppings, and an overall better value than Secret Pizza or Five50 Pizza.

Add that it's in Red Rock Casino where there's plenty else to do, you can fill up your whole day just hanging out here. I would say bowl and hit up happy hour, watch a movie or a concert at the pool if you're ambitious. 

To sweeten the deal, there's special late night bowling pricing. $1.50 per game starting at 10 PM until 2AM on Sunday through Thursday. If you watch a movie, bring your ticket stub and get one game for free. Shoe rentals are not included in that. 

There's a bar in here with pool tables and darts as well if you're into that. There's also cafe serves snacks like pizza if you want to eat and bowl. If you ever have a special event, their VIP private bowling rooms are awesome and worth considering!",2013-06-02 23:06:45

We ordered the zucchini fries and patatas bravas...not a great pairing, way too fried and bland. I wasn't thrilled with the tapas menu options. 

The decor was a little kitschy for me too. It's somewhat confusing to market being a Spanish tapas restaurant with silver screen decor, but maybe I'm too traditional in my tapas restaurant expectations. 

Out waitress was attentive and pleasant. Nothing really stood out for me about this place, apart from proximity to other cool places on state street. I'm sure the outdoor patio seating would be nice.",2018-03-18 13:55:43

Now for the food:  we both ordered combo platters for $10.88 each, that included rice or organic noodles, two regular entrees and a beverage. Appetizers can be substituted for entrees. Unlike Panda, the taste was not bland or overwhelmingly sweet.  The meat was tender and the vegetables fresh.  No dreaded MSG, only healthful organic ingredients, I really feel good about having lunch there!  We ordered the beef and broccoli, chicken wings, shrimp balls and noodles.

QMKh4mePn9b9EDUD_fUauw,DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,nXgyXL-OXk6NGi477xt5eA,5,1,0,0,"Wow. This place is amazing. As soon as Aj S. told me about this place, I KNEW I had to check it out ASAP! I finally had the chance to check it out and was blown away completely! First of all, I love that it is located in Braddock. Not only because it's an easy 15 minute drive from my house, but it's one of the many new businesses in Braddock that is helping to bring new light to the neighborhood. I was also excited to see that there was a parking lot as well- ALWAYS a plus!

I am absolutely in love with every single thing about this place. I love the atmosphere, the entire vibe you get when you walk in, the décor, the brick wall, the fact there was a dog just hanging out in the brewery, the idea of the bartenders wearing suits--it was all so unique and fun! 

They don't have a kitchen, but food trucks are there almost every single day. We went on an evening when the Pittsburgh Taco Truck was there- we just ordered them and took them right in the brewery, sat down and ate them before even ordering a beer (I didn't want the tacos affecting my taste buds while trying all of their beer for the first time, lol). What's so cool about this idea of food trucks- they have different food all of the time!! I checked out their site and saw that Blowfish BBQ often comes to The Brew Gentlemen, and sometimes they even have food truck round ups, where multiple food trucks come at one time. I am SO excited about coming back here to try more food trucks and drink AMAZING beer..

Now, about the beer... WOW. Every time I visit a brewery, or try multiple beers from the same brewery in general, there's typically always a few that I don't like and a few that I love. Every single beer that I tried at The Brew Gentlemen I LOVED. Here are the ones that were on tap when I visited that I had the opportunity to try: 
Overgrowth- this is one of their spring releases and I attended the day it was released officially. WOW. It was by far my favorite beer out of all of them. It basically tasted like a hoppy wheat ale and was PACKED with flavor. I had two samples of this one, it was the best! 5/5
Prototype 2- a blonde coffee ale. Let me start off by saying, I don't like coffee. The only way I will drink it is if it's iced and mixed with lots of sugar and cream. I LOVED this beer! It smelled and tasted like light coffee and was almost mocha tasting to me. It was so unique and just unbelievably good. 4.5/5
Nelson Saison Ale-  so refreshing and light yet packed with delicious flavor. There were hints of lemon and orange- perfect for summer! They had this in bottles, so I made sure to purchase one before I left! 5/5
White Sky- the chai wheat ale! I read tons of reviews about this one and could not wait to try this unique flavored beer! It did NOT disappoint! It was the PERFECT fall beer- perfect amount of spice and flavor. Super tasty and different. I really enjoyed it. 4.5/5
Build and Destroy- a really really dark wheat ale. What a crazy unique idea! Such a good flavor, this seemed to be my boyfriend's favorite. 4.5/5
General Braddock IPA- for an IPA, this was exceptionally smooth, the perfect combination of malt and hops. It was everything you could want in an IPA. 4.5/5

I loved that the screens above the bar not only displayed what beers they had on tap, but the glass it came in, what kind of beer it was and the percentage. It made choosing which beers I wanted to try super easy! The sample glasses were adorable, ranged from $2-2.50 a glass and each glass was 5 oz. Super reasonable!

The service was excellent, the beer was perfect, the bar is gorgeous... this place is awesome! I left with a bottle of beer to take home, two glasses and a t-shirt. 

I am in love with this place and cannot wait to come back!",2015-04-03 19:56:25

I've ordered the steak & sweet potato previously but it was not that impressive imho. The good thing was it was certainly filling. The small felt like a large to me.

The vibes were just like home - the bone thugz blasting and workers just enjoying the grind really reminded me of Los Angeles & made me miss home. 

If you've read my LA Grand Central Market review, I always get the same thing at Eggslut:
*FAIRFAX (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) - The scrambled eggs are always luscious and beautiful.   SUBBING THE BRIOCHE FOR THE BISCUIT IS CRITICAL. It adds a delicious butteriness and touch of savoriness. Also, this location didn't charge me extra for the substitution! Do note that you won't be hungry at a normal lunch hour after having this baby.

We also ordered their signature slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette)..because you have to at Eggslut. It's like mashed potatoes with extra protein from the egg. Love it. I like that this location has a clear area (to the right of the food pick up) to recycle your jars!

Parking:
-charged $5 for parking for this event, this was listed no where that I saw on any of the flyers/websites.
-lot said ""full"" but was then told that there were a few spaces that had opened up. Why not take the sign down then? And where else would people park?
-dirt lot with no defined parking spaces, was a bit like driving off-road.

Concert Venue:
-I attended an outdoor concert behind the club, $20 general admission, $40 VIP. The stage is elevated and surrounded on 3 sides with large industrial shipping containers, stacked on top of each other. Pretty cool, visually speaking.
-the concert floor is concrete and sloped, so almost everyone has a good view of the stage
-sound was hit or miss throughout the night. The PAs popped a dozen or more times during the Y&T set, an issue that never got resolved and resulted in loss of sound from the PAs, could only be heard through the monitors for 5-10 seconds at a time.
-I couldn't believe that the headliners were on at 10:00PM-- it's normally 11 or later! I ended up missing the All-Star Jam, which I was really looking forward to.
-VIP seating/viewing area complete with cabanas, would be great for daytime shows
-VIP standing/viewing area not even roped off, towards the end of the Y&T concert, almost everyone had filtered up into that area.
-bring a light jacket/coat as it's entirely outside, was very windy on Saturday.

Drinks/Bars:
-two bars, well staff and well stocked, reasonable mixed drink prices: $6 well.
-free shot (tasted awful) for VIP
-lines were not too long, but the service was a bit slow.

Bathrooms:
-two port-a-potties outdoors and access to indoor restrooms inside the strip club.
-as a woman, I'm a little skivved out about sharing bathrooms/toilets with strippers. Plus I feel like they would probably prefer to have their own dressing/changing room that they didn't have to share with the general public.

Strip Club:
-from what I saw, there were not too many attractive ladies dancing, but the club was full
-free entry with concert ticket purchase

We were pleasantly surprised by the awesome customer service we received in the men's department. We had three associates ask us if we needed help from the moment we walked in the store. Andy swooped in and helped us find two great Calvin Klein suits on sale for under $200! The material was beautiful and the cut of the suit was perfect. He had a keen sense of coordinating shirts with ties that best fit the suits we picked out. We then headed over to the men's shoe dept. Again - the same great experience. We found two pairs of shoes that were marked down 50% with an additional 20% off pre-sale coupon! Our savings for that day were incredible. 

The best part - the friendly helpful unpretentious customer service! And the fact that we were in and out in less than an hour. I bet you men don't hear women bragging about leaving the store in a quick manner too often!  Then again, we weren't shopping for me.",2010-03-24 23:15:08

Again, we got lucky and did not have to wait a ridiculous long line . Our server lacked customer service and had no personality. I knew what I wanted so we ordered right away.
I had their Spicy Tonkotsu with corn. Broth was not as thick as last time but it was not spicy at all. When I asked for hot sauce, they said they did not have any besides the chilly powder on the table and if I wanted chilly paste I would have to pay extra for it (wow). We got two sides, one was the Pork Belly bowl and Gyoza (pot stickers). Pork belly was delicious and the pot stickers were okay.

Place is very lovely looking and decorated to suit the theme.  Very similar to the other ramen houses.  Not too packed on a Saturday night.  Menu had several choices, but tonight we were aiming for spicy.  My friend got the spicy miso and a extra spicy for myself.  *Nice little check-in bonus (1 free drink).  Now the only complaint I have is that we have to add toppings?  I was a little confused since the description for my miso said ground beef.. So I added chashu.  My ramen obviously became expensive now.. Extra cost for extra spicy and chashu.  This bowl of soup better be worth it. 

After several slurps, the spiciness  began to kick in.  Very good tasting broth, but I did not feel like it was anything special.  The spiciness was only a tad more than the regular.  The thick noodles were a nice change since we are used to getting thin types at the other places.

Service was excellent since our waitress was consistently coming around to see if we were doing okay.  

Overall, this place is not bad in my book.  It just that there are plenty of ramen houses in this area.",2013-12-10 22:30:21

What a hidden gem in the land of overpriced strip food.  Feeling slightly under the weather, we ordered a bowl of pho. The chef must have been tutored personally by ramen girl's soup nazi because they have got this down to perfection.  The vietnamese spring rolls are also some of the best I've had.  Only disappointment was the pad thai which was swimming in too much sweet sauce.  But the prices more than make up for the one dish not too our liking.  The dishes are reasonably priced by Vegas Strip standards.  We ordered 2 dishes, an appetizer and a bottle of Sonoma Cutrer and the bill was under $100.

The ambience is cool with comfortable wooden booths next to a water pond.

It almost seemed like they are finally reading Yelp reviews because the service was TOP NOTCH.  We had so much service it was almost overwhelming, but really very much apprecaited.

The food is always amazing here and the service was one of the best we have ever had.  The springs rolls were cooked all the way through this time which was good and the rest of the food was pretty good.  

On the Pad Thai, the chicken was a little dry and on the Pumpkin Curry with Beef, the beef was tough, so unfortunately it seemed like all the meat was a little over cooked but it was still edible.  

This place is good, but it is really hit and miss.  One this trip we had AWESOME service and  just ok food.  Sometimes it is GREAT food and bad service.

anyway, first time in, we got sat near the pool tables. no one greeted us for awhile, but someone finally came by and asked if we had been greeted (he ended up keeping us as a table). he explained all the specials they have, and started drinks for us. after we ordered food, everything came out in a fairly timely manner. although we did wait for our pitcher, it was ok because we were eating and didnt want to fill up on beer anyway. 

overall, a great experience. if you dont mind domestic beer (i personally only drink domestic beer if im playing a drinking game, but hey! $7 for a pitcher isnt bad at all!), its definitely a deal. $7 pitchers every night, as well as other drink specials.

to top it off, my boyfriend left his sunglasses at the table. they were a pair or oakey's that he's had for years! we end up going back to look for them, and sure enough, our server gave them to the manager to hold until we come back. normally people dont do that! ive worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years, and people arent always 100% honest about lost items. but thankfully, they were there. i think that overall made it an even better experience.

Well I've been regretting never having heard of Jiro when I visited Ginza. Definitely had my way with the food in Japan but still...regret. Anyway, imagine my excitement when I heard of Kabuto. And here in Las Vegas! The chefs supposedly hail from the same sushi community as Jiro. Not the same in notoriety but I bet that they take the same pride in their craft. Kabuto claims the fish is just about as fresh, if not fresher, than Jiro's and without the heftier price tag. So if you are a true lover of fish (not the AYCE-sauce-up-my-rolls kind), Kabuto is the real deal.

The place was a bit hard to find since it does not have an overhead sign. It's a small sushi bar that only seats up to 18 people so I would suggest making reservations. Ordered the omakase which at $80 a person, is a great value for the freshest fish in town. The menu varies depending on what assortment of fish is fresh that day. The bar is at table level so you can actually watch your seafood being selected and prepared. What makes this place stand out even more is that there's no clunky refrigerating system at the bar. The produce is in a case which I can only describe as a large box of fishy goodness. 

The meal began with an aperitif of cold sake homemade by the head sushi chef. I was told it contains very little alcohol and is aged for a minimum of six months. There are several rotating flavors and I had peach that evening. Light and sweet, a perfect start to my meal. 
Omakase also includes an appetizer, sashimi, 10 pieces of nigiri, miso soup and dessert. The  sashimi plate had 4 different types of fresh fish. Eat the light fish first and make your way to the darker meat. Each masterfully-made nigiri is meant to be eaten as soon as it is served. Everything that was set in front of me was absolutely divine but the standouts of the evening were the chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) and the anago (sea eel). Both just melt in your mouth.

There's a lot less BS and almost no worries about someone doggin' someone else. Drinks are stiff, even if you're redeeming the complimentary drink passes that the girls get for coming in before a certain time.  Bottles here aren't too pricey.  I tend to come here after dinner with friends who aren't looking to get into something like a club but do want to go out. The view is pretty with all the sparkling lights. I haven't ever had to pay, not me or anybody in my group. I try and make contact with different promoters to get free admission for myself and my group. Of course a lot of that has to do with the ratio of women to men trying to come in but maybe I've just gotten lucky all the dozens of times I've visited.

Ordered the minced pork with sausages on rice - this was alright. $4.50
the 'pang pang fish' ($4.99), which was fried fish skewers was disappointing though. I remember it being a lot more tasty the last time I had.
the porkchop pancake sandwich was disappointing as well. when we ordered we asked to add an egg inside but it was missed. there was so little porkchop in the pancake sandwich. the pancake sandwich texture was flaky but lacked flavor, it was all dependent on the porkchop and a little bit of coleslaw.
the popcorn chicken was good, probably the best dish of the 4 I tried

First time here (and most likely last time) as I usually don't venture up too far north of the city.  Attended a friend's birthday party on Saturday night and apparently lots of other parties happening that night as well, so it seemed like a very happening place.

Wines per glass varied from $10.50 to $19 and bottles from $25 and up.  I had ordered a bottle of red from Sonoma for $35 which I thought was a bargain considering the pricing of the wine list.  The waitress had to come back to confirm my order and when she finally appeared with my bottle I was disappointed it wasn't a full sized bottle but a half sized bottle.  Perhaps it was me not reading correctly,  but I really didn't see any indication of size except bottle written. Guess it was too good to be true a bottle for $35.  It was a decent bottle so I didn't mind too much, but it was definitely not worth the price as I got two glasses out of the bottle.

Since we had a large group we had opted for a prix fixe menu for $40 inclusive of tax and tips which was a great deal. Choice of two different salads or a soup for appetizers and choice of steak, fish (tilapia) or pasta for the mains. No desserts, but choice of tea or coffee included.  It was okay since we had brought our cupcakes and a cake for the birthday girl. 

I had the caesar salad which was well presented and tastewise it was flavourful, not too zesty, and bacon topping cooked to a nice crisp.  For main dish, I had the steak which came with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.   
Upon making my first slice into my steak, I noticed it was not pink in colour which you would expect from a medium steak that I had requested.  It was definitely overcooked, but I was very hungry and took a bite.  After the second bite, I just couldn't stomach it and was hesitant to send the steak back since we already waited a significant time for the mains and I was hungry.  Plus it didn't help that my friends were teasing me to not  send my dish back or they'll spit in my food.

The server was nowhere in sight, so luckily for me the busboy was around and I told him my dilemma and requested a medium steak in exchange for the welldone steak on my plate.

By the time I got my steak, most of my friends were done their meal, and one friend didn't even get his main dish yet, so it was quite the wait.  My second steak was cooked exactly medium to my liking and the busboy followed up  and asked how it was.  No sign of our server anywhere and you would expect it was the server's responsibility to ask how the meal was regardless of the situation. 

Service was a bit sporadic because it was quite busy that night, but when a diner has a wrong food order you would expect them to be more attentive ensuring that everything was okay.

One would expect with an establishment that specializes in prix fixe menu with Dinner Dining Dancing advertised, they would have their service down to perfection. 

The DJ appeared around 10pm and the main dining area was cleared of tables and chairs for the dancing floor.  I've been to many supper clubs in Toronto in the past,  so know what the protocol is, but Marlowe just doesn't seem to know what they're doing.

Dancefloor was busy and the music varied from Spanish, R & B, hip hop and top 40s.....really a mix of everything. Half our group left after the cake cutting, but the remainder of the group stayed and tried to make the most of the night.

Considering the location, wine pricing and lack of service, I most likely won't go back.  The original Marlowe restaurant located on College Street in Little Italy many many years ago was great and they should have just stuck to the restaurant business.",2015-02-24 05:56:01

Despite half the party arriving late, we never felt rushed. The food is a little on the more expensive end compared to some of the Indian restaurants we are used to eating out at in Mississauga, but it makes sense as the restaurant setting and the services is much nicer. 

The menu has a good variety, and the waiters were very accommodating in terms of dietary restrictions (nuts) and spice tolerance (we wanted medium-high, and they warned us approriately so!). The chicken in the chicken curry was nice and tender, the okra was flavourful and had a great texture, but the spinach paneer was definitely the highlight of the four curry dishes that we ordered. It was creamy, rich, and there was a hefty amount of paneer. The naan bread was a little on the light and flaky side, whereas we prefer it a bit more chewy and dense.

Saturday afternoon while I was at work, I received a voicemail from the restaurant asking that I call them back to confirm my reservation.  Naturally, I didn't get the message until 6:30 p.m.   I understand they want to ensure that they're not holding reservations for people who aren't going to show, but I like to use the online service so I don't *have* to call.  Otherwise, I'd just call to begin with, wouldn't I?

I never did call to confirm but we arrived 15 minutes ahead of our reservation time.  They still had our reservation and even seated us immediately!  We were very impressed.  

Someone brought us the traditional complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was delicious!  It had a unique flavor to it.  I think it may have been chargrilled?

I was happy to see that the menu items (drinks and entrees) were reasonably priced considering the restaurant's prime location in the Epicentre in Uptown Charlotte.  There were three different entrees that jumped out at and appealed to me (that's always a good sign for a restaurant!).  I opted for the Green Chile Brisket Tacos.   There were three tacos (more than plenty!).  Additionally, Vida offers you your choice of two side items.  I was very happy to see such unique choices on the side item menu.  Wanting to try something different, I chose the (1) ripe plantain and black bean mash and (2) grilled corn with queso fresco.  The corn was delicious; the mash was just okay.  It was a weird combination, and I think I should have just gotten one or the other by themselves.  

My partner ordered the one thing on the menu that first jumped out at me:  Tortilla Pie with Poblano Cream Sauce.   I was thinking about ordering that without the listed mushrooms.  It's a good thing I didn't, because it was basically ALL mushrooms and I would have been left with just a couple of sad-looking tortillas.  If you love mushrooms, *that's* the dish for you.  It was a tortilla with layer upon layer of mushroom filling topped with another tortilla and then smothered with melted cheese.   It looked good, but wasn't for the mushroom-hater in me.  

The service was great and we were in and out of there quickly, with a lot of extra time before the movie we were going to see.  The interior of the restaurant was nice, too.  It had a modern look to it; nothing ""Mexican"" about it.   I'd definitely return.",2012-01-09 15:01:54

Prime Rib, for the price, was not bad.  Its a rather large piece as a matter of fact.  I couldn't even eat it all.  BUT, its probably because I had about 1 and 1/2 pieces.  I'll tell you that because when the first Prime Rib was delivered, it was cold.  I was so hungry and didn't want to flag down the waiter, I figured, let me just bite into it and deal with it.  Nope, I couldn't.  It wasn't cold as in frozen, just I think it took a while to get to my table.  So, I did eventually flag down the waiter, asked them to warm it, but my waiter kindly gave me a new serving.  It was hot, it was more on the medium I ordered it at, and I was satisfied.  It was served with sides, I got fries and veggies.  The veggies are frozen type, so we all know how frozen veggies taste like, bland.

Today, after I got off work and my tummy was demanding lunch I decided I would give the 5 Guys out in NLV a try. I also heard that this place is teeming with MIUs from Nellis AFB, so that was what really made me make the many mile journey to the North side of town.

Each vegetable did have a different taste the carrots were lemony and the baby cipollini onions were smoky and so on. The fingerlings were prepared well being crispy on the cut side but still showcasing the creamy quality a fingerling is my portions were generous. My Husband enjoyed his hanger steak topped with a basil bacon sauce served with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.

 We really enjoyed the cheese plate, I picked a local non-tangy maybe a goat cheese dusted with fennel pollen , a robiola , a taleggio and another local cheese a havarti all these cheeses were worth the calories all were very good. We also received VERY GOOD tasty bread with the cheese with a side of very soft smoked butter. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS Todd should have told us he was adding on a $4. charge to give us bread with the cheese. WE DIDN'T ORDER or ask for bread OR THEY SHOULD just add $4 to the cheese $12 plate and just make it $16 on the menu so nobody is mad but I do note the bread was very good.

 Linens were crisp and clean silverware and glasses were sparkling. Service was friendly and knowledgeable.

The only thing bad about BYOB ($10 fee) is you might bring a wine that doesn't match your food as we did but we had plenty of time to enjoy the wine between plates and with the cheese.

Next door we found a VERY HARD TO GET Pride Syrah it is always sold out from the winery and the ride to get it is officially the second scariest drive to do in Sonoma. It should be excellent! WOOHOO!",2012-04-01 13:57:14

The place has been completely remodeled and looks great!  It resembles a swanky pizza joint and has the bright airy open feel that the old restaurant in its completely lacked.  It was pretty slow and we were greeted and seated right away.  The guy who seated us must have been one of the owners.  He wasn't exactly friendly.  I asked him how long they were open and he said ""just opened a few days"" as he walked away obviously avoiding small talk.  

As someone else pointed out, the 4 meatballs on the menu are actually 3 slightly larger meatballs.  REPRINT your menus!!  Seriously.  The server seemed completely unenthusiastic about her job.  I'm not asking for Hard Rock Cafe enthusiasm (any of you who've ever eaten there know what I mean, they are WAY too happy to be real servers), but at least smile and be friendly.   And another thing, I'm a firm believer in  complete full disclosure upfront, especially if your food menu is as short and simple as Meatball Spot's.  If you are out of something as popular as fries, please tell me now and don't wait til I've decided to order them and have worked up an appetite and imagination of delicious golden garlic butter covered fries melting in my mouth.  Seriously.  

Anyway, we ordered the beef meatballs, and they were actually really good.  Tender, juicy and the spicy meat sauce was great too.  The portion for lunch was perfect, though I wish they would have given me just one more piece of garlic bread.  The food was good and I'd probably grab lunch there again since I work at Town Square, but I wouldn't go there for dinner and I'd never suggest it to anyone.  While I have no complaints about the food, the menu overall was very boring and lacked anything that would make it last and stand out.  These are just plain normal meatballs you could make at home if you have any basic skills in the kitchen.  The staff overall lacked personality, resulting in a very dull atmosphere. 

Granted, this was a 45-minute lunch experience so I'd give it another shot, however, with the fast pace of restaurants coming in and out of that spot, I'm at a loss as to why all the hard work would go into opening a restaurant and not putting your absolute best foot forward.  I'd be watching my staff like a hawk and making sure I have friendly, enthusiastic, outgoing people.  Also, they really need to be on point, which means reprint your damn menus if you're now only serving 3 instead of 4 meatballs. It just looks SO terrible on YOU, especially since you're a new restaurant and judgy annoying people like me are going to be judging you up and down as if you're the new makeover project on Queer Eye for a Straight Guy.

While it is filled with English-style decorations that make for a quaint interior, it's nothing impressive. What is impressive, however, is their seafood.

They have such a large selection of seafood, from scallops and shrimps to their signature Alaskan halibut. With a restaurant renowned for its variety of seafood, I was tempted to try as many as possible. They allow you to do this with their Fisherman's Platter, which includes battered halibut, haddock, shrimp, and scallops. It was fried, crispy, goodness. For $16, it was great value considering the portion size. 

For those that want cheaper options, there's a lunch special for haddock and chips that costs only $5.95 for takeout and $7 for dine-ins. Why the difference in price?- I have no clue. 

While they specialize in battered seafood, they also have plenty of grilled options. And they do more than just fries for sides - they also have a variety of salads, as well as baked potatoes.

Oh yeah, and the food's good too, so that doesn't hurt.

We've been a few times now and always have a great time.  I personally feel the food is a little on the expensive side at around $20 an entree, but that's not too pricey.  Most of the food is very good, although I've had one or two things that I would put into the ""just okay"" category.  They also have lots of dinner specials every night, so if you don't see anything on the menu that appeals to you they might have a special that you'd like better.  Dinner also comes with a pretty well-stocked salad bar, so that's a plus.

He's well known in San Francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of Tony's Pizza Napoletana. My first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all I could recall. I guess the pizza was less than memorable. 

A local B-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in Vegas? Why do I have a feeling this is a setup for failure. It's just a feeling. First, the good. I like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. They are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. The Cal Italia, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. It was also crowned the winner of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. The crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. The sweet fig preserve and balsamic reduction paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run. 

The bad. The menu is way too large. I tried the burrata burger, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. I could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. The meatballs and truffle fries were average.

The ugly. The margherita, the supposed World Pizza Cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. I know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. It was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. All I could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. A wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. The saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress. 

I like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. For a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. Street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around Pizza Rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). Oh, I also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. To be fair, I cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol.

Came here with a few girl friends for dinner on Monday evening. We arrived before the dinner rush so it was nice to see what the place looked like. Sure it's not large like other dinner values but it is beautiful. 

The drinks look just as good as they taste. Anything from alcoholic to non alcoholic to Kombucha. I strongly recommend the Iced Teas. Everything is meant to be shareable. They have recommendations based on group sizes but you're obviously welcome to get whatever your heart contents. 

We started with the mussels which were AMAZING. I think the added ewas the sauce that came with it. We also got to Roy Thai dumpling platter. The flavours were really refreshing and paired quite well. Then we had the Sea Bream. Added bonus is that they take out the fish bones and leave nothing but meat and ginger and garlic near the head. Again, they provide that green sauce to pour over the fish when you eat it with the lettuce leaves. 

Kua Hang Gai + jasmine rice was suppose to best of the best. However, my friend and I felt a little underwhelmed by the dish. It had nothing memorable to it. It lacked flavours and spices. I didn't even have a tang of spicy which was unfortunate since that what we were looking forward to most. 

Although the chicken dish didn't live up to OUR expectations doesn't mean it won't for you. It's definitely a place to try at least once. I do plan to return and try other dishes on the menu.

Things going for this place: Clean, spacious, friendly staff, they provide shampoo/soap in the showers, varied class times and varied instructors.

I really recommend trying out a few different nights and finding the instructors you like best. For me it's Alex and Julia. They are actually both quite different with different styles (Julia being very positive and relaxed and Alex a bit more strict) but I really feel like I get a lot out of their classes. 

The one thing I hate about ALL yoga places is the price, and this place is of course no different.

Been going for almost two months and I can still just barely touch my toes (no fault of the instructors!!) but I feel I am making progress and I think I am a yoga convert!!",2011-03-24 15:30:57

It's what everyone wants - a little bakery/breakfast/market/coffeeshop sort of place. It was empty when I went there around 4pm on a Thursday, but this place probably gets slammed for lunch and breakfast. 

Everyone wets their damn pants over Le Grande Orange and that place isn't so much more special than this. They appear to have really good food and the people there were all pretty nice and friendly. Now I really want to have a bad time there so I know what everyone's complaining about. 

Anyway - only been there once, so apart from the name sucking - I like it and I'll try it again and revise my review later if things change.",2008-01-05 03:07:12

Overall, even though I do semi-agree with the 3-stars overall this place has received, I personally would give them 4 stars.

MABU actually limits your time on weekends to roughly 90 minutes as it gets soo packed that people line up out the door.  Seating is very packed if you do not get a private booth and you're sitting at one of the tables where the couches are shared.

The menu is soo extensive and each dish I've gotten was well-made and I've finished all my food here.
I love their little hotpot concept where each hotpot comes with set ingredients and they light a little fire underneath to boil it in front of you (ask for another cube if you don't think your food is being cooked properly).
I always get the House Special Hotpot, even though it is a little pricey - it is much better than Spicy Mafia's.

The service is spotty.  There is one girl worker who is always on top of her game and you can see her scurrying around trying to get sh*t done.  The staff also loves to yell ""WELCOME"" whenever a new customer walks in, so don't be shocked if you can't understand and they scream every couple of minutes. 

Do not get the drinks here though.  Get them next door at ShareTea or inside the food court - much better.

Overall, don't get overwhelmed by the menu, feel free to ask for extra cubes for the hotpots, expect slow service, and come during downtime.",2017-02-20 19:41:13

The wings were goosed in a ""sweet chili"" sauce. I thought they would have a little bit of kick to them but they were very good. The wings were crispy and juicy. 
The wrap had turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, and tomato with mayo. It was filled with turkey. It was very tasty. It came with a side of seasoned steak fries. They could have been abut crisper but they had great flavor.

First of all, this restaurant is beautiful. I love the high ceilings and the vibe - it's dark, and noisy, and so much fun. It's the perfect place to go on a Friday or Saturday night with a group of friends for a late dinner and some drinks! 

Now let's talk FOOD! 

We started with the seafood platter which is beautiful and was perfect for our group of four. From there, we had the BBQ plate (because when in Rome), for three, plus the Mac & Cheese with Brisket (YUM!!!), and a few of the sides. The cornbread is moist and basically to die for, and the beets made even our beet-hating companion change his mind. 

I would say that I think the BBQ sauces they serve with the meat platter are almost unnecessary, I ended up completely avoiding them and absolutely loving my meal. 

To top it all off, the service was fantastic - we were celebrating an anniversary so sparkling was brought for everyone, and it stayed consistently great the whole not. Attentive, but not overbearing, you know?

There are four crab sliders. Each crab patty is placed in between small Hawaiian rolls topped with a different sauce.

Slider 1 - Pico de Gallo and Chipotle Aioli:  I wasn't expecting this slider to give my mouth a spicy kick, but it did. 

Slider 2 - Tarragon Caper Mayo: Surprisingly creamy, and I enjoyed the flavorful combination of the tarragon and capers. 

Slider 3 - Tartar Sauce: Out of the four sliders, this was my least favorite because of the tartar sauce, which, in general, I don't like. Each slider has a unique sauce/topping, but this one was predictable.

Slider 4 - Dynamite Sauce: My favorite one out of the four. The sauce had a bold, spicy taste. To me, it captured the perfect level of spiciness (can I just order four of these on my next visit?). 

As good as the sliders were, I was still hungry for more food after I finished them off. This might be something to order if you plan on eating light, but don't expect to become satiated from these. 

I still think the service at this restaurant is hit-or-miss. A few visits before my most recent, I noticed waitresses arguing and swearing (take it to the alley!), and some who just seem indifferent about serving customers.

Whether you are vegetarian, vegan or not this is a wonderful place to get some grub. The entire staff is incredibly friendly and helpful whenever I venture in for breakfast or lunch.  There are lots of new faces here now, but the service and friendly vibe are all still in full force. They always seem to know everyone. They have a dedicated following, but they are just as nice to new comers. I try and bring all of my friends and family even though none are vegetarian.
  They have seriously killer breakfast foods. The top being the Lumber Jack Sandwich though their breakfast specials have never disappointed me. Be on the lookout for their special pancakes and the vegetarian ""Sausage Biscuits"" and gravy. My personal favorite lunch food is the RAW Tacos which have walnut taco meat ( yeah I know it's still fantastic).  They are the offspring of amazingly delicious mexican food and a salad.  If you don't know what to get just ask. They are always super helpful at explaining things and making great suggestions or just get something from the vegan desert case everything is awesome.

- RAW Tacos
- Mocha
- Breakfast Specials
- Passion Juice
- Chocolate Banana Muffins
- Snickers Bars

My most recent trip was to the bar for happy hour, a happy hour I have experienced in the past - but with drinks only. This time I went with an empty belly, ready to eat and drink.

Ordered - Their quite famous Comme Ca burger, and it was delicious. Ordered medium well and I asked to have them hold back on the amount of fries. As noted by my friend with whom I was dining, she mentioned the sheer amount of fries they put on the plate would be overwhelming. 

The burger was simply delicious and not too big, nor too small. It was quite perfect actually. It comes with two sauces - a white kind, not sure what it was, and ketchup. The french fries were so on spot I cannot say a bad thing about them. I ate all of them. *FATTY* - No really, I hardly ever eat all the fries that are presented to me at restaurants, but I could not resist these ones.

Drinks - I ordered from their 18A cocktail menu. Both drinks I had were vodka based - the first being a minty refreshing concotion made with a splash of champagne and the second was the aviation, a drink I commonly order at cocktail bars. Comme Ca did me good with both drinks.

Came here on a Saturday night at around 7pm. I made a reservation ahead of time but it wasn't really needed as there were empty tables throughout the night. $26.95 on weekends for AYCE and they were still running their 15% off grand opening special. Tablet ordering system which is very easy to follow. I didn't like how they didn't really have booth seating for more privacy. Also didn't like how when the doors opened the cool air would come in even though we were seated in the back of the restaurant.

Overall the food was good. The sashimi was fresh and sliced to decent sizes. As for the foods that were cooked they came out hot and fresh as well. 

Some things I noticed about the food: 
- the beef ribs were really fatty
- there was no beef sashimi on the menu :(
- the torched sushi did have a torched taste but I didn't really care for the torched flavour
- the tempura shrimps were nice and crispy
- the escargot were small and the taste was overpowered by the cheese and mushroom
- the fried salmon belly was really tasty
- the mussels were also large and tasted fresh
- the seaweed used on the eel hand roll was so fresh and crispy and tasted great
- the scallop sashimi which is only available on weekends were small and didn't really taste that great or even that fresh. I would not come here just because they have scallop sashimi.
- shrimp sashimi were also very small but tasted A-Okay
- the desserts which consisted mostly of ice cream were very good

In terms of service I thought it was above average for a Japanese AYCE. They hired enough staff, food arrived in a timely manner and we got all our orders except one.

Semi casual Italian restaurant, off the strip, that caters to locals!  Not sure if they offer the menu at 1/2 price for locals year round, but during our visit it was still going on!  That's EVERYTHING on the regular menu at half price for locals!

We supplemented the RW menu with Calamari Fritti ($15 / $7.50 for locals): Fried calamari and Spicy Tomato Sauce. This was good, very tender pieces of squid. Lightly breaded with not much flavor/seasoning...almost plain!  Wish these was a bit more zing/kick in the flavor dept.

The Complimentary bread...nothing crazy here, but the pesto/olive oil combo was nice.  I dipped the calamari in it to add flavor lol.

Tasting of Agnolotti : Ravioli Filled with Spinach, Mascarpone, Ricotta, Mortadella, and Tear-Drop Tomato Sauce. Good, but wish there was more to the tasting lol.  They gave up one ravioli, so it was a pretty light portion.

Tasting of Gnocchi Bolognese : House Made Potato Dumplings with Bologna Meat Sauce. This was perfect! The dumplings were super soft, tender and meat sauce was flavorful! This was the highlight of the night for me actually, and I would come back for this dish alone!  Gnocchi doesn't usually do too much for me, but this actually wow'd me!

Mista del Casa: Mixed Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was actually pretty good, coming from someone that doesn't enjoy eating salad lol. Simple but flavorful salad.

Caprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil. I only tasted the Mozzarella, which was good. Not my kind of dish.

For main entrees, Osso Buco ($45 or $22.50 for locals): The House Specialty, Veal Shank Braised in Red Wine Reduction and Faro. This was super tender, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth! Sauce was a good consistency, but a bit rich...couldn't finish it!  Tried the bone marrow...ok, but I guess I am not a huge marrow fan.

Pollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, a bit heavy on the capers with a strong mustard taste, but good overall.

And for dessert, a Tasting of Tiramisu and Cannoli. Tiramisu wasn't overly strong tasting, but good overall. Cannoli had a crisp shell and light filling...good! 

Service was very friendly, and our waiter even entertained Little Foodie Dude while he ate :P

Prices would be great if you are local, and fair if you aren't...just not as much bang for your buck on certain dishes.  Go with the pasta since everything is made in house!  Give em a try :P

KbgSRZgC1oS_itlpeWxGzA,7eKtHkxxWvI465WbDJj4dw,xrFL7DL5SisPMWDarg52pA,4,3,1,0,"I like this place!!!! 

My parents are not adventurous in the realm of food, so getting them to try ramen is a huge step for humanity. 

When I saw the 3.5 rating here, I was a bit iffy but I'm glad we came. I love that we could tweak the fat/oil/spicy levels for the Kyouka Ramen bowl, and it really does make a huge difference when you ask for ""less fat"" because you don't see the globules of fat floating in your soup. 

I also really liked the texture and thickness of the noodle. Most ramen places use that round, squiggly ramen, which is fine and dandy because it sure fills me up, but the flatter type of ramen they got here was wonderful and didn't make me feel bloated. Moroever, this flatter ramen holds the seasoning and soup better, meaning you get a party in your mouth when you eat it. 

Usually ramen places give you really fat chashu but this place was 85% lean!! 

So why a deduction? Please, do yourself a favour and NEVER get the shrimp tempura. They obviously didn't follow the 3-second rule because that shrimp came out more fried than the KFC I had 2 weeks ago. The batter was crunchy to the max, and it wasn't even lightly battered. It was like they wanted to see how much batter they could fit on the shrimp before the weight rips the body from the tail. $6 for 3 deep-fried shrimp is a total rip. 

Service was wonderful here and everyone was attentive. I like the quiet atmosphere that was here. 

Def recommend for ramen, and would love to come back. Don't order the tempura.",2017-08-18 02:08:37

While the dressing/lettuce/banana flower part of the salad was fine, what they served as ""chicken"" was absolutely ridiculous!
Have you ever made chicken broth from scratch? You boil a chicken until the meat is falling off the bone, let it cool, then pick through the pot....pulling out bones, cartilage and skin. Well THAT is what the ""chicken"" in my salad consisted of.....bones, cartilage and skin! I seriously could not believe it....there was NO chicken meat of ANY kind! Just the scraps that one would normally throw away.
I called the older gentleman that had waited on us over and showed him the bones and skin, to which he replied, ""Oh, well next time tell us you want it without bones and skin."" 
Um, excuse me? Is this guy for real? 
If you're going to serve nothing but bones, skin, and cartilage, then you should call it a chicken BONE or chicken SKIN banana blossom salad, so that people understand what you are actually intending on serving them!  
I was cool when he said this at first, thinking that I may have just hit a bad patch in the salad, but with my very next bite it was exactly the same thing....a big, splintery chicken bone with absolutely ZERO meat on it, covered by a pile of lettuce, chicken skin, and banana blossoms. 
To their credit, when I finally realized that enough was enough and sent it back, they were VERY accomodating and made me a different salad, right away. 
I think it was a shrimp pork salad, and it was very tasty.
I also noticed several of the employees huddled around the chicken bone salad that I had sent back. They were speaking vietnamese? thai? to what I'm assuming was the cook and pointing at the bones and skin, so OBVIOUSLY this was not actually the way that this salad was supposed to be served. And I must admit that I think it's a good sign that they actually checked it out, and LOOKED at what was going on with the salad, instead of just writing me off as a pain-in-the-ass customer, because atleast it shows that they care about the food they are serving. And hell, anyone can make a mistake.
In fact, I'd probably have only given them one star, except for the fact that they actually seemed concerned.
My boyfriend ordered Pad See Ew. He said it was okay. Not the best he's ever had, but certainly edible.

However, the aspect that really makes this park great is the fact that you can promenade about while taking in the sights.  I guess I wish it was a little bit larger or had more areas to explore, but it is a really premier park.  The fact that it is connected to the Little Sugar Creek Greenway only makes it better.

They should stop skimping on the coleslaw, because really, the portions are already small as it is.  The pulled pork that came with the small platter was condiment sized.

Well Snooze, knowing that I can get my hash browns the way I want them kicks you up a star. In addition, it was my first time eating at the outside tables and wow, it was so nice outside, what a great way to start the day.",2016-04-14 03:33:20

Since it's small plates (for not a small price) menu/a la carte model, I've tried quite a bit of things here ranging from daily specials to trusted/all the time items. I can't say I've really ever loved one thing very much. First red flag when going to a nice restaurant is when you can see a block of butter sitting on top of your sea food. It doesn't take a genius to realize butter makes everything taste good, so if you just drown your food in butter your guests are sure to love it. I realize that's common for veggies and for lower end restaurants, but I really expect more at an establishment that is bordering a nice dining experience. Their ambiance and decor is spot on, as it gives the illusion you're at a really fancy place, but the food is just not great. What happened to being inventive with flavor parings? Savory and sweet and getting creative? Literally 3/5 dishes I got were simply drowned in butter. The cauliflower special was decent, but it was literally charred cauliflower with loads of a Parmesan type cheese shredded over it. Second oldest trick in the book, douse your food in cheese and it magically tastes great. I could have gone to a Mexican restaurant if I was looking to get that. The best dish was the bok choy special, as it had sausage and another suspicious oil base it was submerged in, but I did actually like the sausage flavor (even it I doubt it even had 5 leaves of bok choy). I think if the price were much lower you'd understand what you were getting into, but overall I felt fat and stuffed after leaving, and didn't particularly love anything. The duck I had before was way too gamey, and they had no flavorful sauce to challenge the taste. Same with hangar steak this time, the sauce was literally worse that just eating the meat plain. Not sure if they do any marinating or dry rubs (highly doubt it since it literally tasted plain) but that would be a good thing for them to get into. I gave them 3 because they support farmers and have nice ambiance, but the food deserves a 2. The waitress had literally no personality and we might as well have had a robot wait on us. If that was the case, I'll bet the robot would have been more responsive and attentive. It took 2 of us (who actually were trying to hurry) over an hour for us to leave (clock starting after we were seated). It was very late on a Thursday and hardly anyone else there. I think waiting 15 minutes after bringing water to return may have been the first set back, but also only bringing beans for the first 20 minutes after ordering is what probably did us in. I any case, definitely recommend Bricktops which is right around the corner, and I've yet to have a bad meal in the 6x I've gone, and they are very similar in pricing. I think they pride themselves on cocktails and had a lot of wines, spend $90 this time without even trying any. Ouch.",2017-04-21 20:07:10

The lack of check ins is a reflection of my phone dying or me leaving it in the car -_- i prefers the Tivoli Village location because its prettier and less crowded - oh! and less kids :D 

There is always plenty of parking in the garage either so you can avoid the hot hot sun or the cold of winter. When you walk into the restaurant, the hostess is always there with a smile and walking you to your table immediately. 

I really like the waiters here, because you can tell they're a team and they're always looking out for each other. Whenever it does get kind of busy, and our waiter is running around, another waiter from another section will come help us or tend to our needs. They always saying they're helping each other out, which is nice to see. At the other location in Town Square, other waiters are always ignoring us unless we're their table. 

The lobster bisque is really good and not too fishy tasting. I personally like penne pasta with vodka sauce. They don't have it on the menu though - they have another type of noodle with cheese in it with the vodka sauce. I always ask for the penne vodka though, and they are always more than willing to accomodate and ask the chef for me. I always add shrimp too! Makes me feel like someone important because theyre doing something off the menu for me haha

We decided to come here for a happy hour since this is the first time. By the time we left, around 7pm, I was surprised how crowded this place got despite the raining/windy weather and possible tornado outside (yeah, we had a tornado warning here in the phoenix area!!)

We sampled out 6 dishes in total (two of us, yes, we eat a lot and want to try), here is the little summary:
+Chibi Burger - the cutest burger I've ever seen! The meat was very well cooked, very juicy, along with the slight taste of wasabi, yum!
+Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll - fresh fish and refreshing taste!
+Butterfish Tataki - delicious little piece of butterfish with white asparagus and Yuzu, we should've ordered two!
+Robata Grilled Unagi - the unagi was grilled to the perfection, so soft,  and you can feel it melts in your mouth - heaven!
+Fried Soft Shell Crab with Mixed Green - the crab was really good, but didn't really like the chili dressing, it tasted kinda sour to me.
+Rice Hot Pot with Japanese mushrooms - we didn't order this until we saw the waiter brought it to the next table, we were amazed by how the rice was cooked and decided to give a shot (it's on the regular menu). The rice was mixed with four kinds of japanese mushrooms and beans in a light miso broth, very flavorful, but I thought it was a bit too salty (i do eat less salty than majority of my friends)

Drinks:
+Tanuki Peach, signature cocktail - Shochu with peach puree, sweet and fruity, a great fresh start of the meal
+Japanese Pomelo Lemonade - this is NOT your typical lemonade from any other restaurants, they're made from the Japanese pomelo juice (a citrus fruit) with lemons, very citrusy, my friend liked it a lot. They waitress told us they imported the juice directly from Japan. And it's $7 per glass, even more expensive than a martini!

The layout is really interesting, with the bar in the centre of the restaurant. There are lots of booths, including big ones for larger parties. There are also regular tables and high tops with bar stools.

The restaurant and the washrooms are always very clean and tidy.

Every time we've been there, the service has been good and the staff are always very friendly and attentive.

The menu isn't large, but there are quite a few interesting options. I love that on Sunday and Monday they have all their pizzas for $10 and that includes the option of a gluten-free crust.

Some of our favourites are the 3-meat cowboy pizza which has pepperoni, bacon, sausage, mushrooms and corn. I didn't think I'd be a big fan of the corn on there but it works. We also love the social bowls, which are with rice, veggies and a protein (the tuna is amazing). These also offer a low carb option where you get cabbage instead of the rice. 

The drinks are a reasonable price and the house wine is pretty good for around $20 a bottle.

We have yet to try the brunch on the weekend, but I'll update my review when we do.

The thing that I do like about this location is that there is an upstairs and downstairs, and in the warm months, you can sit right outisde. Granted, you're overlooking a CTrain track, so I'm not sure how nice of view that really is, but hey, at least you're outside. Anyway, with two levels, tons of seating, and pretty good service this place earns its three stars even if I found everything else to unremarkable. 

The menu is a typical bar-food with a fancy twist and the drinks aren't anything to write home about. There are specials every day (with wing night on Monday and 1/2 price wine on Tuesday) including some (limited) hapy hour drinks. Although, yes, you do need to enter near the CTrain, inside the establishment is clean, well-lit and not very noisy.

I got an appetizer and a few drinks, so I can't comment too much about the food except that the sushi cones were good (although all together unremarkable.) I probably wouldn't go here for dinner, to be honest, as I wasn't really impressed and the prices are fairly high.

In general, this place goes on my list of decent places to take work contacts, but beyond that I don't think I would go again. In general, I would probably go back to James Joyce over Moxie's for that sort of atmosphere anyway.",2014-12-18 19:14:53

Since AMC bought the theatre it's gotten better than when it was independently owned (sadly).  The food prices are still obscene. But equal in obscenity to any other movie venue around. But $5 matinees are a wonderful idea, and I'm glad that AMC is sticking with this concept in mid-sized markets.

I recommended Max's to my friend to have his birthday celebration at. As the only Filipino there, everyone asked me what to get. Remembering what my relatives in the Philippines told me, I advised them to try the fried chicken. I followed that same advice and got the Half Chicken Dinner. 

The chicken's skin was good, great even. It was seasoned to perfection and I couldn't get enough of it. I can't say the same for the actual meat, though. While still satisfactory, it was on the dry side and wasn't special. I was surprised with how little rice they provided with the dish. Anyone that knows a Filipino knows how important rice is to every dish, yet the portion of rice given was only a little more than five spoonfuls.

I don't think either of us has ever felt that full in our lives! Haha If you have the opportunity to it might be nice to have a ride to pick you up after your experience meal. We were joking that we wish we would have taken an Über because we felt so food drunk after all of that food. It didn't seem like much at the time, but it was very filling and well worth the price for a special occasion date night.

I had the caipirinha which was good and hubby had the Asian Pear martini - which was very refreshing.  We were called to our table and, even though my husband had asked to sit next to me, they sat us at a small table where they then turned it on the longer side so we could sit next to one another.  Thankfully we like each other because we were definitely in each others space all night during dinner.  It really got to us when a couple came in 1/2 hour after us, no reservation and they get the 4-top right next to us and they sat next to each other.  Nice way to treat a reservation!  We had the Tuna Carpaccio (very good), the calamari tempura (eh, fried very crisp but the sauce wasn't great), Tuna and avocado Poke (very yummy).  We had ordered 2 rolls for dinner and a Sashimi plate with a side of rice.  They brought out the rice right away - and I had to send it back otherwise it would have gotten cold waiting on the entrees.  We got the Sashimi and it really was very fresh and tasty.  We had the black cod, yellowtail, ahi tuna and salmon.  Dude -- very fresh and really great cuts of fish.  We scarfed down the plate in no time.  We ordered hot sake as well and it comes in little baby bottles.  You would think it was made out of gold.  Then the waiter came by and asked if there was anything else we wanted -- he had forgotten our rolls.  Ok, just make us another sashimi plate -- yum.  Yes, it was that good to order it again.  

The food was good, the place is very pretty but there really is no one managing the place thats a ""grown up"".  The girls at the hostess stand were way too young to call the shots and the waitstaff is very young as well -- they need a manager.  I think there are alot of places out there where you can get really good fresh Sushi. The service here really lacked -- and this place is not cheap.  Oh, and hey guys?

We had dinner here before seeing Miss Saigon at the Four Seasons.
I like the menu here.  It's small but creative.  They even have a pre-theater special (2 courses for $32, 3 courses for $42).

I was going to go for the special, but I had heard the burgers could rival some of the best in the city.

Dude, it's a $44 dollar burger.  
What makes a burger worth $44 dollars?

* A 9 oz patty of ""forked wagyu brisket burger""
* It's got foie gras.  Everything is better with foie gras.
* Pancetta  (not as exciting as foie gras)
* Truffle Mayonnaise (equally exciting as foie gras)

Now that's what I call a fk'n fantastic burger!!!
It's fat on fat on fat and oh so good.

The burger was fall apart soft, fat-marbled, juice dripping deliciousness.  I don't exactly know what they do to wagyu cows but they end up as damn good burgers.

I finally scored a dinner reservation for Saturday night and overall, I had a good time.  I tried the carmelized onion soup, tourtiere, steak main, brussel sprouts, and something for dessert that I can't remember.  The setting was nice, as we had seating upstairs overlooking the floor below.  It was dark, a bit rustic, and minimalist.  I like ambience because they don't try too hard.  The service was great and I enjoyed the carefully selected beer selection that had some excellent European and Quebec options.  

The food was well prepared and presented nicely.  They don't over season their mains and have a very eclectic menu that should have something for everyone, including vegetarian options.  My only complaint was the cut of steak I had.  It was the shoulder or something and it was a little bit overdone and tougher than I would prefer, but the béarnaise sauce and mushrooms were nice.  The tourtiere was great and the soup reminded me of a classic French onion, and also tasty.  They apparently bake all their bread fresh in house as well, but I found the bread the same as anywhere else. 

Like others, I did find the menu a bit pricey so I can't really say I was blown away for the price.

I do note what I tried might have differed from what others had. I am Not saying Holsteins is a bad burger as it was OK and Good but for a high priced burger I was expecting the beef  patty a full fat one to taste better with more flavor and juice than when I cook a 93% lean burger at home.

I got the Fungi Burger. I was expecting more mushrooms than onions but it was mostly onions that were very good I add. I upgraded the aged sirloin beef to wagu style since I buy this meat once in a while and it's very good. My burger was juicy enough but did lack flavor. I was expecting it to taste really good and beefy. I liked the study well sized bun but my sweet potato fried seemed old.

My husband had a dry aged sirloin burger with bacon , goat cheddar cheese and arugula. He had to send back his bun because it was hard as a rock. We laughed about it with the waiter and got a new one fast. His medium rare burger was lacking in taste and was oddly juiceless.

Had the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow! The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big béarnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon).

Had the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates.
My friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert.

The cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car!
My friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert.

All in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum. We agreed though that we'd give it another chance based on the scallops alone.

But I decided to give Paese a try during the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion and had a lovely dinner with a good friend. 

The place is modern and elegant. I really liked the square tables at the back and made a mental note to remember this place the next time I am planning something with a big group. Square (or round) tables make so much more sense for groups, as everyone can see and talk to each other. With those long rectangular ones, you end up just talking to the people in your immediate vicinity. Anyways...

We had:
- Waiter brought some baguette and carrot (and something else?) spread to the table. 

- Pear and gorgonzola salad - nice, classic
- Meatballs - they were HUGE. This was a bit of a mistake because I was full before the main course! Delicious blend of flavours -- I could really taste the pecorino. 

- Lamb striploin - came with a nice chickpea mash. 
- Arctic char - with pistachio, carrot, lemon ferro. A light, simple dish. 

- Pistachio and brown butter cake - we both found this a tad dry
- Affogato - the winner of the evening! A dish of chestnut gelato (just divine!), served with a tiny cup of espresso that you pour over the gelato yourself. I've never had anything like it and it was a wonderful contrast. It comes with a huge cherry and dark chocolate chip cookie that was warm and soft, as all cookies should be. But it was so big, I took it home. 

I had a glass on the pinot grigio and our server brought over the sommelier to help my friend choose something to go with her lamb (Chianti). Apparently, this is a great place to go if you really know wine, but I don't. 

We stayed for ~4 hours and nobody rushed us out, which was nice (if it was really busy though, we would've given up our table out of courtesy). They only brought the bill when we asked for it. 

I will probably be back to try the pasta and to get the affogato again!

This is a fun, urban-feeling breakfast spot that reminds my husband and I of indie places we loved in Chicago. They are few and far between here in Vegas. The food is huge and great, always good for a second meal to go. 

What prompts me to finally write the review is the experience we had today. We took our kids for the first time. It was quiet, since it was early on a Monday, so we didn't feel bad about subjecting our loud pre-schoolers to too many people. Unexpectedly our 4 yo daughter had a seizure, which we are used to handling. The couple next to us was surprised by it but very kind, and the servers were helpful, offering a cool towel and to-go containers for our food. A wonderfully kind patron even quietly handled our bill amidst the chaos. 

While I don't specifically recommend having a medical event in the restaurant, I am thankful it was probably the second best place to being home this morning. Thanks so much to Squeeze Inn for being a great place to eat and for being so helpful today. Support them and get some delicious brunch!",2017-03-06 20:17:58

Curry
Tikka Masala
Buttered Chicken
Mango Chicken
Naan

Now be warned, several of the dishes, from my sampling of the menu, are essentially identical with perhaps a slight twist that makes it different based on a technicality. It's akin to two soups being different because one has mushrooms but the other one doesn't. 

You can't go wrong using naan with the four dishes I listed, their naan is soft and not too thick or thin (though I've had friends say they thought it was on the thin side).

I am not a huge fan of the mango lassi that they make here. It's got a little too much milk and not enough mango. 

The chai tea here is decent, but don't get it to go. I've heard that the lunch buffet here is good, but can't make it over here during to daytime to check it out.",2013-01-29 02:06:56

RWvzyCkdSFXu4NuszgIdeg,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,VEFtI92ux6Q9PwMMrm0T-g,5,6,4,6,"Welp, I still haven't tried any of the macarons, croissants, basque cakes, tarts, eclairs, or mousses. 346 Patisserie has earned my interest from frozen delights alone.

The impetus for the fifth star is the aggregate result of seeing many different, delightful flavors from week to week. Like a certain place that many people loved, they are inventive when other gelato shops may have more rigid menus. As I've mentioned, they rotate flavors out on a regular basis (for pastries as well), and they've even had a purely savory ghost pepper gazpacho, something that I don't think ""the other place"" even tried. My favorite flavors so far are balsamic, cinnamon struesel with pecan, Earl grey sorbet, and passion fruit & apricot sorbet.

Having asked Amber a lot of questions, this layperson has learned a lot about their creations. They consider themselves to be the only place in town making the bases for their gelati and such from scratch, whereas others buy a base and add to it. They also experiment with different speeds of spinning the desserts (gelato = slowest spin, ice cream = faster, sorbet = fastest) to bestow what they feel is the best texture for the ingredients, regardless of whether it's a ""gelato base."" In my experience, this really does give them a lot of control over their product, and different flavors really do have subtly different mouthfeels. On that note, I've failed to detect icy flaws in their products in the past two visits, which I'll chalk up to being an improvement instead of just dumb luck.

I've started to consider doing a custom order. They ask for a minimum of two pints an order (which can be split with a friend if you find one), so if you really enjoy something, you . If you give them a week, you can even request something not currently in their repertoire (aka flavor catalogue). People who don't live nearby will be delighted to know that if you order in advance, they might even throw your delights into an extra-cold freezer so that you won't end up with a dessert soup when you reach home.

Overall, it's just been relaxing to be able to hop on their regularly updated web site, head over to sample whatever gelati and sorbetti pique my interest, and pick out whatever appeals most to my taste buds at that time. 346 Patisserie definitely holds it own against the other currently active Vegas-area gelato shops because of their flavor variety and execution, and it's just a bonus that they're a convenient drive for Henderson residents like me.

(QUICK UPDATE 3/26/15: Finally did try something else today: macarons. Black and white truffle was pretty interesting, a little sweet but not cloyingly. Citrus cilantro had a nice lime flavor that kicked in during the second half for me. They had a little crispness and a pleasant chew.)

(QUICK UPDATE 3/28/15: Half-sized scoops! This is a formidable option that is only outmatched by one other local gelato shop that I can think of. You can pretty much get double the flavors for the same price. A full scoop of jasmine green tea and half scoops of pecan caramel, lychee rose, ginger wasabi, and angel food cake all made their way into my order, and I enjoyed everything. Oh, and sampling my friend's frozen honey strands was also a treat.)",2015-03-20 00:08:18

As a Korean tradition, no meal is without its banchan. They serve about six of these side dishes and seem happy to refill as you please. Usually it's kimchi, some bean sprout, something tofu, dried fish etc.

-- Great bartending.  My bartender was 100% on his game, even though the bar was full.
-- $4 White Bag Special.  Order a white bag special and you get the bartender's choice.  He'll select a canned craft beer, place it in a white paper bag and plop it down in front of you.  Taking chances can be fun, and it's a good time trying to guess what it is that you're drinking before you take a peek at the label.

I rolled in tonight for a quiet girl chat night with a good friend of mine. It was unassuming and very clean - decor wasn't what I was expecting, but I was ok with that. The two mega loud grannies in the corner were a bit of a pain - I couldn't hear my friend talking over those 2 whose voices were so loud - did I really need to know your grand daughter got the type of medical procedure that most Christians despise while she was studying abroad? NO. I really didn't. And you really did not need to repeat that word over and over again.

The woman serving us was very sweet and very prompt with water - my glass was never empty! Definite plus in my book.

We decided to get an appetizer that was 'spicy'. I wish I had been paying attention to what the appetizer was called...ugh. It was pleasant enough to make me happy.

I wasn't too thrilled with my main dish - pad thai. It came with chicken and 2 pieces of shrimp - it looks so scrumptious I couldn't wait to tuck into it...I was so bummed. The sauce was a little too tomato-y for my taste. I Actually felt like I was eating spaghetti, but not quite. :(

My friend was enjoying her eggplant and chicken dish - it looked fab. I'll have to try it when I go back.

It's all right for now, but I'll be able to judge it better with a couple more visits.",2010-01-21 06:33:58

They usually have the Spanish radio stations here on the weekends so it makes for a truly enjoyable experience and you can pretend you are in Mexico. 

Maybe they are dueling with the Ranch market that is across the street, who knows. The prices on food is pretty low compared to the regular supermarket. They now give you the prices of Fry's and how their prices compare for each items. I bought this huge seedless watermelon for $4! It looked like an alien pod.

I have never been for lunch, only dinner, but have done everything else in between from grabbing a bucket of beer to doing a full sit down dinner with visiting family. Highlights include spot on food for each occasion, good free chips and sala, and an amazing guac dip that may have been my first real love with the food. Our most recent trip was before a show at the Blumenthal so we just came in to grab some beers and aforementioned guac. Per our recent usual, we sat at the bar for a quick service / low thrills approach, which works well for us. We ordered the large bowl of guac - big mistake as it is almost the size of your head. You can make a pretty filling meal of the chips, salsa, guac, and beer - and that is exactly what we did. On previous occasions we have ordered some other food including burritos and enchiladas, all excellent.

On a recent visit, I was disappointed in how salty the poke was, the lack of flavor in the chow mein, the dryness of meat, and I could go on. Even the desserts felt like the quality changed. 

None-the-less, I still think this buffet is a great off-the-strip location and would recommend anyone to give it a shot. I love that they have wine and a quick list of beer as part of their buffet.

I have had enough the of the Las Vegas greasy buffet meals so I began researching other places for us to eat while we were in town. While searching the main Yelp page of Las Vegas I came across Mr. Mama's. Upon further review of Mr. Mama's I observed they were offering a Yelp deal of $20.00 for $10.00. After reading the wonderful reviews of Mr. Mama's I purchased a Yelp deal. 

My girlfriend and I decided to pay this place a visit on our way out of town. Mr. Mama's was located right off of the 15 south so that made the decision even easier knowing we did not have to backtrack. 

My girlfriend and I were able to find Mr. Mama's very easily. Mr. Mama's is located in a very industrial part of Las Vegas, Mr. Mama's is actually located in a small little strip mall and you would probably drive past this place without giving it a second thought, well if you are in the area have a third thought and stop, you will not regret it. 

The vibe inside of Mr. Mama's is a great one. The chairs were lawn chair type of deal but seemed like a more upgraded version of such. The tables had a nice little beach theme going with all types of Ocean life displayed on them. 

My girlfriend and I walked in and were seated right away. Soon after we sat down our waitress 'Julie C' came over and asked if we would like anything to drink. Before ordering our drinks I advised 'Julie' that we had purchased a Yelp deal ($20 for $10), Julie asked if we purchased it several weeks ago, I said we did. Julie advised us that Mr. Mama's no longer offers that deal but they would honor it. My girlfriend ordered a Black tea and I ordered a decaffeinated coffee, Julie told me they did not currently have decaf coffee but she would brew some just for me=) I decided now was as good of a time as any to check-in using my Yelp application on my Iphone, when I did I received a second Yelp deal of one free beverage with the purchase of a meal. I asked Julie if we could use both deals during the same purchase and she said we could and we did just that. 

I advised 'Julie' that this was our first time here and what would she recommend we order. Julie advised us that Mr. Mama's is known for their omelets. I was not in the mood for an omelet and neither was my girlfriend. My girlfriend ordered the Breakfast burrito and I ordered the French toast breakfast that was served with 3 eggs any style and your choice of bacon or sausage, I went with sausage patties. 

Both of our breakfasts were spectacular. I absolutely loved my French toast; the bread was egg bread that was crispy on the outside yet nice and doughy on the inside. It was simply amazing!!! My girlfriend's breakfast burrito was pretty darn good; I enjoyed a few nibbles of her food as well. 

Shortly after we finished our meal, the Owner of Mr. Mama's began walking around the restaurant asking all of the patrons 'How was your breakfast,' after he engaged every table in a short conversation he thanked you for your business and told you how much he appreciated you being there. I thought this was a very nice touch; I am very much about supporting local business. I would much rather give my business to a local business than a big chain or Las Vegas buffet. Our bill arrived and with the both Yelp deals our balance was $0.00. We left 'Julie' a nice tip for simply being 'Awesome.' 

I am not sure when the next time I will be in Las Vegas but when that times arrives without question I will come back here. Mr. Mama's is a business that is only open for breakfast & lunch so make sure you call ahead to find out their hours. As we exited Mr. Mama's everyone continued to thank us and wished us a good day, as we exited the doors I noticed a 'People love us on Yelp' sticker on the door and I will have to agree with you there Mr. Mama, when you are putting food out of your kitchen with pride & love that truly shows=)",2013-04-15 00:52:50

Before going in, I called to verify the price for their All-You-Can-Eat and to my surprise, it was only $19 for dinner on a weekend. I guess it's a current promo so I'm not sure how long this will last. They have a pretty good selection of appetizers, sushi, and rolls. One odd thing that I found different about this place compared to other AYCE spots is that each table gets a piece of paper where you write your orders. You only get to order three times - yes, it sounds like it may not be enough but trust me, it is. Make sure you order a lot on each round. One thing that really stood out to me is their presentation with each dish. They are beautifully served which makes each dish more appetizing (all though some plates should be smaller). I especially liked their salmon cheek with Sea Salt and their Japanese sausage is a must! Service was also excellent - they were really attentive and proactive to our needs. In the end, we were offered Vanilla with Chocolate Chip Mochi. I do wish that they serve oysters which would be a great addition to their menu.",2018-08-06 05:20:34

Yes, Yes and Yes.

Tatsu is totally underrated. They deserve way better rating than 3.5 - thus 5 stars to help bump up the rating.

To me, Tatsu comes close to Monta, Sora and Fukumimi (and Shoku, for that matter), if not better. And so far, tsukemen (with authentic, special thick noodle!) is only available at Tatsu (except Hiromaru but don't count).

If you haven't, try the deluxe ramen - it's a tasting menu for their ramen. Also, fried rice and gyoza are pretty good too.

If you tried a long ago before the ownership fuss, give them a second chance.

My wife has more unforgiving tastes than myself (looking at you, Guy Savoy), but she approves Tatsu too. Consider this review two votes.

As far as I understand, this is the same Future Bakery that used to have an amazing bakery  at Runnymede and Bloor years ago. I used to absolutely love the Runnymede location for bread and sweets, and have some very fond childhood memories of the corner cafe.
Unfortunately, the Annex Future does not deal with too much dough in the literally sense, but they do make up for it with some 20-30 varieties of cakes available at most times. This, and the fact that you can be underage and hang out late at a cool spot, make Future a great spot in the Annex. The other positive quality is the huge patio and reasonably priced beer which could be very appealing in the summer. Add in quality service from a friendly staff, and you have a 4.5* experience for this part of the business.
What brings them down for me is their not-completely-successful venture into foods and drinks... 
Beer availability in afternoon is very variable, and chances are they will already be 'out' of some favourites. Additionally, the food is at best mediocre. If you are really hungry the schnitzel is a decent choice, but the sides that come with the meal will probably not impress.
Another factor that bothered me was the w/c which was more or less horribly disgusting early in the evening! Definitely something to improve on.
Minus this last point, it is understandable that this is meant to be a dessert place, and so overall Future is an A-OK place.",2010-08-27 16:33:24

I've had the chance to eat dinner here as well as eat off-menu light bites when organizations I'm a member of have booked lunch here. I've also had the chance to enjoy a quick tour of their wine stocks, which honestly are impressive in and of themselves! Not only did I get a glimpse into the huge collection of wine but I found out that they have quite a system here to ensure that different wines are ready for serving throughout the night. So yep, when it comes to wine it's safe to say that these guys definitely know what they're doing.

Food wise, I can say after dining here during group outings that Capital Grille makes very delicious and tender meat dishes. I've had off-menu lamb bites and kabobs and can't even describe how tasty they were! The last time I was here for dinner I opted to stick to soup and salad, and believe it or not those options were just as satisfying as anything else I could have ordered. The bisque was thick and nicely seasoned, and the Caprese Salad was put together beautifully and drizzled with just the right amount of dressing - and hey, I love any place that doesn't drown its salads in dressing! And to finish my last meal off, I ordered the cheesecake with fresh seasonal berries. It was definitely one the best pieces of cheesecake that I've ever had, I think - it was both tasty and light and fluffy, so I left after eating feeling perfectly full rather than overstuffed from my delightful meal.

Service? No complaints. I've never had a problem here. The waiters here are always able to answer questions and help with meal and drink selections when we're having trouble picking what to pair with what. They've also always been quick to check on our waters, take away empty dishes, see if we need anything else - honestly they've always succeeded in making me feel like a special guest, which in a place as fancy and expensive as Capital Grille is always a good thing, I think!

I would absolutely come back for a big date or just to grab a drink and dessert, but unfortunately Capital Grille will always be a special occasion only sort of place. It's impossible to forget that the food here is expensive - particularly the steaks! - and while I don't mind paying for a high quality meal like the ones you can get here once in a while, those prices do mean that this place and my budget don't always mix well.

The service here is so welcoming, they treat you as if you've been coming here for years. They have great sangria and lots of decent beer on tap to go with their delicious food.

I avoided coming to this place for YEARS because it's right next door to unPhogettable and that place is so hard to say no to.

One day my boyfriend insisted on trying something new and forced me to come here against my will.  I was pissed.  But then I walked in and spied with my hungry little eye this huge plate of grilled meats and got put in my place.

If this is your first time here, you HAVE to get the spring rolls with charboiled sausage.  It comes in this delightfully orange and pink shrimp paste dip and the flavors together is pure magic.  In the roll itself is a strip of deep fried wonton wrapper and creates a surprisingly pleasant crunch and great texture.

For your entree, definitely get the broken rice with 10 things because WHY NOT.  Pork? yes. Short ribs? YES! Chinese sausage? Yes yes! Deep fried roll thing with shrimp in it? Yes yes yes! AND little pieces of deep fried pork belly scattered across the plate?! AHHHHHHHHHH.

Good hangout place
Good decor/concept
Nice servers
Tasty drinks (I recommend Hokkaido milk tea)
Less loud than other bubble tea establishments
Free popcorn
They offer food (and desserts)

Nope. It was a BOGO on any well drinks.  

Its a swanky bar and lounge, with plenty of comfy couches and high tables.  Stephen and I grabbed a corner couch and Angela sat down to take our order.  I wasn't sure what to get, so she came back and then helped me decide on a Moscato Spritz, while Stephen got a Bourbon and something.

The drink prices were not cheap.. so no wonder they gave us a BOGO coupon.  My drink was $20, and Stephen's was $12.  Lucky it was free, so with tax and tip I think I gave Angela $30.

The drinks were not watered down, and they didn't rush us at all.  We sat and chilled for quite a while, before heading toward the lobby to check out the Conservatory.

I really enjoy going to Sushi Inn whenever I am in the Yorkville area.  Their prices are reasonable and their service is good.  They are constantly refilling tea cups and their food service is very quick.  I used to come here almost every week many years ago, but just recently went back a couple of times and the fish was not AS great as I remember it to be.

My favourite dish is the Salmon Sushi Pizza. I have yet to try another sushi pizza as good as this one!!  Their miso soup is never disappointing, and I love their green salad dressing and their spicy mayo. Yum! :)

I really do think that they should renovate some day though because the space is very small and the tables and walls are beginning to look old and run down.  I have been going to this place for approximately 8 years now. Not much has changed, including some of the staff.",2012-03-02 22:27:35

The servers were extremely attentive. I almost felt like a human walking into the bar from the movie Dusk til Dawn. They were nice though. Nothing really wrong with being extra attentive. Better than being ignored, I guess. 

I ordered the fried shrimp sausage spring rolls for an app. It came with a tasty peanut sauce that I love regardless of the roll but the shrimp sausage was also pretty good. 

The server was taking my plate as I was putting the last bite in my mouth. I kind of laughed though. I know how it is when you are working in a slow place and you want the customer to like it. But, pump the brakes a little, boss. The place looks cool inside. They painted the walls and have televisions and it looks like a really chill place but I'm guessing it's just a bad location. Or, maybe I'm wrong because it was my first time there. I've seen it before though and I've never seen a lot of people there. Anyways, on to the entree...

I ordered the chicken panang spicy number 5. 

(This is a Vietnamese owned restaurant. Even though it's Thai food, Hue was a Vietnamese/Chinese owned area on Thailand so it's a mix of the two but being owned by Vietnamese, my thoughts of the Thai dish explain to me that they focus more on the Vietnamese items rather than the Thai. There is a specialty drink menu but I didn't want to mix the two experiences. )

Ok, so, although all of the ingredients were fresh and it was cooked thoroughly and really wasn't necessarily bad, it is not the way I personally like panang curry to be. It was basically just coconut milk with a few curry spices but either the cook didn't thicken the sauce right from adding the ingredients at the wrong time during cooking or they like their sauce very thin. I don't. I've never had Hue type Thai food so I don't exactly know. It was loaded with a great assortment of veggies and a fair amount of chicken but again, the sauce is what ruined it for me. I used to cook Thai curry from the paste a lot and I know that if you don't cook it right, it turns out like this. There were Mexican cooks so it is very likely they don't know how to cook Thai curry but the servers didn't think it was wrong so I'm not sure...

I would be willing to try again but next time I'll avoid the Thai dishes, or curries, at least.

The server did ask me what I thought and I told him I usually like my panang thicker. He did apologize but that was it. I finished everything so not really anything to fix.

I tried the mac and cheese with braised beef and a friend had the burger with fries. After 10pm, the dinner menu turns into a late night snack menu, where portions are smaller, but prices remain the same. Before going to Soco, I've read many reviews and had high expectations for their award-winning mac and cheese. I was not disappointed. I think adding the braised beef makes the dish sooo much better. The mac and cheese is REALLY heavy and cheesy. And thats why I would not complain about the portion size being smaller than their drink glass. Adding a fresh element or even a tiny side salad would help cut the amount of fat you can literally feel yourself consuming. (Not complaining, this dish would satisfy any mac and cheese craving for months!)

I always get excellent service at Marilyn's Cafe, food always comes out at the right time, drinks kept filled, etc. They have a thing where if they don't offer you dessert at the end you get a free dessert, which seems very tasty because they have some displayed in the middle of the dining area while you eat, but they are always on it, I always hope they forget so I get some free dessert.  Also it's only good for after 4 pm which I've tried during lunch and they said no LOL. Honestly I never have room for dessert.

They have an amazing monster burger with fries special for only $5. I'll take a picture next time or you should trust me and try it out.  The monster burger is pretty simple but looked and tasted gourmet, the patty was plumped and juicy and the bun was fluffy with a crisp.  The fries were thick.  You can also add more ingredients for more.  Eat your monster burger with the Heinz 57 or hot sauce if you want a little spice.

They have nightly specials, don't remember the order.  Steak and lobster. AYCE crab legs on Fridays. Half a BBQ chicken with 2 sides for $6.99.  There's an either $2.99/$3.99 AYCE pancake offered 24/7 and senior menu for those seniors, which is basically the same as the regular menu except for 1 side instead of 2 and cheaper.  Their menu consist of seafood, salads, Italian and American dishes and appetizers, sandwiches and soups.  Ask for the free rolls and corn bread.  They also have some good late night specials, steak and eggs, starting at midnight.

The interior is nice also, a little feel of Tuscany. I recommend taking the tables if your dining with more than 3, the booths are crammed not really made for 3 unless you like banging each other legs. And they have a private room for large parties.",2011-10-30 22:21:10

Walked into this place and it was quite busy, was actually quite surprised on how busy it was for 7pm on a Weds night. Lots of College football fans in their gear due to the game between the ducks and Auburn the day before, so I am assuming most of them were tourist.

There was no hostess, and after looking around I decided to mosey up to an empty stool at the bar, took the bartender/waiter a minute to see me, but once he did he was on top of things. 

Got a Corona and my chip and salsa on, not a big fan of the authentic chips, and the salsa was a bit watery, I got an extra side of sour cream and guacamole, the guacamole was good, large chunks of avocado in it. Sour cream was your run of the mill, after looking over the unimpressive and hard to read lettering on the menu...due to poor design.

I decided after the chips maybe just to stick with what I had, so I got the nacho supreme with chicken. To say the least I was not impresses with any part of this dish except for the fact that it was huge...and the chicken was good...but there was not enough of it.

There are different set courses for up to five or six ppll. Downside is you don't get to choose what you get in the set course dinner; it's pretty much fixed. 

Last tip?

If you're a loyal customer at their restaurant, often times the owner treats you to an extra dish that's on the house so be prepared for a pleasant surprise once the owner recognizes you!!",2017-06-09 04:46:17

I was skeptical to go here as first since I'm a big fan of Monta and Sora. And after trying the fusion ramen place, which was a pretty big disappointment, I thought I should just stay with what I know and go with the popular places. But after reading one reviewer's detailed description on how true the owner is on ingredient and style at the place, I figured I'd give it a try. 

And now I think I don't ever have to go to Monta anymore, especially Monta is pretty much a guarantee to stand in line kind of place.  It's a cute little place run by real Japanese folks. The Japanese lady who took our order is so cute and attentive. If you check in on yelp you can get a free drink, ice green tea included. 

They have many variety of ramens, just like other ramen places. The pork is perfect in between Monta and Sora. I always think the pork at sora is too big and fatty, and pork at Monta is too thin and a bit stingy. Pork here is perfect size and they have regular size noodles and thin noodles, just depends on what type of ramen you get. And their egg is perfectly cooked. The yoke is to perfection. 

Their karaage is THE BEST I've ever had. Meaty, perfect crispness without too much breading and not oily at all.  You must order it when you go. 

I really don't need to go stand in line at Monta for my ramen fix anymore!!",2014-06-17 00:48:11

The grilled cheese sandwich was not so great on its own, but I was able to dip it into my friends tomato basil soup and that was delicious! The tomato basil soup is nice and thick and made a perfect dipping! 

My husband had the mussels and it was more than enough for one person. Lots of sauce!

You can order a bottle of wine, have a glass of it and take the rest to go which is great! We ordered the sirloin steak for my daughter, but it was not very good at all. Most of it went completely uneaten. The fries were great though. The steak is just not a very good cut, it came out raw and then came back again and anytime a steak is cooked twice I think it loses more flavor than necessary.

Vegetarians and pescetarians, rejoice: the veg ramen ($14) at Konjiki is not your typical phoned-in lacklustre miso situation. The base is a thick, rich, creamy potato and soy milk soup. Tofu nuggets and a variety of vegetables (corn, spinach, pickled beets, yam, mushrooms) round it out and make it a much more filling and flavourful meal than expected. I couldn't have this regularly but if I need a warm comforting hug of a lunch, it's a great option. Adding an egg ($1.5) is the smart thing to do even though it means it's going to be a relatively pricy bowl of noodles after tax and tip.

Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.

The only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.

We walked in, went down some stairs, and walked into this dimly lit, romantic little speakeasy lounge. The place has a causal yet still fancy vibe.

I honestly believe the low reviews are because of the fairly high prices. I do wish they would lower their prices--we would get take-out more frequently if they did because their food is good. Our last take-out order, we got the moo-shu pork, shrimp with vegetables, house fried rice, and one egg roll. Our total with tax was $40 (as for the reviewer who ordered for four and their total was $110 - they must have ordered a crazy ton of food. My family doesn't eat like pigs). This fed my family of four for dinner, and I had enough leftover for my lunch the next day (a big lunch too. I was stuffed). 

Quantities are not always very big. I love moo-shu pork, but they give you very little for $10. If you eat it in the restaurant, they roll it into only two pancakes and serve it like that. If you empty those two pancakes, it amounts to very little, but it's still very tasty. I also like to take my daughter here so we can sip tea while we wait for our meal. The ambiance is lovely.

The serving sizes are big, but not the way some places give you a lot of food to make up for the fact it's not good food.

The coffee is the generic dark diner    variety and perfect for those days that you crave this type of food the most (you know the ones I mean).

Actually, the home fries are the only thing I can even think to complain about.  These are the home fries I love, shredded and fried on a flat top.

I personally found the curry dish way too sweet, same with the Thai tea. My bf's Thai fried rice was lacking on the chicken. Also our food came out within 5 minutes which was awkward. 

Anyways, i wasnt really satisfied with this meal, especially for the total coming to almost $40.

Their jasmine milk tea (my usual at every boba place) is good. Going to be trying their other milk teas over time, too. 

The plaza itself is usually always pretty open so I really like that it's not crowded (so far). It's a good place to come chill with friends for a few hours with access to drinks and food. 

Their egglette waffle wasn't too bad but I do want to try their honey toast soon.

Fantastic Caprese appetizer with fresh, so soft mozzarella, crostini, tomatoes (I would've preferred more) and a pesto/balsamic glaze, enough to sop up with the pizza crust (much better than licking the bowl, which you'll want to do!).

Light and crispy calamari made the hubby happy, and if course he snacked on my Caprese--WHY didn't we get the large?!

The Roasted Mushroom Pizza was deelish. Piled with various mushrooms and quality cheeses. The crust is just that: crusty but soft, just as I like it. I split it with a friend so as to save room for dessert...

A Pizza Cookie, Red Velvet Cake or Mini Donuts were the main choices but when I saw that they had chocolate ice cream (yay!), I had to go for the cookie with that on top. BJs is the only other place that does that! Hot cookie, very sweet with the chocolate and caramel drizzles. Just what I wanted.

There is art on the walls and most of it is for sale- which is pretty awesome. When we were seated, I noticed these awesome little business card sized cards with a bunch of conversation starters on them, like: ""have you ever been in love?"" And ""when you were ten, what did you want to be when you grew up?"" Those were such a cute idea and my boyfriend and I had fun answering the questions with each other. The brunch menu wasn't very long, but it had plenty of options. I first ordered the emperor which is a home made smoothie. It was a green smoothie and tasted like bananas- it was awesome. I ordered potato and kale tacos... Soo amazing. The order came with three tacos- fresh tortillas, potatoes with taco seasoning, sautéed kale, cashew cheese, sundried tomato sauce and picked red onions. They fell apart but they were incredible. Writing about them is making my mouth water. I also had a house salad on the side- nothing crazy but delicious none the less. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito and a house salad.

Medium Fries

I asked to upgrade from fries to onion rings and they had no problem accommodating my request. There was a mix up however so we ended up with sweet potato fries, but this was corrected after the mix up. We were even allowed to keep the sweet potato fries since they would have just thrown them away. As our Southern sides we went with Southern Coleslaw and Mac n' Cheese. 

I have to say my favourite part of this meal was the pulled pork. It was so tender, juicy, saucy, and delicious. The wings were really good too and a good size. I don't usually like brisket because its tougher meat, but there were some pieces that were more tender so I enjoyed it as well. The ribs were as good as always, nice and meaty. The Mac n' Cheese was great too, it went well with the pulled pork and brisket. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were nothing special, I've definitely had better, but that's okay because their specialty is meat.

We ordered sweet fries, onion rings, and truffle fries, to share between 5 people. They were promptly finished. The sweet fries were paired with a tzatziki sauce, which I found to be a rather poor pairing. The fries themselves were decent but nothing special. The onion rings were pretty tasty-- the barbecue sauce they came with was nothing extraordinary. The truffle fries were my favorite, but  the aioli they came with was too rich and not tangy enough. I ordered the blackberry lemonade but i found it to be a bit too sugary.

Our burgers came out within decent time. I decided to go with the Kobe burger. It was definitely excellent-- cooked just right and dripping with juicy goodness. No doubt the quality of the beef likely attributed to the enjoyment. The potato bun was ever so crunchy and melted in my mouth at just the right moments.

Southern Rail just might be what you are looking for.  We met here with a small group of friends where we posted up at the bar on a Friday evening.  Had the chance to sample some of the cocktails from their drink menu.  My absolute favorite was the Austin Mule.  An updated version of the moscow mule...very refreshing! I also tried the hush puppy.  It was good, but different.  I am a fan of grapefruit and bitter, but this was maybe a little too bitter for my taste.  

By about 8pm we were hungry.  At that time, the restaurant was still busy, so we were seated at an extended bar.  Our waiter was great.  Very informative regarding the menu and the wine list.  He helped us choose an amazing bottle of wine.  

Our group decided to sample a few things from the menu and share.  So while this list will look like we ordered the entire menu, we didn't (this time).  Our selections were...Cornbread muffins, fried green tomatoes, succotash, broccoli/cauliflower/leek/rice casserole, the gumbo, and the cider brined pork loin.  My favorites were the succotash and the cider brined pork loin.  I know that some people on here have mentioned it being over done, but ours was cooked perfectly.  Very tender and juicy.  And the collard greens and brown butter sweet potatoes that came with the pork were AWESOME.  

I know that some people have had a fit over the gumbo not having a proper roux.  I get it.  But seeing that I have lived in the south, I wouldn't consider this place as authentic southern food. It is southern food with some changes and interpretations.  If I expect authentic fried green tomatoes, I need to go and talk to my Mother In Law in Tennessee.  This is great southern food, but it has an upscale twist.  So just have an open mind if you do decide to go here.

I will order that again because I'm a sucker for burgers with BBQ sauce, bacon and fried crispy onions. The beef itself though was dense and full of flavor.

Priced at $7.29 hubby and I shared a ""Bloomin' Onion"" because it's not a visit to Outback without getting one. The bloomin' onion tasted great, I just hoped between the onion and bread that we had room for our meal!

I ordered a 6 ounce Filet priced at $20.49 after the addition of a blue cheese crown to the steak. I also for another $1 added a ""Wedge Salad"" to complete my meal. The wedge salad was awesome and almost a meal itself. The steak came with mashed potatoes that tasted alright, but might have been sitting on the plate for a bit because they weren't very warm. It also came with ""Baked Potato Soup"" that was pretty good. The steak really surprised me. I didn't expect much, but the steak was cooked to my liking, was tender and had good flavor. The blue cheese crown was too much. I little goes a long way in that department and while I usually like it on my steak, this time they could have scaled back and maybe even used actual chunks of cheese instead of a mixture.

I had high expectations for this place because I was imagining it to be like Volcano Grill (Yelp it, so worthy). I know this was only their 2nd day open, and I'm hoping they work out their kinks because the location is so convenient for us. I hope they start with the entreé pricing because is super ASSpensive.

I wouldn't mind paying the $90 we did for our meal if the quality was up to par. I understand it's labeled ""sushi express"", but what's up with the dine-in-hibachi-where-the-chef-puts-on-a-fancy-show-for-you-cook-in-front-of-you prices????? Seriously! $12 average for a Hibachi Entreé with STEAMED rice, $3 extra for fried rice. You also get steamed veggies. I mean, this is a fast food style restaurant! They serve their food in styrofoam for dine in. That's cool and all, but the price to quality has no balance.

What we ordered:
-Vegas Roll
The closest to what is normally called a Tiger roll elsewhere. Shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna. Their Tiger roll here is not like this. This was our first time eating sushi from a styrofoam plate lol. But I gotta give it up, this was bomb and we'd come back for this AND only this!!
-Shrimp Tempura
They don't have TEMPURA SAUCE!!!! I know it's a new restaurant but the poor girl at the register gave us a look like we were making shit up when we asked, ""do you have tempura sauce?"" She looked so confused and said all they had were sriracha, soy sauce and other sauces in the back for sushi. Wtf????
-Salmon Teriyaki Entreé 
My 4 year old finished his fish and he said it was good. 
-Beef Entreé + $3 fried rice
This was my husband's. He said his was good but nothing he'd come back for. He's a sauce guy and he's appalled as to why no sauces were offered or served. Hibachi and sauces go together!!
-Shrimp Entreé + $3 fried rice
Look for the photo I uploaded! My shrimp and rice looked charry. Like they didn't clean the grill well before cooking my meal. What if it gets busier than it was tonight guys? Fried rice should be part of the entreés!!
-Chicken Katsu Entreé + $3 fried rice 
My son, who loves chicken Katsu, from almost anywhere was sort of upset because they poured the sauce over the meat. He ended up eating it all anyway because he was hungry after a basketball game. He's a big fan of Hibachi fried rice and he said this one tasted weird. Probably charry tasting like mine did.

Next time we want Hibachi again, we're going down the street to Ohjah. We'd be paying the same price plus salad, miso, and SAUCES!! Oh and we'd get a free show from the cooks too. Next time we want ""express"" style food like this, we'll take the drive to Volcano Grill. At least their meals come with fried rice and everything tastes delicious. 

Southern Highlands is a family oriented neighborhood, you need more tables that are family friendly. Not everyone coming in will come in twos. High chairs needed as well.

It's a small cozy cafe with seating for around 30-40 people? It's super close to UNLV which makes it a prime place to go to for a coffee break and possibly to study. They do have free WiFi! And the owners are pretty cool and really nice.

I ended up getting waffles and tea, more specifically I got the vegan version of Viva Las Elvis with vegan ice cream. It's a waffle with peanut butter, honey (agave if vegan version), and coconut bacon with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. The peanut butter melted into the waffle which was pretty awesome, because I mean melted peanut butter on anything is delicious! And the ice cream was well vegan vanilla ice cream and wasn't too special to me. 

I'll probably not get tea again, only because it was $2 for a bag and one cup of hot water. I'm not sure if they'll give you more hot water, but one bag and one cup of water doesn't seem like it's worth it. 

My biggest gripe was that it was DIRTY. I mean the tables, I went through two tables and they were both dirty. There was dried syrup on them and stains from the last customers. I looked down to see if there were any other tables, but most of them seemed like they were dirty to me. I tried cleaning some of it off, but most of it didn't come off with a napkin and some water. That to me is disgusting especially since it seems most people leave their dishes and the owners clean it off. That's just how it looked to me, when other customers ate and then left. When I got there the whole cafe was empty but as I sat there there were people that came and go. So they didn't really have an excuse to be dirty. 

I do however want to try some other menu items the next time I go. I just hope it's cleaner this time. I like the owners, they're pretty nice to talk to. I like the atmosphere. I like the location.

The ""office"" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  

In my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their ""office"" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their ""lobby"" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the ""office.""  I couldn't be happier with my first impressions--to me, minimal overhead means maximum service and value.

Sure enough everyone at Walter's is very nice and helpful.

I was at Taro's today for what is surely the best non high-end restaurant sushi in Canada and they have removed the counters, stools and seats to force people not to eat there. Since everyone knows take-out sushi is as nice and palatable as three-day old cake it seems this will be my last visit to Taro's. I am not sure why they dislike and disdain the customers who took advantage of their seats and counters, because clearly putting bags of rice on the counter and taking away the chairs means you did not really need the space, but made sure you fill it with something else on purpose, but that is a loss to the customer and the business.
The sushi menu is still there, but only amateurs or people who live next door (!?!?!) will buy sushi there now. So they have the sushi but want to send it out of the store only. Sorry, cold sushi sitting in the car for an hour is as cool as a SUV or four-door Porsche. Ladies automatically know that stuff.

The store is still selling packaged and whole fish, Japanese edibles and garnish of course. For those who do not enjoy standing in line Mr. Taro also now sells Japanese cheesecake and matcha cake too (see they are uptown but they know business and how to make money on the back of a trend), but gone is the ability to order rolls, sushi, sashimi, clams and even tempura and enjoy it there.

It is too bad because I always picked up something there whenever I visited. Whether fish, ready-made food, oden (which they don't care any more) or soy sauce I will pick those things up elsewhere as well.

See, I told you, change is bad. That is why corporations and hypocrite types always have to repeat the lie that 'change is good' or 'change is for the better' or 'change is needed' etc. If it were true it would not needed constant preaching.

The first time I came we started with the Tortilla Chips with ancho chili powder and guacamole. These house-made chips are pretty phenomenal, to be honest. The dusting of ancho chili powder ensures that they're delicious all on their own, while the guac is spicy and flavorful. (The second time I came I started with the Mission Salad, which inexplicably isn't listed on the website, so I can't describe what's in it. Nevertheless it's extremely tasty and quite addictive.)

So I've tried the following tacos:

In Cod We Trust (""Cod, Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro""): Probably my favorite taco on offer. The generous piece of fried fish was cooked perfectly, while the accompanying toppings proved an ideal complement.

Pollo Fritto (""Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa fresca""): Okay, wait. Maybe *this* was my favorite. The big chunks of chicken were unbelievably tasty and I loved the level of spice the taco contained. I could seriously eat this every day.

Beef Cheek (""Ancho braised cheek, lime avocado, green cabbage, pickled jalapeño & crispy shallots, queso anejo, charred pepper sauce""): Again, a complete and total winner. The meat is soft and juicy, and the toppings are placed ever-so-carefully and are a perfect accompaniment.

Carnita (""Confit pork, jalapeño sauce, mango salsa, queso añejo, guacamole, chicharron, cilantro""): Though this was my least favorite, it's still miles better than most tacos out there. It's just bursting with flavor, but somehow it's not as memorable as the aforementioned tacos.

I also sampled the Churros (""w/ housemade cajeta"") and my god are they delicious. The churros themselves are crispy but also soft inside, while the caramel sauce is amazingly sweet and rich. (I'm not ashamed to admit I drank what was left after the churro was gone.)

And this is all the tip of the iceberg in terms of La Carnita's menu. I'm certainly looking forward to trying more of their stuff.",2016-12-21 01:22:47

Our party of four ordered Mussel's as a shared appetizer which were pretty good. However only two slices of bread were provided and there was no spoon to use for serving onto our plates. Instead of plates shallow bowls should have been provided so we could enjoy some of the broth. 

There was a long delay between the time we ordered and when we received our orders. Our server told us they were short staffed resulting in delays in the kitchen. 

Once our orders arrived we were surprised at the appearance of our individual orders,  a pasta dish was poorly sauced, the pasta was in bits and pieces and quite lumpy and dry. Beef Bourgegion was okay however the whipped potatoes were off color as if in the steam table too long and the portion of beef was very small.  A Pork Tenderloin dish was also small portioned and tough as well as unattractively dished and the whipped potatoes were also off color from being in the steam table too long. The Salmon in filo dough was good.  We ordered bread pudding and crepe to share and were so surprised that they weren't garnished with whipped cream. 

They have remodeled to a larger room and as a result more customers are seated. They had better figure out how to serve these customers in a more timely manner and get production issues ironed out in the kitchen. 

I don't mind high prices IF I receive great food and service.",2018-04-05 00:44:54

I have never met anyone who didn't like Olive Garden's salad and those breadsticks. On this last visit we had the salad and soup combo -- as many bowls of different kinds of soup as you can handle.  The limit is usually two.  Chicken Gnocchi is our favorite, with Pasta e Fagioli a close second. (I must admit, I do not care for their minestrone soup.)

There's a full bar with some clever cocktails, craft beers and a small selection of interesting wines.

It's a very open concept kind of dining experience, looks a bit like a canteen with like long metal tables and wooden seats. I came with one other person, and I guess we were lucky that the table beside us remained empty the whole time. Although I don't think it would have been a big deal sitting beside a stranger.

I ordered the Siam Noodle which I guess is similar to Pad Thai except for the sauce - the sauce was made from peanut and coconut milk and was so fragrant and delicious! I really enjoyed it and thought it was super interesting. It was $9.75 for my noodles (I got them with chicken) and the portion was pretty big, I had a really hard time finishing and felt like I got my money's worth. I also like that you can customize the spice level of any of the dishes here - good for people like me who can't handle the heat.

House of Tricks is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Tempe!

For $10, you get their quiche of the day, fresh fruit and a soup or salad. 

First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. ""Wow, Alicia, this is... wow..."" 

Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche.

There is nothing that can beat how awesome the stage is in this show. The movement and story are pretty great. It is also really neat how the show is going on all around you. They come out into the audience and it really feels like you are part of the show. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because there is a part at the very end that projected onto the stage. This is kind of lame considering the awesomeness of the entire show. I understand some of the performers died and that may be why they use the projection on that portion. To be honest it looks kind of like you are watching a video game.

One of the best burgers for the price. Menu is about 10 deep for burgers at an average of $11 per burger which is very reasonable. A byob option begins at $8.50 with $1.50 charge per additional topping for the creative. I had the diablo which was quite spicy but more of a jalapeño level, not reaper or ghost pepper. Burger was big (bartender says 6 oz) so was filling. A side fry shared would be best to complete this meal. They also have a nice $5 hh menu for sliders of 3 oz and had off wine and droughts. The one downside I found was the very small beer selection. Usually burger joints specialize in beer selection and Zin disappointed me for sure in that department.

I truly believe we eat with our eyes first and everything is presented beautifully-it's all picture and social media worthy! My one complaint or recommendation is to figure out a way to increase their seating. Their seating is pretty limited which I can see posing an issue as they get more and more popular. 

My sister, niece, and I stopped in for dessert after lunch somewhere else. Located at the end of a small plaza this space has lots of natural lighting and some unique decor. It's very whimsical and vintage looking. There's about 6 tables with seating for 2-6. They serve cups and pots of tea, different coffees and lattes, and a handful of desserts. They had different cakes and even an almost make your own honey toast option where you can pick toppings and sauces.

Today we tried their green tea crepe cake, tiramisu, Nutella bear cake, and a taro latte. Everything was plated super cute, had a little wow factor, but most importantly was tasty and affordable. My favorite item we got was the  taro latte with the crepe cake with added ice cream on the side. The latte wasn't very sweet at all and honestly tasted like taro and milk but was so refreshing.

This place was super cute, all their items we tried were not overly sweet, and the pricing was right. I'll definitely be back to try their honey toast.

Update: stopped by a second day in a row and tried their pistachio latte and a strawberry cheese cake shaved ice that was to die for! Perfect for the vegas heat.",2017-07-09 08:06:45

Also, sign up for their emails and get a free small Ice on your birthday.  

If you buy an Ice and can't eat it all, cover it well and freeze it. When you're ready to eat it again, put it in the microwave for a few seconds, which slightly unthaws it so that it's edible.

First the positive: wings are huge, juicy and smothered with sauce...trully thru the mud style. Sauces are flavourful and I love their creamy dill dip, if you think that's for celery only try dipping wings in it as well. The onion rings were also top notch, crispy and not too oily, batter is deliciously sweet and savory at the same time. Poppers were good too, creamy and crunchy at the same time...what a treat! 

Now the negative: Selection of beer is pittiful unless you are an avid Molson Fan. Onion rings on their own are $8.25 that's about 1000% profit margin right there, and wings are $12/lb sans fries, so really more  like $16 with small fries. If you come for Tuesday's special that combo will still be $12 plus you have to purchase a beverage. Somewhat pricey if you ask me, since there are places where you can get same quality wings, fries and a pint for only $10.

Several people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with ""oh, I LOVE this song"" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood. 

Speaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the ""baby it's cold outside"" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995! 

Biggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a ""healthy"" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish).

I got pasta salad on the side which was flavorless and soaked in oil and a double chocolate cookie which was a yummy end to my meal!

My guests got a tuna burger and a cheese, bacon, mushroom burger with a side of fries. I can't vouch for the taste of those, but they ate it all, along with a slice of carrot cake (she said it was great!) and a toffee cookie!

You basically get everything like veggies, herbs, sauces and the meat with some lettuce, dry rice wraps and hot water, just have to dip the dry rice wraps in hot water , place it on the place and stack whatever you would like and just roll it up, it sticks nicely and doesnt spill all over when you take a bite.

- You positively enjoy decreased portions for increased price. The smaller the portion and the higher the price, the better;

- You simply love them smallish menus of nothing to choose except for the bare essentials. Just one page, but so much fun reading it again and again while trying to make your mind!

- You honestly believe that a plate of chicken salad could be considered a main course;

- You awww from joy when your teeth crack over a piece of uneatable stuff in your chicken ""fillet"". Twice for like four chunks of chicken in the whole salad;

- You feel even better when the plate with those pieces remains on your table for the time of your staying, so you can observe them. You also don't mind dirty plates and napkins on the neighbouring tables;

- You are feeling comfortable when a waiter tosses the next plate directly in your hand, while you are still working on the previous one, all that without even looking at you;

- You enjoy when another waiter yells from the middle of the room: ""S'allokay for u ser?!?"" - so you can burp and wave your hand, showing how good do you actually feel;

And you particularly love when a glass of wine for 12-15 bucks results to be just a half of glass. Even a bit less than that, oh yes.

On the positive side, at least those guys are honest. They don't call themselves an ""Italian"" restaurant. They say something like: ""Inspired by Italy, made in Canada"". Such openness is actually good, appreciate that. No way to complain about yet another fake ""Italian"" food place.

Decor is cute, and ambient music is smartly selected - so if that's what you eat, Paese may be a good choice.

Wow, I'm now begging Yelp to start implement zero star or even negative star rating because this place got even worse.

We visited the café at the peak dinner time but the place was almost empty, which was not a good sign. Anyway, we ordered different items, mostly steak and prime ribs, none were of any good. When they brought out the food, the meats color looked weird and not appealing at all. They were way overcooked and not a hint of any seasoning. They were bland, chewing, and just plain bad. For my steak, I only took a few bites because I was so hungry. I got a stomachache about 40 minutes later. 

Even though their food price is average, I considered them to be expensive for the crappy food they serve. TGI Friday charges similar price for steak but at least you get decent good tasting steak at TGI Friday.


For service, the wait staff looked so gloom and doom, no one even crack a little smile the whole time we were there. Everyone of them look so depressed, which in turn made the whole dining experience very depressing. Again, the place was pretty much empty and no one came to refill our drinks, the waitress that was serving us disappeared for a long time, so we had to wait quite a while to get our check.


Overall, I will definitely stay away from this place, even if they let me eat for free. I'm just surprised that the casino upper management let this café get this bad. SMH.",2014-12-19 17:18:30

Chicken wings - absolutely gigantic, good sauce. A great choice for non-seafoodies hanging with their pirate friends.
Gumbo soup - Excellent!

Apparently named as an acronym of the underlying motto ""to inspire and be inspired"" with free WiFi and an innovative drink list including a rich caramel and cocoa infused iced coffee for myself plus a heavily praised honey cream iced latte for my friend it was after only a few moments of indecision that our order was placed and chatting while we waited the tasting soon began with a duo of $2.50 ""lollies,"" the single strips of spongy dough pressed between hot metal proving paltry in portion and largely flavorless save for the sweet finishing drizzle that unfortunately warned of things to come.  Entirely eschewing savories in favor of items far more sweet it was after perhaps a twenty minute wait that our proper order arrived and beginning first with a doughy Belgian topped with fresh berries beneath artificial tasting chocolate I quickly turned my attention to the alternatives, the Elvis faring a bit better by balancing sweet and savory over a slightly more study base while the ""Honey I'm Home"" proved the best of bunch in its sugar-crisp coating overlying a somewhat dense crumb - its ""veganism"" thoroughly compromised by honey and ice cream but the result all the better for it.",2014-08-12 22:10:50

We were not greeted by the host as he was on the phone. 

We sat down and waited....and waited....

Ten minutes later still waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence in the patio. 
Or to at least greet us and give us a menu. 

Well we got tired of waiting and had to go back in and hunt someone down. 

The person who we found, was off standish and said someone will be with you. 

Well we continued to wait another 5 minutes before a young guy finally came to our table. 

Luckily he was very friendly but still the service there, or lack of service was very slow and the communication between them all seemed ineffective as they all pointed to another when asked for our server. 

Food was fine and the patio was nice but if your hungry and want service then maybe go somewhere else.  otherwise you will starve or get hangry.

So we decided to eat here. We ordered some nachos and house red; to start. 

The nachos were nacho-y. They were good, the ground beef was rather delicious. We then ordered some burritos....which were accompanied by rice and salad. My rice was a bit undercooked and crunchy, the burrito was chicken and I remember it being creamy with a decent amount of heat. The guac was perfect. 

Dessert; well there was only one choice, vanilla chocolate cake. By this point I was rather drunk. My recollection of the cake was it being lovely. But in this state I could have been served anything and I would have thought it delicious. 

Overall, it was fine. The meal and copious litres of house red were reasonably priced.

The stew is not spicy so she brings extra peppers in a small bowl.  The rice is hard and has a odd taste it is not good at all the stew which is the red sauce has no flavor. My husband gets fu fu with egusi soup he says that it is tasteless but he never complains because he feels it is offensive, I guess it is cultural. 

His brother came to town and he was starving and wanted some native food so we once again are forced to go to this restaurant.  I warned him that it is not good. But he insisted. So we go and he orders the egusi and tried it and sent it back so fast. My husband was so embarrased. I vow never to return so instead my husbands' sister sends us food by fedex or he cooks stew at home which is ok but it doesn't compare to his sisters.

I had my first breakfast at JPH today, and a few notes:

- There isn't much in the way of a vegan breakfast, but there are vegetarian options including eggs with salad and toast or yogurt and housemade granola. The granola comes with dairy yogurt, but I've seen other Yelp reviews indicating it can be served with soy milk instead. 

- The breakfast service was a little lacking. My companion and I ordered breakfast bowls and they came with forks but no knives. There was one salt and pepper shaker set in the shop, and their contents weren't of very high quality or flavor.

- Soy milk costs extra, but on the plus side, when I asked for a splash of soy milk in my coffee, the barista gave me a little pitcher to accompany my little carafe of coffee. I appreciated that. 

I like Madison Sourdough much better for the same sort of breakfast (higher quality bread, better flavor in the eggs and seasonings, and more thorough service at a lower price for the same meal), but I'll continue to frequent JPH for coffee dates.

My wife almost placed a bet with me that the meal, and service would be a repeat of our last visit.  I should have taken the bet. We requested the mild salsa and we actually received it. We requested sweet and water and also received them in a timely manner.  ( It is Sad that a highlight of the meal was that you actually received your drinks correctly).

The meals were very prompt, very tasty, and the server was very attentive even though we were located in the back of the restaurant due to the crowd. She even refilled our drinks, prior to them getting half empty.

This was a redeeming visit for this location and as usual, I will continue to follow up on our visits.

I always loved this place to begin with because it showed independent and foreign films, which are my preferred genres. To add to that I was in a long-term relationship with a French girl, and since I've always loved French flicks anyway we came here almost every couple of weeks to see whatever was the latest hit out of Paris. 

Unfortunately my most recent visit was not such a great memory, through no fault of the theatre. I came last month when I was with my visiting brother and mom. Mom had originally expressed a desire to see Seinfeld's ""Bee Movie"", but since it got some lukewarm reviews and we knew that she typically likes suspense thrillers, we opted for ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" playing at Camelview instead. 

Um. How can I put this delicately? How about... the opening scene of ""Before the Devil"" consists of an overweight Philip Seymour-Hoffman banging the shit out of Marisa Tomei. Doggy-style of course. For 2 or 3 straight minutes. After banging her, they both rolled over onto their backs and discussed how strong of an orgasm Philip had. 

Picture watching this opening scene with your mom. Also picture your mom being a traditional, prim and proper 63-year old woman from India. As the scene unfolded my brother and I glanced at each other horrified. About 5 minutes later, I dared to look over to see how Mom was doing and the look of pure, unadulterated revulsion on her face is something I've never seen before. Stifling my laughter I asked what she thought of the movie so far. Which was a mistake, because she very loudly responded so every audience member around us could hear, ""WHAT IS THIS FILTH? I'M GETTING OUT FROM HERE AND GOING HOME, NOW!"" With chuckles coming in from everyone around us, I somehow managed to convince her to stay. About 20 minutes or so later, when the very interesting plot of this fantastic film had further been revealed, I glanced at her again. Incredibly, that look of pure revulsion was still there. I think it was permanently frozen on her face for the entire evening.

I remember seeing this place as a future spot for R Burgers but forgot all about it. Luckily my brother lives in the area and my aunt who lives with him told me about this place, so of course my other half and I had to go and try it! 

The first time we went, the drive thru wasn't too bad. We ordered from their vast menu, a grilled chicken sandwich, beef and chicken taquitos, fried zucchini and a chocolate shake. For starters, the grilled chicken sandwich is huge! It definitely is a filler, the only thing is that the buns get super soggy so it gets mushy fast. The beef and chicken taquitos aren't bad, it's paired with their guacamole and pico. We thought they came separately like just beef and just chicken but both of ours were mixed up, i mean of course we gave each other the different ones, you may have to clarify more. Fried zucchini is excellent! Perfect breading and it comes with homemade ranch! And the chocolate shake was just like eating chocolate ice cream! 

Now the last time we went, which was yesterday, it wasn't as great as the first time, but maybe it was because it was busier than normal? Drive thru wait was a bit longer, and confusing. This time we ordered the R burger with cheese, a strawberry shake and zucchini fries. When we got up to the window the lady was about to give me someone else's drinks, I said no those aren't mine and she said oh you didn't order the coke and Diet Coke, I said no, the strawberry shake. Then she said oh, gave me my total and I waited. When she finally gave me the food I drove away. I really didn't realize the price until my girlfriend said something, I looked at the receipt and saw she charged me for the person behind me's order. I called the place to let them know I was charged differently and the woman that answered was like what did you get, I told her and she's like so you were charged $.34 more, I said yes. And she said would you like to come back and get your change or credit it for next time. I just said it's only $.34 it's ok, I don't live in the area. I just wanted to call so it doesn't happen to someone else. Anyways back to the food! The burger was delicious, again the buns got super mushy and it wasn't as enjoyable, so I ate it without the buns. The strawberry shake was on point, it would be hard to mess it up. As for the zucchini fries, they weren't as great as the first time. They looked rushed, the breading was sloppy and they weren't cooked all the way, as you could see the uncooked batter. 

But of course, I will try it again to see if they work out the kinks, I believe they've only been open for a month. But on the plus, they serve a bunch of options and breakfast is served all day!",2018-03-17 12:54:37

Crabcake benedict - Good but the crabcakes can get a bit overpowering and they turn this breakfast into a very heavy one.
Mixed Berry Pain Perdu - Great for if you have a sweet tooth. They give you tons though and after awhile, its a bit too sweet at least for me. Still liked it alot though.
Chipotle Breakfast Burrito - This is surprisingly very good considering its not from a mexican restaurant.
Ciabatta Breakfast sammich - Very good but a bit too much meat for my liking. I think I will order it minus the ham next time. But the rest of it taste terrific.
Quiche - Have had a couple different types (brocolli and cheese, crab and sweet corn) and I can say that Mimi's makes some of the best quiche I have ever had. Very light and flaky crust with fluffy eggs and great mixins
Carrot Bread/ Blue Berry muffins - Some of the best bread and muffins I have ever had. Always warm and fresh
Redskin Breakfast potatoes - Pretty good. I prefer greasy hashbrowns though

Lunch/ Dinner:
French onion soup - Good soup. Better be good cause this is one of the things I think they are supposed to be known for.
Chicken fettuccine - Was ok, not very memorable though. I liked that it had artichokes and sundried tomatoes but the sauce wasnt very thick and the chicken was kinda bland.
Butternut Squash Ravioli with scallops - This was a special at one point and it was very good. The scallops didnt taste frozen like they do at most AZ restaurants and the ravioli were very light and flavorful. Unfortunately, I am not sure if or when this special will come back

So to sum it up, I am always excited to go to Mimi's for breakfast, however, I don't often consider going there for dinner. I feel that I should go and try more items for dinner/ lunch because the items I have had during those times were not bad. There is definately potential. The prices are reasonable and the service is good most of the time. Oh and I definately need to go back and try their bread pudding at some point to see if it makes the list of best bread puddings.   :)",2010-11-25 17:27:16

I'm not a heavy beef or pork eater but I wanted to get in on this new sensation. While it didn't disappoint, it was too heavy for me. But I can say that the Pork Belly and BbQ Ribs were outstanding. You'll need plenty of water if you get the meat platter. Short of giving it a five star is because the ""strongest"" cocktail there was not strong at all.

HddoeXBzmLBvrNpljFZ8Ag,LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw,5,4,1,4,"FINALLY got  chance to try Studio B.  I've been to M so many times but I was never able to try it because of a few things: long ridiculous lines and they aren't open at midnight :[

Went on a Saturday around 5:30p since we didn't want to wait, and yes, we did drive out of Vegas for about 20 minutes just for the buffet.  Studio B is located inside the modern M resort, and is probably the biggest draw of the hotel.

Once we paid and were seated, I immediately went for the carving stations.  Prime rib, BBQ ribs, lamb, turkey, roasted chicken... everything was there.  Of course, I started out with the prime rib because for me, the quality of the prime rib can sometimes make/break a buffet.  Surprisingly, M Resort had one of the best prime rib I've had a buffet, anywhere!  The seasonings on the crust, the medium-rare doneness, and the au jus all came together for a delicious tasting prime rib.  The braised short rib was my 2nd favorite.  Didn't expect the buffet to have tender short ribs.  

A lot of people liked the BBQ ribs, including me, but I do have to say, it is a bit fatty so that may turn some people away.  The poultry were all good, but for some reason they didn't have chicken breast, only the dark meat.  Not that I was really complaining since I always prefer the more juicy part of the bird.

As for the seafood, that's what all others went for first.  The highlight is definitely the crab leg!  Mounds and mounds of crab legs.  It's not split in half for you like some of the buffets at the high end hotels (Wynn, Bellagio), but it is cracked open at strategic spots so it is quite easy to crack the legs.  However, one thing I do have to say that it was extremely salty and that some just looked sorta odd with brown and green spots.

There's also unlimited raw oysters!  A few of my friends totally went berserk but I sorta held back since I've had bad experience with raw oysters and will only eat the ones that has a pure clear liquid, but that's just me.  The fact that they offer raw oysters is amazing to me though.

There's also an Asian section, which is the same as everywhere else.  Hot foods such as mashed potatoes and fried fish is there as well.  My favorite was definitely the fried calamari with marinara sauce.  It's like free and unlimited appetizer that you would have to pay 10-12 bucks for at any restaurant!

As for the desserts... I didn't care much for the cakes but they do have creme brulee (I'm a sucker for it) and gelato ice cream!  Creme brulee is creamy and tasty.  For the gelato, lemon was definitely my favorite.  Sweet but just enough tang for you to pucker.  

Another huge draw for the buffet is the unlimited beer & wine.  3 types of beers on draft and a red/white wine option.  It's sorta hidden in the corner and a lot of people thought you had to pay but it's just people giving tip.

Seriously, I have a craving to go back.  It may not be the best quality and it is a little out of the way, the price, selection, and unlimited alcohol definitely pushed this buffet into the 5 star realm!",2011-09-27 17:47:43

As a child I remember going to the Planetarium and being dazzled by it all. But it closed, and 10 years later, here it is, again, sponsored by a steel giant. I was very enthusiastic. Space! Joy!

The layout is very awkward. To my surprise, very little is exhibited, a couple of meteorites, a half-hidden telescope.. The planetarium wants to attract children, and only children. The displays are touch screens, interactive games etc.. The displays are incredibly bright and become hard on the eyes  after a while. Another unpleasant thing is the focus of the place: life in space. That, coupled with the kid-friendly tone of the exhibit makes for a grating experience as an adult. You can learn to name planets, see them in space, retrace the timeline of the Earth, what water  is made out of, and are asked ad infinitum ""IS THERE LIFE IN SPACE?"" but nothing gets in depth ever. No Big Bang Theory, no up-to-date feed on the Mars rover, what is a nebula? Where is our very own Commander Hadfield? Julie Payette? Whatever.
The architects banked on both the immersive cinemas which mimic the night sky and space itself. The projections are booked at certain times, and you should either buy tickets online, or come a full hour before your desired projection time. The first presentation ""Continuum"" is stellar, you lounge around, while space opens up around you, to the sound of classical music. Epic. The second is alright: your guide introduces you to constellations, and then the space surrounding the Earth. I could have enjoyed myself if two teenaged airheads next to me hadn't decided otherwise.
You can easily skip this. I think Continuum is worth seeing, but the entry price is too steep for that alone. If ever you crave space-stuff, and are on the American West Coast, go to the Griffith Observatory.",2013-08-17 17:07:34

Our server had some recommendations (maybe since we were taking too long making a decision) and the one we went with was freakin awesome.  The Sen Mee Kang Pou which was a homemade crab curry with thin rice noodle was a slam dunk for both my wife and I.  She said it was one of the best Thai dishes she's ever had and I have to agree.  If everything the waiter recommended was this good then I would have had him pick everything.  

We also tried the Miang Pou.  That was a lettuce wrap with crab meat, ginger, roasted coconut, peanut, chili, lime and onion.  Nice starter and I liked how the filling was arranged in the lettuce to where you get the crab and spice at the end of it.  It was kind of like an appetizer money shot if you will.  

The final dish was the green curry which I wasn't too into getting.  My wife always wants it but I was sure glad we ended up having it because it was terrific. The curry had grilled pork, bamboo shoots and eggplant.  The sauce was really good but the pork was cooked perfectly.  It was so tender and tasty that it made the whole dish for me.  That's a protein I never consider for Thai curry but I definitely would now. 

Sure they have all the usual items any Thai restaurant does but I don't think that's what you should come here for.  Pad Thai schmad Thai yaaawwwwwn.  Quail eggs, Chilean sea bass, lobster and some of the more creative dishes is what I look forward to trying on future visits.",2013-06-01 19:15:58

They serve me absolutely delicious hummus and let's be honest, I could probably finish off the entire serving by myself. Oh wait, I have! The hummus and chicken platter is one of my all-time favorites. However, it's not the healthiest, so most times I try to go with the Broiled Chicken Salad or one of the broiled chicken pitas. However, on a fat kid day, I love the Philly Cheesesteak Pita or the Chicken Cheesesteak pita. I also enjoy the Chicken Lavosh without the garlic sauce and hummus as a substitute (see? More hummus. I'm obsessed). Just recently, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (trying to be healthy) and holy salad Batman. This salad could quite easily feed a family of four. I got through about 1/10 of the salad before getting full and it looked like I hadn't even started eating it. The salad also has enough flavor on its own that it doesn't even need the dressing. If I were to order that salad again, I would share it and add an order of hummus on the side. 

I like this location because it's convenient and a relatively healthy (and quick) option while on the go at the mall.

So far I've gotten Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken which all include white rice, fried rice, or lo mein and an egg roll for about 6 bucks. The portions are HUGE! They give it to you in a jam packed styrofoam container as you can see in my pics. There's so much that it normally takes me two days to finish. No problem there because I love me some Chinese leftovers. 

The Orange Chicken is all white meat which makes it a little more dry than normal, but I still like it more than most other places because I prefer white meat anyway. My brother likes the General Tso's Chicken more though because he says it's less saucy than the Orange Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken I tried today had way too many veggies. I know it's suppose to have a lot of veggies, but there was hardly any meat at all in there; I might as well have just gotten a vegetarian dish. 

Pros:
Cheap
Big portions
Free wifi!
Slushies and Thai Tea
Tasty food
Location
Nice staff
Clean
Free refills

Too little meat in some of the meat dishes

It pays to be on the guest list at Marquee as we were not in line for very long. We were whisked away via a back entrance route to the club. Ladies, this entails a very brutal walk up the stairs as evidenced by my lady friends. The ladies with the large heels have to work for a wonderful clubbing experience. The club consisted of two sections. They were playing hip hop outside while playing EDM inside. The thing that was most noticeable were the translucent hot tubs adjacent to the cabanas. It seems like those tubs would be used during the day time. I was mainly outside listening to the hip hop music but the EDM music was also pretty good as well. Also, if I remember correctly, mixed drinks were about $16 a drink.....so definitely try to pre-drink before you come to the club.

Marquee provides you the ability to purchase your tickets in advance before going to the club. For the world renowned DJ's that they bring into the venue, it is advisable to do so. Also, Marquee has all access wristbands that are good for an entire weekend. One weekend I saw had the price point for an all weekend wristband was $100 for males and $30 for females. I suppose that if you were a guy who really wanted multiple opportunities to hookup with girls, the wristband may be worth it. Who knows......

The music definitely stole the show. I would love to return to Marquee in the near future.",2014-06-30 14:51:28

Even with a menu that is seemingly small, the selection is varied, the portions large and they have a daily sushi roll feature.

All the staff greet and thank the staff in Japanese (thank goodness for the Mr. Roboto song or I wouldn't have know what Arigato meant) and charmingly yell a Japanese phrase across the restaurant as new clients take their seats.

Though they have been in business only a short while, the hostess says they are slammed busy with the downtowners at lunch and I can see why; with the open, casual, bustling atmosphere, good food, a funky soda water list and charming Japanese touches, Goro + Gun is somewhere I would definitively visit again.

Whatever tickles your fancy, they probably have it. 

On weekends, they have live entertainment. Live bands will come in and do their thing, which is a major perk of hanging out here. In the back, there's a pool table, popcorn machine, and a patio. There's a lil' somthing for everybody! 

And, last but not least, my most favorite thing about Edison's: The PIZZA. It's not any fancy classic italian pizza, but just what you need after a night of being out and having too many drinks. It's perfection in all its greasy glory. You can get a cheese or pepperoni pizza slice at the window inside the bar, or you can go to the other side and order it in the pizza kitchen. 

Their whole pizzas are pretty bomb-diggity too. Lots of toppings so you're not being skimped out on anything. It is a little bit pricier than any other pizza joint but you will get your money's worth here. Another genius thing: they brush honey on the crust and dust it with parmesan cheese.

The different friends I brought with me all ended up liking it too! Palmyra occupies the long time bicycle shop that used to be on state st. In contrast to the Mediterranean Cafe also on State, Palmyra does not have 'daily specials'. Instead, they offer a fixed menu, but fret not, with over 30 items to choose from, you won't get bored. 

Through my visits I have witnessed a steadily fast increase in their business, which has grown to be really good. My guess is that word spreads fast for good eateries =) Hopefully it will keep up. The tables are arranged very far apart from one another, leaving a lot of space in between, too much space, if you ask me. Given the way tables are spaced out now, they could most definitely get more and provide greater spots for dine-in if they decide to expand in the near future.

As a previous review pointed out the waiter taking your orders at the counter will ask you for the number of your order. So even if you pronounce the name 100% correct, they will ask you for the number. Often times I find myself being so certain what I wanted, and then lifting my head to the menu to hunt for the magic number. I am not sure what the reason. 

Well the lamb and beef kebabs and schwarma are nice picks. Serving is generously huge, and the meat marinated well and cooked to a light tenderness. The yoghurt sauce that comes with it is refreshing, and the pita bread is served fresh (caution: HOT). Contrary to popular belief, it's a good idea to come here for the chicken wings. This is no typical American food, their wings are freshly fried to order dipped in a special batter consisting of Mediterranean spices. Nothing like what you might have tried in western eateries. Those wings are best eaten in the restaurant where they are crispy. Otherwise the condensed water vapor makes it soggy and there will be a noticeable difference. 

For the light eaters out there is the sandwich plates, choice of sandwich served with fries. Or just get their hummus plate that comes with pita. The one thing I would hope to see on their menu is soups. Lentil soups which are usually a classic in Mediterranean restaurants are, sad to say, non-existent here. 

Too bad location a little far from campus. It's kind of midway between campus and the square. Otherwise I will find myself stopping by a lot more than I am now.",2014-05-10 02:44:56

First of all, the service is impeccable here. The wait staff know what they're doing. They're friendly, informative and always checking to see if everything is great.

Second, the food is tasty, perfectly seasoned, and the right portions. Although, there are times, I wish it was less, so I wouldn't eat it all.

I'm not sure if Yelp saves all of the past reviews, so I won't go into the other meals I've had. For brunch, my friend had the chicken salad, and I had Elizabeth's Caesar with a side of salmon. I love the salmon here. Just a few doors down from Honey Salt they have salad and salmon too for not too difference in price, but the quality and flavor, so much better for the money at Honey Salt. 

The fruit platter is more like a bowl. There's enough fruit for 2-3 people, if you're not making fruit your main meal. I loved the pieces of mint in it. We tried the monkey bread as well. It's more like a cluster of rolls with caramel sauce. It's fun, I think, if you have a few people to share.

Honey Salt knows desserts. The chocolate Society cake is amazing. The banana is an interesting twist. At first, I was more hesitant about the banana, but now I really like it. On this meal, we had the brownies and the brookie with a scoop of ice cream. The brookie is a killer dessert - a little bit of everything you're craving in a dessert. Seriously, I would go to Honey Salt just for the desserts.

We had the bread and salumi. The salumi board was larger than we expected. It probably had 24 pieces of 2 different types of meat and it went really well with the whole wheat bread.
We also had the fried chicken that came with a banana pepper hot sauce and corn relish.The chicken was delicious,juicy and again generous portions(4pieces)

I didn't care for the soy drum sticks, nor their dessert bars.


I should also mention that this place is spacious, so if you want to get out of the hustle and bustle of Kensington market, go here.  It's very clean.  Nice bathrooms.

The restaurant decor is lovely and gives off a very nice vibe. 
The servers and staff were also very accommodating when it came to seating us and serving our food.
For the starter, I ordered the bitter greens salad with the smoked white fish.The fish was delicious but as for the bitter greens, it wasn't my favourite thing to eat. It was way too bitter for me and the portion was too big.
As for the main meal, I ordered the pasta with clams and tomato sauce. It was pretty good and there was a good amount of clams in the pasta. My only criticism is that it was very salty.
For dessert, I ordered the panna cotta which was perfect end to the meal. It wasn't too heavy and was the perfect bite to finish the 3 course meal!
One more thing: When we received our bill, we noticed that the waitress charged us $5.00 for still water ($2.50 for me and $2.50 for my friend). If you do not want to pay for water, I assume you have to specify that you want tap water.",2018-02-04 18:01:52

We were shown to our table and they had rose petals scattered around, nice touch.

We started with crab cakes, I don't really eat crab, But I finished it off, so good! I loved the crispness of the out side of the cake and the sweet corn sauce it was placed upon. 

Next up was soup. Hubs got the lobster bisque and I got the nights special which was a cauliflower puree and cheese soup. AMAZING! I love that they bring the bowl out empty (well there is fun little accompaniments in there) and then pour the soup right there, very fancy. 

Out came the entrees. Hubs had the prime rib and I had the Dover sole. The fish was cooked perfectly. We ate until we were in a food coma. 

But that's not all, as it turns out a friend of ours waiters there, he wasn't working that night but called and told them it was our anniversary, hence the flowers on our table, as we did not tell them when we made reservations.

The name is kind of misleading; it sounded like another Matsuda (the ayce) but is actually an HK style cafe. They do offer several Korean-fusion dishes though. I have yet to try those.

The restaurant is tucked in the corner of the plaza, right where the Garden Basket grocery store is; lots of parking is available. Once you go inside the restaurant, the servers may not greet you right away because their high counter is packed with stuff so they can't really see you. You'll have to manoeuvre your way a little around the counter for them to see you (unless they're already running around so in which case they'll see you come in). You'll see what I mean when you go there. They are really nice and courteous, though. Service is efficient, which is always great, and it is quite spacious there so coming with a small group is ok. 

I usually come here for their half tea. There's plenty of options available. You get the basics like noodles and deep fried stuff, including a few new others. My fave here is their (gigantic) deep fried drum stick, and their pork chop bun. The size of the drum stick is probably bigger than the size of your face (assuming your face is normal size). It's so nice and crispy on the outside, while the inside is juicy and tender. The fries that it comes with is also delicious; it's similar to the ones you get at Costco, not the cheap powdery ones. Same is with their pork chop bun. Very juicy and tender, and the bun that it comes on is crispy and soft. Very satisfying. If you're one to watch TV while eating, they have 4 or 5 huge tv's there!

Do pay this place a visit if you're ever in the area, or just looking for a bite (or two)!",2018-01-22 00:00:45

Senor Frogs is the vacationing tourist bar/ dance spot to go to if you don't want to deal with the crazy pretentious crowd of Cali residents that drove all the way to Vegas to be packed in a club on top of one another.

Its located in the front of the Treasure Island Resort and at 10:30pm you have to be at least 21 or older to enter for a night of drinking and dancing. The DJ was cool, he played top 40s and some hip hop music so we all danced the night away. They were celebrating one of the staff members leaving the TI pirate show so in honor of that we all got up and did the Wobble dance. There was also this 2 for 1 margarita special with the huge souvenir cups so you know we jumped up on that deal.

First, is the food - to start,  I ordered a Caesar salad.  It was excellent.  The dressing was perfect and the croutons were yummy.  There was seriously nothing left on my plate.  For my entree, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.  This dinner item is under $10 and is definitely Bang Bang for your buck.  You also get to choose from a few sides.  I opted for the homemade chips.  They were very tasty but they didn't come with a dipping sauce so we requested a side of ranch.  Just the salad and the tacos filled me up - but of course, we munched on some amazing bread with a side of even better pesto & olive oil.

The waiter was patient (we had a group of 6) and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.  My only complaint was the timing between the salads/apps and our entrees.  My guess is close to a 25-30 minute wait.  About 20 minutes in, the waiter did come over and apologize and said that the kitchen got backed up.  

We did have one birthday girl and she was given a small box of chocolate cookies to take with her.  It was a nice treat!

The bread rolls are to die for. SO good. The whole affair took us nearly 2 hours and I was absolutely stuffed when we left.

This store is really hit and miss.

Sometimes the employees are good, and sometimes they ignore you.

Went here last week, and we were ignored.
I have the worst luck, and just about everything I get from them they discontinue... From bras, to fragrance.....so, I only get panties there now.

The store wasn't that clean when I came in last, and there was a rather large spider, that had spun quite an impressive web on one of the displays. I had to hunt down an employee to tell her, and even then, she didn't look too thrilled when I told her I needed help.

Overpriced lingerie, overpriced yoga pants, that just end up getting holes in them...... I should know, I have a few pair. 

The cotton collection 5/$26 is what I have the better luck with. Anything that is too Lacey, ends up ripping by the 2nd time I wash it...( on gentle, in lingerie bags, might I add). 

They stretch okay.... I'm really bottom heavy (big thighs and toosh... Family curse.), if you stay away from bright sunlight and don't bend over, no one will see that they are completely see through... Or just sit wherever you go. Don't exercise in them.... Lol.

I've been to Brio many times and still visit once a month or so. The ambiance here is warm, the inside dimly lit and there's also plenty of outdoor seating when the weather gets warm. Half of the bar is inside the restaurant and the other half opens out to the outdoor seating area.

Brio has good happy hour specials for Town Square; apps starting around $4 and drinks at $5. Great customer service; the bartenders are all very friendly. 

My favorite, the Shrimptini (cocktail shrimp) was taken off the happy hour menu and I was devastated. I still order it though because it's that good!! The beef carpaccio is excellent as well and I believe that's still on the happy hour menu. The black pepper shrimp is also very good; bite size eggplant pieces topped with peppered shrimp, glazed in a red sauce. Yum!

The only actual dish I've ordered here was a salmon Caesar salad which I had for lunch one day. It came out pre-tossed and was a decent salad. I would give the bar food and service a 5/5 and the Caesar salad a 3/5. Definitely a great place to come for drinks and apps! Especially once it gets nice outside again, Brio is a great choice in Town Square if you wish to eat and drink while enjoying the Vegas sunshine.",2015-02-24 08:06:14

after finishing up dinner at wicked spoon, the guys in our group went to get in line.. i went with my other friend up to the their room to grab the rest of the girls.. in the sea of people in line, i couldn't find the guys.. someone told us to get in the hotel guests line on the 3rd floor.. glad we did bc it only took 15min to get in, however, through that line you had to go up many flights of stairs to get inside =( when we found the guys we were told they had to wait in 1hr+ line on the 2nd floor/main entrance, oh too bad for them, if only they asked they would've found out they could've gone through the hotel guests line..

the stage, lights, visuals were as i expected but the dance floor was too small to my surprise.. the dj's (porter robinson and diplo) that night were good.. after dancing on the main floor for a little bit, i couldnt take that it was so crowded and spent most of the night in the outside area..bc no one was really dancing outside and didn't want to go through the main floor again for a spot to dance..i got bored and wanted to go back to our hotel.. my friend and i left and everyone had go down those many flights of stairs to exit.. not fun..

i'd only go back to marquee nightclub for a good dj i knew was going to be there.. i wouldn't mind checking out the dayclub sometime though..

quick update:
came here again on my next trip and had a good time.. we had dinner across the strip so we went straight here to get stamped for being on gl.. our promoter lead us and the other sea of girls up the escalator (never in my life have i seen an escalator and more filled w hot girls going up while the suckers aka guys were all on the escalator going down to pay for cover haha) we went to the line on the 3rd fl and line went by quickly..i cant believe we got in for free for kaskade!! (his '12 residency is amazing and was 3hrs, btw) anyway, we got our stamps and stayed for 30min before leaving while the opener was still on.. we came back in time for kaskade and the re-entry line wasn't bad at all.. i finally got the chance to check out xs the night before and honestly prefer it over marquee a tad bit..",2011-08-30 03:04:46

My husband and I have been going here for over a year now, and it is hands down one of our favourite places. We go once a week. Our go-to dish is the Nikku Udon. I get the pork, my husband gets the beef. The udon noodles are always cooked perfectly. The soup is sooooo good. And I love the red seasoning that they give you; adds a great touch of heat to each bite. We have been tempted to try other dishes, but each time, we just can't do it! So I am a little biased when it comes to this particular dish.

Tip: 
- once you're done the noodles, you'll wish you had more. I always go for the noodle refill. Only $1.10 extra!
- if you are sensitive to gluten, you can substitute with sweet potato noodles instead. I did last week and they were a great alternative (a little gummy in texture). $1.99 extra.

So, I'll talk about my experience at I-Hop after a 5 year hiatus that goes back to 2009 when we dined in the Fisherman's Wharf restaurant on the week that Michael Jackson passed away. 

  This is an interesting I-Hop. It is located in the parking lot adjacent to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall off of Las Vegas Boulevard a short distance south of where it transitions from the Las Vegas Strip to a local Highway parallel to Interstate 15. This I-Hop is a melting pot of clientele. Under it's roof; tourists, locals, and I-15 motorists enjoy the legendary I-Hop pancakes and breakfasts. 

   This past Saturday, I was facing a 300-minute Praxis exam. I  needed a delicious breakfast that would fill me up. I needed I-Hop. 

   Owing to the fact that you have all the tourists, locals, and I-15 motorists flocking to this I-Hop; it gets busy to the degree that the parking lot and restaurant fills up. I'd park a couple of pads away at Dunkin Donuts. Regardless that I-Hop was hopping with people, they were able to get me in right away. 

   In the five years since I last dined in I-Hop, the menu has changed. I did not see the Rudy Tutie fresh &  fruity breakfast combo that I remember loving so much. Likewise, I saw less of the omelettes I also loved. What I saw more of was higher prices. The majority of the breakfast combos with just a coffee (forget coffee and orange juice) add up to around $15. That is around triple the price of a coffee with a cream cheese bagel or coffee with two donoughts combo a couple pads away at Dunkin Donuts. Regardless, I did see a combination with a stack of  flavored pancakes that included bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. 

  Just looking at the picture of the stack of strawberry pancakes topped with that mouth watering strawberry sauce, strawberries, and whip cream makes me salivate. Their fruity pancakes are the bomb. The scrambled eggs were also out of this World delicious. The bacon was cooked at just the right temperature. The coffee, served in a kettle was premium tasting. The one weakness was that the top center of the hash browns was hard. 

  The service was okay. I appreciate that regardless of how busy they were that they did not rush me. Still there were some flaws in the service. At the time the waitress served the coffee there was no silverware. Likewise, I'd have to reach across a recently vacated dirty table to grab Sweet & Lows. 

 In conclusion I am more of a dinner than breakfast person. I prefer to look forward to eating out. However, every once in awhile either I deserve to treat myself to a good breakfast or feel the necessity for one before a long test or event.",2015-02-24 05:07:56

Very surprisingly, I hadn't heard of Sweet Republic until I moved in basically right behind the store. It was a sweltering summer afternoon, I wasn't working, and I spied ice cream. I was dubious at the amount I was paying for a scoop of espresso, but I tried it out.

HOLY.

Since then, we've become ultimate fans. I know, duh, Food Network, countless local awards and 325 reviews, almost all glowing, can't be wrong. Brave the line--it's worth it.

Flavors we've had:

Espresso: Pure coffee flavor, with a chocolatey kick. Perfection. Buzzbuzz.

Real Mint Chip: They ask you if you've had it before, because it's natural, real mint goodness and some fat 'murcans have a dumbed down palate. Refreshing amaze-mint. (Get it?!?!?!)

Maple Pecan: Boyfriend's favorite. Chunks of pecans in sweet, sweet mapley goodness. He likes it more than he likes me. I bought a pint for him when he was sick and it immediately healed. True story.

Pumpkin Spice: You don't need pie anymore, or a PSL from Starby's. Get thee to SR for this holiday TREATACULAR.

Horchata: I know what you're thinking...well, maybe you're not thinking, because your brain just exploded in cinnamony goodness just trying to figure out how delicious this could be. Hint: it's BETTER THAN THAT.

Brownie Swirl: Chocolate Explosion. Enough.

I've also sampled a wide variety; the Earl Gray sticks out in my mind for being so unique.

The waffle cones and bowls are made fresh and if you just want to throw all caloric issues aside, get 2 scoops in a bowl and call it a crisp-ity, crunch-ity day.

I visited the Las Vegas Convention Center for the Wizard World Comic Con. Oddly enough, a car wash convention was taking place in another area of the convention center at the same time. Really? People go to car wash conventions? Anyways...

There were only 2 food options in the Comic Con area: A pizza place and a hamburger place. Both were outrageously expensive for extremely sub par food. The first day of the Con we ate at the hamburger joint. I ordered a veggie burger with fries, and my dining partner ordered a burger combo. The total came to an astounding $27 + change. You're killing me smalls!! The food was, uh, edible. 
TIP: Try not to at the Convention Center if you can help it. 

Parking in the convention lot was $10 and was limited. Most lots were full, too. However, we parked across the street in a lot for free! (If you look across the street on the corner, there's a walkway and elevator that links to another parking lot. More walking involved but it beats the $10 price tag).

I've had this place bookmarked for a long time, and finally got an opportunity to check it out. When we were seated (around 5:30), we were the only guests in the place. It was only my second go around with Vietnamese food, and since the menu had so many different types of dishes I'd never heard of I decided to trust her on her choices. Our waitress was extremely upbeat and friendly and was actually fantastic in her recommendations.

My buddy ordered a rice noodle dish with ham, sprouts, and other veggies that was light and tasty, esp when accompanied with the sauce. My dish was phenomenal with two big crepes filled with shrimp, sprouts, pork, and something else and was accompanied by a virtual field of greens, cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, and other healthy stuff! The dish was filling but not greasy which was a nice switch up from most Americanized asian food joints.

I usually cannot go and study on a regular basis at libraries because I need food. Constantly. So I usually like to visit new cafes to fulfill both my stomach and brain. 

Sometime ago, I went to One Hour Cafeteria, located near Spadina and College. It's a Chinese cafe run (I think) by Chinese young adults in their mid 20s. They have a pretty good menu of bubble tea, desserts, and food. I personally like noodles, so I thought I'd try their Zha Jiang Noodles with their recommended Taro Slush. 

Zha Jiang Noodles:
The noodle bowl was pretty small, about your average palm size, and it was warm when served. The Korean cuisine has a similar dish with the exact same name, except the sauce is made of black bean instead of minced pork like it was here. The vegetables were very fresh, noodles very good, and all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the food. For me, the food portion was a tad bit small, but that might've been also because I was famished. Next time, I'd like to order a small dessert to go along with the food.

Taro slush:
The slush was good, nothing extraordinary, but they seemed to use fresh taro instead of the powdered kind that you normally see in bubble tea shops. 

They have wifi, but I couldn't really figure out what the password was... something to do with a lot of 8's and h's. That day, I was lazy and didn't ask but I am sure they will be more than happy to help you out.

Their interior is also very appealing, they have small tables by the walls and also big tables for friends with bean bags as their chairs. On the walls they had coat hangers for all which was a very nice touch and their washrooms were very modern and clean.

Maybe it's because of their name, but everyone seemed to be sort of leaving after one hour ... I felt a bit intimidated to stay for longer.

I had the Meat roditizo, unlimited access to the side bar (not salad bar) which was fresh and delicious, the cheese bread is my favorite.

One out of the eight meats I tried was dry and two of eight I got a 'bad cut' (fat and grizzle). I enjoyed all, however with the sausage being my favorite overall. 
Sangria from the bar was delicious, although not very potent (if you are looking for such things).
Service was attentive, although the hostess was not very friendly and I noticed other diners having issues with certain servers. Once the meats started coming, they continued at a good pace, with a emphasis on the chicken (often times paired with other meats such as bacon or sausage).

They have a great outdoor patio and location so they have the ability to thrive. My coworkers and I all felt the same way, our main entrees were awful.  All I had was a salad and soup, and I'm not sure how that can be messed up but it was.  There was not enough flavor and overall zest.

Honestly, I snuck a few just now and they are so delish! Very fresh, not overly greasy and totally massive! They are easily 1.5 times the size of a normal samosa. If not double some places.

We opted for the AYCE menu which I believe was about 26.95 a pop, and is definitely the way to go since rolls start at like 11.95 and nigiri can range from 6.95-9.95. There are limitations of course, only 1 order of sweet shrimp and uni per person, no sashimi, and you must eat all the rice or you'll get charged for leftovers. I wasn't blown away by the flavor or quality, but it wasn't horrible either. The halibut and salmon belly were the best, but the tuna and yellowtail etc. all have a way of blending in together sometimes. I tried mackerel for the first time....pass. Way too fishy.

Not to mention opening week. If you plan on coming, then expect a wait for the next week or two at least!! If you complain about the wait, you're a new kind of special. 

The place was packed to say the least, both the store and the restaurant. The seating area outside was pretty packed as well but as they turned tables it slowly got less and less packed. I think people came in waves lol 

After we were seated we were greeted by our waitress who had a member of the training staff with her (red shirt) and she took our drink order. It didn't take any longer than expected for the drinks to come out. We noted that the tables were cleaned up pretty quickly for another party to be seated. 

The service overall was pretty good, they had people coming around checking on tables to make sure the drinks were filled and what not. The assistant managers were checking on tables to make sure people were happy, etc. It's to be expected for opening day. They probably had double the staff on hand working and training. 

I ordered unsweetened ice tea which is pretty much the same where ever you go. The rest of our table had sweet tea, orange 'n cream, and apple cider. The drinks were all on point. I'm not a huge fan of apple cider because I can never find ones that I like, but their apple cider is on point! The sweet tea wasn't overly sweet, which was good for me but my friend likes it extra sweet so she dumped another two packs of sugar into it! 

Our table had Chicken and dumplings platter, rainbow trout dinner plate, and the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast. We all shared a bite to see what everything tasted. The difference between the platters and dinner plate is the size of the entree and an extra side. I got the rainbow trout  with corn and mashed potatoes.

I'm gonna have to comeback and try one of those concretes cause it surely sounded good.  I guess you can say a concrete is a mixture of toppings with the yogurt of your choice.

Wish they had a $7.

UPDATE:
Bought the $9 wash, accidentally dropped my Credit Card after scanning, attendant picked up for me. Noticed car from first lane on left pull into wash lane in front of me.
I believe he got my $9 wash & I got his $5 wash.

When I came out of wash I drove to attendant and & told him I paid for $9 wash but got $5 wash.
He stopped me from explaining & quickly asked how I know that I got a $5 wash so I explained.
He was quick to say I need to tell that to the Manager. Didn't offer a number to call or I guess doesn't have the authority to run my car back thru for the wash I paid for?
So I asked how I talk to a manager? Complain on Yelp? And he replacing I can go on Yelp & get the number there.

So here I am wasting my time updating my review, therefore I figuired I might as lower my 4 Star review to 1 Stars.
Should have been a Zero for loss of $4.

Customers, BEWARE if anyone else paying about same time as you in another lane, you might not get what you pay for.

WOW system is FLAWED!

Simple, they seem better than the last time I was working/shopping here. I went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the Summer, but certain areas of clothing had been moved around. Despite all the moving and switching around they must have done, the store seemed really clean and in order. In fact, I really have no issues with this store except one, teeny tiny, little problem...the check out girl!

I remember her from when I worked here and she gave me attitude when I needed to ask her something. Turns out, it wasn't a one time thing.. she's just a rude person. On this particular night, there were only two check out girls and a line of about 15 people. My boyfriend and I were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her. I happened to get the friendly one, but before we each paid for our items, we were watching as the rude girl didn't crack even ONE half-hearted attempt at a smile. We listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced. They wanted to make sure they weren't paying too much/too little and her explanation?: ""That ones been the store longer."" It didn't make sense to them, or to those of us in line watching, but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue. She shoved people's items in bags and practically threw them at them and said, again without trying to fake some kind of customer service, ""Have a good night. Bye. NEXT!"" Yuck.

My cashier was slightly more frienldy, but still not awesome. It was obvious she was having a long night (afterall, she was stuck at the register with the Ice Queen), so it was understandable. Also, I didn't catch her name, but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by. 

I had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something I was filling out on a form and I was told they've got a new manager. Thus, I know why this jumped up two stars. It could have been four, but certain things they haven't fixed (rude cashier girl) have kept this review at a solid three.",2010-01-13 15:35:56

I would like to note that the nachos were extraordinarily delicious. They had this slight tropical twist to them with the sauce and the pineapples on them. I've never had nachos like such, but it complemented the dish beautifully. 

The exterior is so deceiving... you would never guess there is a beautiful restaurant hall inside. I love how they kept most of the old church images and style while adding their own Pittsburgh twist with the brewers.

Nevertheless, the cupcakes are pretty and taste great. I usually get red velvet or dark chocolate (mostly because I default to chocolate and haven't seen any interesting seasonals in my years here nor do they offer much choice). It looks like they use cacao nibs for the red velvet which is great. 

It's true-- the cupcakes do get stale as the day wears on. The cream does develop a shell. It would be reasonable to slash prices after, say, 6. However, I've never had a truly dry cupcake as other reviews mentioned. 

The giant pistachio macarons are yummy. Considering how involved macarons are, I think the $5+ price tag is somewhat justified. I've tried their gummy candies as well but I found those to be unremarkable.

We Went here for my dad's birthday for lunch and left with mixed impressions. There's definitely a few hit or misses here.  First turn off which is where I would give my strike is the lack of courtesy. Easily ordered the most expensive dishes on the menu, which included 6 salads and miso soups. We had 7 people, and common business sense dictates that a complementary salad and soup be provided. This was not the case, we were given the excuse that the $69.99 sashimi platter doesn't come with it. I would understand if we only ordered like 6 combos, we ordered 6 plus a really expensive dish. It's literally the cost of $1. That's like tea money.

Now the quality of food was definitely good. Good cuts of sashimi, good rolls with the combos, and definitely decent ramen. From the lunch special, do not order the ""dons"". It is a complete rip off. The size was tiny!!!! It was the smallest don I've ever seen. I swear they priced it for $12 and decided to up it to $18 before tax.

For lunch, you should get the ramen, now that's bang for buck right there. Not the best soup base, ingredients, or noodles, but it was all done right to a decent quality. For the cost, you get a salad, miso soup, maki(roll), and the ramen. My girlfriend personally got the oyster ramen, and it's definitely enough to fill a normal person. Sharing is whole other story though. We also saw the sushi/maki lunch specials, and they were definitely worth the price also assuming the fish quality was consistent.

We also ordered from the dinner menu, and I can saw don't order the sashimi, 35 piece set. The presentation was a bit sad and the variety a bit lacking. I expected at least Uni to be there, but it wasn't. Much better off ordering a la carte at this place if you want your money's worth for the quality of raw fish. Do not get the bento A dinner. It's $23.99 for a bunch of vegetarian food that's worth like $10 when you put it all together. It was tofu(bean curd) sushi, more tofu, veggie tempuras, avacodo maki and edamame. I was pretty underwhelmed. 

The only redeeming part of the whole dinner was their coffee/mocha dessert pudding, which was sadly probably their best dish. However, they did give us 7 this time opposed to 6, because they probably heard the disappointment in my voice when I asked about the salad/miso soup. 

Overall, this place is average at best, I would solely only go here if I was close by and wanted some  good a la carte sushi and the ramen. Definitely, not a place to go with big groups.",2016-03-21 01:09:57

The server/manager is a piece of work and when you ask questions about the items, she is extremely matter of fact and may come off as being rude. We asked for a separate bowl to split our pho and rather than just oblige she gave some bs reasons why she wouldn't do it.

This is like the Dick's Last Resort of Pho......or the manager is a pure marketing genius pawning her food challenges and rude service to lure people in.  Hey - it worked for me!

The Ox Tail pho was really good.  The noodles were northern style, thick and girthy to supplement the richness and oils from the soup which was not like Pho So 1's watered down soup.

Bad: Service was awful.  We all got AYCE, and they had us fill out the papers on the table (which is normal.)  We only received some of the food that was ordered and had to request the rest of it on more than one occasion.

Some of us had beer, some had sake, some (myself) just had water.  The server couldn't figure out who had who, so wrote all of the checks as one lump sum and split it between us... making my (and my girls) 2 $25 AYCE and waters to $74.  Everyone else at the table was having the same issue.  When we explained that we all know what we ordered and should pay that, the server started to argue (really) with us about ""how it works.""

Warning to anyone attempting to come here with anything but a pack of girls: be prepared for at least a two hour wait, even if you get there at 9:00, and even if you're on the guest list. Also, you won't be able to get it without bottle service (~$1500 for 3 bottles the worst tables outside) if you don't have an even ratio of guys to girls. The line outside had to be breaking some sort of fire code with the massive hoard of hot, sweaty, cramped people gathered on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. I can't stress how un-awesome that was.

Once we finally were escorted inside, I was shocked that instead of putting us in the elevator to get to the club, they led a group of ~20 people to the STAIRWELL and had us climb 4 flights of stairs. W.T.F. They said it was to get people in the club faster - bull $h!t. I waited two hours in 4"" heels - you better carry my @$$ up these stairs!

Once we finally got into the club, it was indeed amazing. The design has a very spacious industrial feel to it. There is lots of space, occupied by tons of people. The stairwell put us into the smaller Boombox Room, with DJ Lisa Pittman spinning with DJ Eric DLux (from Power 106 in LA... whoop whoop!) We checked it out for a bit and found fresh air outside that room.

We went upstairs to the main dancefloor that lead to the outside area where we could smoke our cigar. That whole floor is huge, and really fun. Outside by the pool has got to be my favorite area (beside the Boombox Room), because of the fresh air, awesome views of Aria & City Center, the nice decor, & good music.

Overall, the club needs some work... I'll be happy to come back when they get their $h!t straight. Until the wait and the elevator situation are remedied, I'd much rather party at the other awesome clubs in Vegas that have it down. It was nice to check it out though!",2011-01-13 18:41:54

The food here is SO GOOD, period, & that makes it worth coming back to over & over & over... & over. I've been coming here since they opened nearly a decade ago, & it's still among my favorites in the area. Their menu changes with some regularity, but as I write this, I'm a big fan of their plantain nachos (so unusual!), crispy Brussels sprouts (OH MY GOD), adult mac & cheese (there's lobster in it!), sweet potato gnocchi (one of the most delicious dishes I've ever tasted)., & the adult cherry coke (mmm, whiskey). The atmosphere is quaint & perfect for a meal with your parents or with a date. 

Occasionally, you can snag a good deal on Groupon, which helps bring down some of the high prices (again: the food is WORTH IT), & they have great nightly specials. On Wednesdays, they host ""The Original Cheap Date Night,"" your choice of six pizzas or three pastas, two salads, & a pitcher of draft beer or bottle wine, plus dessert for two...  all for $35.

Subway and Port of Subs aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.  The sandwiches are delicious and huge.  Unlike the other sub places, this place actually has a fair amount of meat and other items in between the bread.  Not like some places where you have to pay extra dollars just for enough meat to actually taste it.  For me, it's all abou the spicy italian, with lots of these tasty chopped peppers.  Sure it's not $5 to eat, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and get a sandwich that is filling, and taste way better than all others.  There is a Subway pretty much in the same parking lot as my job, but I would rather drive a few miles down the road any day to get Capriottis instead.",2012-10-10 18:18:16

The food also came pretty quickly, so i was pretty happy with the service.

Food wise, I am going to speak for their vegetarian options, cuz that's also partly what they are known for. I would give it a 3 for the food quality. So we ordered this vegetarian gyoza and it was very yummy. Although the crust was a little thick, the flavor was pretty good. Then I ordered the vegetarian pad thai. It was pretty well made and the portion size was very reasonable too. It costed only $11 so that was not expensive either.

We took a French friend there to see it, she thought they did a good job representing her city and told us some historical facts about the replicas.
The drinks are very, very expensive. Also, my friend paid less than I did for one round of the same drink, then she got comped another (by a totally different bartender) while I paid $13 for mine. The bartender was cool though because she wanted something 'really hard' which we explained is called 'strong' so he created something strong and not sweet, she loved it. As long as most of us were happy it's a-ok.
Oh, and we asked one employee if there was anything Moulin Rouge themed and she asked 'what is the Moulin Rouge? I saw a movie, but I have no idea what it is.'

You may get lost trying to find this place because there are 2 ways in. There is an entrance straight from the parking lot that takes you into the bowling alley, and you just walk down the length and arrive at the restaurant or you go into the plaza and up the stairs or elevator. It is just easier to go from the parking lot but it is an unmarked entrance.

When I first came here, it was bubbling with pots everywhere and there were lots of people. Business has died down a bit but I still think that they're food is pretty good. I mean, how can you actually mess up raw food that patrons cook themselves? 

Their sauce bar has a wide selection of different sauces as well as other add ons like seaweed, century eggs, raw eggs, different herbs etc. and it is here that you choose what you want in your soup base, whether it be miso or spicy etc. 

There is an upgrade for seafood, it's an extra $4 (I think) for one plate of oysters, salmon, shrimp, scallops and various other things. But you only get this one platter, meaning this portion is not all you can eat. 

I'm not a picky hot pot person, if you serve udon noodles with beef, I'm pretty much good to go. The udon that they serve here is really good. I think that's why I like coming back here. They do offer the bbq side grill, it's sort of like korean bbq but you also get hot pot at the same time. I rarely ever see anyone take advantage of this option.

They used to have a special with the bowling alley, if you eat at Hot Pot King, and take your receipt, you will get one free soft ice cream cone per person. This used to be the draw and allure of coming here but they have since gotten rid of this option. In its place, they now serve a dessert on the premises. Usually it's a Chinese papaya dessert soup, couldn't tell you the name if my life depended on it but it's pretty good, but not as good as ice cream.",2009-10-26 19:25:50

I actually love the different bentos, my go to bento would be the 808. Spam, bbq chicken, teriyaki beef, fried salmon and rice. I usually order a side of Kim chee and mac/potato salad as well. 

For a quick lunch while your working, this is definitely a fave of mines

The ultimate is the Kalbi short ribs plate. It's $16.00 but it comes with rice and a side salad, but the Kalbi is cut so thick, you're going to love this plate! Especially if you're like me and have a Hawaiian sized stomach!

Today, I ordered the garlic chicken combo plate with bbq chicken - WOW!

The garlic chicken sort of reminds me of mochiko chicken with a nice garlic aioli.

Folks, if you love Hawaiian BBQ, you can't go wrong with this place. The food is yummy and the portions are just right.

Check out the food, order take out or delivery and enjoy some good Hawaiian style bbq!

I was alone, so I did something kind of shameful...I set out to find the Olive Garden that was tucked away off of Independence Blvd. I found it, but much to my salad-craving chagrin, it was closed. Closed, gone the way of other Independence Blvd. businesses. So no unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks for me. 

I started thinking of where I might find some affordable, but good Italian food, and I remembered Portofino's. It's not in the nicest shopping center ever, but the food is really good, and the prices are very reasonable. For $13 or so, I got stuffed shells, a soda, crusty bread, and a delicious, delightful salad. I was pleased.

The servers were friendly, and the service was quick. There was no line to wait, either, even on a busy Saturday night...so it's a far better option than some of the ""fancier"" Italian restaurants. Yes, this shopping center is kind of creepy, but Portofino's is worth it.",2011-02-20 12:10:20

Had been to the south end one, but this one is closer to home now and I had heard good things about it. So, off we went last minute while running errands. Casual atmosphere, the details of the restaurant are NOT refined so you can go in there with jeans and a t-shirt and feel right at home. The carpet is old school and the boxes of wine I noted in the middle making a divider of sorts really need to go in the back room. but anyways back to the food.
We ordered my fave, fettuccine alfredo with jumbo shrimp. Now, I would not say they were JUMBO but they were not salad shrimp either. Best thing however is that they were cooked perfectly. One of my pet peeves is overcooked shrimp or seafood of any kind. At first I thought the portion of pasta was not going to be enough but it was. I am still full and we ate 2 1/2 hours ago. The alfredo sauce was amazing, plentiful and I loved the fresh, warm bread to soak it up with. They gave us extra pieces of bread too, no charge.
My spouse had the spaghetti and meatballs and this is not something he would just order from anywhere. It was very good, very authentic and lots of meat sauce. Picture being in Italy at your best friend's Nona's house. THAT was the quality of this pasta and it was done al dente. You and I both know how easy it is to kill a spaghetti dish which is why I make that type of pasta myself usually. But here, very good! The meatballs - there were 2 on the plate and large, good consistency, the meat did not fall apart when you cut into them.
Our server was very personable and on the ball. He even recommended me a dish that saved me money in the end which gave me more shrimp! My spouse loved the temperature of his beer.No beer on tap here though? I had a short glass vodka/cran. Meh, they were out of the good vodka. I had a very small glass of Merlot that set us back $7.50 that I was not impressed with. I will get different type of drink next time, the sizes of the wine glass were really a joke.

The bar is then surrounded with the bar stools accentuating the circinate theme. Then, the lounge table and seats are situated on the inner circumference of the venue. The only factor that could out the disk-esque them would be for the bar to actually spin! That would empasize the layout in 'centrifugal' terms.

The thing I don't like about round bars is that is is difficult for bartender to see all the customers behind them if they are facing the outside of the circle. If the bartender is facing the shelves of booze  which are in the center of the bar, it blocks his/her view of guests on the other side. I wish I could draw this out to explain but you'll just have to use your imagination. So when we first got there we sat down for a bit  but then I realized that we couldn't see the bartender and he couldn't see us. So I had to go find him. Phew.

I wish I could remember his name as he was very polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the beers. I didn't expect that as Centrifuge is chill yet clubby - flatscreens with sports on but in a low lit and high-ceiling environment with ambient music playing. If the manager is reading this, our bartender was young and African-American. Give him props!

Centrifuge surprisingly has bottle service. But it's at a much lower cost than at the clubs. So for those of you who are on a budget or just don't like clubs, for whatever reason, this is decent option.",2011-06-03 16:49:43

Our waiter never mentioned the specials to us but the table next to us got the full run-down.  My husband's Crown & Coke tasted off.  At first glance, most pastas and entrees are $25 ish.  We started with salads.  I opted for the sun dried tomato vinaigrette with Gorgonzola.  I had to salt it because it was under seasoned.  And there was barely any Gorgonzola on it.  I went with the gnocchi.  Again, under salted.  The sauce was nice and creamy but it didn't have much flavor aside from the included sausage.  Now here is where it gets weird...the wine list.  How in the world can a restaurant with entrees in the $25 price range have a wine list that only lists varietals and no brands?  I asked the waiter about the brands and he was very sheepish about it.  Translation:  these are cheap wines, folks.  Yes, they are mostly Italian varietals but how can you pour a Super Tuscan for $8 a glass?  Hmm...  this place seems to be an old pizza place that one day decided to expand into a full size, albeit super small restaurant.  Given that Dante in Tremont, Nora in Little Italy, and Trentina in Cleveland Heights has similar price points in their menus, these places are all head and shoulders above Marotta's in terms of food quality, restaurant experience, and certainly wine list.

MIANG POU - Lettuce wraps. These were good, but actually my least favorite. It has fried coconut and I hate coconut in any food. But if you like it, go for it. 

MOO HONG - Braised Pork belly. Super super good. The sauce was stronger than I expected, but I was very happy. 

PANANG CURRY - Very good, but holy hell, was it spicy! I would have preferred it with chicken or shrimp though. 

GREEN CURRY - this was tasty for me. I'm usuall not the biggest green curry fan, but it was very good. They serve it with pork, which again--I'd probably prefer it with chicken or shrimp. 

PAD THAI HOR KAI w Shrimp. This stuff is it. Best Pad Thai we've ever had. Even better than what we had in Thailand... insanely good.

I've never used any sort of long term airport parking facilities, so I did my research before deciding to use Blue Sky.  Luckily, I also scored a coupon in my Valu-Pak mailer just in time for my travels. 

GPS guided me to their lot without any complications.  Upon arrival at their security gate/entrance, I was promptly greeted by a uniformed employee, who kindly instructed me where to park and that I should wait at my car for the shuttle to come to me.  The shuttle came shortly after we parked but it was dropping off customers, so we had to wait @ 5 minutes or so for it to come back around to get us.

The driver was courteous and he provided us with a card showing our parking spot #, and he instructed us to call the number on the card for airport pickup when we return (very helpful info since we were returning late).

Upon our return, I called the phone number after I'd deplaned and the shuttle was there about 5 minutes after we arrived at the dedicated pick-up spot.  My car was found in good condition (no door dings found). Thanks to another Yelper, I was aware that I could use the Yelp discount in conjunction with the ValuPak coupon.

I was supposed to go play tennis, but the pouring rain said otherwise... and then what I thought was going to be a ""quiet night in"" turned into an amazing feast.

Firstly, I want to commend the servers and staff of this place - I know it probably does take a lot of patience to deal with food noobs to this place.  Everyone was so friendly and had a ton of suggestions - especially since it was my group's first time there.  

While we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we found a spot underneath the metal awning behind the bar which is probably my favorite spot since you have bar service right in front of you and can people watch into the rest of the entire restaurant.  People will be fighting me for this spot when it gets warmer and the weather becomes more predictable, but for now... I'll take a little rain since it drove people inside.  

Our very nice bar server suggested to start with soju, but I was leaning toward the beer- she must have had training from Leonardo DiCaprio and ""inceptioned "" me since I decided to go soju anyway.  I forgot how good soju can be - they offer a ton of different flavors, but I went straight up.  Later a friend ordered the yogurt soju and it came with a smoking shaker....  later I deemed it unicorn tears since it was so good - I've also had a good base of regular soju so my talking filter was unhinged that evening.

The table became ready and everyone arrived so we decided to take the awning party to the table.  The menu has a lot of choices... it's a one page menu, but it can be intimidating.  The BEST part is that you can't go wrong with anything you order... and don't be shy to share!  We ended up trying things off of a complete stranger's table (we traded bites of items).  I love it when food brings people together.

Got to try the pork belly, wings, brunswick stew, kimchi slaw (vinegar), soy deviled eggs, ramen mac & cheese, sweet potato swirl.  My taste buds and stomach were a pair of happy campers that evening.  

Overall the place has a great location... I love the fact that they don't let people park on the street in front of the restaurant.  Lets you see the patio and also gives you an unobstructed view of uptown when you are in the patio itself.  The decor is super inviting and comfortable, just like the people working really hard to make sure you have a great experience here.

Absolutely gorgeous, well laid out, easy to navigate (except for the cash registers... weirdly located).... you couldn't ask for more in a grocery store.

I went over to the bakery area and poked around and ended up asking about getting a slab cake with some writing on it. I didn't want something with flowers because it was for a guy and I talked to the guy behind the counter for a bit and he told me special orders would take 24 hours. I almost walked away but he pointed out the cakes they had in the display and told me they could write on it right now. We went back and forth about the cakes (no flowers please) and they went in the back and found one with balloons instead and did the writing on the spot.

For $23.99 I got a cake that fed more than 12 people with customized writing to match the piping already on the cake itself. Everyone was really pleased with the cake. It was super moist, not a TON of icing like you normally get and it was just perfect. I would totally go back here again for this kind of thing, the right price and good quality too.

I've been to this place about 7 times and have ordered over a dozen peking ducks. I have had peking duck at pricier restaurants but this is my favourite (so far).

I have three expectations for a ""good Peking Duck"":
1) The skin has to be CRISPY with a good roasted colour
2) The meat has to be TENDER and JUICY and flavourful
3) Unlimited hoisin sauce (at no charge!)

I'm serious about #3. What's peking duck without hoisin sauce?! Anyways, I think out of the dozen or so times I ordered the peking duck, only twice was the skin slightly under the crispy side. 

I almost always order the two-course duck since I'm not a big fan of soup (that comes with the three-course). They give enough wraps/pancakes/crepes for the first course and usually not enough lettuce wraps for the second course. Feel free to ask for more, though I can't remember if they charge you extra. One order of the two course duck is enough for three people, maybe four if you order another dish.

I love ""mudbugs"" and Hot N Juicy had long been on my Vegas and DC ""to do"" lists.  They offer a lot more besides crawfish, but I went for what I was craving, a pound of crawfish ($14.95) with Hot N Juicy seasoning.  I believe March is right in the middle of crawfish season, so I was willing to pay a little more for live crawfish vice frozen.  Not being familiar with Hot N Juicy and their definition of spiciness, I played it safe and went with the medium spice level.  I washed it down with my new favorite beer, Joseph James Citra Rye American Pale Ale, which they had on tap.    

In truth, crawfish is an acquired taste as it's extremely messy to eat and there's a lot of work for the relatively small payoff of in terms of crawfish tail meat.  It becomes an even smaller payoff if you aren't into sucking the heads.  In short order, I received a plastic bag filled with a pound of whole crawfish bathed in the Hot N Juicy sauce.  The Hot N Juicy sauce was delicious and the medium had plenty of heat (I'll admit it worked up a little sweat on my brow) without overwhelming the delicate flavors of the crawfish meat.  It was good and messy.  Thankfully, they provided a bib.  Like I said, crawfish isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind getting messy (probably not the place to go if you're wearing a suit, or white or light colored clothing), then Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a great choice to get your mudbug fix.",2017-03-28 21:54:56

Really, the worst part about this place is that when I say their name a lot of people have no idea what I'm talking about - and when I tell them, they ask, ""There's a movie theater in Lawrenceville?""

We need to fix this, ASAP, because Row House is wonderful. A little 80-some seat and single-screen theater located in Lawrenceville, they run about two to four movies at a time here; each movie that they pick will somehow fit into the ""theme"" that they've chosen for each particular week. So while this isn't the place to go for most new releases (with some exceptions), depending on the theme of the week, it IS the place to go to catch a favorite film of yours on the big screen. For example, this past week the theme was ""graphic novels"" - so all week they played ""V For Vendetta"", ""Sin City"", and ""The Crow."" Nice, if I do say so myself!

Since movies only stay here for about a week total, it's smart to check their website and social media to find out what's coming up in their schedule. A week isn't very much time to catch a favorite movie if you let yourself get too busy before picking a showtime, believe me. Fortunately, usually the films are shown at different times on different days throughout the week, so that those of us who can't get anywhere at 3pm one day have a chance to get the movie later in the evening on a different day. 

By the way, when checking their calendar I HIGHLY recommend watching for any announcements regarding RiffTrax screenings here. I've only gone to one so far, but I am DEFINITELY watching for more in the weeks to come. RiffTrax are often hysterical, and the ability to enjoy them while also enjoying the view of a movie on the big screen is a real treat. Add in the awesome audiences that this place attracts - not to mention the natural popcorn, real better, vegan snacks, and even drinks from Atlas Bottle Works that you can enjoy during your showing - and you can get quite the night out here!

My only possible complaint is just their location. Not that Lawrenceville is bad, of course, but parking in Lawrenceville is not easy, guys. This is not a theater you can get to at the last minute very easily - it admittedly takes a little planning and often requires you to budget for some time so you can find a spot and actually get to the theater. Still, it's SO worth it, and I'll happily deal with this problem in the future for the chance to catch more of my favorite movies here. Hopefully more of you will, too, because they're a fabulous little theater, and they deserve every ounce of support we can offer them!",2015-11-06 21:26:10

Obviously we all know the view from Mt. Washington is amazing but it still blows your mind each and every time you see it. The view from this restaurant is simply breath taking. FYI little tip...press your camera directly up against the glass and you won't get a glare in your photos.

For the event I chose the salmon as my main entree and the creme brûlée for dessert. The salmon was absolutely amazing. Cooked absolutely perfectly and the almond crust on the outside was surprisingly very good with salmon. Something I wouldn't have typically considered pairing with salmon. The creme brûlée was also amazing! As creme brûlée almost always is. The sugar layer on top could have been a little harder like your typical creme brûlée though.

There are numerous water slides to choose from including ones to slide down on a mat, 4-person raft, many traditional, and multiple on a (no charge) inflatable tube. The lines do not move as fast as you would expect with slides that allow 3-6 people at a time.  The slides themselves are awesome and offer a good variety.

Other reviews talk about multiple down rides, only the yellow half pipe slide was down and it looked like it was down for at least a few weeks.

We really enjoyed the lazy river which was long and had many different features. It gets a bit congested as the day goes on. They tell you that you must be in an tube.

The wave pool was very underwhelming. I have been in a few other wave pools where the deep end is a bit of a challenge. Boring here.

The lockers were great with a kiosk to pay for lockers with a card then wristbands are printed to access. Just go up to a bank of lockers and scan your barcode and an available one opens. Then come back all day and scan to get back in. Very easy.

Due to the amount of people that attend, there are a number of improvements that can be made to further smooth out the guest experience.

Although there are people helping I would like to see people check kid heights and overall optimizing line wait times. Organizing people in lines, making sure they are in their intended line, etc. Also, we would see groups of two go down 4-person rides where we would eventually get up and be paired with people. Why did they not go with others?

Although the locked attendant eventually helped us, it would be nice if the locker instructions were more visible.  More maps would also be helpful.

Now, I never got to try their macaroon cuz they ran out, so I can't comment on that, but if your restaurant got freaking macaroon on the wall as decorations, you'd think they would have it, since it's like their specialty??

The pate chaud was ok, it was just some meat on a crusty pasty and I didn't really care for it. I also tried the almond croissant, and the owner said that it is like drug and I thought it was ok too lol.

The reviews drew us in and once inside the open floor plan and friendly staffers were great additions. This place has a great open floor plan and the outdoor space was pretty green and had a couple of bags games set up. 
Our server was very attentive and took our order promptly. We ordered the Fries Green Tomato appetizer which is served over grits and topped cowboy caviar. The tomatoes were yummy but the show stopper was tied between the cowboy caviar and the grits both perfect accents.
I ordered the Black Bean Burger:
*It was extremely dry and below basic 
Our son had chicken tenders:
*They appeared ok, however he bit one and didn't eat anymore he only ate the fries and he isn't a fry type of kid. I must add that he doesn't eat meat much either but if it's super yummy he does.
My husband ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich:
*He stated that the Waffle was to doughy. He enjoyed the honey type drizzle on the chicken. Our son even took a bite of his sandwich. My husband didn't finish his food which says a lot.
I was reminded by our server that I mentioned wanting a milk shake and she offered up on in which we allowed my son since they didn't have almond or coconut milk for me (I'm eating Vegan 90% and 10%Vegetarian). He enjoyed a cookie and cream shake that he drank down good and fast.

Being just a little bit exotic but not TOO exotic, Uniqlo has earned itself top hype levels amount Torontonians, who notoriously love to line up for stuff in the name of hype. Remember Muji? Uncle Tetsu. Cheesecake Factory. Anything that's a ""pop up"". Drake. The great thing about Uniqlo is that it's big enough that you don't have to line up to get into the store, just for everything else. 

The clothes are, well, basic. But that's what you're here for. Affordable, quality, every day wear. No branding. Usually very neutral. They're famous for their heat tech, which is quite impressive actually. Thin material that keeps your body warmer than other thin materials. Their underwear is comfortable and their outerwear is timeless. You can be 14 or 40 and wear the same things. 

Staff are also clearly trained from the original Japanese service manual. While Forever 21 and Zara give me back pains from sorting through literally mountains of mismatched clothing, Uniqlo workers are dispatched every time a shirt is slightly out of place. 

Fitting rooms are usually the nightmare corner of any store, especially a hyped up store, but Uniqlo has at least 5 people keeping things on track. They're sorting clothes, directing people, removing items, and moving at speeds that qualify as cardio exercises. On top of that, the ""host"" type person of the fitting room (the guy that greets you and hands out item numbers), is crazy polite on top of being great at what he's doing. We're in our 20s, he called my fiancé ""sir"". Oh my. 

Is Uniqlo worth the hype? Nothing is worth the amount of hype Torontonians give things, but Uniqlo isn't bad at all. I foresee it having a very successful run in the harsh Canadian retail market, which has already punished several other brands into bankruptcy (Sears, Express, Costa Blanca, Jacob, Mexx, Aeropostale...oh my god the list is endless, this is so sad). At least when you walk out of Nordstrom feeling financially inadequate, Uniqlo will always be there welcoming you with affordable arms.

I love how every Starbucks has a lounge and electric outlets ready for you to use. It's like they want you to stay there and hang out.",2015-08-08 05:39:10

One of us ordered a delicious ""sounding"" pancake dish of orange ricotta pancakes with pistachio and fig compote. Unfortunately what was served (for $11) were three thin pancakes with perhaps a single pistachio and a hint of fig. Server must have known since she offered to bring syrup. 
My order was chicken and waffles with eggs and breakfast potatoes ($14). This dish had possibilities but chicken and eggs (overcooked despite my request) were warm while potatoes and waffles lukewarm at best.  Suppose I could have sent this back but no one came by so it was easier to just deal with what I had. The chicken was decent but overly salty. The potatoes seemed like they could have been cooked a day prior and were lifeless and could have been from a freezer bag and reheated in oven. 
Mentioned all this to server who hardly listened but said she would inform the kitchen. 
Guess I should have paid more attention to the yelp rating of 3.  We had been to this restaurant twice before and recall a wonderful meal the first time several years ago. Sorry to say though there is no intention to ever return.",2017-03-05 18:24:44

The only thing that sets them apart is Uncle Willie's chicken special, and they hardly ever make it.  I understand it's a special, but I think they would get way more business if they made it a weekly thing.  I even heard many people asking for it last time I was there and were also disappointed it wasn't being served.  MAKE UNCLE WILLIE'S CHICKEN A REGULAR THING!

Edit: So after adding my 2 cents in on yelp, the people at 808 mixed plate actually listened!  they emailed me letting me know when their special uncle willy's chicken was going to be made.  We took the drive from Henderson (which was a lot better knowing they actually would have it) and had a delicious dinner.  It was so yummy, and I even heard more people order it while we were there (for a second, I thought I was the only one)  so thanks to the power of yelp, and the people at 808 hawaii mixed plate that take their reviews seriously!

I had the mechada and it was a nice toasty gluten free pocket with shredded beef and lettuce with a side of diced tomatoes. It was extremely filling. I'd recommend the yucca fries to share as they were part of one of our appie plates and they were yummy.

RaONTtOEIZB0gZT52wvDww,Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw,4,1,0,0,"Studio B Buffet has to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas! I went here on Saturday for lunch with my family that was visiting me from California. I paid about $180 for their seafood lunch for 4 people. If you are going with a group be ready to shell out quite a bit of money..but when is that ever new in Vegas? I was not upset with the price because I knew the buffet would be worth it.

Upon entering you will see a vast array of food spread out before you. A word of buffet  wisdom: scan around and then take a little bit of what looks appealing, and figure out your favorites. Believe me. You will want to keep eating everything there.  Everything that they have available from the crab legs to the fruit is fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite things that I tried was the prime rib. The prime rib is usually generously served and very juicy. Definitely something you want to try if you're a meat lover. Another great option that they have there is their kalbi ribs. The kalbi ribs are cooked perfectly and are very huge. I don't think I have ever seen kalbi ribs so big! 

If you aren't a fan of beef, they have various pasta choices that you can try that are very delicious. If they have mushroom ravioli available, I definitely recommend you try it. The cream sauce and ravioli filling will make you go ""Mmmmm"" from the first bite! Their crab legs are always being refilled because everyone loves them so much! They are all pretty big and have a good amount of crab meat in them. In addition, they have various fruits to choose from that look and taste juicy and sweet. 

Studio B Buffet is definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas that is actually worth the price. If you are looking for a great buffet away from the strip, this is your place! I promise, it won't disappoint you. 

**Be sure if you do plan on coming here during a weekend that you get there early. The buffet gets pretty packed and the line is usually really long, so plan your dinner or lunch accordingly**",2012-04-03 00:00:09

We did order the philly cheesesteak egg rolls which were cheesy and flaky. The only thing that we weren't too happy with is that our appetizer was served and not even 5 minutes later our entrees came, it was a little rushed.

My suggestion is if you want to drink a lot get up and go to the bar to order your drink because like i said you'll only see your waiter once every hour.

0ZmPS_AkYcwNGqedB6FTGw,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,4,10,4,7,"Toqued by Chef Mike Deas with input from Red Rock Assistant Executive Chef Joseph Kudrak, formerly from Glutton, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge is one of those places easily overlooked by Las Vegas visitors as well as locals, a recent dinner on an early Friday evening leaving one to wonder exactly why, and how to get the word out?

More tucked away than Hearthstone, Lucille's or The Buffet and Grand Café, a nearly 200 seat footprint overlooking the Red Rock pool with high ceilings, fireplaces and plenty of polish, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge both looks and feels like many On-Strip casino Steakhouses, but taking a few more risks with the menu than several the experience is presented as one also more affordable, the price-point not dissimilar to nearby Andiron, Fleming's or Morton's.

Retaining several of its well-mannered Captains from early on, the restaurant's professional-friendly service style reportedly a focus of the Fertitta family who own Station Casinos and visit often, dinner was served in a Prix-fixe fashion and with Chefs Kudrak as well as Deas present that evening the meal was nothing short of a feast for the senses, a $300 tab for sixteen appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts plus one heck of a cocktail and a bread basket that bests any seen recently on Las Vegas Boulevard.

Acknowledging a friend's two-hour time limit, tickets to the UNLV Opera requiring departure just before Seven o'clock, it was at a large semi-circular booth that the meal got started and with greetings from GM Christopher Jurchenkoit was not long before service was underway, the opening trio seeing lightly battered shrimp given a Chinatown treatment while steakhouse staples of French Onion Soup and Crabcakes were as good as any in the city, the former faintly sweet with plenty of bubbling cheese while the ""cake"" was almost pure crab with bright aromatics of paprika, onion and cayenne in the binder.

A bit off-put by the noise emanating from the bar, a combination of March Madness revelry, Friday Happy Hour and music piped in from the Gaming Floor, round two followed quickly and although fresh-cut potatoes could have been more crispy, ""Perfect Poutine"" was quite a bargain at just $10 when taking into account all the confit, cheese and skin, the Steakhouse Salad equally well constructed as chopped Romaine blended nicely with Avocado, Bacon and Gorgonzola beneath creamy French Dressing.

Not even 1/3 finished at this point, course three a six-piece exposition of two entrees and four sides, gone are the days of piddly portions at CUT or PRIME as Au Gratin Potatoes, Hashbrowns, Mushrooms and Creamed Corn are all built for sharing, as too is the two-piece Fried Chicken with Sage Gravy while the Beef selections range from American Wagyu to New York Prime from Niman Ranch, the latter in our case served Medium with a topping of fresh Lobster, Asparagus and Béarnaise.

Bathed by the setting sun with blinds offering only modest relief as a result of floor-to-ceiling windows that give the room part of its grand appeal, dessert was taken to the patio as music turned live in the Lounge and although admittedly already quite sated none of the five options proved less than worth the temptation, the Carrot Cake and Soufflé both straight forward classics alongside Cheesecake that trends far lighter than most followed by indulgent blueberry donuts and a frozen parfait plus Sticky Toffee Pudding  that falls just short of Gordon Ramsay's for best in The Valley.

**** Easily overlooked in a city where Steakhouses rule the day, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge is a great spot for those inhabiting Summerlin to grab a Cocktail or snacks at Happy Hour and an even better one for al fresco patio dining, the price point more favorable than spots on The Strip while the menu outpaces other places nearby in terms of both creativity and quality of sourcing.",2016-03-19 22:48:48

However tonight the ramen is a 2/5 stars (being generous) because the broth was superrrrr oily yet bland. I was hungry yet struggled to finish it because there was almost an inch of oil floating on top my ramen. 

For the record I always order the Shio Tonkasu ramen, the 2nd one the list with the blacken garlic oil. Also there was practically no blackened garlic oil in my ramen today, only this yellowy brown oil. Really disappointing since a nice bowl of ramen was perfect for the rainy cold night tonight, but it was bordering on very gross. My husband who isn't very picky with food agrees, he was struggling to finish his bowl too due to the extreme oiliness.

Overall, I was previously baffled by the lowish rating on yelp with this place but after tonight I understand.

Although the restaurant was busy, we did not have to wait for a table. Once seated, the waitress provided us with menus and water.

I ordered a weekend special (I don't quite remember what it's called) with eggplant in a tomato paste, 2 fried eggs, and rice. The others ordered what I believe is called the bandari and we all shared a chai tea. Don't be fooled by the pictures you see online, the portions were  big and filling!

Victoria helped me and she was excellent. She had an associate in the shoes dept to get another pair, but they didn't have the right size.

Victoria was pleasant, kind, and friendly.

The only downside during my visit last time was the manager. The manager, Chris, could have been a little more pleasant when Victoria asked her a question for me about ordering the shoes online and having them delivered to their store since they didn't have the same size in store.

They serve a series of signature cocktails, and the two I tried were very good.   The wines are all Ontario wines, which isn't great for someone like me who only drinks red, but they don't aspire to be a wine bar, and cocktails really seem to be their specialty.

There is no reason why you would want to do business with unethical people. I had an approved loan through my bank, and spent several days (on different occasions) with a sales rep looking for the used car that I wanted.

When it came in, they called me. After we went through all of the paperwork, and I was waiting for it to be ready, they started adding various ""fees"" into the contract. When I questioned these ""fees"" they stated that they were mandatory. I laughed, knowing that they were simply upcharging, and hoping I was an idiot. They then tried to pressure me into taking the car ""or I would lose the chance, and they would sell it to someone else."" Needless to say. I did not buy.

I know that car dealerships are largely made of all types of sales reps, some ethical, some not. I would say stay away from HONDA WEST, because if they permit these types of practices, and the management even restates the sales reps lies, as fact, then its a company problem as well as bad reps.

I'll give an additional star for the nice employee who took our order, and the fact that the rest of us got the correct items, but the wait and inconsistency of following service protocol (using the machine to call out numbers when the full order is ready) is ultimately going to chase away many customers (and stars).

To decrease overhead, the stores are bare-bones basic, crowded with stuff, and not attractive-looking.  You have to come here with the mindset that you are looking for hand-me-downs for cheap, and that the stuff you find may be cracked, worn thin, missing something- or might just be like new. 

I bought a winter shawl and a couple of blouses and am quite happy with my purchases.  I know people who have bought their Christmas decorations here.  They have anything you can think of, depending on when you go and which store you visit. Current and old books, vacuum cleaners, Christmas trees, televisions, CD boxes with no CDs in them... (seriously, open the box!).  

The employees range from very friendly to disinterested. The deals can be good or not-so-good; don't assume just because Savers priced something, they priced it fairly. Sometimes you can haggle for a better deal.

Maybe so since it appears the parent company has filed for bankruptcy reorganization.   I didn't even see a hostess on duty when I came in, and I didn't really see one as I walked back and forth from the dining room to the bar.   Why was I walking back and forth?   Well, I was there for a party.   I guess the people hosting the party thought they were getting the back room as they had done last year.   Nope.   So they were talking to whomever (I presume the manager), and we stayed where we were.    Oh, well.   No big thing to me.   What was disappointing is the fact our server was busy elsewhere; therefore, I had to go to the bar to get my drink since I wanted it on the happy hour pricing.   Then it was getting close to the witching hour;  still no sight of a server,  so I went looking for someone to see if he could have our server come to our table so we could order.  She came.   Since it was a minute or so around 7:00 (the witching hour of when HH is over), I asked if my order could be had at the HH price.   She said she'd see but didn't know for sure.   As it turned out, it was.   We had to keep flagging someone down to ask the server to come to the table so they could order.   My water glass sat empty for a long time till I finally got it filled after asking two or three times.   Then at the end, when I was paying with my gift cards that I had bought during the restaurant's promotion, she told me I couldn't use it for the tip.    I told her I had used it twice prior and had no problem.   She argued with me about that.   Then she came back with the, I assume, manager, and she told me the same.   WHAT???!!   Then the server wanted to know when did I ask for water and not receive it.   WHAT??!!    Is she calling me a liar???!!!   I have been to this restaurant numerous times in the past, and I do mean numerous.    I do love the shrimp bites they have on the appetizer menu and some of the other items.

WELL.. That is NOT allowed at Monta. They follow strict rules and would rather have you LEAVE than seat you at a table (that seats four people) and have your remaining party join you. 

SO in essence, if you're seated at a table with 2 extra seats you CANNOT have anyone come in and sit down and join you.

We both got a Cumberland detox drink - kale, cucumber and coconut water ($8). We were both sucked in by the name because we've never had any ""detox"" drinks before. We were also curious to try kale in our drinks. I expected the drink to be sweet and almost smoothie like. However, it was very liquid and salty, the opposite of everything I expected. It's like drinking soup with ice in it in a cup. It's possibly the worst drink I've ever had in my life.

My friend ordered an omelet - mushroom, asparagus and chevre with mixed greens ($17). I thought her omelet was done very well and they were generous with the cheese.

I ordered the Cumberland breakfast - scrambled eggs with chive, buttermilk pancake, lamb sausage, smoked bacon and potato chive croquettes ($19). The scrambled eggs was incredibly creamy and surprisingly, so was the potato chive croquettes. The smoked bacon was just like any other bacon you can at any restaurant. The lamb sausage was interesting because restaurants don't usually offer lamb sausage. The pancake was not the overly fluffy kind which both my friend and I prefer because we find the overly fluffy one just soaks in all the syrup and gets all mushy. This pancake had an odd sour taste to it though probably from the buttermilk.

Worst experience ever and my instincts told me to just leave before we ordered since it took over 10 min for our waitress to acknowledge us. We ordered drinks 2 sprites and a tea and my glass arrived with what looked like a baby roach in the glass. The food came forever later and my daughter had the half pot roast melt and a side of eggs. She ate very silent which is very unusual for her and she later admitted the sandwich was cold and the so were the eggs but she knew I was already mad and didn't want to add to it. My chicken florentine crepe had bacon pieces and blueberries missed in. When we went to pay there was no one at the register and the person that showed up finally to take our money yelled out for the cashier so that obviously was not his job.,2011-10-02 18:16:33

I was expecting a wait of around 30 minutes minimum given our prime brunch time arrival (just before 1pm) but since this particular Sunday was the running of the Pittsburgh Marathon and Bryant Street was part of the route, we only waited minutes for the hostess to clean off one of the outside tables.  It was a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we enjoyed the weather and rooting on the final runners as we dined.

When I went inside to ask the hostess about sitting outside, I saw the daily beer bottle special was Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout.  I ordered one as soon as we were seated and greeted by our friendly and personable waitress.  Deciding on food was a bit more difficult.  Everything sounded delicious and I had been looking over the menu online the day before but still couldn't make up my mind.  After our waitress approached us for the third time, I went with my gut and ordered the Open Faced BLT and a side of Bruges Frites.  My dining partner went with the prix fixe brunch option of Beef Brisket Potato Hash, Granola and yogurt, and Mimosa.  

The beautifully structured creation of maple-bourbon house cured bacon, sunnyside up eggs, tomato, and arugula on ciabatta drizzled with smoked paprika aioli makes you remember why brunch exists.  Those frites with roasted garlic dijon mayo didn't hurt, either.  If I wasn't such a lady, I may have also devoured my friend's main course.  That beef brisket potato hash is made with gouda and horseradish sauce topped with sunnyside up eggs.  It should be no surprise that when our waitress asked if we wanted dessert and we didn't really answer yes or no, we opted for a delicious chocolate cake (I think she mentioned something about Bailey's when she explained the dessert options) to end a perfect meal.

I could not have imagined a more perfect day.  The only reason I deducted one star is because I felt the brunch was a little pricey.  Our two meals (with drinks and dessert) came to $65.  I don't mind a splurge every once in awhile and on this particular day it felt worth it.",2015-05-15 06:59:47

Waiting in line to order i could see all the fresh ingredients i could choose with my chicken shawarma.  I placed my order for a chicken shawarma pita with salad which was prepared fresh in a bowl and upon suggestion of the friendly preparer I added some house spicy sauce, onions and tahini on the end of the wrap.  He was kind enough to give me a plentiful side of peppers and pickles to accompany my sandwich.  Pricing was very good for the portion and the chicken was extremely juicy and tender when biting into the sandwich.  Definitely a mixture of flavor with the chicken shawarma, salad, tahini and pita.

The place just oozes relaxation, best Chi we have experienced at any of the local Indian Reservations. Unlike most of the other Rez's in town, this tribe has the vibe!
You must experience this for yourself.

I rarely ever bring up service in my reviews but today I must highlight the downside to an otherwise excellent experience. Typical and I mean ""typical"" Sheraton resort service, high on the cleanliness and pathetic on the people management. All the employee's were kids, no doubt because adults will not work for the wages they pay and/or put up with their corporate BS. Walked out to the ""all lite up"" pool bar and were informed by 10 laughing an giggling child employee's they were already closed. All-Righty-Then. Strike 1.

Walked up to the pathetic 6 chair excuse of a lobby bar and with one look at the bartender's prowess knew cocktails where out of the question. OK we'll take a round of Four Peak's Kiltlifter Drafts. ""Oh, the drafts have not worked in a couple of days, its all foam, but I will try it for you one more time. Oh, still foam."" (Amazingly this Ground Hog Day conversation repeated itself with several other patrons as the night progressed.) Strike 2.

Ok then, forget the sunset drinks lets head straight into Ko'Sin. Sorry the child hostess says, reading from her cue card, at the moment we are ""fully committed"".  As we stare into an half empty Saturday night dining room. Strike 3.

Calming down my posse, I decide to reset the circuit breaker and we re-group for bottled beer and the waning sunset from the beautiful atrium. I however keep checking with the Hostess, 8:00 no not yet, 8:15 still no, 8:25 no,  finally getting a group consensus from the now 3 young robots behind the counter, that our reservation was not until 8:30. Finally exactly at 8:30 the Piper at the Gates of Dawn leads us into ... the now ... completely empty dining room. 

Corporate BS OFF ..... Review ON!

We start out with a kick ass round of top shelf Margarita's, amazing and I mean amazing. Roasted limes, fresh squeeze juice, agave, dark Patron, Grand Marnier mixed to perfection. Nice ... and strong!

Well buzzed on just one drink we move on to appetizers & salads. Lots of sharing, loads of flavor. All fresh and local ingredients ""as advertised"" ... and the main reason we drove all the way out to experience Ko'sin. Service was excellent and everything flowed like clockwork. 

While the main entree choices appeared limited on the menu,  when the entree's hit the table ""all at one time"" it truly looked like a banquet.  No kidding, it really had a ""wow factor"". Beautiful presentation, colors, aroma's, and spot on delivery. Color me impressed. 

All the entree's tasted awesome, everyone sharing, everyone on there second Margarita. Fresh mahi-mahi build your own Taco's, killer Indian Fry Bread, the beef filet & pork chop where from local farmers which had a very unique fresh and natural flavor that I've never experienced before. No doubt many of the ingredients trickle down from their ""hi-end"" sister restaurant Kai upstairs. Two Thumbs Up!

Rolling back into the atrium we were met with live music from an amazing solo guitarist. The sound quality and beauty of the atrium is truly impressive, just awesome acoustics. My hat's off to the Architect! To bad the pathetic little bar does not match the grandness of the atrium. While we all wanted to stay and play,  there was no way we were going loose our buzz waiting for that service. Off to the Casino........

Unfortunately the Ko'sin restaurant is located within the confines of a corporate influenced landscape. Lucky for them I don't bring service into my ratings. (I'm all about the food) I applaud Ko'sin for their ""fresh & local"" food theme, sadly missing at most of the valley restaurants. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food served, I for one will return, but with the lessons learned from this experience.

Order: Fries, Calamar= $18.11 TLP=$15.60 (including 20% tip each)
which is annoying that they expect you to tip before receiving food or service.
A bit over priced for one but I don't usually complain about price until after I eat. I don't mind paying for quality food. But these sandwiches definitely were not worth the price or shitty high school girl service

I first ordered the Calmar w fries based on suggestion from the girl at the counter ( blond, young girl, skinny) . I was still waiting for my sister to pick her sandwich via text  which is why I ordered my food first and her TLP on a separate bill. 
Anywho she made my sandwich first so I sat down to eat it while she made my fries and other sandwich.( bun was big, sandwich was messy, missing cheese or bbq sauce something is missing. but it was pretty tasty) There was no one else in the restaurant at this time. I'm sitting down enjoying my sandwich and I see the same girl whos making my sandwich fussing with something so I stretch my neck to see over the counter and shes changing the garbage.
Fine! but then she has the nerve to go right to the sandwich on the hot top with the same gloves she used on the garbage and my food previously. I was like no impossible, so I stood up to be sure and looked. Yup! she was adding the topping on the bun. I didst wanna be rude even though it was extremely disgusting and unsanitary.
So I say ""not to be rude but, you should probably wash your hands after touching the garbage""
she says ""oh ummmm"" and continues what shes doing
I was shocked like hi helloo did u hear me or.....
So another girl comes up to the front heavier set dark hair, I tell her I need a refund because ...before I could finish my sentence she says we can make you another one if you like
I said no I dot like can I have a refund plz, I know this must be annoying for you to do but you must understand how disgusting that is.
In the most annoyed voice ever she says ""no you don't feel comfortable eating it that's fine. After 20 mins of her trying to do a refund and calling who I assumed was her manager she still couldn't do a refund. 
Meanwhile my sister who just had a csection the night before is waiting on her first real meal, So I just said listen why don't you just give me back cash as you'll still balance at the end of the night
She agrees and I leave w my refund of the second sandwich.
shes lucky I didn't demand a full refund of everything as I didn't even touch the fries and had 2 bites of my calamar sandwich

Bonus: they offered lobsters for weekend dinner during the month of January.

Environment:
The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, way better than what I usually expect from a buffet restaurant. Even though there were a lot of people dining for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, the food serving space was large enough that it didn't feel too crowded at all for the most part, with the exception of the line for the lobster. They section off the area for different kinds of food, there are stations for seafood, sushi/sashimi, salads, soups, rice and noodle, hot food, steaks and cooked seafood, desserts, and fruits. 
For the January lobster special, they had a line for lobsters at the steaks and cooked seafood station. Let me tell you, the line was absolutely crazy!!! I got seated at around 7:20pm and I went straight to the lobster queue and there were around 10 people in front of me and it took around 15 minutes of wait. When I wanted to come back for seconds the line was literally 30 people long, it was insane. So yeah, they were serious about the ""while supplies last"", because every time when they have a new tray of lobsters only about 10 people can get it. 

Food:
So even though there were a lot food and it was virtually impossible to try everything once, a lot of food I found wasn't very good in terms of quality. As much as I appreciate the variety there I was also expecting good quality and tasty food, but unfortunately for the most part I didn't experience that at Spoonful. Most of the items I had were either average at best or just wasn't good at all because it either tasted bad or it didn't taste fresh. Take the sashimi for example, those can't even compare to the sashimi you get at AYCE sushi restaurants, because it was so icy and watery that the sogginess ruined the fish. 
Apparently the only difference between weekend/holiday dinner and regular weekday dinner are the oysters, scallops, and fresh donuts. But with $6 difference, it's absolutely not worth it. The oysters and scallops weren't very flavourful, and again they were soggy and had ice shards. As for the donuts...well trust me you wouldn't want to touch it because there are so many other better desserts available, such as the fresh Belgium and Egg Waffles, various cakes and ice creams. 

Service:
The servers were great. Even though they were really overwhelmed with the large crowd on Chinese New Year Eve, they were really thoughtful and they worked hard to satisfy the requests of of the customers. A+ on the effort. 
There is a social media check in offer where you can get 10% off if you mention eating at the buffet (see picture). They also offer special promo on birthday month (10% off for the table) and on the actual birthday (50% off for birthday person).",2017-01-29 01:24:24

I finally had the chance to try maha's after SO long and it was definitely worth the trip coming to the east end!

So eventually I became hangry. 

Once inside, we ordered the chef's platter which I highly recommend! I had the maha's mind blowing chicken and my bf had the cairo's classic. I also had the honey cardamom latte to warm myself up.

The maha's mind blowing chicken sandwich was really good but I wouldn't call it mind blowing haha. Just wish there was an even ratio of onions and chicken. It's also a great dish for instagram purposes ;).

Cairo's classic was delicious as well..those beans doe. You'll be farting up a storm lemme warn you!

It was pretty frickin cool! They have TV's set about the place with some screen shots of different locations around the world. This was a bit wierd as it went from Bahamas(sweet!) to weeds in Beatty, Nv (???). Didn't exactly make sense, but still kinda cool.

We are seated in our booth and a guy comes to get our drink order. I order a Sierra Mist and my friend a water. They very promptly bring us 2 waters.lol okay. The waitress chuckled when I told her this and brought out my soda. No harm, no foul. Waitress is very nice and very attentive, which is especially appreciated considering how slammed they are during this time.

I ordered the Masarati Omelette(12.95) and my friend ordered the Peppermill Omelette(also 12.95). Those things were freaking huge! lol They both came with an order of hash browns and toast. Damn, they were really tasty! Mine had ham and musrooms and tons of american and peperjack cheese in it with some Marinara sauce on the top. It was very different from any kind of omelette I had ever tried before and I must say it was scrumptious! 

This was such a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try different things on the menu and check out the Fireside Lounge one of these days!

Enter the ever kind, gentle, and loving husband to the rescue. (Note that I have cast aside any humble traits I may have).  After an appointment this morning, I took her to Just Nails, a first time for either of us.  I stopped at the door and asked if they took walk-ins.  There was no one there so of course they do.  And they do any time.  No appointment is necessary but it would be a good idea when the place is busy.

The shop is bright, clean, and well stocked as much as I could tell.  For the next 20 minutes, Andrea was pampered and she came away with well cut nails and hands massaged with some lotion.  It was very pleasant for her.

Since I have been a kid, Barnes and Nobles was the place to go for newest books, magazines, and calendars.

These days, I come out here so my kids can go into the book store and walk into their kids section. The store is much different than before where now they stack the aisles with toys, newest gadgets, and a Starbucks coffee for some quiet time.  The biggest sadness is that their ""calendar"" section has dramatically miniMized this year but I still LOVE this place.

We didn't realize that we had stayed here for so long but the atmosphere at Cowbell seems to be 'take your time, enjoy the food'. And enjoy the food we did. It was one of the most sumptuous dinners I've ever had. 

To kick things off, our group of 7 ordered four appetizer platters. The menu changes regularly so our platters included different charcuterie, cheeses, as well as fried smelts and pickled vegetables. 

For the main, I ordered a pasta dish which had long, thick noodles with bok choy, chestnuts and drizzled in truffle oil. It was good but I should have ordered the Cowbell burger. One of my friends was generous to give me a bite and I can say, hands down, that I've never tasted such a good burger before. I didn't realize that meat could taste that good because it had so much flavour. I also believe the burger is part of the regular menu, so do yourself a favour and get it. 

My only complaint of Cowbell is the overall service. Having said this, our waiter was fantastic and took great care of us but between him and the two other wait staff, communication seemed non-existent. For example, our waiter would check in on us and see if we wanted more wine or whatever else, and then 5 minutes later, another waiter would come to us and ask the same question.

Getting this much attention is nice and it's better than receiving none. But after a while it was obvious that the three of them didn't communicate to each other or even had a set plan as to how they serve their customers. 

Otherwise, the food is absolutely delicious. I recommend everyone should try to have dinner here at least once.",2011-02-16 16:05:17

The food/portions/quality were good, service was prompt, and NO BILLS being shoved in my face while I'm still stuffing my face!  And green tea bowl wasn't frozen over, as it seemed like it was scoped hours before serving and shoved back in the freezer. 

With most lunch + dinner orders, unless you just get a roll or something, you normally get a salad, miso soup, bachans, AND green tea ice cream at the end of your meal.  So that adds value to dining here.

The 3 sides that I got were edamame, sprouts, & spicy fish cakes.  Since I know the waitress, she added some fried beef gyoza and some roasted sweet potatoes in a syrup.  ;)

Waitresses were constantly walking around, seeing if your tea needed a refill!  So I hope this was not a one-off and quality just continues...

Very pleased with my order.

I know it sounded strange.. I need my espresso beverage fix before my class... I did not know Little Nicky's is located on the side street.. all I saw the banner saying Coffee Shop while walking along Queen Street, and that was my calling! 

Love the Retro Vibe of this place.. really laid back compare to other Indie coffee shops I been to..and you kind of have to chill and take it easy... 

While waiting for my cappuccino to be ready.. I could not take my eyes off those little mini donuts being made!! They kind of like Tiny Tims but they look a lot more delicious!! But you have to order at least half dozen.. and no way I can eat that have a cappuccino and do a headstand in a heated room within 30 minute. It took me all my will power to say ""that's all"" when the barista asked me if I want to have something else with my coffee... 

My willpower is weak.. really weak... I am now have my mind set to come back again to have those mini donuts SOON!! And of course, their cappuccino was awesome too! Lovely Latte Art!",2011-04-26 06:07:34

   The menu has a nice selection. Lots of reviews for the Mac & Cheese, which is not on the lunch menu.....however I asked about it and the server said he would check with the chef~ nice touch and they made us a Mac & Cheese. Very, very good! Not the best I have ever had but worth EVERY calorie!!!! We shared this and the Butternut Squash/bacon/pecan spinach salad. Also quite deeeelish~ and got better with each bite. The dessert was ok, which was disappointing as the reviews raved about the bread pudding. It was good but again not GREAT! 
  I will say the service was quite good, although the buss people which there 2 for our section, were constantly asking to clear the dishes while we were still eating. I guess this is better than not asking and once I mentioned that we would let them know we were finished they were perfect.

I wanted to expand my horizons and try some out.  I had only had Indian food one time.  My mom was a 2nd grade teacher and she had a student named Smith Sirisikorn.  He was of Indian decent and his parents took us out to dinner one night.  I remember not really liking anything and the only thing I really ate was the bread (naan).  Fast forward 20+ years and I decided to try some out today.  I got in my car and made a left on Bell Rd and wound up here.  There are multiple ones in the area, this is the one I landed at!

I walked in and was greeted by a gentleman.  I told him I wanted the buffet and he guided me towards a table.  There were a few other people in the joint, I was the only white guy...nothing wrong with that, just an observation ;-).  I got up and went over to the buffet area.  I grabbed a plate and started piling stuff on to it.  Here are some of the things I got.

Goat Curry-  Um...interesting?  Had lots of bones in it and not much meat.  I only sampled a little of this.

Paneer Tika Masala-  I thought I grabbed chicken, but when I bit in, it was definitely something different.  Turns out that Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese.  Who knew?  Reminded me of tofu kind of and was decent.

Chicken Curry-  This was in a brownish sauce with lots of pieces of chicken.  I did get one small bone in one of the pieces of chicken.  If I hadn't picked through each bite, that would have been a bitch to swallow and choke on.  Thank goodness I found it.

Chicken Tika Masala-  I went back and got some of this.  It was better than the Paneer stuff and was probably my 2nd favorite meat dish I had.  It was in a flavorful tomato type gravy.  Most of this food looks like a babys poo, but once you get past that fact of how it looks, it was actually not bad.  I had a lot of this stuff.

Tandoori Chicken-  This was my favorite thing I had....I should have just stocked up on this and gone to town.  Bright red chicken, cooked perfectly.  It was chicken thighs from what I could tell.  It was delicious!   

Butter Naan-  I loved this bread!  Reminded me of a thin crust pizza dough.  It was delicious!  I ate a bunch of it and used it to dip in the curry/masala sauces.

Rice- Plain white rice and also some Chicken Biryani which is like a fried rice sort of?  Both were just ok.  I kept expecting something like Chinese style rice but this was different.  Wasn't bad, just wasn't great either.  Really dry.

Um...that was about it.  The buffet was $9.99 and the choices were plentiful.  I don't know if I will be back though.  I just didn't really like all the spices/flavoring of most things.  It just wasn't for me.  If you like Indian food though, you will probably love this place and be in Indian food heaven.  If I ever do come back, I will stick to the naan and tandoori chicken.  Those were both fantastic!  I'm glad I tried it though.  I'm usually a simple man and know exactly what I like and am loyal to my preferences.

I've tried various other providers and they all simply pale in comparison.  Note that I am not putting Real Fruits into the equation, since I see it more as a smoothie provider (I don't get tapioca, haha).     In terms of pearl milk teas and wintermelon milk teas, Gong Cha's the winner, hands down!

The wintermelon milk tea is my HG. Ever since my friend introduced it to me, I couldn't get enough of it. I've tried wintermelon milk teas at other providers since then, but the smoothness and balance of tea to juice wasn't as perfect as what Gong Cha's version provides. In fact, I've converted several of my friends into frenzy fans of this drink as well. I encourage you to give it a go. 

If you're an original milk tea type of drinker, then I highly recommend the Royal Milk Tea with Pearls. This is on their list of top ten drinks. It has a deep tea flavour that harmonizes well with the rich dairy. Even though I don't usually like tapioca, the pearls here have a good girth to them and are very sweet. Whether or not you add in pearls, my rule of thumb is to stick to a 30 percent sweetness level for all their milk teas.",2017-10-13 23:08:17

Found this quite by accident. I did a Google search for something and this came up as an advertisement,  hubby's been wanting fried chicken, we're in Vegas and eating stuff I shouldn't so why not. It's located in the restaurant row of the Venetian and you should make sure to have a reservation because it gets crowded.

Our server was a very nice young man who took time to explain the menu. Food is served family style and the menu says everything serves 2-4 people. Our server said he always suggested that people order two entrees but believe me for normal appetites would be way too much food.  As it was we couldn't eat all we ordered. 

We started with biscuits, we thought they would come with the meal.  I'm sure they had a whole pound of butter in the four we were served and there was a jar of apple jelly and a jar of honey butter.  We managed to each eat one.  The. We shared an iceberg lettuce salad that came with tomatoes, avocado, fried pork belly cubes and an amazing dressing. Again we couldn't eat all of it.  Our main course was chicken and waffles.  OMG, to die for. The chicken was perfectly cooked and those waffles, well I could eat them every day. They had cheddar cheese inside and came with a bourbon maple syrup. I just ate mine plain. Who needed syrup. There was also some huge cubes of watermelon which was pickled and while it sounds strange tasted really good.  It was a half a chicken and of course couldn't finish that either.  Because I love grits I ordered a side of cheesy grits and alas, they were pretty mediocre. Only down side of the meal.  Wish we could have taken the leftovers home with us.

I've already written about the décor, and the service was good last night which earned this place an extra star.

The food here is horrible.  It lacks flavor, imagination and is never like the description on the menu.  Sweetie is a vegetarian and they only offer one option which was a breaded and fried chile stuffed with squeeze cheese no flavor, a blue tortilla covered with squeeze cheese, no flavor and looked like something a dog threw up, and some beans undoubtedly from a can, no flavor.  She rated it the 2nd worse meal she has ever eaten in her life.  I had the combo fajitas for one.  The menu said something about being marinated for 24 hours in some juice or something.  Not possible.  I know, trust me.  The chicken was dry and was completely void of flavor, the steak only had a taste because there was so much fat on the beef, and who doesn't like fat?  The tortillas were made in house because I saw them making them but they were dry, and dusty.

Chuy's is in this area because they have ""chain"" money behind them, otherwise they wouldn't last very long.

Sat there with empty glasses a couple of times and just luckily caught the bartenders eye to wave him down to our end of the bar.  He seemed more interested in working the service bar.

Unsure as to what to order, I went with a tuna salad sandwich on rye that left me perplexed as to why Panera's bread is so well-liked. This was spongy, Value Time-grade material one could buy a loaf of at Wal-Mart for less than the price of the entire sandwich. The tuna salad was mushy and only mildly flavorful, tasting like something dished out at a hospital cafeteria at lunchtime. 

Panera's saving grace (aside from free wi-fi and a self-serve soda fountain) is its chocolate chip cookies. Fall-apart toasty, I kept wondering where the chocolate ended and the cookie began during every bite. The chips had a deep cocoa flavor, and the cookie itself had a lightly crunchy exterior to offset the plush, gooey, humid interiors.

GxugI_5U81VXBtraUQkSKQ,QNiMz3khnM7iAgr44DOXQw,JQrh2cmndqRKwTpVveHPDg,1,6,0,1,"This place is just bad. Okay, not just bad, REALLY bad. I consider myself somewhat of a Connoisseur of chinese cuisine, and this place is maybe the worst i have come across in a long time in the gta. 

Here is why;

Its new looking, and well appointed with fancy chandeliers, but dont let that fool you. Look up CLOSE and you will see that the place is actually filthy. We got there just when the place opened, at 11:30 on a sunday morning, and the chairs we were seated in were clearly dirty, and we had to wipe them down with wet wipes. There was also some wierd looking plum on the floor under the chair. I casually inspected a few other tables and they clearly had the same problem. Im guessing its because saturday night is a busy night and they didnt have time to clean up. Not a good start. 


We had a group of 5, so ordered a few dishes. I will comment on a few. The Peking duck was good. Not great, but adequate. You would expect however that for $40 you would get a bit more than just the first usual course of the cut up outer part, but also some part of the rest of the duck made into another dish or at least the meat pieces by themselves on a separate plate; but no, there was no second duck dish forthcoming which was very disappointing. Many chinese restaurants cut up the rest of the duck and turn it into a supplementary dish or dice it up and let you eat it with lettuce pieces... Not this place though. Its clearly a money grab. They use the rest in other dishes for extra $ flow. I should also mention that they dont cut up the duck in front of you, which is the usual way i have seen it done. Are you actually getting a whole duck, which is what you pay for? Maybe, but i suspect probably not.... Just an observation. 

Next egregious error imho was the fried rice. You would think fried rice is a dish that you cant screw up, but they manage. We got the shrimp/pork fried rice. It was just aweful. Minimal if any shrimp or pork, and the rice was dry and hard, and lumpy; it looked like it was thrown together VERY quickly, with no attention to how it actually turned out. It was bland and tasteless. A disaster dish. Embarrassing for a chinese restaurant to put out. 

Final dish i will mention is a lamb dish. Lamb is a difficult meat to cook properly, so its not a surprise the amateurs in this kitchen would totally screw it up. Seasoning is important to any dish, but dumping  haf a pound of chilli peppers on top of a random meat is not seasoning. Its just wrong. It removes any other flavor that may (or may not) have been there. Just amateur. 

On top of all of that, the service is slow, and certainly not with a smile. Better bring cash or debit card too, as thats the only payment they will accept, just to make sure they gauge you for every last cent they can.

This time, I ordered something I've been wanting for awhile, a bowl of udon. We also got three rolls, an asparagus salad, some fried rice and a side of brocolli. The last time we were here, we sat down at the teppanyaki tables and ordered the brocolli for our 2 year old. We got pretty much a half pound of ""trees"" as she calls them and munched them down. Our order yesterday was only about a dozen pieces, which was a disappointment.

The udon was okay. I ordered the small, as the waitress said the large was very large. Props on the noodles...big and thick, chewy and firm. There was plenty of tofu inside and it was cooked in a way that gave it the texture and flavor of chicken. I got three large tempura prawns that were cooked perfectly. The broth was a little lackluster. And since I recently started having to watch my sodium, I had to leave the soy sauce alone. The soup was good but I probably wouldn't order it again.

The rolls were all good as usual. She got the California roll, the veggie roll and the Rock n Roll (shrimp, cream cheese, cucumber). Their sushi is priced pretty much the same as all the other sushi I've found in town. They have a couple sushi combos, and we've gotten these before, they're real deals. Individually picking the rolls can get pricy, though.

Finally, the salad. They have a green salad on the menu for $3.50. Its pretty small for that much money. Or you can get a few other salads for about $5.95. They double the size of the lettuce plus they put some asparagus or some other veggies on it. If you're gonna grab a salad, skip the $3.50 one and get the large size, its worth it.

The fried rice was pretty tasty. But for the two of us and the baby, it was overkill. Lots of egg and veggies in it. 

Their teppanyaki lunches are priced great. You get plenty of food for $9-15 bucks. All in all, their prices are just a little higher than average for teppanyaki/sushi. Not as high as Nakama, plus the quality is better. Their lunch teppanyaki deals are real steals, though.

So one thing to keep in mind is this is a Johnny Rockets with the concept of a fast food restaurant; you order your food, they give you a transponder, and then you pick up your food when it buzzes. You grab your own utensils nd you clear your own table. 

Honestly, I almost didn't feel like I was in a Johnny Rockets because there were flat screens all over the place and no juke box either. It didn't have that 50s spunk that the others have and it just lacked that nostalgia.

It's Vegas,  I get it. I mean it's pretty awesome that this place is open late but I sure missed that old Johnny Rocket's feel. But anyway, I digress.

For me, the heart warming thing Bout this place are the smoothies and floats. The burgers and fries ate great too but the sweet stuff is usually so delicious! Not at this location.

My root beer float was just awful. The ice cream wasn't smooth, but rather very much frozen and crunchy. I was also jipped. My float was missing alot if you ask me.

If I were just rating on the food they would deserve all 5 stars. I mean hands down this food is absolutely amazing. I ordered a beef patty, and the curry and jerk chicken plate with rice and beans and salad.

But here's where they lost the stars...they are slooooooooow and service could use some work. My goodness. 

First we ordered drinks, then played the waiting game for the drinks and then straws...finally I gave up and went to the bar for straws and the crappy attitude that the lady gave me was ridiculous. If service ain't your thing...that's fine. Just don't...you know....work in service. 

But let's get back to the meal, next we ordered apps a few beef patties and plantains. And then we waited and waited again. When they finally arrived I devoured it before I could take a pic. I was starving. 

Then we finally ordered food everyone for something different and we mixed up the sides so we could try everything. 

Cue the waiting music.......

ONE HOUR later our food arrived. This was after our server stopped by the table many times to say our order was ""the next out the kitchen"". Ugh.

When it arrived we had the wrong sides. I ordered salad and ended up with cole slaw but I was too hungry to send it back. I don't recommend the slaw but all the rest of the sides I sampled were pretty tasty.

It was on the way home so I stopped.  The line was pretty deep and took about 15 minutes before I placed my order.  I ordered 2 pollo tacos, 3 carne asada tacos, one mini carne asada quesadilla and one mini pollo quesadilla.  Total for all that food was only $9.00!   Its $1.00 per taco and $2.00 per quesadilla. Here is how they were................

Pollo Taco-  This was my favorite of the bunch.  They have great tortillas and they top them with grilled chicken, guacamole, cabbage and hot sauce.  The cabbage threw me for a loop at first but it actually worked with these kind of tacos.  These tacos are super duper small....2 biters.  For a buck, they are fine.

Carne Asada Taco-  Same prep as the pollo.  The carne asada was flavored decent.  My tacos did have some gristle and fat in them.  They were fair.....compared to some spots in SD, nowhere close, but for Phoenix, they were decent.

Quesadillas-  These were topped the same way as the tacos but cheese and another tortilla was added.  Next time, I might just get cheese/meat.  The cabbage made these quesadillas worse.  Weird texture issues lol.  

Service was friendly enough.  Price was good but I was not blown away.  TONS of people were coming and going though so its pretty popular and may be the best Phoenix has to offer.  If so, Ill accept it but Ill continue to dream of SD taco shops!

I absolutely love this place. We've lived less than a block away for over a year and finally just ventured over and we're SO happy we did! I like the inside of the restaurant as it's decor is very nice but not stuffy, it feels homey while looking like quite a 'fancy' restaurant - which is hard to accomplish, but they did it.

To start, our servers have always been 100% spot on; Great personalities and great service. Along with our main server, there is plenty of staff to keep our waters and delicious bread filled. We have also never waited long for our meals, no matter how packed it been or what time of night. Managers come by and sometimes there is a band playing. Plenty of people to keep you happy while at Luciano's. 

Now for food...holy delicious. Our first time we tried a pasta and one of their chicken specials for entrees and both were a great amount of food, not too much but very filling and both just tasted so good(note: I have been looking everywhere for a chicken marsala as good as my dads and Luciano's is as close as it gets). Tom was really impressed with how many meatballs and mozzarella were in his pasta (apparently other places really skimp). 
Another time we went for just appetizers and I'm gonna lay this out because we were amazed. We got the carpaccio and I swear, enough for 6 people and perfectly done. There was plenty to go around for just us two and the aioli and arugula salad on top was great. We also got the calamari which were cooked perfectly and also had the great aioli sauce to compliment it. However, for me, the Holy Grail was their Scallops and Artichoke antipasti (bow your heads for a moment). It was perfect. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The long stem artichokes were tender and so so tasty and perfect. The pancetta, perfect. And...the lemon sauce, perfect. I had to ask for an entire other bread basket just so I get every little bit of that lemon sauce. Amazingly perfect. 

Okay, enough about my obsession with the food and scallops. We love this place.

#1 The chips and salsa. The free chip basket seemed never ending and there were three different kinds of homemade  tortilla chips in each basket. The salsa had a nice chipotle kick and I filled up more than I intended to with the chips and salsa!

It's nothing like a lot of other breakfast spots in Scottsdale, and that's good and bad.
It's very much a diner at heart.  A handful of tables inside, a few tables outside, and some seats at a counter.  

The food is fine.  It's nothing you'll rave about, but it's fine.  My Burrito was good (though a bit lacking in Ham), and I was a bit surprised the side of Bacon only came with 2 pieces (though they were very tasty).  My wife got an omelette and said it was good, but something she could probably make at home.  

The service was good, but you could definitely feel how small the restaurant is since you could overhear every conversation the staff was having with one another.  

It's around $7 or $8 per entree, so overall I'd say if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive, simple breakfast, this is a good choice.

Our orders typically include one, some or all of the following:

-Lamb vindaloo 10/10

-Chicken Curry (spicy) 9/10

-Palak Paneer 8/10. This may be their weakest dish of what we order but it is still great.  Ask for extra ginger, it makes a pleasant difference 

-Meat kabobs - these are better eaten at the 
restaurant rather than take out. More on take out vs eat in later

-Butter naan 10/10 - stands up well to take out 

-Chicken Tikka Masala 8.5/10

I am not a big fan of their pickle, so if you are a pickle fan, you may want to avoid it here. 

This is not a restaurant you want to go to if you are seeking romance or fantastic service.  As others have mentioned, the tables are very tight and the restaurant is usually very busy.   This results in service which is good enough but just barely.    Keep in mind though, the service isn't bad because the servers are sitting around gossiping, trust me, they are running their butts off.  This is just a very busy, non fine dining, restaurant.   Due to this, we typically do take out or delivery.   I am pretty sure the portions are bigger with take out anyway. 

One last thing, if you like very spicy food like we do, you need to stress to them that you want SPICY as they lean towards white person spicy unless instructed otherwise",2016-03-10 22:34:00

The ordering system does take a little getting used to.  

The kids were a little concerned that there was no hot sauce and even suggested taking out to ensure they had some...the concern was a non-issue since there were some sauces by the soda fountain.

The kids loved the Cuban black beans.  I couldn't get past the look and texture.  Not sure why, it's not a texture any different than a refried bean, guess I just don't like to see it so dark.

Kids had the popular Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas quesadillas.  The hubbie and I stuck w/ bowls.  He had the Chinese BBQ Pork and I had the Chicken Diablo.  Both the hubbie and son didn't think the Diablo was too spicy, but I found that it is a cumulative hot that builds as you eat more; my mouth was on fire by the time I finished my meal.

We also got big snickerdoodle cookies with our meals.

Consensus was the food was good and we will probably return.",2008-06-02 19:16:07

Definitely make a reservation if you plan on coming on a Friday or Saturday night, as you may be waiting a while. Luckily, I preemptively took my own advice and came with reservations.

We ordered the duck confit and the chicken and mushroom crepe. While waiting, we were served a freshly baked loaf of bread, which was fantastically gooey on the inside. Good bread is hard to come by, an this one impressed me (5 stars!).

While waiting for the food, we had the chance to check out the ambiance. Two things stuck out in my mind: noise and clientele.  Most notable was the noisy buzz of music and talking. Whereas many movies may romanticize French restaurants as quiet establishments with perhaps a soft piano, Cafe Monte was buzzing with life jazzy music and rather loud conversations and unruly drunken laughter from a neighboring table. This made talking with my companion difficult to the point of leaving with a raspy throat. I would have preferred a more relaxing and quiet environment.

Secondly, we both noticed the rather stuffy clientele. Many (boarding of most) men were dressed in 3 piece business suits and ladies in fancy evening gowns. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with having a fancy night out, but there was an air of pretension that seemed out of place. Cafe Monte is a nice restaurant, but it ain't the Ritz. It made for some fun people watching, particularly when we added our own voice over, but overall contributed to making us feel under-dressed (despite wearing a nice button-down shirt and slacks). 

The food came out in generous portions, laded in butter and cream. The chicken and mushroom crepes were pretty good (4 stars), but the guilt of all that creamy sauce comes fast. I defy you to finish all of it. The duck confit was a little above (3.5 stars), but broccoli over-salted (coming from a lover of salt).

We both left with a feeling of 'meh': by no means bad, but not exactly memorable. We also agreed that a much needed run was needed the following day and that we didn't feel the need to return. I will say that I may have since had some impure thoughts regarding that bread of theirs.",2012-01-06 18:13:05

Salmon; it still had some of the skin not cut off. I hate that haha. It was fresh but not buttery. 
So then, we ordered salmon belly in hope it would be better and it was. It was sooo buttery and melted in my mouth. 

Garlic tuna; pretty good. Wish it was more garlicky.

Ama ebi; great like always! 

Scallops; they were okay. Scallops are my favorite so I can tell the difference. Slightly fishy.

Yellowtail; I've had better. But still good.

Unagi; mmmm yummy! A lot of rice in that nigiri though. 
Screem inor gazim; seated tuna in spicy creamy sauce. so good! A must get.

Especially since we're in Madison, where it seems to be impossible to get a freshly baked Chinese bun anywhere (someone tell me of a spot if you know it!). So, even just the fact that they serve good buns makes it a destination in this fair city.

Although I like most of Umami's offerings, one thing that bums me out about Umami is how disappointing I find their Ramen to be. This could very well be that I just don't like Ramen, but I find it difficult and time consuming to eat, to the point where it's cold by the end. It's also surprisingly lacking in flavor. I realize you can order spice/garlic bombs to spruce it up, but I don't like the idea of having to pay for flavor for my dish. The broth makes up for the lack of noodle/tofu taste a bit though.

The Ramen is the only dish there that I feel is appropriate for getting as an entree, as the buns/dumplings are more small plates. So, it deters me from coming here frequently. But, despite that, you can definitely have a good meal at Umami on occasion. I'd give a 2 for the Ramen, but a 5 for everything else. So, let's say a 4!",2014-12-19 03:27:25
qLWh4oOn1mUxW_MhLfC2Qw,DRlIsW15Zn2qwYdOuhHlsg,REfekXeUbPWGkgvlzSNbpw,5,3,1,0,"Years ago before I ever considered myself a foodie and was just and avid home cook, this was my favorite local restaurant to eat at. To this day it's still my favorite chain restaurant. Yea, they usually have a long wait for a table on the weekends but I  didn't mind waiting because I enjoy their alcohol selection and bar service. 

I have ordered the shrimp bruschetta tons of time, with large shrimp, nice garlic sauce and crusty bread, I strongly recommend this app. Also, their mussels are really good too, if your into that sort of thing.

I quickly learned it's not necessarily about the pasta here, more so about the grilled meats. This place has given me some excellent fillet's in my day. I had the filet marsala one day (was a special for that day) then proceeded to order it ever since. I get it with a side of fettuccine alfredo instead of mashed potatoes.  Even though it's not on the menu daily, they will serve it, if you ask. 

I do enjoy their chicken soup, it is exceptional and it comes with your entree. If their out (which happens a lot if your a late diner like me) I go with the caesar, which is a great substitution. 

I always take home desert because I'm too stuffed to eat it there. Dessert Rosa is my favorite, by far. Delicious butter cake topped with pastry cream, bananas, strawberries, pineapple and whipped cream. So good, but the last time I was there it wasn't available in full size, only a shot glass. Either way, as long as they have it, I'm fine with that. 

I need to go back here soon, after writing this review I want it so bad.",2012-12-06 20:57:16

The first time I came here I ordered a regular latte sat down at the nice big comfy leather chair and really took my environment in. My initial thoughts were that Toronto Coffee Company was great and I was excited to have a new coffee hangout so close to home. 

The second time I came here I had a complete change of heart. At the risk of execution, I am going to disagree with my fellow yelpers by saying the coconut latte was a total disappointment. I like relatively medium to strong coffee and lattes and I found this one to be way too sweet and milky (although I am aware it's not actual milk). 

The WiFi situation was no better than my latte. Me and the stranger next to me struggled to reconnect a dozen times each as we were constantly kicked off the network. When I told the barrista, he reset the modem but still nothing. Apparently their WiFi is always touch and go he said. 

I sadly can't work here if the internet is going to be unreliable. I'd probably come here if a regular latte sans laptop but alas this is not going to be my regular work spot unless they fix their internet.",2012-03-06 20:14:05
Ag--hd1HNSUF1ckXrjDCEQ,Rzf35jKV8e8EJdssrae_AA,85Dv-yddtLUhX-Dl6jqy9A,4,6,3,3,"Well I knew I was in trouble when I was greeted by a bakery case to my right and a plate of bread and olive oil for sampling in front of me.  I had never been to The Kitchen, nor its predecessor Dish, so I was a little confused at first.  But when good food is involved, I will find a way to figure it out.

The Kitchen is a cafe and gourmet food market rolled into one.  It's broken up into ""stations"" that include a center deli, pizza, salads and cold sandwiches, hot dishes, and more.  You place your order at the station and are given a card to be scanned when you check out.  Want to order from more than one station?  Take your card to the next, and they'll add to it.  Check out when you're ready.  Don't forget to grab a basket because you just may want to pick up a few must haves for later.  There's also a small area for eating in and a wine bar.  I did not go back to that area, however.

As for the food, I had the grilled portobello on ciabatta.  It was bursting with grilled red onion, roasted tomato, and goat cheese.  My only complaint was that it was also bursting with far too much olive oil, from the pesto I assume.  The plate was covered in it, my to-go box for my leftover half was covered in it, my plate the next day was covered in it.  I would definitely order it without or on the side next time.  For my side dish/dessert I had the sweet potato fries.  Big thick fries nice and crispy on the outside and served with both an herb aioli and cumin ketchup.  For my second dessert, I had a key lime mousse that was delicious as well.  

Cold sandwiches, paninis, and salads are $6.99;  hot sandwiches are $8.99.  Not bad given the quality of the ingredients here.  I only wish The Kitchen were closer to my kitchen!",2009-06-10 19:54:49

I had to give it three stars because 1.  We were broken-hearted we could not have pizza and/or lunch menu items and 2.  My goat cheese and fig waffle was a little on the dry side.

The regular croissant wasn't flaky and was more on the dried-out end, even with some zappage from the microwave.  The cheese croissant was slightly better, but was more on the bland side.  I did enjoy the raisin croissant, as it was filled with plump raisins and the croissant had more of a sweeter note to it.

It will definitely take some time for everything to gel. The menu needs work, as does the drink selection. Last night I came with a large group of 8-10 people and they all seemed to love the quality of the food, especially the pizzas. I heard complaints about the size of the martinis, especially in light of the prices. I agree with Yelper Sarah about what seems like a sterile feel to the place at times, but maybe they're experimenting with the lighting because last night it felt cozier, and darker. I like the music. 

The main problem is that it's so large and cavernous that it won't appeal to people unless it's jam-packed, like AZ88. If you go there now, it's dead. My sense is that owner Karl Kopp has a long-term vision for the place so he's not worrying about cramming in hordes of people through cheapo deals or gimmicks for now. Light rail starts in a couple of weeks and Cityscape will be done in about a year, which will continue to change the downtown scene significantly (Cityscape in particular), so if he's trying to simply establish a foothold here while the rest of the area builds up around him, it could turn out to be a smart move. He does seem to know what he's doing, judging from his places in Scottsdale and Manhattan.

And by the way, I totally deny the slanderous allegations in MrK's review. When I ditched him at the bar and came home, I honestly didn't expect to have the First to Review slot sitting there waiting for me to write it. I'll admit to ditching his ass. Just not for the reason he claims. :)

We ordered 4 items which came one at a time. The last dish did not arrive until we were almost done eating and after we inquired about it. 

Dayali's concept of good food is just to drown everything in oil. We ordered the Sliced Boiled Fish but what came was a tub of oil. It's true that the flavor wasn't bad, but I couldn't eat more than two pieces of the fish due to the amount of grease coating each piece. This was labelled with 3 chili but wasn't spicy at all.

They offer new and exciting Asian inspired flavours such as Durian, Hong Kong Milk tea and Tsing Tao Peach, which is a nice change from the usual.

We were lucky enough to find an open pool table in the back, so we grabbed it and watched the band and people on the dance floor.  After shooting a few games of pool, we ordered some Nachos and a Quesadilla.  The food was OK, nothing great.  Service was kind of slow....our Beers were empty a lot.

We stopped in after dinner and must have hit some odd after dinner crowd. I am not reviewing the place based on everyone with their screaming kids just wailing loudly. But, be aware, children love frozen yogurt and will scream and cry until they are eating it...  apparently. Mine is 11 and still does the same thing. The staff were good about keeping the toppings area clean. The young lady was there sweeping things away to minimize cross contaminating the dishes and it was nice to know she was paying attention. I always go with a fruity flavor with fruity toppings just because I am a little fruity... They had these balls of flavor that burst in your mouth. Maybe these things are a commonality amongst the froyo industry? Maybe I don't get froyo enough? I am going to butcher what they are called but I swear I want to call them bao balls or something...

The good thing about this place is there are a few cool department stores, more dining options in the area, and a new luxury theater. Currently, not every tenant is open and ready, though it's growing every week with openings. 

I went prematurely when only Macy's and Dillards were really the only things open, and we just kinda drove around to see what's building. Then I went a week after the ""grand opening"" with a few friends before dinner and we walked around and I got a better feel of the place. One of the things I don't like is the layout in places just is disjointed. 

So on the west end (by Sahara) is this large shopping area with the shops on the perimeter of the square and right in the middle is a parking lot, then you can walk to the other stuff by walking on the side of Dillards to get down to the other shopping streets. If you are driving to a specific thing, I suppose that's fine, if you're walking then maybe plan on having a long walk if you have stuff to see on one end to the other. 

One odd thing was when we went, we were struggling to find a coffee house.We were thinking that it seemed like a natural fit to have a few beverage stops, but none were found or no signs we noticed of any coming soon when we walked the main drag of Dillards and Macys area. 

It has potential for a few things to stop at, but this place is gonna suck like all our outdoor malls come summer as the nice lovely lanes means - no shade. When are we gonna learn to make something desert summer friendly?

The options, it appeared, were either a Japanese restaurant which the counter attendant at Bruno's said was not too bad, or Maxim. Well, we searched trusty Yelp and Maxim's was described as a Cafe serving French food. That was exactly what I was craving for and so we went in.

The lady asked me, in Cantonese, how many people and I was taken aback for a quick moment. I then realized this could be the same Maxims near my home...great for cakes, but so-so on everything else.

Service is awful here, in that it is very slow. They also do forget things. We came here Saturday around 3-ish so it wasn't prime time exactly. The food on the other hand was okay. I had the chicken which was covered in a great gravy, served with crunchy green beans (just the way I like them). My bf had the fish and chips which tasted like the best microwave oven fish ever! Crispy and crunchy on the outside, and fluffy white fish meat on the inside. The fries were yummy too!

Of course, we had the cakes for dessert and my fave is the Strawberry Meringue and Strawberry Shortcake:)

Overall though, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're hungry or if you're in a rush. The good thing is if you just want to be left alone and not have server's coming to see if your cup is empty or if you want more food, then this is your place.

They do serve alcohol (white and red wine) although there is no menu for it. Also, my bf originally wanted the kids menu fish and chips portion as he wasn't hungry, but they wouldn't accommodate which meant we got the regular serving (2 HUGE pieces of fried fish).",2013-02-24 21:21:56

Staff: They are extremely nice and accommodating to my needs. They tailor each treatment to you and the experience is relaxing from start to finish! It also seems like each time the staff improves upon the previous visit which is amazing.

Ambience: Rooms are tranquil but a tad on the smaller side (though I don't care because my eyes are closed and/or I'm facing down). I think they recently got newer tables (or maybe I'm going crazy) and they are comfortable. They play music from piano pieces to ocean sounds, but I like their older playlist more.

I highly recommend their massages. They can provide a receipt for insurance claims as well. In addition if you pay for 5 or 10 treatments you can earn credits towards their yoga lessons! I've met a few of the instructors in passing and they seemed friendly as well. They had redone the place a year ago so the facility is very modern and comfortable.

After moving from California and trying 6 different sushi restaurants in the area we thought we were doomed to mexican food and pizza forever. I literally said this was the last place i would try sushi and if it wasn't good then I would throw in the sushi towel.

OMG! DELICIOUS! AUTHENTIC! ATTENTION TO DETAIL! FRESH!!

The owner/sushi chef was so entertaining and really takes care of his customers. Everyone in the restaurant was brought a complimentary lightly seared tuna tataki with ponzu and thanked by him personally for coming in. I was hesitant to eat sushi with black rice but I am officially converted. While white rice has that chewiness and bounce back to it, the black ""purple"" rice was tender with the just the right amount of resistance to complement the melt in your mouth buttery fish. It felt way less heavy than white rice and the fact that its healthier makes me feel a little better about stuffing my face with sushi.

GET THE FRESH WASABI! So worth the $2. I am officially spoiled. There is no going back to that powdered crap now. Its got such a fresh bite to it and it doesn't overpower the sushi like normal powdered wasabi does. We also got the Sex and the City roll, spicy tuna roll, and eel nigiri. They accidentally brought us the crunchy crab roll too and let us keep it no extra charge of course. Everything was amazing.
We also got the spicy shrimp tempura ramen too (our eyes were bigger than our stomaches, and yes we got togo bags, were not sumo wrestlers!)
I only wish they would set the shrimp tempure off to the side and not have it sitting in the ramen because it got soggy quick. I would probably just stick with sushi next time.

This place is the BOMB!!!!!!!!   

The #1 Best Taiwanese food in town!!!!  There is no comparison between other places that offer Taiwanese food

I found out about this place because my favourite Taiwanese-style spicy beef noodles was closed @ Silver Star :( and someone on RFD recommended to check out this place.  However, upon going there for the first time,  I completely forgot about the beef Noodles and ordered the popcorn chicken bento box instead and got mesmerized by their other food items.

It was only my third visit that I finally tried the beef noodles haha  :)

I loved it so much.. I am willing to drive the extra 20 minutes even though I know so many people complained about how far it is and how small the place it.. 

How much do I love this place?? well I once waited 35+ for a table for two and once we placed the order, we waited another 45 minutes for the food..  I WAS SO STARVING AT THAT TIME... This is how much I loved that place

Since then, they increased their staff and the food turnaround time comes out fast. like in a few minutes!! and therefore the wait for a table is faster too.. 

When it first opened, the menu had many items but now since the renovations, the restaurant decided to cut down and focus on the most common items.. I really do miss the variety and the older dishes that is not offered anymore   

Did the place get bigger after the renovations? no.. The renovations was needed to move the washroom up front of the restaurant as people had to pass through the kitchen to go to the washroom. but the place and size did not get bigger unfortunately which is sad.. because I think the restaurant would benefit from a bigger seating to accommodate their large clientele

Spoke with the old guy about that and he said that if they were to increase the seating, they might have to increase the prizes of their food items.  Half of the business seem to be a lot of takeout.   

Since the restaurant is so tiny, it doesn't take reservations and it is first come first served though you can leave your name and phone number and the restaurant will call u when the table is ready.   

There was apparently an incident recently by one of a customer who complained that some people were sitting at some tables already but it wasn't fully occupied since those people were still waiting for others to come to join them but they arrived first.. That so called customer apparently made a big scene and quarrel and complained to papa chang and the big staff about how this restaurant was not doing so called business since there were people sitting there but not ordering but there were customers at the door that wanted to eat but there were no spaces for them

Since that stupid quarrel, the restaurant now has a policy where it would only sit people at the table if only the full party is here.. I really don't know who was the customer that yelled and made a big deal about that but was it really that necessary??  the turnaround time is so fast now at PAPA chang.and the wait time  for a seat is not long or not as long..  also, if  you want to make sure to get a seat, it is recommended to go early or go during non busy times..

Thanks Yelp!). We were strolling around the square feeling a little uninspired over the usual places. Hamilton's caught my attention out of the corner of my eye-the exposed stone and cool lanterns over the bar made me think ""this is a place I want to sit inside of."" We walked over and saw a few open tables and assumed there would be a wait-those open tables must be for reservations, we figured. Nope, we were seated right away and were able to score a table at the window. The one seat had a gorgeous view of the Capitol. 

I was surprised to see the poor reviews regarding service. Both the host and our server were extremely friendly and prompt. Our server was one of the best and most friendly I've had in awhile. We ordered drinks rather quickly-very nice list of cocktails with a few unusual selections-and our server came back a few minutes later to let us know there would be a small wait because a bunch of people had just sat down at the bar. No problem and thanks for letting us know!

The drinks were great. I had the rum sour which was delightfully refreshing. One of those drinks that tastes like vacation in a glass. The bf had the Manhattan which was quite strong but enjoyable. For dinner I had the ricotta gnudi. And wow, just wow. The gnudi were outstanding and the broth was perfect-not an overwhelming squash flavor at all. The broth was so delicious I would have licked the bowl clean if this was socially acceptable. Alas, it is not. Luckily this dish is served with a spoon so I was able to scrape up as much as possible. 

I'm new to Madison but those who aren't would know Hamilton's is in the previous space which was the Blue Marlin. In a nod to the past occupant, the special Saturday night was a shrimp diablo. My dining companion had that and wow, it was also excellent. Five decent sized shrimp along with some crazy delicious sausage crumbles in a cream Sriracha sauce with penne. Yum yum yum. It was exceptional. We were both pleasantly surprised at how amazing our food was. We will be back for sure.

The space is really more of a 4 star space and the food really outshines the ambiance. I loved the exposed stone walls and lanterns (it reminded me a little of Chicago's Violet Hour) but the other wall is a little odd and the music doesn't seem to quite go with the feel of the place. It wasn't loud at all as other reviewers have written.",2015-12-06 22:07:31

When I think of an all night casino cafe, I think of a dim, smoky joint serving nothing but greasy burgers and day old spaghetti.  Not so much at Farm.  It's well lit, super clean, nicely appointed and their late night menu is extensive enough that you can get anything from breakfast to a full on steak dinner.

We were seated quickly and our server (who's name I unfortunately don't recall) took our drink order and was very helpful with the menu.  We asked him for some suggestions and he was awesomely forthright and steered us clear from the chicken fingers.  He said they were ""frozen and nothing special.""  I appreciate when a server is honest even when I'm certain they're encouraged to gush over every item on the menu.

We both got breakfast and it was good.  (Tho it's pretty difficult to eff up breakfast).  Eggs were cooked exactly how I like them and the sausage was good.  I'm funny about my sausage (stop it!) but this had a good flavor, wasn't too greasy and was cooked thoroughly.  Their big draw is that the cook with locally grown and raised food.  I'm slightly perplexed at what's locally grown and raised here in Sin City but I like what they're trying to do.  

The service was excellent, the food was good and the prices were reasonable.  Hey - it's an all night casino cafe. They are what they are but Farm is a little bit more - more upscale, more clean, more options, more friendly.  I wouldn't make a special trip to Aliante just to eat here but if I'm ever in the casino again when a hunger pang hits, I'll give it another whirl!",2017-06-08 17:55:36
