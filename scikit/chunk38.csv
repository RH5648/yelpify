- pharaoh po boy was good. definitely hit it with some lime juice to brighten up the flavour.
- get the dookah (spelling?). it's a nice sesame based grounded spice rub that you take their bread and dip in conjunction with olive oil. very tasty.
- place seats about 25 inside, so if there is a line, be prepared to wait.",2015-08-10 23:40:49

I got an awesome deal on some tickets to KA by playing MyVegas slots on Facebook.  True Story.  For myself and two friends we shared the cost of one standard ticket and paid roughly $27 each.  I got a buy 1, get 1 free voucher, and a voucher for a free ticket.  My friend told me this show was good, so for under $30 each... it was worth checking out as you really can't go that wrong with a show by Cirque Du Soleil.  

Our seats were in the first row of section 103 - we didn't know this was the FIRST row in the theater to the side, but it was a great view.  I'm sure one would get a different perspective further away but being up close to all the action was great too.

All three of us really enjoyed this show - my friends had nothing to compare it to.  My all time favorite is LeReve at Wynn, but this was great to see as well.",2015-06-26 21:35:17

The Italian food here tastes authentic and delicious.  They have a large wine list.  I feel the only difference between Tommy V's and Tomaso's really is the decor.  Tomaso's has that old school Italian restaurant vibe.  Tommy V's has a modern contemporary interior with a few pictures of girls on the walls where all you can focus on are their boobs.  It was kinda funny that all three of us at dinner noticed it.
I had the eggplant torta and butternut squash ravioli.  The eggplant torta tasted to me like eggplant parmesan but in a lasagna type shape.  The butternut squash ravioli was divine.  I would love if I could just have a giant bowl of that!
We made reservations, but being that it was a Thursday night in the summer, they weren't really necessary.  
Their prices pretty much start at $15 and go up.  I noticed they have a decent happy hour menu if you are a bargain eater.  
This would be a fantastic date spot, but sit inside.  The patio would probably be nice during the day with friends, but there's nothing romantic about sharing a bottle of wine in front of the Grapevine and a parking lot.
Great Italian and great atmosphere!",2012-06-27 22:58:54
Og71uEwXr-SxLtiYvbzcaw,2MLTkPNp9ldB4YBOi5k4qA,vJvEKFtQ8Am95tWEkiwOGA,4,3,1,4,"First off, I would like to give credits to the management team of King's Fish House. Managers are open to take customers' opinions into consideration, and I found it very proficient and adequate. 

As stated in my previous review, I will draft another updated review based on my last visit for lunch at this place, and also for the invitation of the management team. This time, after jumbling through the menu once again for a closer look. I decided to go for Rainbow Trout Amandine with mango salsa, plus 2 sides of sauteed spinach and grilled zucchini.  At this moment, I am impressed. The trout is crunchy from the outside, but it also contains enough moisture. The garlic sauce (you can find it on the table) and the main entree is a perfect combination together. However, the sauteed spinach is just not my taste. The sourdough bread is fresh baked, and I prefer to enjoy it with sugar and butter on top. 

Once you know what to order, you can't go wrong with the your selection. They rotate the lunch menu every week, so each day they will have different specialties. Overall, my experience was improved this time. Thanks King's for the hospitality.",2015-04-03 01:25:45

It's not that the rest of the menu doesn't look good, it's just that the burgers are very good.  This is a wonderful little restaurant in a great location, with great food and atmosphere. Slightly upscale crowd, but a downscale (in a good way) place.  I wish it was bigger, but the smallness adds to the feel of the joint.

Bottom line:  If you want a burger or some classic American food, with a lot of chotchkies (sp?) on the wall, skip the bulls**t packaged corporate fakes like TGIF Friday's, Applebees, Champps, etc. and head to one of the originals--Gasoline Alley.",2008-05-07 18:02:42

It was definitely pricey ($50 for breakfast), but the portions are HUGE!  My hubby got the flapjack and it was the size of a monster truck tire...he can put away some food and was only able to eat half of it. I got their famous fried chicken and it had a maple reduction on it that I could have done without. The biscuit was big and came with a delicious blueberry preserve. Now, for my favorite part of the meal..the griddle cooked mashed potatoes were hands down the best I've ever had!!!!  Even after I felt like I was gonna need wheeled out on a gurney from eating to much, I ate some more of those mashed potatoes!  They were chunky red potatoes seasoned perfectly then put on a hot griddle to get a nice crust on the outside. Absolutely brilliant. 
I had the strawberry lemonade. It was good, but I expected more from $5 a glass and $1 for refills. My husband got a mint cappuccino and raved about it. I asked to substitute my bacon for chicken sausage and the waitress came back to me and said the chef said no...which was annoying but not a huge deal.  All in all, very good food and big portions.

For valentines I thought this would be a cool place to go because I love the location in Yorkville so we booked reservations and here's what happened.. 
The restaurant is hidden inside a big ""shopping mall"" for Asians. It was cool though because it had FREE underground parking and in the -25 degree weather that's a bonus!

We went up the elevator and followed a group of strangers through the mall to the restaurant (which had no sign pointing which direction to go).. 

Walking into the restaurant you can smell the amazing food! 
It was dim lighting with candles on every table (so romantic).
They seated us in the back at the ""couples tables"" with only 2 feet between each table. Everyone was listening in on everyone's conversation... It was kind of funny. 

The servers were average and the food amazing as always!! 
I was just annoyed at how small the tables were.. We only ordered 2 chicken dish, 1 small rice and 2 nan and we had no space for anything more.... :(

I was able to call my order in, and it was ready about 15 minutes later. It's in what used to be the Big Wong Chinese restaurant, but they've made some nice changes inside. The decor was very nice and inviting, and I was promptly greeted by a super cheerful lady all ready with my check. I ordered the  Pad Thai Lunch Special with chicken and Shrimp. I ordered it with two stars for the level of spice, just to be safe. the lunch special came with a humongous bowl of soup, a spring roll and a humongous heap of Pad Thai. I started with the soup, which I found a bit off putting (but I'm not much of a soup guy, maybe my wife would llke it better?) Next I dove into the spring roll. Not very good in my opinion, but that could just be my taste. I wasn't a fan of the texture, and there wasn't much flavor in the spring rol. The pad thai was pretty good, I've definitely had better. Will I go back? Heck yeah I will. I only tried the one dish, and it was pretty good. Next time maybe I'll  try one of the many curries they have on the menu.

You have the MGM, New York New York, etc. Paris Hotel and Casino is one of the coolest because of the decoration. It is elegant but not too pretentious.

ydHb9viGCU30eaj1mYQthw,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,zYzYmPLViy5Q6u7rmL8AYA,3,2,1,2,"Summerlicious is always in and around my birthday and so naturally I end up at a lot of them for birthday dinners.

I don't know about everyone else but I had a lot of difficulty trying to secure reservations this year without eating like a senior (e.g. 5PM) or having to eat two dinners (because I don't think I would've been able to hold out until 9:30PM).

I almost couldn't get a reservation to Bloke & 4th, but through the power of Twitter managed to nab a reservation for our table of 10.

I don't usually go to restaurant-lounges (the kind that turns into a bar/club after 10PM) because the food is usually mediocre and you're usually paying for the ambiance and convenience of not having to go elsewhere to party afterwards.  But after having learned that The Food Dudes were part owner at this trendy King West joint, all my doubts subsided.

The $35 dinner menu consisted of an amuse-bouche + 3 courses.  While the amuse (a Strawberry gazpacho) was a refreshing way to start off our meal, it was their Focaccia bread that had us all cooing.  It had a nice crust, but was pillow-soft on the inside and I suspect there was some cheese involved.  While I almost always pass on the bread, there wasn't one slice left in this basket!

To start I opted for the Steak Tartare with paper-thin, house-cut chips, mustard aioli and fried capers for added crunch.  The tartare was not too wet, not too pickled, and not too sweet - as Goldilocks would say - it was just right.

For my main, in true Flinstone size, a Braised Short Rib served over a bed of smoky cauliflower purée, grilled asparagus, King mushrooms and topped with carrot chips.  This colossal rib had me howling Ya-Ba-Da-Ba-Doo as tender and juicy shreds of meat came off the fork.  The King mushrooms were full of flavour and I loved the creamy cauliflower purée (bonus that it's way less calories than your usual mashed potato).

I had high hopes for the Key Lime Pie - essentially a white chocolate and Key Lime crème brûlée with ginger crumble on top.  But it resembled a Key Lime Pie as much as I resemble Angelina Jolie - not even a hint of lime flavour.

Luckily, the real dessert came when my best friend Andie surprised me with my very own birthday cake.  A Chocolate-Kahlua cake with Frangelico cream and a cherry minion on top!  I loved it. Bloke & 4th was kind enough to divide up the cake for us; service throughout the night was attentive and our server was a lot of fun!

We ordered pitchers of Sangria ($36) to drink.  As one of my friends put it ""Enjoy your Sunny D!""  But we did later discover that all the alcohol content went straight into the booze-soaked fruit.

All in all, I had a fabulous time at Bloke & 4th.   Even my pickiest friends gave their stamp of approval for this Summerlicious pick!  The ambiance is chic and there is plenty of street parking nearby (we parked right out front).  But beware the parking enforcement Nazis who left me a huge birthday present (a parking ticket) for being 10 minutes late to renew my parking.

Summerlicious runs until this Friday, July 19th.  Take advantage of special prix fixe menus and choose wisely - not all restaurants are created equal ;)

I expected it to just be a giant sushi roll but it's more because you can customize it with some alternative ingredients and, maybe more importantly, texture. I had a nori jaburrito with Salmon and Avocado (my favorite simple roll), masago, wasabi mayo and avocado cilantro, lettuce, tortilla strips, and tomato. What sets these rolls apart is mainly going to be the sauces. They add another layer of flavor choices that really makes it enjoyable. I also had a side of seaweed salad, which was pleasant.

My jaburrito was 7.95, which I thought was a good price for fresh fish and great tasting ingredients. Other choices can run as much as 10.95, but I honestly think it's better to choose a favorite protein and make your own rather than jumble 3 or more fish together.

I've also tasted the Jachos with taro chips, which were also tasty, but I don't really know how well it went with fish. I'd think drenching it in sauces and masago and veggies would be the way to go, but I'd have to experiment with that more.",2015-12-07 10:05:06

~Fud/Drink~
Well, the food takes an obvious second place to the wines in house, which there are plenty of. The staff understands how to interpret your pallet well, and easily helped guide my fiance and self through the options we had. We ordered some Sweet Red they had on the shelf which was perfect with the pizza we ordered. The pizza was a fine thin crust with yummy add-ins like pepperoni and olives, etc. The wines here all are fantastic, we had a hard time choosing from the selection they keep stock of. They also have some beers if you prefer that, although I believe the selection has changed. 

~Atmosphere~ 
It has a quiet, local and relaxing quality to it. I felt right at home and our waitress on each occasion was welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of homey qualities to the site, the bar area has a TV but its not in your face, allowing me the chance to pay attention to whom I am with, rather than other disturbances. They have an outdoor patio we briefly skimmed over. Next time I go I'll update on it so you have a feel for what it provides, etc. There is a general sense that loud noise is well out of the norm here, so boisterous parties are probably best left for reserving space for an event.

They do host events, and they do a great job at hosting them from what I have heard.

I'm so glad that summer decide to come back for a second run because the last few weeks has been way to cold and windy and the last thing I wanted was something cold and frosty. But today was beautiful, sunny and I was excited to be heading to Kensington in search for some KEKOU!

....guess everyone was thinking the same thing on one of the last warm days as a line up had already formed at the gelato house when we walked in. There were definitely a few flavours I was curious about (Pandan, Soursop) and a few that I was instantly attracted to (Black Sesame, Red Bean White Chocolate, Vietnamese Coffee). I got a sample of the Pandan which I was told is similar to the lotus leaf - very earthy and refreshing, and vietnamese coffee, strong and intense just like I expected.

I knew for sure I was going to order Black Sesame but needed something else. While I am a red bean lover, I didn't feel like chocolate today (it was  Red Bean White Chocolate flavour). At the last moment,  I decided to go with my gut and get the HK Milk Tea - and boy was I glad I did!

The Milk Tea was fullllll of flavour, exactly like a regular cup in a Chinese Diner... creamy and full of aroma, it was SOOOO DELISH! The sesame did not disappoint either with bits of sesame in every bite. Not too sweet and yet made of the real deal.. The winner by a smidget was the Milk Tea though... I really could have had that by it self. I tried ""his"" Green Bean Coconut Gelato and it was as authentic as can be with bits of green been to compliment the aromatic coconut flavours.

For $3.75 for a small cup, it is really a steal. I would compare it to the best Gelateria's - like Bella in the heart of Vancouver that charges $5.50 - 6.00 for the same size. Nothing really compares to this and if you really want to try what Durian tastes like I suggest you give this a try,

1. If you find the lines are getting longer these days and store is crowded, avoid weekends. Go on a weekday after 7.30 PM and more than likely you won't find the long lines.

2. Do not be shy to try samples. They want you to try them. :)

3. Use their ""no questions asked"" return policy (but please don't abuse it). If you are not happy with your purchase, you have a right to return it even if it has been 6 months. That's what Costco promises and you should enjoy and exercise that right. (Though, the guy who returned one year old socks with holes in it, needs to get a life).

4. Gas station opens early in the morning and is open till later at night (even after store closes). Keep that in mind and fill up during off-peak if you are passing by or live in the area.

5. Don't forget that Costco also offers other services like travel etc. Usually you will find better prices on car rentals and cruises etc.

6. The food court is nice where they sell high quality stuff in generous quantity at a reasonable price. Try it and you might be surprised. Don't discount it because it's ""Oh! Costco Pizza?"". 

7. If you find a certain item has not been in stock for some time, ask an employee to look up when would it be available again. If it is not on the list, you can always make a suggestion.

There is one thing that Costco can do to improve the experience. They can implement the self scan service like Chandler Costco. That will help speed up the check out times. To their credit, they do have staff who will pre-scan items in your cart sometimes (when the lines get longer) and it helps a lot.",2014-06-30 21:24:03

Decided to get their Chicken Katsu Burrito and Tocino Spam Musubi and POG Lemonade. (Yes, I can eat!)

Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and everything looked and tasted great! - it did make my stomach feel a little uneasy afterwards though.. (not used to fusion style foods) and the POG Lemonade was perfect for the 100+ degree weather in Las Vegas. 

CONS: My other family members wanted to order their Kalbi Short Ribs.. but they were all out!! - on a Sunday at 12pm - lunch time? When they just opened an hour ago? Whaaaaaa? - Either someone came in before us and ordered all their Kalbi.. or a major poor planing/food ordering issue going on.. Not sure about any other days, but it got really busy afterwards and people were getting bummed out that there was no Kalbi..

Other than that, well try this place out again in the future.

Enjoy!",2018-07-18 17:49:33

Jamie and I went there tonight, seeing as they were serving dinner until 9pm. however, once we'd arrived, Robert(the owner) greeted us and told us that they were in the midst of changing their hours, and that they were no longer going to be open on Mondays. he kindly offered to buy us each a glass of wine/etc. and a plate of cheese for our trouble(driving 20-25 minutes).

moments later, the sous-chef came by and asked us what we 'liked'. neither of us wanted to put him to trouble, especially since they were technically closed. but he said it was no problem at all. in the meantime, Robert brought us a plate of bread with 3 dipping sides: soft herbed butter, an artichoke/lemon oil/olive oil mini-bruschetta, and a balsalmic/olive oil mix, all of which were divine.

we moved to a larger table for the meal, and were absolutely blown away by what the chef presented to us: one plate was the open-faced BLT--shredded, marinated duck breast, seared foie gras, crisp smoky bacon, and sliced duck breast...all atop a thick, butter-soaked, toasted slice of ciabatta, spread with truffle aioli and with 25-year-aged sweet balsalmic on the side.

the other plate consisted of: a small salad of micro-greens and chunks of (nutty) beets tossed in sweet vinaigrette, cold smoked antelope served with a side of sweet balsalmic, beef tartare and almost-crisp onions(in a mound) topped with a poached quail egg, and sea-salt-dusted crisps with a wedge of creamy, buttery brie.

as for the drinks, I started with a glass of Spanish red wine(can't remember which, though the grape varietal started with 'M'--juicy, smooth, with hints of leather). then Robert poured me a glass of Malm(very smooth--hints of lead, but not a strong overtone of it like many wines I've tried--very sweet and easy on the tongue). Jamie had a glass of sauternes...an Australian Somilloun that was very sweet without being saccharine and overwhelming--absolutely addicting :)

throughout the meal, Robert stopped by, showing us the utmost attention and discussing the delicacies we were enjoying. 

for dessert, Jamie enjoyed the Banana Creme Pie, laced with dark chocolate sauce and accompanied by baby banana brulee(exceptional!). I had the flight of sorbets(all wine based)--pear, cherry zinfandel, and watermelon--the pear was my favorite, but the watermelon and cherry were splendid together...

so--the end of the meal--Robert didn't charge us for any of our drinks(my 2 glasses of red wine, the 2 glasses of sauternes, and Jamie's dirty martini), and they charged us half-price for our food--not at ALL what we'd expected. I was somewhat embarrassed for putting the staff to test on their night off, but they all went above and beyond anything we've ever experienced--this night was one of the best we've ever experienced, and we'll be back again tomorrow night for half-off-wine-night :)",2009-03-17 06:38:06

This time I ordered the Chicken Kebab Salad and my companions ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate and Gyro. My salad was beyond disappointing. The leaves were wilted and the tomatoes were mushy and tasted like they were on the verge of rotting. The whole thing was drenched in what would have been a really tasty dressing, had there been less of it. While the chicken kebab was delicious (well seasoned and perfectly grilled), there were only 6 small pieces of it on a mountain of greens and veggies. The Gyro was apparently not even close to how good it was last time, and they changed the bread they wrap it in, which was a downgrade. It seemed like the Shawarma plate was pretty tasty, but hat also had very few pieces of beef on it.

On the upside, the service was a lot faster and better than before, but we were also the only diners at the restaurant.

I've had a couple of dreams about how good their wings are. Like legitimately I've told people in my dreams that they have to have the best KFC wings and that would be at Seoul.

The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is pretty upbeat and fun, with open seating, a good bar area, and TV's all over the place. I'd say if you're in a hurry, come back when you've got some time to spend to appreciate the food because this food deserves your time and full attention. Also side note, it gets pretty packed here so it's not really an in and out kind of place.

I started off the night with the pineapple margarita. I'm not much of a pineapple fan, but I thought this was pretty delicious, especially with the coffee/sugar around the rim. Definitely a unique spin on it! Probably could have had a little more booze, but it was tasty nonetheless.

Once we were seated, we ordered the kimchi fries and the crispy pork belly. The kimchi fries were so good and a great way to start. They're pretty messy so it's fun reaching in to the middle of the table with your fork or fingers to get the fries over to your side of the table. 

The crispy pork belly actually surprised me a little bit. I'm usually not the biggest fan of pork belly only because it usually has so much fat left that hadn't been rendered down. It was NOT the case here, and each piece really was crispy on one end and super tender on the other. The sauce served with it was perfect.

Now for the main star of the evening. The WINGS. There really isn't that much to say other than the flavor is a 10 and the crunch is a 10. We got half and half soy garlic/spicy. I wasn't the biggest fan of the spicy but hands down the soy garlic were the best wings of my life. If that's what you want, come here.

I'll be back very soon to have those sweet, sweet wings. There's a bunch of other sides that need exploration, too. CAN'T WAIT.",2017-12-18 16:17:10

The location is off Strip and has plenty of parking in the back of the building. Morton's also offers valet, but being off Strip it doesn't really seem necessary to valet. 

The inside of the restaurant was a bit old school. The restaurant is on the dark side and not overly large. There are rooms for large groups off of the main dining area, but the main dining area is essentially one large room. They offer a combination of tables and booths.

The onion bread to start was tasty. The Morton's salad was okay and did the trick for a serving of vegetables. It was not the most exciting salad though. My filet was delicious, tender and buttery. It was prepared as I requested. I loved my sides, mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Dessert was a chocolate mousse, it was creamy and full of chocolate flavor.",2018-02-12 11:47:47
EAemIcfGrKjYY6IbZj5mcw,GEduhFjPmD5Jq1BLeZwiRw,iQDPdxmXXvW-mgy9gsKXhQ,5,0,0,0,"This is a review for the new Starbucks Reserve Bar, which opened on February 17, 2018.  So, when reading reviews and viewing photos here, you should disregard any that are dated 2017 or earlier, as those are for the previous Starbucks located in this area (that no longer exists).  

The store looks huge, almost cavernous in photos, but it's deceptive due to the high ceilings and long wraparound bar. It's really about the size of a small McDonald's.  Which is still about 2-3 times as big as a normal Starbucks. Music playing was upbeat ""Hot AC"" with some EDM mixed in, which was a lot better than some of the depressing stuff (country, ballads...) I have had to endure at other stores.  

At time of writing there are only 3 Reserve Bars in Canada - Vancouver, Ottawa, and this one.  There's a hierarchy in the Starbucks chain, with the Roasteries (so far just Seattle and Shanghai) at the top and your run-of-the-mill ""Dairy Queen"" Starbucks decked in green at the bottom, the ones full of squealing high school girls in Hello Kitty gear lining up for stupid Unicorn Frapps.  Reserve Bars are about halfway up the chain.  Look at the menu on the wall here and you'll see the Frappuccinos are hidden at the bottom right corner. They don't feature prominently here at all. In fact during my visit I never heard the Vitamix run even once.  This is Starbucks for the mature crowd.   This is Howard Schwartz's answer to all those hipster coffee shops downtown.   The hipsters have US$30,000 Black Eagle Gravitech espresso machines (as used in the World Barista Championships), so does this store.  The hipsters have Nitro Cold Brew Floats and Affogatos, so does this store.  The hipsters have rare exotic ""small lot"" coffee beans, so does this one. The hipsters will brew a ""flight"" for cupping, they'll do that here too.  And so on.   If you love and appreciate coffee, come here. If you want dessert out of a blender, go find a Dairy Queen or Baskin Robbins, don't come here.

If you're a Starbucks Rewards member and have a lot of free drinks to redeem, this is a great place to do it. On my visit I decided to treat myself to dessert (to redeem 2 freebies).  On arrival I started with a Nitro Cold Brew Float, which is a scoop of vanilla gelato with nitro cold brew poured over it, and would have cost $10 after tax.  Wow.  Creamy foamy coffee greatness in a glass!  I followed that up with the House Affogato (also made with that delicious gelato) but I specified that I wanted it made with 4 ristretto shots (the standard order is 2 regular shots) of Micro Blend 21. (by making these mods that bumped the price over $10 as well, but this was a free order)  MB21 is a special blend of beans exclusively used at the Reserve Bars and only brewed in the Black Eagle machine (which is fully manual - the barista hand-tamps the portafilter and hand-pulls each shot... not that lazy ""press button and look away"" business).  The barista then added demerara syrup and dusts it with cinnamon.   The special espresso blend with that vanilla, heavenly stuff.  Try what I had today and you'll ask yourself, why did I ever waste calories and money on Frappuccinos?

Along with the Black Eagle and the Nitro Cold Brew on tap, they also can brew Reserve coffee beans on the $15,000 Clover Brewer, do a pour-over brew using Chemex glassware, or for a special show, have them brew it at the Mod Bar, which looks like a high school chemistry setup.  I was disappointed that the Reserve Bar (at time of writing) did not yet have the Siphon brewers, which are actually available at the new Yorkdale Mall store.  Hopefully this gets included soon as that is a fun presentation to experience...

Lots of Starbucks Reserve branded items, but you'll get sticker shock...  Cold Brew growler for $54, and a 2-tablespoon measuring spoon (!) for $10!  Ouch... 

I can't wait to return to the Reserve Bar! I was ecstatic to learn we were finally getting one (how did Ottawa get one before Toronto?). Long overdue, Starbucks....  This is Starbucks as it was meant to be, not that Dairy Queen clone it mostly had become.",2018-02-26 04:03:58

Upon entrance, the associates greet you with a warm smile that makes you feel right at home. I usually know my way around and knew exactly where that cookie butter was located. As I picked up the jar of heavenly goodness, I decided to wander off and picked up a jar of coconut oil and started reading the label when suddenly an associate came over to make small talk. He told me about the different kinds of oils they had, but coconut was by far his favorite because of all the uses other than cooking. It was almost like having google right in front of me! I wish I could remember his name because he made me feel comfortable and our conversation seemed natural and unrehearsed. 
I came to the conclusion that no matter what associate you come across, they are always the first to approach you and give you the necessary information you never knew you wanted. And their products are pretty amazing too! Thank you trader joes for having me shop with you instead of Walmart!",2013-09-11 06:26:50

(+) Employees were friendly and helpful. Several made it a point to say ""hi"" and ""have a nice day"" when I was leaving. No complaints with the service at all.
(+) Plenty of stock in here. I'm mainly here for the Funko Pops! They usually have a pretty healthy selection of commons, and if you get lucky you may come across a decent exclusive.
(+) Prices are competitive. I also have the Hot Topic credit card, so I receive additional discounts, which is nice and makes having that card a nice perk.

(-) at times they seems understaffed as I've been stuck waiting in line for quite a while. 

I mean, it is what it is...it's a standard Hot Topic store i an outlet mall.

My boyfriend and I came here Sunday evening around 10pm and the place was pretty dead (which we expected). I hadn't been to Gallo Blanco in a very long time, which is regrettable since I live right near The Clarendon. 

The good: The food is great. I ordered the chopped salad and loved the jalapeno dressing. My boyfriend ordered carne asada tacos, which he enjoyed. The tacos did come with an awfully large amount of salsa compared to the size of the tacos (street taco size). Weird. He ordered 2 and wished he had ordered more because 2 does not a meal make! 

The bad: Service. While our server was certainly a nice person, for some reason our beers did not come until after our food was served. It's just beer, so I do not understand why we waited so long. Plus, we were one of a whopping 2 tables dining (not counting the few people at the bar). We also had to request silverware. 

I admit that I was expecting to hate this place based on other reviews that I read. It is not Gallo Blanco, but was anyone expecting it to be the same place?

The server who took my order was lovely, and provided me with one of their late night menus which is more limited and doesn't provide any pasta options. Just fine with me, I came in for a salad anyway.

The wait for the food was short, and it was packaged nicely when I got home. I ordered the Greek salad which came with romaine, red onion, pepperoncini, feta, tomatoes and olives. The olives were quality with the pits still in them, and the pepperoncini were served whole in the salad. The tomatoes you could tell had been refrigerated for a while as they had no taste except to be slightly sour with a mealy texture. The feta was dry and grated which was very strange to me. I prefer a creamier, softer feta, the kind that comes packed in water. I usually associate dry feta with poor quality. The vinaigrette was thin, thank goodness as I hate syrupy dressings, but I still added some red wine vinegar to my salad at home because it lacked the acidity I was looking for.
I also got a side of rice, and it came with white basmati rice topped with some saffron basmati rice. It was decent, but tasted heavily of butter. I can only imagine how much they probably used when steaming/reheating it.

Not only is this a pretty sketchy area, but this place looks even sketchier.  It is a very small place in a shady strip mall.  There are maybe 3 tables in the joint, some pictures of their food on the wall and a glass counter where they sell a bunch of random Asian bric-a-brac which is also where they take your order.

Luckily I called ahead to order or it would have been a while to get food.  There is only one cook so things may take a while if there are more than 2 people ordering.  Anyway, the cashier/order taker lady was very nice on the phone and in person.  She was also running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to get orders ready.

This place was recommended by my coworkers but because I didn't have a menu, all I had to go on were the reviews on Yelp to use as a guide on what to order.

* Orange Chicken - came with fried rice and an egg roll.  The egg roll was pretty good but the fried rice was nasty.  It tasted stale and had a weird flavor.  The orange chicken was just ok.  I like it that they used big chunks of white meat chicken and the orange sauce a mild spice to it.  I wouldn't order the meal again though.  I could tell the ingredients weren't quality and everything was fried and overly greasy.

* Hot and Sour soup - This took about 30 minutes for this to cool down to ""won't-scar-my-mouth-forever"" temperature.  The soup was full of great ingredients including nice-sized shrimp and meat.  It looked excellent but the flavor just wasn't there.  The broth tasted sweet and was just weird.

I don't like to give sub-par reviews but I don't think I will be back here any time soon.",2010-09-01 19:42:15

If you ask for a window view, you can see the Bellagio fountains.

The amuse bouche was this delicious chopped tartare of fish. 
Hubby paid extra for the authentic Japan-raised Wagyu beef sold by the oz.  He got 5 oz. We both agreed that's one of the best tasting cuts of meat we've ever tried and they cooked it just perfectly.  The outside was seared and crunchy and the meat was very tender. He thought it practically melted in your mouth. I wouldn't go as far as that to say it melted, but it could easily be consumed by someone without teeth and had to gum it.  

I had an appetizer of Yellowtail hamachi, thin slices of fish which was tender and I could've eaten more of it. My entree was a Mediterranean seabass surrounded in a potato crust.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  Dessert was a wonderful milk chocolate souffle'. The souffle' was fluffy and soft served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cream anglaise.  

Hubby had a very tender foie gras appetizer.  His dessert of lychee ice cream with raspberry was also very good.  They offered 5 different slices/rolls of bread but we tried 3:  French, a great chedder bacon roll and chocolate/coffee which could've been dessert by itself.

I ordered myself a large plate of Japanese curry, and it only came with TWO (rather small) pieces of chicken :(. I think the bill came up to 10$ for it, leaving me unimpressed. I felt the value of that dish was rather poor-- it came with two pieces of chicken, about three heaps of rice, and two scoops of curry. The curry tasted good, but it wasn't amazing or as savoury as I hoped it would be. The plate DID leave me full, however, so that was good (probably because of the rice lol).

*The service here was a bit lackluster in terms of speed and just trying to get them to notice you. 

-Lumpiang Ubod - $12.99
I didn't like this dish at all. It was like eating a crepe filled with raw vegetables and meat. There was no flavor and the peanut dip was somehow really sweet, and didn't go well with the savoury meat at all.

-Lechon Kawali Sisig - $14.99
the sisig here was crunchy and every bites was explosion of flavors. It also has a texture contrast of soft pieces as well as crispy since the dish was served on a hot cast iron plate. Toward the end the sisig became quite greasy and it would have been better if there was something tangy like lemon to cut through the fat.

-Lechon Kawali  - $15.99
The skin was super crispy while the inside was dry and hard to bite. It also lacked seasonings but the mild tartness of the liver sauce helped to cut through the ""supposed to be"" fattiness of the lechon kawali.

-Pancit Palabok - $10.99
There was something strange about the texture of the rice noodle and the sauce that didn't work for me at all. The noodle was overcooked, mushy and sauce was really .. flour-y? I also found the noodle to be quite bland and the cracklings were incredibly dry, it just added no flavors to the palabok at all.

-Garlic Rice - $6.95
The garlic rice was a must order when you are having Filipino food and we also had a lot of saucy dishes as well. It was very garlicky with real bits of garlic, but in a good way.

-Leche Flan - $3.99
Nothing special. Tasted just like any other flan that I could make at home.

-Ube Creme Decadence - $4.99
Technically we received this dish for free as there was a check-in special on Yelp that day. On the initial bites, the texture was similar to a panna cotta, rich and creamy yet light in flavor. When you dig in further, you will find the rich ube creme in center. The milk and cream muted the starch of the ube to make a perfect pair, finished off by the ube roll crumbs. I thought it was a light and refreshing dessert to cleanse the palate all that oiliness from the lunch :).",2016-01-07 16:49:38

I am extremely glad that business friend brought me here for late dinner one night--exceptional experience. First of all, this is a very ethnic restaurant--you will have as true of a Japanese experience as possible. Everything from the dishes served to the friendly Japanese servers are authentic. This is not an Americanized sushi place--you will find many ""weird"" foods by American standards. The cooks will make everything by your suggestions, but I would definitely advice to just tell them ""make it the best way you know how."" There are a lot of raw foods here--raw fish, sashimi (out of this world, by the way), raw oysters with super yummy spicy sauce etc. This place is not for the unadventurous, although there are several dishes that are very common, such as the hot menu. However, this plase is only amazing if you are able to enjoy it all--with its traditional atmosphere and its traditional raw seafood dishes. If you have a gentle stomach, this may not be the best place to dine.

Service is quiet, quck and with an occasional Japanese joke humor. Traditional wide variety of alcoholic drinks. This restaurant is open after 5PM only up until 2AM. Good looking ladies (pretty much 99.9% of women) get discounts on all you can eat meal after 11PM.

The restaurant is located in the hot spot of the Pitt campus, right next to the lawn in front of the Cathedral, which makes it a very scenic location and visible. The inside of the restaurant isn't the neatest, but that's because they usually have to move tables around for larger parties of guests. Still, it's a lively environment that pairs well with the large glass side that lets you gaze into the large green lawn.

Onto the food! So options are porch are definitely plentiful, and drinks are complete as well. But in terms of the quality of the food, I just didn't find anything tasty. Even for things that you can't mess up like a cheese platter or a smoked meat platter, the food was just really dry and weirdly flavored. And for the entrees, I was thoroughly disappointed by how poor everything was made. For one of their ribeye steaks, it was so loose that I had no idea if it was ground beef or steak. For another one of their steaks, that wasn't ground beef, it was so dry that I was essentially chewing on rubber the entire time. Their side dishes are usually the standard, except when they try to be extra, and ugh, it's really an embarrassment. They just out so much crap that you don't want to eat and really make you question what they put in their food. 

If there is any bright spot about porch, it's their dessert. But if you're serving desserts from other places like Millie's ice cream, that's not even credit well deserved to the porch.

Then I considered the location of being right in Market Square, their name (both odd & conveys a message of a cocktail bar, their logo (note sure if it was local), the photos of the upstairs bar, and I really didn't think it was going to go well. I just imagined those vibrating beepers that hosts hand you so they gyrate in your pocket to be seated. 

Instead, not looking upstairs, and I think we got lucky on being Thanksgiving weekend, there was barely anyone there and we were able to sit right in front of the burger griddle. And the staff was the complete opposite of what I expected. And I loved them for it. Two teddy bears of large chaps behind the counter made me laugh through the whole night. Add on I was with the cute Canadian, and it was such a perfect odd couple pairing for the setting. I don't know if this would be a real dive-dive, and I don't know what the standards are for Pittsburgh, but I love how bare bones, and blue collar this feels. 

Now. I usually put nothing on my burger but cheese. Apparently someone stared into their lunch pale in Pittsburgh and put their coleslaw and fries on their sandwich. If I were ever going to put this on a burger, it was then, and it was excellent. Large enough to not need any sides at all but a beer. 

It feels like an off the beaten path place that's wisely plopped in the middle of Market Square. I dig your move Pittsburgh. I'd imagine most visitors make their way here, and if this is the style you're promoting, you're one of a kind in a very good way.",2013-12-11 18:22:46

 Came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm. 
First time here , probably last time here. 
We came to try this new ayce and it was quite disappointing.   As we were being seated I was indecisive on which seat to sit at because one table had a bright light which hurts my eyes and the other table was uncomfortable.  The lady was giving me a rude looks even though I apologized for being annoying and indecisive.  So we ended up at a table and we ordered.  The lady was pretty clumsy she dropped the wasabi while i was ordering on the iPad and scared the hell out of me. 

So the variety of selections are smaller than some of the other ayce. I wouldn't really recommend anything from the menu other than probably the salmon belly. It was very crispy and juicy pretty much the only thing I ordered more than once.  The sashimi wasn't fresh tasting and the cuts are really small. As said before the selection for sashimi is also very small for weekdays. On weekends you get scallop I think.. 

 The menu is quite deceiving for example they have fried scallop but it would  actually be fish paste.  They would have fried chicken wings but it would be drumsticks.  They would have a seafood soup but it only has salmon and crab meat in the soup.  

 Anyway overall 2.5  because it was decent priced since they gave me 10% discount if paid in cash.",2016-01-07 18:08:43

I think I can release this now.  There are two doors but you must enter the left one because the hostess stand is there, and the right is locked.  Greeted by two hostess, sat down at the ""power seat"" of the house.  I had a view of everything, I believe it was table 8, seat 9.  The server, Alison or Ally, approached me and I can tell how inexperienced she was.  Felt like a diner service rather than a place that sells (on the face of it) overpriced burgers.  She doesn't tell me her name, I found out her name after shift change but she asks if I wanted anything to drink.  I pointed to the raw juice section on the menu when she tells me they didn't have any.  Blah, but ordered an IPA beer.

I asked if they were able to sample the dishes and she said no, but she did sample the drinks and I think dessert.  I asked what kind of Kobe Beef was used and she gave me a are you kidding me with that question look, had to explain that it could either be Japanese, Australian, or American.  But she goes and asks the chef and comes back to tell me it's American.  I ordered it, MEDIUM RARE, and had a side of crushed potatoes.

My Kobe Burger comes and when I go to cut it, it doesn't cut as smooth as I thought it would.  It was a bit past medium, I showed my server and Candance, part owner or wife of Chef Conrad, and she too can see it wasn't medium rare.  Usually I send it back but I kept it and ate it, not going to waste this dish.  The foie gras itself was good, if it wasn't for the foie gras my burger would have been dry.  If you cut your burger in half, be sure to cut it half through the foie gras so it divides evenly.  The pair of fried quail egg still had some runny yolk to it so I loved that part too and the tomatoes were fresh.  But it didn't make up for the main event being almost well done.

The ""crushed"" potatoes aren't crushed but small potatoes cut in half and seasoned with thyme, cayenne, and oil.  I loved the taste but it wasn't crushed.

Fast forward to my actual meal on Grand Opening.

For appetizer I ordered the tomato buffalo mozzarella, for anyone who knows me know that I eat at Parma right down the street.  I've had Bufala on my pizza when they had Pizza Wednesdays and this was Bufala mozzarella.  Unfortunately my server does not know what a tomato caprese is so when she explained to me the dish she made it sound like it was a green leafy salad.  Then when it was ready, the food runner brought it to a different table and set it down.  She picked it back up and told the old lady Just Kidding! and brings it to me and tells me she didn't touch it so it's fine.  Ugh what?  I witnessed everything so I know.

What I did witness though about health issues is there's an exit door at the kitchen, next to a sink.  Some of the people who entered into the kitchen from the exit door didn't wash their hands.  I mean, commeeeeee onnnnnnnn.  You're outside and all of a sudden you start working on stuff in the kitchen?  I mean if you're delivering items then drop it off and go but don't handle food.  The executive sous chef wore plastic gloves, I think he was the only one too but others could learn from that practice.  

Anyway, everyone's back is facing the customers so it took me 10 mins to flag someone down until Candace saw me and came over to assist.  I ordered what was probably my favorite beer there so far, the Devastator!  It's a dark beer but fit well with my burger.  Daniel brought it out to me and he was cool, had and held good conversations with him only because he knew what the hell was going on.  Sorry servers, I didn't even need to look at the menu a second time to order the beer or appetizer.  Eventually they'll get better, especially as they get more experience and see more of the different dishes.  Both times Allison had to come back to me after putting in the order on the machine thingy to ask how I wanted my burger cooked and what side I wanted.  

My main course was the Wild Boar Burger.  This was actually perfect.  The bun did not have the oily brush like my Kobe Burger but the second I cut through the wild boar burger it split like the Red Sea and came crashing back down.  My Kobe Beef stayed apart, stiff like a board and not cooked the way I wanted it.  Good bye all that fat I crave for.  The Boar Burger was not bad at all, I can tell this wasn't the first time this was made but my Kobe Beef Burger... maybe I was the first one to get it?

The side I choose with this was the Skinny Fries.  They were skinny and topped with shredded Parmesan, good enough for me!

Food wise, there's something delicious for me at every meal which is nice as a vegetarian. The spicy chickpea wraps are especially good since they are tasty and a little more virtuous than a regular sandwich. Back in my meat eating days, I devoured the cobb salad and tuna salad sandwich. In fact, I now have an expensive addition to Bubbies pickles solely because of LGO.

My sweet tooth is always very happy at LGO. The gelato case has lots of great flavors and usually many of them are dairy free. During the holidays, we had an apple cider sorbet that was out of this world. The baked goods are so sinful. A drug rep learned about my love of their pastries and cookies, and she started bringing boxes of the stuff to our office. And, well, I had to quit my job just to stave off obesity. (ok, not really)

I love their retail section too. Their marionberry jam is double what I would normally pay for a jam, but I'll be damned if it doesn't taste amazing with their english muffins The wine section is where most of my dollars go. They have a cool selection, and their prices are comparable to total wine.

I normally get a waffle cone with two scoops ($4.45 plus tax). The waffle cones are offered in original, sesame and seaweed from what I remember. Also, like other posters have mentioned they allow you to sample any flavour before you make a purchase.

But the staff is half and half. I got attention on the floor like no other. They really helped. But the dumb bitches at the counter fight for ring-ups because of commission. Times are hard, I understand.

I went on the free panty/$10 off bras day. I read the card and it said you COULD get undies with lace, but when I got there the dumb girl told me it wasn't true. Why? Because the ones she told me I could get were more expensive. I wanted a RED bra, so I chose the BioFit (which is great, btw). The tag said $45. Good price, I thought.

I have a number of VS bras. Very Sexy, BioFit, Ipex, and 4 or 5 others.
I buy them because I'm dumb apparently. These things need warranties based on prices. Wires pop out. Cups get mangled. The clasps break. Straps break. Fabrics peel apart. On ALL of them. The BioFit looked different and it's holding up well thus far.

I had a bad experience because all sizes were messed up. The panties I wanted were only in XS or S and in an ugly color. The girl helping me convinced me only certain ugly panties were free with the coupon.

She rang me up for a DIFFERENT bra because it was $48 instead of $45. She didn't use the coupon for the underwear. She purposely had me get the wrong pair for more money also. My friend and I were splitting the $30 for 6 perfumes/lotions. I was paying for the rest. She was very rude, no smiles, no laughing, nothing. She said, ""One-hundred-seventy-five."" And my friend and I said, ""It couldn't be THAT much, but I GUESS..."" (she had convinced me to get so many pairs of panties I didn't even think about just getting the free pair). I explained that she was paying for $15 and I would get the rest. So then she said I owed some insane amount. We kept arguing back and forth and then she looked at us like we were retarded, pulled out her calculator and finally it read: $100.75. DING DING DING! Ooooooooooh, okay. Duh. We could have avoided this annoying scenario if she had said, ""One-hundred-DOLLARS-and-seventy-five-cents."" Cashiers are told to do that. I used to cashier and this pissed me off for a few seconds, but I got over it.

I was just wanting to get out of there, the mall was about to close, we got to my car and looked at the receipt and realized how much bullshit that was. She had me get a bra not under the $10 off deal, although I specified that's what I wanted, and she charged $3 extra.

After coming here a few times (with great experiences) I chose Eggslut for breakfast while having friends in town. We waited in line then when it came our turn to order we should have run for the hills.
I ordered the Gacho sandwich with no bread and no dairy. I specifically asked her if there was any type of cheese and she said no. The cashier asked me if I wanted to turn that into a salad, I said sure. My friend ordered the bacon eggslut sandwich.
Upon receiving our order I asked the guy who delivered it what the white stuff covering the salad was. He said cheese.
I returned it because I told them I couldn't have dairy (I'm on a very strict diet right now) and he got the cashier to come over. She told me she said there wasn't dairy on the sandwich, she never said there wasn't cheese on the salad.

Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? In front of a ton of other guests mind you. I told her I'd gladly pay for another order but I absolutely cannot have dairy. They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order. 
I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm. Even my boyfriend Andy who NEVER complains commented how cold it was.

I had some besties in town and we were looking to have a tasty night out to dinner after a vigorous day of hiking, college basketball and patio-hopping. I don't really know how or why I came to the decision of Grassroots, but BOY HOWDY (yep.) am I glad I did!

I used to work right over in this area and put Grassroots on my mental ""to-try"" list when it opened. Time got away from me, and I really have no idea why we just now tried it out, given how close it is to home. Nothing could prepare me for how glorious it was. Walking in, we were transplanted into someone's hip, modern kitchen with lots of Americana art adorning the sleek space. We were promptly sat at a high-top for 4 and perused the menu. We all ordered a cocktail (or beer) to start with, and my Hendricks/cucumber concoction was cool and refreshing. 

Ordered:

~Burrata app: Heaven. Creamy, dreamy burrata served alongside lightly dressed arugula and tomato jam. Served with lil grilled toasts. So perfect.

~Seasonal vegetable chop for the table to share: Not sure why, but our order came with chicken on it? At a normal time I'm sure we would have sent back but we had already placed our dinner order and it was getting closer to the kitchen closing. No matter. Those who weren't eating meat just picked around. The plethora of veggies was outstanding! (Beets, grapes, bnut squash, corn, edamame, cucumber, herbs, cherry tomatoes, feta, I'm sure I'm leaving something out.)

My choice as my main was the grilled portobello sandwich, no mayo, add avocado. The combo of smokey porto, creamy avo and sharp, melty white cheddar was outstanding! The soft and warm sea salt foccacia was insanity. Paired with a side of fatty grilled asparagus spears, this meal was amazing. I also loved how they cut the sammie into tiny squares...easier to handle and inhale.

Friends ordered the sashimi ahi salad (was told the ahi was PERFECT and it actually went better with the champagne vin that came out with the chop salad rather than the miso vin), the vegetable platter (the sauteed cabbage with goat cheese was TO DIE) and my boyfriend said his burger was one of the most perfect orders ever.

With the meal, we ordered a bottle of the Rockus Bockus, which is a mix of Cab Franc and Zinfandel and was SO, SO perfect. Juicy, man. It's a new favorite.

Service was great, even though we stayed a little past closing. Whoops. (PLEASE SCOTTSDALE, HAVE SOME NICE PLACES LIKE THIS THAT STAY LATER THAN 10:00 ON THE WEEKENDS, PLEASE!)

I will be honest though, a big reason that this place gets a 4 instead of a 3 is because my husband and I have found NO other Chinese food in the area that is edible (if anyone has recommendations, I am all ears!). The jerk chicken was chewy with quite a bit of gristle. The Jade Red Chicken is my favorite, similar to a VERY spicy combination of S&S Chicken and General Tso's at your typical Chinese hole-in-the-wall.

If you are extra hungry, you can get a combo plate that comes with your choice of fried rice varieties, either bean, and two smaller portions of a meat (or veggie). You can get your meat on a quesadilla or in a burrito for no extra cost! The decor is simple; a large number of very long, heavy-duty plastic tables, lined up in L-formation in the restaurant. They face a huge flat-screen TV, which seems to always be tuned to ESPN. Order at the counter, give them your name, and then they bring the food out to you in foil to-go containers.

Joe's drew us in by the comfortable modern/industrial atmosphere with tons of counter and bar seating everywhere, music,and patio dining. Very open kitchen to see the cooks in action. This place has a pretty cool layout.

Sat at the bar for Sunday brunch (Father's day). No wait. Coffee was fine. It was bustling but not quite a sold-out house. Bartender and everyone was nice but wait staff seemed pretty stressed with the volume of business and didn't really engage other than to get a quick order and refill coffee and waters. Had a frittata and pancake. Frittata was way overcooked and dry.  Normally would have sent it back but one of us needed to get some protein asap to avoid a headache and nausea (she hadn't eaten anything that morning). 

Pancake was very thick, ""cakey"" texture . . .  interesting and unique. If I had it again, I would want to special-order the pancake with fresh fruit or some other toppings. Otherwise, really prefer the flavor of my other go-to pancake places in the neighborhood.. 

Bartender did a courtesy check once to see if everything was ok but did so in the middle of pouring a drink for someone and was in a rush. Felt like an imposition in that moment to send it back and that was my mistake. Anyway, the frittata was almost gone by then so we didn't send it back. 

We thought about talking to manager after dinner about the eggs just to give him a heads-up but he was busy waiting tables. Hostess knew something was up and we'd like to talk to him but didn't  interrupt his work so we missed our opportunity to share.

I'm sticking with a 4 star review because I like the overall store concept, selection of drinks, and the drink I had last time but reviewing the Deerioca alone, I'd only give it a very mediocre 3 star.

I got to try the black sesame flavored tapioca and I think I was expecting some sort of explosion of sesame filling in my mouth so I was a little disappointed. It's essentially just tapioca with black sesame paste embedded into the pearl. That being said, it wasn't bad! Definitely could taste the black sesame and it was aromatic. However, it made the texture slightly softer and chewier than my preferences. I was also told that the deerioca tasted the best when paired with a specific milk tea that the employee recommended so I ordered it and.. well, I think I would've enjoyed it better if I got to choose my own tea. I believe she just gave me original milk tea and it was so.. standard tasting that I didn't feel like it was worth the $6.50.

It was also a busy Friday night so the employees seemed to be a little exhausted and sidetracked. She got our order wrong, but quickly realized it and rectified her error by remaking us the proper drink.

Food trucks pop in here often, so you may temper your drunken-ness with stomach contents, and they have Video games for you to play while you sit in a beanbag (I believe I saw super Mario bros 3.) 

They sell growlers( if this is unknown to you, buy one and thank me later-it's a vessel with which to bring home your tasty discovery), as well as shirts with their designs and such.

The atmosphere was pretty industrial, with an awkward second room which also contained the single unisex bathroom with a separate sink just outside the enclosed stall. Really, Drip.

""Primi"" (Appetizers):

Calamari Fritto Misto: Big plate (easily shared by 3-4 people)! I loved the peperoncini mixed with the squid. Once in a while I would pick one up to spice it up a bit! Or sometimes it was a spicy surprise! Breading wasn't real golden brown and crispy. Came with 2 sauces on each side -Red sauce/Marinara type and Yellow sauce/Garlic Aioli. Red sauce typical pasta pizza sauce flavored. On the other hand, the Garlic Aioli was Absolutely Divine!! I don't know if its just me but that flavor got my attention real quick! It had a distinct flavor and a hint of horseradish mustard something that I couldn't get enough of! I didn't want to look like a dog but I would of Licked that plate clean with a shine! 

Spicy shrimp & Eggplant: Nice presentation, came on a long rectangle plate all lined up like in a straight line. Overall, flavor wasn't really impressive more disappointing if anything. The black pepper cream sauce wasn't as good as it sounded but the romano crusted egg plant was nice. Basically, after a few pieces, I was over it.. I guess that's why its an appetizer! But this felt heavy and after a few, I threw in the towel..

Entree:

Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken and added their Bistecca Insalata (salad): Another Heavy Weight plate, a generous mound of angel hair pasta, grilled chicken, pine nuts and their cilantro pesto drizzle. Plus some grated parmesan on top. Pretty straight forward dish and pretty good as well. It was just lacking 5 Stardom calibur, just like every other dish.. (Except for the salad, I'll get to that!).

*Bistecca Insalata: The Freshest Wedge of Iceberg Lettuce (crisp and almost neon green), Gorgonzola, real pieces of bacon (not dried bits), shiny red roma tomaotes and their mouthwatering creamy parmesan dressing!! One of the Best salads I've ever sunk my teeth in!!

Couldn't help but watch some of the staff really get to work. During our meal, we couldn't help but notice a vacant table behind us that was getting set for the next guest(s). The busser/server assistant was so precise and jaw dropping fast! I mean like watching a dvd and pressing forward like 3 times/3 arrows!! Just like everybody else here!!

My buffalo wrap was bland with a very salty tasting buffalo sauce.  Little bit of chicken.  The Thai wrap had all the sauce in 1 spot and was also bland.

Overall it was OK.  The experience was not great. Super slow service and the lobby was filthy. Literally trash everywhere and broken tables.

I arrived at opening time this past Sunday (02/12 at 11:30), and was greeted by a young, very bright and enthusiastic female server, who told me I could sit anywhere; I chose the booth closest to the door. 

She immediately placed a full water glass and menu on my table, then went about some other duties. When I was ready to order she magically appeared and efficiently took my order, repeated it back to me for confirmation and whisked away to the back with my menu in tow. All the while, more customers were filing in to the place, and she didn't miss a beat with any of them. 

In good time, she returned with a steaming bowl of miso ramen and a small plate of chahan (I chose regular fried rice over kimchi fried rice). The chahan was decent, with a nice bit of wok flavor (I dropped the left over chahan at my mother's, and she thought it was excellent), and the miso ramen was just what I needed after a couple days of hard driving. The broth was hot, flavorful, with firm noodles, plenty of bean sprouts, corn, green onion and chasshuu. While it wasn't as good as a bowl of Misoya Tomi's miso ramen (they're actually closed now), it was pretty dang good. The highlight of the dish was the chasshuu, with excellent flavor in the lean part, and of course, a lot of flavor on the fatty part, which was plentiful. 

After drinking the bowl dry, I pushed the bowl away and almost immediately after, the server dropped the check at my table, and asked me if I wanted a box for the left overs. When she returned with the box, she parted with a warm/polite ""thank you"". 

The industry needs more servers like her. I hope this server, and many more like her, decide to make it their role in life to do this job, and do it well - especially in small, hole-in-the-wall places like Ramen Tatsu. Who knows, maybe she's the owner, and if so, thank God.",2017-02-14 02:58:26

Everything started out fine, till our food took really long. There were only 3 tables of people in the place, and a few on the patio. It wasn't busy. AT ALL, Tuesday night.

We saw another angry table of people complaining that their food was taking forever. So we complained a little too. They really had no excuse, the place was dead.

As soon as the bitching started they jumped into action swarming our table like bees, filling our water cups and such. Not sure why we had to bitch to get this kind of service. It was soo awkward and embarrassing. The manager jumped in and served our food. They really tried to accommodate us, and we did appreciate that. But like why do we have to ask for service? Made everything uncomfortable from there on....
The food tasted bleh. Not worth the gas I got later on. The shrimp and chips were frozen shrimp, and if they weren't geezus help us cause I don't know what that was. My aunt ordered a pizza, and it was like something you would get at the skating rink. My cousin got the sliders, huge bun , turd sized burger with no taste. 
The chicken in my nachos tasted like cat food. ( forgot to order no chicken - it was my fault.)

This place is either going to shut down, or get a visit from Jon Taffer and the show Bar Rescue. If that does happen I hope the first thing he does IS TAKE AWAY THAT HORRIBLE LOBSTER TORTURE TANK. ANIMAL CRUELTY AND ITS SOOOOO DISGUSTING TO WATCH PEOPLE TRY TO CATCH HELPLESS ANIMALS WITH A METAL CLAW. 

I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN. AS LONG AS THAT INHUMANE  LOBSTER TANK IS STILL THERE.",2014-07-16 10:05:49

Tryon... the space is pretty darn awesome and you can tell they've learned a thing or two from opening up their original location in Villa Heights.

They've got a great parking lot in the back.  A good number of spaces, but I think it could fill up pretty quickly.  I like how they have a nice spot for a food truck and the outdoor space.  Right now no shade, but I'm sure as the trees grow in and it will be a great place to enjoy a great beer and food outside.

When you walk in, there's a nice high ceiling and a large space - one of those ""big a** fans"" circulating the air the in room.  We got a table right underneath the fan so it was a bit of a wind tunnel, but I like moving air rather than the alternative.  It also didn't help that it was pretty hot that day and I had already started sweating through my shirt just from the short walk from the car to the taproom.

Nice, large bar in the back with a wall of beer options.  Chalkboard strips suspended from each other make for a nice backdrop and interesting way to display their menu (Pinterest anyone?).

I went in after seeing a large sign advertising a discount for their 'grand opening.' Upon inquiring, I was told that they actually were only offering the discount for a short time (which is indicated in tiny print on the sign) and no longer had the discount. This seems pretty dishonest, no? 


Anyway, I had wanted to try the ice cream regardless and put in an order for Thai tea ice cream with mango. The rolled ice cream is expensive. It costs upwards of 6$. It took a looooooong time to receive the ice cream. Like 30 minutes, as the guys working there had to spend a good 5 minutes making each order. They offer to add toppings (two for free I believe), and I asked for pretzels and whipped cream....that is, until they pulled out a cheap can of whipped topping from the grocery store, and I stopped them. For 6$ they don't offer real whipped cream? I opted for strawberries instead. When I got the ice cream, the strawberries were cut up, but the pretzels were left whole, which made it difficult to eat. The pretzels were essential to the ice cream's flavor, however, because without them, it would have been way too sweet. Anyway, with the wealth of places in town that make homemade ice cream and homemade whipped cream and offer these products for less money, I don't know why anyone would come here.",2017-07-02 01:19:27

The Steeles location is more spacious. Though the leather bench gas pretty beaten up look, but the place is pretty clean in general, including the washroom. 

We ordered #13 Banh Cuon (Vietnamese steam ground pork rice roll with shrimp cake), #11 Bun Bo Hue (Hue style beef noodle , #26 Com Tam Suon Nuong (grilled pork chop with minced rice), #23 Goi Cuon (pork and shrimp roll), #50 Ca Phe Su A Nong (filtered hot coffee with condensed milk). 

The service was very friendly and the staff confirmed me after if that was what I wanted to order. Thanks for his confirmation, I found I did misunderstand the dish and it was corrected. 

#13 - **4 stars** Vietnamese steam rice roll is signature dish here. I love the sauce they provide. It is lighter flavour sauce and won't over power the rice roll. The shrimp cake looked dry but indeed was soft. It was full of mung bean flavour. 

#11 - ** 3 stars** Hue style (spicy) beef noodles soup which is special recommendation and only available from Friday to Sunday. Hue style soup was full of flavours of many spices and I really enjoyed the soup. The round and bouncy noodles were used in which was authentic. It has not only slices of beef brisket, but also fish cake and pig knuckles. The only complains would be the meat (mainly was the brisket) was very chewy. Wish it was more tender. 

#26 - **3.5 stars** Com Tam Suon Nuong (grilled pork chop with minced rice). I love the aroma of the grilled pork. The side was harder but the meat from centre part was tender. The fish sauce has a stronger flavour. 

#23 - **3.5 stars** Goi Cuon (pork and shrimp roll) the portion was little small, but the ingredients were fresh and I liked the sauce that go with the roll. This place offer different sauce to different dish, not like other not authentic Vietnamese place would only give you the same fish sauce for everything. 

#50 - **4 stars** Ca Phe Su A Nong (filtered hot coffee with condensed milk). Part of the star go to staff who educated us how to make the Vietnamese coffee. The hot water from the bottle was supposed to pour in to the cup to dilute the coffee. By the time you finished your meal, the water in the filter would be done by then. Also I made a mistake to order the coffee without milk, and staff was very kind to provide us condensed milk afterward.

I really like the clean process they use for soaking your feet, you know your getting a new clean place to put your feet in, now worries about ""catching"" something. 
I then got the gel manicure. I'm pretty rough on my hands and nails, so anything that will last a little longer, I'm all for it. I'm not a fan of the chairs at the manicure stations, they're comfy but really heavy, I had a tough time moving it around! Otherwise I had a great mani.
The girl  that did my services was really friendly and did such a thorough job, probably one of the best mani/pedi's I've ever gotten. It's a little pricier than I'm use to even with the Yelp check in discount but its worth the splurge every now and then.",2013-02-01 18:12:18

This place is great it is Asian and American food mixed together. They have an array of different burgers and other Asian inspired dishes. The sushi menu is huge and there is so much to choose from. I liked how they had a page combining burgers and sushi. I was in the mood for a burger so I ordered that. I got the long horn burger with sweet potato fries because I love sweet potato fries. The burger was delicious and juicy. It has a sweet after taste. My friends ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer. It was just like the traditional Asian version but broken apart like a dip. They had the duck sauce drizzled on the chips and then the dip on the side very good. Finally their dessert was just as hard to pick from as their regular menu. I ordered the s'more shake with Greek yogurt. I like how they give you the option to swap out things for semi healthier versions. Some restaurants get so stuck on their menu they don't let you do things like that so I appreciated it. I also forgot to mention they give you the option to essentially build your own burger. You can add and subtract different ingredients to suit your needs and they have different proteins to choose from including a veggie burger and bison. I loved this restaurant.

They also bring out chips and a salsa and some sort of Spanish style coleslaw. The slaw was pretty yummy, but a little difficult to eat with chips. It would be way better if the cabbage was chopped finely. The salsa was good, but not enough heat for what I like.

I vaguely recognized the name of this restaurant as being somewhat hyped when it first opened, although that's clearly died down now. In my opinion though, this is one of those rare occasions when the food actually lived up to what was promoted. Pho Vistro is known for its MSG-free pho, made with healthy and fresh ingredients. And that is exactly what we got! Also, I was hugely relieved that concerns over the noodles or soup being bland were not warranted at all (perhaps I just prefer tastes on the lighter side?). Both my friend and I agreed that the food was very flavourful and delicious, while not overwhelming or coma inducing (important since we had to work afterwards). However, I would not recommend their rolls - these were dry and paled in comparison. 

Portions were relatively large for the price - warning, don't expect the sizes of cheaper uptown Vietnamese noodle places (though those are mostly carbs anyway). Speed of food arrival was not superb, but doable. Service was wonderful and decor was quite nice and clean. I thought it was really cute how they put Santa hats on the backs of the chairs, and all their waitstaff were in Christmas sweaters lol.

Overall, I was surprised when I walked inside because the restaurant was so cramped with tiny booths all over. The waiters had great coordination in making sure they didn't bump into one another as they were walking up and down the tiny aisles. Service was also very fast and efficient, I can imagine they turn over very quickly at this place. 

I ordered a Tuscan omelette (sundried tomatoes, asiago cheese, sauteed mushrooms) with home fries and rye toast. It came piping hot to the table and was delicious! The cheese was ooey gooey and there were large pieces of mushrooms, a very packed omelette with tons of flavour. Needed a touch of seasoning though but that's not a big deal, I prefer when the food is under salted to over salted. The homefries were the tiniest diced potatoes, crispy all the way round and sauteed with onions, the gave a HUGE portion of home fries with the omelette. Toast arrived in a cute little basket although the jam selection was mediocre (there was only strawberry).

I've eaten here twice this year, and both times I had ribs and sides.  Ribs are tasty and not drowning in sauce. Sides are also good...I've tried the mac-n-cheese, collard greens and fries.  Their cornbread is also tasty, but can be a bit dry.

I came here in June but the line was so long that we gave up after waiting 45 minutes and seeing that the line was not moving fast enough.  This time around, there was no line!!  4 of us got in and seated in about 10 minutes so that was good because I've been hearing a lot about this place and really wanted to see what it was all about.  Walking in, the setup is impressive with the LCD TV's surrounding the place making the walls change patterns every so often.  The counters stretch for what seems like miles with tons of food.

Some simple rules I follow when going to a buffet are:
1) Don't waste space on low value items like bread, salad, and drinks
2) Start with many items in small quantities to determine what you want to go back and get.
3) Seek out the most expensive but best tasting food in the place and load up on it to make it worth the money you paid (here, $22.99).

So, to follow my rules, I grabbed a plate and started on one end of the counter and worked my way through looking for things to try that I would go back and refill on after trying more things.  Once I tried many things, I stuck to the different shrimp offerings they had as each one was really good but I really liked the shrimp scampi but stayed light on the sauce because the cream definitely has a lot of calories.

My friends didn't really follow any rules and loaded up on stuff they said didn't taste good so they were passing full plates for the server to take away.  But, no need to worry, the scraps are picked up by the pig farms in North Las Vegas so it is indeed recycled.  However, the one thing they really enjoyed was the all you can drink wine and beer.  I don't know what kinds of wine they had but I know beer offerings consisted of PBR on tap as well as a raspberry cider that smelled delicious.

After stuffing ourselves with the main course, we save a little room for dessert.  One of my friends recommended the cookies, especially if they just came out the oven.  So, I walked over and loaded a plate for all of us which included said cookies which were warm!!  I brought the cookies, chocolate covered Rice Krispies, and pecan pie over and we enjoyed the calorie filled desserts guilt free.  After that, we all went back to get the ice cream, maybe it was gelato, and grubbed on that which was excellent.

When we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.

The decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. 

The server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.

The star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.

Starting out with the artichoke ""guac"" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.

Now the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. Top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.",2011-03-23 20:42:13

Accompanied by my pomegranate aranciata from Zia Pia (also in the market see review), I dug in with the best intentions to eat only half of the pizza. I failed miserably and ate it all. The crust was perfectly cooked and the perfect combination of soft, chewy and crispy. The mushrooms were perfectly seasoned and the truffle oil such depth to the flavor profile.

I'd never gone to a off the strip buffet before except Palms casino several years ago that was crap. 

Surprising the Orleans buffet was $20 with players card $19. The selection was pretty good. Mexican, American, Chinese, Italian and some sushi (one thing I won't touch at buffet)

This was my favorite the Chinese BBQ ribs was decent, the lo mein was really good and flavorful and of course the beef ribs tender done just right, I'd definitely go back again for that. I stuck with mainly beef ribs and the lo mein which was my favorite.  I'd stay away from the fried chicken no flavor and the prime rib it was dry and bit tough. Like I said I went there for mainly the beef ribs. I wasn't disappointed the guys wasn't skimping  he gave you as many as you wanted. 

Now for the desert I really liked their gelato it was really good. Overall for $20 I got my money's worth and lot better in my opinion then most strip casino buffets for less the half price for dinner.

Mainly with the players I pay $19 and go there to eat basically 3 really good things
1. BBQ beef ribs 
2. Cancun shrimp
2 gelato 
I load up on those three things.

The prime rib is a hit or miss sometimes it's pretty good and some times it's dry, best to look at it before getting. At dinner the carving station has beef ribs, prime rib and brisket, there are two carving stations the other one has ham, rotisserie chicken and lamb of leg.

The gentleman that sings here is very talented and the entire band is superb.  It's a great place to hangout with friends, have drinks and listen to the band.

First, when you walk past, you have no effing idea where the effing front door is. Is it on the west or the north side of the building? Why isn't there a sign? So that you don't walk around aimlessly as I did- it's on the north side of the building, facing the parking lot. There's also no host/hostess so you walk in and say ""hello?"" hoping someone answers. 

The parking lot right in front of the open windows of the dining room= every time someone pulls in at night with their lights on, it gets real bright and/or blinds you depending on where you're seated.

The decor? Damn. It looks like a mismatched set of rustic Alaska, Colorado and Tuscany. There weren't any barrels and wagon wheels in Italy the last time I was in Italy. There was also an undecorated fake Christmas tree in the center of the dining room.

The menu is all over as well. A few Italian classics alongside some Shrimp N Grits, Meatloaf and Fried Chicken. My head is spinning. Am I at Mr. Cacciatore's or am I at Marie Callender's?

The best thing that we tried were the Arancini or the rice balls. Blackened Tilapia was under-seasoned, carbonara was OK, beer selection was decent and well poured.

For a chain, this place still does a nice job of feeling high quality with subtle lighting and service that is truly top notch.  And for the prices charged, this is as it should be.  My only complaint is the hostess took a phone call that apparently involved a complicated reservation and we were left standing for several minutes without a greeting or other recognition.  A small point, but couldn't the caller have been put on hold till we were whisked off to our own reservation?

I got to try a couple of different cheese dips, broths and meats for the main course, and no less than 4 different types of chocolate fondue.  All came with plenty of accompanying items to drop into the fondues.  Vegetables were basic: broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  Apples and grapes were a nice twist.  With the chocolate we had fresh bananas and strawberries that were a bit less fresh.  We also had squares of poundcake and rice crispy treats.  They brought more of what was popular, as much as we asked for.  No one should suffer for a lack of food here.

My issue really centers around the meats.  We had an endless deal, so I got to try a lot of different things, but here's the way it generally works: you get a meat (sometimes pre-seasoned) and cook it in a broth or an oil.  That broth may have a plain base of might be flavored with another set of seasonings. Once done, you put your meat on a small plate that has room for up to 6 different dipping sauces, all with another set of seasonings.  That's up to 3 different seasonings in the finished project.  Muddled and confusing?  Yeah, to say the least.  Can you narrow it down?  Of course, but that's hardly discouraged at the time you order.

I like the concept, especially if you have a long time to sit down for dinner.  Our complete dinner lasted just over 3 hours.  It makes for great conversation with a small group.  However, when paying a minimum of $30 a head for dinner I'd like to think I'm paying for a chef's skill and training in producing good food.  Here you get all the basic building blocks and do the final work yourself.  I know it's novel, and some folks get excited for the change, but it's a off-putting to me.  If that's what you go for, however, this location will give you the full experience and make sure you are comfortable and served with care.  I'd easily go back for dessert, and maybe that alone.",2013-12-11 16:51:08

I recently dined at Anise Tapas with fellow yelpers. I arrived at the restaurant early and headed to the bar for a glass of wine. What a cozy little gem Anise Tapas is - the inside was dimly lit and flooded with scents of yummy spices. Rodem greeted me right after I took a seat at the bar and provided a drink menu. He cleared off the bar area and took my order (Cabernet) and engaged in friendly conversation, noting that he personally enjoyed the Cab I went with as it was a lighter Cab. The pour was quite gracious and it tasted delightful!

Once the rest of our party arrived we were seated at a table. Menus, waters, and sangria quickly made their way to our table. Rodem took care of us and we were impressed by how knowledgeable he was about the menu and took advantage of his tasty recommendations. Jameson the GM stopped by to welcome us as well which was a wonderful touch and only added to our enjoyable dining experience.

Where to start... The Red Sangria! Filled and garnished with various fresh fruit and maraschino cherries - it tasted heavenly. It went perfectly with our mini feast. 

We ordered a variety of Mediterranean salads which was one of my favorite parts of our meal. An assortment of pickled veggies, two types of cabbage salad, beat salad, marinated carrots and potatoes, corn salad, and Israeli salad (chopped cucumber and tomato in light vinaigrette). These small cold dishes are like the banchan (Korean side dishes) of the Mediterranean world! 

My absolute favorite was the Hummus Con Carne which is a must try. Delictable hummus surrounding a heaping pile of freshly made shawarma. I could eat this all day and it would never get old. Our salads came with amazing warm pita bread that we quickly demolished with the hummus. If I had to recommend one dish to anyone dining at Anise Tapas, I would definitely go with the hummus + shawarma!

We also tried some drunken avocado empanadas (bite size egg rolls filled with avocado) cigarro marroqui (small deep fried rolls with flavorful beef and lamb), beef and chicken skewers, paella, mashed potatoes, and grilled veggies. All were wonderfully seasoned and tasty all around.

At the end of our meal we were served hot water with fresh mint leaves (a delightful yet simple combo) and a delicious Pina Colada dessert to share. I was stuffed but has to try a bite of this fluffy cake layered with caramelized pineapple, shaved coconut, and whipped creamy goodness. The perfect end to our scrumptious meal.

My GIANT complaint about them is time management. I have never, ever, ever been taken in for my appointment on time or anywhere near my scheduled time. It's absolutely the most aggravating thing that I need to be there 10-15 minutes early to check in, but I've never been taken back for my appointment on time. Today they were an hour late calling me in. If I did that to my clients they would leave in a heartbeat.

Doctors don't typically run on time. 10 minutes late, 15, even 20 minutes I understand, but their normal is 40 minutes late. Today an hour. Sorry, but that's terrible! I know she's great at her job, and obviously in demand, but there must be a better way for them to book appointments which can be met closer to on time.

One of the waitresses walked past us four times, got the people in front and behind is, and didn't even say hello to us or be right with you. Service like this is really unacceptable. I would understand if it were busy, but the fact is that it wasn't. 

Food: now the only reason I would ever return is the food. It's so good...and that's what makes me want to love the place. We both had seitan wings which were cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. We also ordered a basket of fries, not worth it. They charge you 4 dollars for literally one potato worth of fries...and they weren't even good looking fries. They were soggy and cold. 

So just beware going here. Good food. Bad service.",2014-07-31 17:45:54

I've changed my mind since attending the Yelp Mixer on Wed. night.  I don't know if it was the friendly Yelpers who were there to talk to everyone or just the right mix of people gathering at one point in time but I had a great time.
The drinks were fabulous- I tried their pear concoction, their Strawberry Smash, and had a glass of champagne.  Champagne is my favorite drink of choice that goes without saying was good.  Both their pear concoction and Strawberry Smash had the right mix of alcohol and flavoring.  In fact, the Strawberry Smash is so delish, it's one of those drinks that you can have 5 of and think you are not getting drunk until you stand up and fall straight on your face!

         Plus it's bigger than their Baldwin location so you don't feel like you're cramped in there and sweating due to all the steam from the kitchen! 
they have lunch specials too!
so far I think they have the best pork belly
I like how they have a spot to put your bag under the seat so it's tucked out of the way.

CONS:
more expensive than most places
no veggie options

My husband stopped there for a sandwich the other day - for only ~$5, he got a turkey sandwich, chips, and a beverage. He said that the meat wasn't great quality, but that the freshly-baked bread was phenomenal. He told me that they had a great selection of dates and figs (my favorite appetizers to make are bacon-wrapped dates and figs with blue cheese, but I always have a hard time finding them, especially figs), so I went back the other day to see their selection for myself. 

The woman working greeted me with a smile, asked if I needed help, and offered me a sample of fresh watermelon (it was so juicy and sweet!). I told her I was looking for figs - unfortunately, they didn't have any fresh black ones, but they had some bagged white ones which I haven't been able to find at Fry's or Fresh & Easy. The price was pretty high ($4.50), but I didn't mind, since I knew they would be really fresh and that I would be supporting a family-run business and local growers. Plus, I already had the blue cheese and wanted to make my appetizer! 

The only drawback of my experience was the $1.00 transaction fee they charged for paying with debit card. They had a little disclaimer up about being a family-run establishment, and I do understand that the economy's bad, but the fee is really high, even compared to mom-and-pop restaurants in the area. Well, when all was said and done, the figs were delicious, and I am excited to go back and try some more of their produce and baked goods.",2008-06-08 19:11:35

They have several sittings available: lounge, tables, & bar.  Our server was so friendly, informative, & prompt!  As we were ordering, he dropped off complimentary popcorn, which was an awesome twist to complimentary items given at restaurants.

Pizza Popcorn:  Complimentary.  Tasty!  But do not eat too much because their burgers are huge!
Campfire S'mores Shake:  Their shake is 2 things: amazingly delicious & overly decorated!  But I love that they give you extra on the side.  To be honest, I picked out almost all of the toppings, except a few, & just drank the shake, which was so, so, so heavenly!  I highly recommend this flavor!

Was invited by a girl friend to try this place as my first Persian food experience, recommended by her as she has been a fan of this place, and just by one visit, i became a fan!

We enjoyed a shared plate of grilled lamb, chicken and veggie kabobs, complimented with two different kinds of rice, one with dates and beans, the other was with saffron if i remembered it correctly. The kabob was tasty with the unique Persian seasoning I suppose, though not overly salted or spiced, the flavor was more on the mild side, which was good for us :) We both liked the rice with dates in it, the little sweetness really balanced well with the food.

Q15bnr82y8HCDDvxqE5BQg,6z9ERfBvRF3HOXLNTNkdpg,rlFEKTaUgQqN4O9ow3LO9w,1,2,0,1,"My boyfriend's family and I went for dinner on Mother's Day. We made a reservation for 7:15. We were not actually sat until about 7:35, which we understood since it was a very busy day for the restaurant. That in itself was not really a problem, but in combination with the rest of the evening, it was kind of annoying...

Mother's Day features an abridged menu. Meh, the choices were blah. No entree salads, no burgers, only one pasta dish.

Once sat, the waitress came to take our drink orders right away, which were all waters and sodas. We did not actually receive our drinks for another 15 minutes, sans straws or lemons (which we asked for). Then she did not take our food orders for another 15 minutes after that. We had some bread, and someone came over to ask if we wanted more bread. We said yes, and we never ever received it. When we got our food, she asked me if I would like some tarter or cocktail sauce with my crabcakes. I said I would please like some tarter. I never received it. After waiting to eat for over five minutes, I decided to just eat them without the sauce. She never once came to check on our table or I would have politely reminded her. My boyfriend's sister, who was eating ribs, needed napkins. She only had one, and the waitress never gave her extra. If the waitress/server assistant had stopped by or even made herself available near the table, we would have asked for extra napkins. My boyfriend and his sister never received refills on their sodas even once, even though they asked multiple times.

Afterwards, we asked for some boxes. Some of the food was dropped on the floor, so we had to wait for the kitchen to make more to take home. It was nice to offer replacement food, but it meant we were waiting even longer for a dinner that had already taken 2 hours.

The waitress may have been conscious of the fact that she gave terrible service because when she dropped off the check for signature at the end of the meal, she said nothing. No acknowledgement or thank you whatsoever. We never once complained or acted unpleasant to the waitress or anyone else in the restaurant.

Seriously the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. And I recognize it was a busy day. I'm extremely patient about that, being in the service industry myself. But holy crap was that service horrible.

It was a disappointment. Before I begin I will say that the place is really cute. I really like the restaurant itself, the doors all open so in the Spring time (when it's warmer, it was quite cold tonight) it is probably great when there's a nice warm breeze. Ok so we walked in and weren't offered a table, for some reason the host asked if we would sit at the bar. We both thought that was because there were no seats so we said ok. Once we got to the bar we were like wait no we want a table... Not sure if that was a misunderstanding or if the bar was so empty he was trying to fill it with some younger people? Anyways... Waitress finally came over and we split the meatball platter which has 1 of each meatball and each sauce, perfect for 2 people on our first time here. Well the meatballs were not good... They were all dry, I dunked them in sauce just to choke them down. The flavor wasn't even there. And when it came to the Veggie meatball I almost gagged. It tasted nothing like a veggie burger, it was mushy and just inedible. I wanted so badly to spit it out, but I swallowed it with a huge gulp of water and even shoved extra sauce in my mouth. Gross! Even the sauces were lacking. The marinara was okay?! Nothing special though. We also shared a piece of pizza... Nothing impressive, and it was kinda burnt from being reheated. Not to mention our food came out about 5 minutes after ordering so I'm betting it was all premade and probably microwaved based on the dryness. I wouldn't ever return....

The atmosphere is dim and elegant, and the waiters/waitresses are always smiling and accommodating...big plus! Food took a while, but that's what appetizers are for:

Vegetable spring soup: Small bowl of soup (Came in a big plate) for $15...this was not worth it for me. It was too salty and did not taste like anything. The only plus would be the fresh, colorful veggies adorning the soup like colorful little gems...Visually appealing, but nothing I would order again.

Brussel sprout sides ($11): Yummmmm! You can definitely taste the maple syrup along with the chunks of bacon. I loved this dish!

Rib eye bone-in steak with diane sauce ($55): Holy moly! Very thick cut that was cooked and seasoned excellently! The diane sauce with mushrooms is salty though, so be sure to really eat it with the steak and not just on its own (I always do that to taste test!) The cheese balls or whatever it was in the little bowl was also a great variation aside from the usual potato. Super delicious, creamy, and soft! Definitely the star of the meal!

Comme Ca Burger ($18): Quite delicious...juicy and soft. It was truly an amazing burger, and the fries were paired with a creamy white sauce instead of the usual ketchup. Thick meat patty, layered with veggies and cheese...yum yum yum!

Braised short rib: EXTREMELY soft! Melts in your mouth with wonderful flavor wow! Seemed to be a smaller portion for the price, but it's perfect for the tummy of an average girl. 

Whiskey cocktail with a twist: It's really an old fashioned with ABSINTHE! Super strong, but boyfriend loved it! Goes down smooth with a hint of citrus.

Penicillin: I was recovering from a cold, so why not? Scotch with ginger, honey, and all things good for you...I really enjoyed the prominent ginger flavor, which was mellowed out by honey, followed by the smokey scotch aftertaste. It was very smooth and the flavors flowed together harmoniously...with a kick! 

Sam Collins: Light and citrusy...a lot lighter than I'd expect the average Collins drink to be, but maybe it's one of the sleeper drinks that taste so good that you don't know what hit you til you're on the floor!

Vanilla creme brulee: Wow! The custard portion was absolutely amazing, and the vanilla bean flavor really made it stand out. I've tried vanilla bean creme brulee before, but this tasted more custard-y/egg-y than usual. I thought it was amazing though. Check in to four-square to get this free dessert!

Frangelico Souffle: Light, fluffy, AMAZING. Creamy inside with just a touch of Frangelico to tickle your taste buds. This is a must-have for the souffle fans.

Overall, the meal was WOW. Experience was WOW. Wallet was Awww....I'd be back for a crazy fancy occasion, but in Vegas, there are so many other high end restaurants to try yeesh!

This is definitely a delicious restaurant and I really appreciate their consideration for local and sustainable food products, but it is a bit out of my price range.

It will be the go-to Saturday afternoon spot on warm days. If only they served beer!

I've tried the chili dog, house dog, and hawaiian dog. Plus the duck fat fries. Oh yes, the duck fat fries. The dogs are very tasty. You have the feeling you're eating quality beef - not some random, mysterious ""meat product."" My favorite hands down is the hawaiian dog. The dainty (yes, dainty) pineapple salsa and bacon bits make this a winner. Salty and sweet. The other dogs are great too. For those who like it simple go for the house dog. Also go for the house dog if you like to customize because you can add a lot of condiments to it if so desired.

The duck fat fries everyone talks about are most likely the best fries you will ever have. 

Service is fast and friendly. This is a fast food joint (with really great food), so don't expect wonders on the service front. But do expect friendly and sincere.",2012-03-08 15:17:26

I've heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.

The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.

Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.

Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!

P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.",2013-03-23 00:46:35

My husband and I are what I like to call fake-sushi fans, so we got a California Roll and a Spicy California Roll cuz we were feeling craaaazy that day. We also ordered the coconut shrimp. Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time, although the shrimp came out a couple minutes AFTER our sushi, and I would have preferred it before.

The sushi was well prepared and very tasty. The rolls stuck together just right and had good flavors. The sauce on the spicy rolls had just the right amount of heat. I know, there's not much to a California roll, but what can I say? We're sushi wimps. The coconut shrimp was nearly on par with Red Lobster's coconut shrimp (which are the best coconut shrimp out there) but a teensy bit dry. This was remedied by the yummy, spicy sauce on the side (strangely reminiscent of the sweet chili sauce McDonald's had out during the Olympics...)

All in all the service was great and we enjoyed our food, so we'll be back. The lunch hibachi prices are very reasonable so we hope to try that next time.",2010-05-28 15:24:25

I kept it simple with a couple chicken tacos and a few rolled steak tacos. Added some chips/salsa for good measure. They have a great little self-serve salsa bar with 5 different salsas that were all very good. Mild to Spicy, couple green, few red. 
The Tacos were huge! Piled with Guacamole and Pico, and some pretty good chicken(guessing thigh meat) The rolled steak tacos were pretty much a taquito from what I know. Service was great and friendly, location was nice and clean. There are a lot of options for Mexican food, this one is pretty solid.

cWbMR6AOtU2iYxFa86AKyg,iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,UPIYuRaZvknINOd1w8kqRQ,5,7,0,4,"Very good ramen.  I've been here about five times and I like the tonkotsu the best, which is pork bone broth.  But it is very filling.  Right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  It has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  This is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  My husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu/shoyu.  We shall see.  I have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  I can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  I'll just stick with that.

I highly recommend getting the takana mustard leaf in your ramen.  It is very, very flavorful.  Also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  If there isn't one on your table, just ask.  It's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and/or ginger.  Free addition to the ramen! The gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.

If the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  It's outside taped to a table by the door.  If they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.

It's true, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. But they are good with the beverage refills (Asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! Plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  Now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  But still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  You need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card.",2010-11-29 01:06:43

Ordered the grilled burger melt with wedge fries and Kacey had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Both were good and my burger was cooked just how I asked.

I was at a beer festival at Heritage Square last December. After a few hours of countless free beer tastings I was walking sideways and chatting up way too many strangers. My husband went on a mission to find something other than beer to fill my belly.

He comes back with a paper tray and said ""Here. Vegetarian quesadillas."" I took a bite. 'Angels singing' ... then the heat creeped up. I started devouring it. My friends came over and started tearing pieces off like the rude, ravenous hyenas they are. I turned and ran for cover behind an abandoned beer tent and finished off my quesadillas in a dark corner. Really it was reminiscent of that ""Nature "" show on PBS. I polished them off and then proceeded to lick my fingers. By the time my husband found me I was in a happy belly trance.

XbukaoilCxApeDLrw0qkZA,Jm5h-bDATqRMWs3VahkFPg,K1nwSvx14on6eVBbu5E9rA,4,0,0,0,"Location: This restaurant is situated in the busy Cineplex VIP Markham hot spot with access from outside and convenience of TONS of parking spots on the further side away from the theatre. During the Friday evenings and weekends, the parking lots may be more full ... but at least there is plenty of space to park above ground from this side of the plaza. 

Atmosphere: It has a similar feel to ""captain's boil"" where you can have some casual dining feel and fun dining experience due to all the messy scraps that you leave on the table and use of fingers to eat rather than utensils. The décor is nice in here... sort of like a ""Bar"" feel since there's TV monitors mounted on all the walls. It is also a big restaurant space with high ceilings, so it doesn't feel cramped and squished. Plentiful seating area for large or intimate groups. It was not too busy or hectic there when we came on a Friday evening. We made reservations, but the place wasn't packed, so didn't have to wait for our table. We did not feel rushed either since we sat there from 7-10:30pm and was not pushed to leave after we stopped ordering for awhile. 

Food: it has a similar but slightly larger menu option than Captain's boil. I ordered the Lobster nacho, slider burgers, pounds of clams and shrimps, okra, corn, Brussels sprouts, and beer flights. 

Lobster nacho - they were very generous with the amount of lobster meat they had!! We got a huge plate of nacho and tons of chunks of lobster meat was inside our dish. I didn't think it came out hot enough for the cheese to melt over it and didn't think it was a good combo b/c the nacho chips was all soggy and the flavours masked the lobster taste. 

Flavours of sauce for the pounds of seafood: THe Good catch sauce was a more mild taste than the popular captain's boil sauce. It has good flavours but dampened. This was quite delicious too because I didn't feel like I was overly thirsty after eating all those seafood and didn't feel like all the seafood flavours were masked by the sauce. 
Even the standard garlic and butter flavour was really delicious to go with the shrimp and clams. All the flavours we ordered didn't have any spice to it. I think the group of friends I went with prefer less spicy and if I had a choice next time, I'd probably ask for spicy flavour for their Good catch sauce (it shows a flame in the picture on the menu, but I really didn't get any spiciness from it)... STILL GOOD THOUGH!

FINAL: I would come here again because the service was really good. We had comfortable seating and never felt cramped or pushed for time. This is definitely a great place for a large group since it is definitely a much bigger restaurant than the Captain's boil locations.",2017-06-10 18:45:00

Crowd:  Must have been senior citizen night.  The place wreaked of despair.  Granted, it was Monday at 6pm.  I've heard the place gets a decent crowd on other nights.

Food:  We got 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich and they were all fairly awful.  The burgers were slightly overcooked, on big wonderbread buns fresh from the bag.  No lettuce or tomato.  The fries and tater tots were decent, though clearly not homemade.

Value:  Beers were very cheap during happy hour.  The food prices were about what you'd expect from a bar... maybe slightly higher.  The burgers were on special for $7.

Service:  Good.

Miscellaneous:  Beers were available in mini-pitchers, which I think is a nice touch.  The patio is dog friendly.

The first time I was here , my friend and I split the miso carbonara udon (their most popular dish) and takoyaki appetizer. While the takoyaki was delish , I wasn't a big fan of the miso carbonara udon at all. The broth was waaay too heavy and creamy. I didn't like the bacon on top either. This dish may be for some people , just not for me.

I decided to give Marugame another chance today since I've been having a really bad sore throat lately and I thought a bowl of hot soup and noodles would be the cure. I'm happy I tried out this place again because I liked the dish I ordered this time a lot more. I ordered the beef bukkake udon (I guess bukkake is that you pour your choice of either hot or chilled broth over cold noodles). I really love the broth in this one and the noodles were nice and thick as always. You can definitely taste that their noodles are handmade. I added a tempura soft boiled egg to mine and I highly recommend getting it as a side. I never had tempura egg before & it made my bowl much more satisfying. My friend had the hot dragon udon and I tried some of his -- it wasn't too intensely spicy. The spice definitely still added flavor to the udon. 

Probably my only drawback would be that this place is more expensive than I would to pay for a bowl of noodles.. :( Cheapest bowl would be 7$ but that's just the broth and udon .. An actual meal would be around 12-15$+. Decently sized portions though and the food comes out quick. It hits the spot when you're craving something savory. Their customer service is excellent. If you don't know what to order , they're more than willing to help give recommendations or explain the menu more.",2017-01-18 00:30:22

The only drawback here is that the pizza can be somewhat greasy.  I don't know if that's from the type of pepperoni they use or what, but I just blot it and pretend that reduces the amount of fat/calories I'm about to consume.  Pizza is good for you, right?",2012-10-16 02:56:41

If you're looking for a nice, clean-looking dudes haircut, bam. Electric Haven. Literally all of the barbers here are excellent and actually take pride in what they do. Pro tip: if you can, go during the day on a weekday. If you're trying to get a haircut on the weekend, get there as soon as they open. This place tends to fill up. Fear not, for they will provide you with beer (if you're of age) while you wait.

My wife had never been to The Porch before so the waitress was explaining that the food was mainly organic or natural food with the exception to their water. She said the water is not organic but it is locally sourced and 100% guaranteed to contain water molecules previously drank by Julius Caesar. Which sounds awesome; unless you grew up in the British education system. Which is why my wife asked me if Julius Caesar was a famous US President.
We started off with the cast iron cornbread and scallops. Both tasted good. We especially liked the honey butter with the cornbread. The scallops came with risotto and some type of nut in a spicy red sauce. I couldn't quite determine what was in the red sauce, but it tasted so good.
For the entrees, we had the Filet Mignon and Salmon. The filet was wrapped in bacon and perfectly cooked. I personally don't like broccoli rabe. I don't know why people like broccoli rabe so much. I always feel like I am getting cheated out of the good broccoli parts. I also didn't like the Violet Mustard sauce under the filet that much. I would really like to try a blue cheese sauce with some sort of alcohol in it. 
The salmon and all of the side dishes were delicious. The skin on the salmon was nice and crispy. I have never been able to get the salmon skin this crispy at home and don't know how hard it is for a trained chef, but most places don't nail this dish the way The Porch nailed this dish. This dish was put together and cooked so well, that there is nothing to improve on with this dish. If you like salmon, this is a wondrous dish.

This search led us out to CK's Tavern and Grill.

My first impression was that this place was nuts!  There was a rather raucous crowd on the patio watching the Suns game, and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  Inside wasn't much different, with most tables being occupied, but a couple were quickly cleared off to make room for us.  

We only sat down for a minute or so before our super efficient server came by.  I really like watching servers and seeing how they do their job, because frankly, there aren't very many good ones anymore.  This girl was awesome.  She didn't do one single thing without doing three others at the same time.  If she was bringing our drinks, she was also bringing the check for the table next to us and the drinks for the group on the other side.  She was awesome.  It actually seemed that most of the other servers did this too.  They must do some awesome training camps here or something.

Anyway, we each ordered a dozen wings, I got the honey and I tried the husband's raspberry chipotle.  We also got an order of beer fries just in case.  The fries were great and super crispy and we got a big fat side of ranch with it.  The wings were searingly hot and when I finally got to bite into them, they were pretty good.  The honey one's are literally just that, honey.  It was a nice alternative to the heavier stuff.  The raspberry chipotle sauce was pretty tasty, but not my favorite.  Meanwhile, after I ate most my wings, I decided I wanted more fries.  They were no longer hot, but surprisingly, they were still crispy and tasty.  Sweet.

Even the other dishes I tried that stayed away from traditional ""bar food"" such as pasta or enchiladas were pretty good (enchiladas better than pasta).

Anyway..I really really wanted to like this place.  SUPER cute and clean on the inside.  The staff was very friendly and was more than willing to answer any questions about the product.  

They had some samples for us to try, which was nice.  Tried a vanilla and thought it was yummy, so we decided to get a box of six to sample.  (Came with free milk--SCORE!)

Got the following flavors:

-Red Velvet (2)
-Midnight Madness
-Wedding cake (vanilla) (2)
-Texas Milk Chocolate

We left with a cute box and were very excited about our cupcakes.  Got to the hotel room and, like another yelper said, they are NOT good to transport.  The frosting was off of half of the cupcakes.

I also see what someone else said about the amount of frosting.  It was a ridiculous amount of frosting!  I will not fault them for that though, some people may have that much of a sweet tooth..and I can always just scrape off what I don't want.

Now, I'll stop rambling and get to the point:

the cupcakes were HORRIBLE, especially the red velvet.  Why would you put filling in a cupcake that already has a mountain of frosting?  Also, the filling was just sick and the cake did not taste like red velvet, but like a chocolate cake gone way, way wrong.

The vanilla was fine, Texas milk chocolate frosting was yummy, but the cake was dry and the midnight madness what just ok, but the frosting was way too sweet for my taste.

I consumed this huge salad and enjoyed every last bit.  The prices are pretty good, but I""m cheap, so anything over $5 is a little high for me. (Which is absurd, I really need to work on that mindset!)  I also had some sort of juice.  I can't remember what I got I just remember it being like the drink of the gods.  

As far as atmosphere, well, to be honest I thought I was back in the late '60's early 70's.  (Yep, I'm that old!!! But please don't tell anyone.)  Even though I'm an old hippie, it's hard for me to see young ones...now....in 2015.  Anyway, God bless 'em, right? The only thing I wish, I wish they were open at night and had alcoholic beverages. 

I loved this place.  The food is marvelous....check it out!!!",2015-04-17 01:52:13

I haven't always heard great things about the restaurant, so admittedly, I'd written it off as a place that wasn't worth my time or money. I'm glad to say that I was impressed with the selections and enjoyed my meal.

First impressions: Gorgeous space! I like how open the restaurant is and what a great decision with the beautiful Aria lobby next to it. The decor is has a touch of elegance and great colors and patterns. The large, heavy armchairs were comfortable and a nice change from the simple dining chairs.

Lobster Gazpacho: Chilled Spanish tomato soup, lobster meat, and cherries. The soup had a light and rounded flavor, however, I couldn't necessarily taste the lobster. If this wasn't a gazpacho, it would be really delicious served warm/hot.

Wild Mushroom Soup: Shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms; mushroom foie gras crouton. This was another first course option. The soup had a surprising depth of flavor that I wasn't expecting from mushrooms (not sure if the broth was just mushrooms). Delicious. Also, the mushroom foie gras crouton was really nice.

Salmon: Scottish Salmon, creamy whipped potato, and horseradish cream. The salmon was well-prepared and all of its accompaniments worked nicely with it. Solid salmon dish.

Rib Eye Steak: Roasted Chinese eggplant, french fries, and mushroom demi sauce. I ordered my ribeye ""rare plus"" and they delivered! It was absolutely beautiful. I wanted to sing a symphony. Besides the steak being perfect, the demi sauce was delicious and I loved the eggplant as well. The fries were great.

Flan de Turron: Almond creme custard, whipped cream, and turron. Okay, this dessert was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. I love custard, however, I don't always find flans always pleasant because the texture needs to be just right. This flan was perfection. The custard held its shape, but was extremely creamy and the flavors of the turron and the flan created this explosion! What a great way to end a meal!

I would like to come back and try some of their tapas, but the prices are a deterrent. For now, I would definitely recommend a meal here during RW.",2014-09-26 17:59:39

They have a crazy variety of toppings. As a vegetarian, I was psyched to see how many vegetarian combinations I could make. I ordered one with tomatoes, roasted broccoli, mushrooms, roasted potatoes, fresh garlic, banana peppers, and mozzarella cheese. On a rosemary crust.

I go to pick it up and it is almost ready. The kid behind the counter could have had a bit better of a personality. But he didn't. *shrug*

Once it is ready, I practically ran back to my office. The pizza looked decent. It tasted decent. Nothing spectacular though. And I was disappointed that the middle was a bit soggy.

They offer a wide range of teas and serve Intelligensia coffee which was a delightful surprise for this Chicago transplant. (Side note, if you've never had Intelligensia you must give it a try!).

I'm already looking forward to going back to explore some of the other options, but in my first visit I opted for the duck confit taco, brisket taco, and the hawaii dog. We also tried the fries. The fries weren't anything spectacular, but the two tacos were excellent! The only thing that I enjoyed at Union Pig & Chicken was the brisket, and the fact that you can get a healthy serving of that delicious brisket on a taco for such a good price alone is worth the visit.

The duck confit taco was also delicious, and I would definitely recommend.

My only complaint was the hot dog. While the flavors were excellent, the sweet soy and pineapple made the bun entirely too soggy. By the time I started eating the hot dog, the bottom of the bun looked like I just dipped my hot dog in water at a Nathan's hot dog eating contest. Fortunately, the flavors were good enough for me to power through the nastiness of a soggy hot dog bun. Next time, I'll be sure to eat the hot dog prior to the tacos.

Overall, I had a good experience at Station Street. The only downside was how the cook reacted to my wife's strange request for a duck confit taco...without the duck. I'm not sure why he was so reluctant to make it happen, but he eventually caved and made the taco. The meal was smooth sailing after that. Looking forward to the next visit!

I have been walking by this place, which is run by a nice chinese family, everyday on my way to work and it always made me chuckle.  It used to be a grilled cheese place (which was alright/blah) for about 2 weeks but the last I heard they got a conditional pass and then voila Slab Burger appeared, run by the same people.

The funny thing about this place is that they often are closed, with brown paper draped over the windows with a have a hand written sign in the window saying saying ""we ran out of beef"" or ""too many people bought our deal and we have no beef"".  It also appears to be open at random times, eg: some sundays it is closed all day while on other week nights it appears to be open abnormally late.

Friends got us a suite at Aria for our honeymoon. I had expectations, I guess, because the hotel is so well-marketed it suggests a certain grand promise. There turned out to be some discrepancy between reality & expectations.

At first we were awestruck. There was a remote control for the shutters, & the view of the Strip through our room's floor-to-ceiling windows was amazing. We found some gourmet chocolates that were reminiscent of London chocolates someone once gave me, with novel flavors like Dark Lime & the like. At the front desk, we were told that the mini bar items were sensor-controlled & will immediately charge the items to our room if we so much as move or lift them. Nice. James Bond stuff.

Our good impression of Aria, unfortunately, didn't last very long. I found some streaks of something dark in the toilet. I was going to inspect it, but figured that wasn't such a good idea. I told myself to just try not to stare at whatever it was.

The cleaning lady also kept entering our room without knocking. She did this about 4 times before we decided to double lock our door & avoid the awkwardness of the situation. Her repeated barging in scared us from even attempting anything, so we mostly just watched TV & eventually left the room to get some dinner. She didn't apologize.

Thinking back, I believe what she was trying to do was surreptitiously leave the bottle of congratulatory ginger ale in our room, which our friends got us. That or a menage. Maybe not. What I find unbelievable is that a hotel such as the grand Aria doesn't have a better system for doing this sort of thing. This lack of professionalism is usually expected of cheaper hotels & motels -- not a place such as Aria, which boasts of sensors & motorized drapes in their suites. Maybe they need to look into hiring some ninjas.

All in all, I must say I'm ambivalent about our stay at the hotel. I felt that the cons outweighed the pros, & I can't say I really enjoyed our non-honeymoon there.",2015-01-21 10:18:38

It was dark, gloomy, and far from elegant being the prices were more then your average restaurant. It needs a lot of gordon ramsays help to fix this restaurant. The service was average, if that. We started with the shirazi salad which contained diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, a little bit of EVOO, and a tremendous amount of lemon juice. It was very difficult to enjoy with the sour/tart aftertaste. Since this was our first time, we decided to order the chefs special platter. It contained chicken breast kebob, ground beef Kebob, and lamb Kebob. On top of that we also ordered the shish Kebob platter. This platter contained ""filet mignon"" Kebob (biggest lie, filet mignon isn't a thin strip of meat which is tough, unless they don't know how to cook it), another chicken breast Kebob and lamb Kebob. We ordered these platters for some variety, but the funny thing is, there was no variety. All of the meats were marinated in the same spices/sauce that in result, didn't allow us to differentiate between all of the different meats. I am a foody and I cook traditional shish Kebob at home, being that I am from the Middle East. This restaurant does not deserve to sell and advertise their horribly tasting Kebobs. Having said that, their basmati rice was my favorite dish. That is why I'm generous enough to give them two stars. In conclusion, 6 skewers of the same exact tasting meats, a huge portion of basmati rice, small bowl of salad, and two hot teas costed roughly 120 dollars with tip. Don't waste your time and gas.

Loco Cantina is the new spot located in the ""The Real Housewives of Las Vegas"" holy land, that is Town Square.

My fiancé and I went with the Queso Fundido, two tacos, and the steak fajitas. The Queso Fundido was actually really good, but what's not to love about, chorizo, peppers, pickled onions and what seemed like a vat of three melted cheeses. Seriously, I think the dish, the cheese came in, was about two inches deep and three inches wide. We never saw the bottom of the bowl. 

The Pastor and Barbacoa tacos were street style size and came on store bought tortillas, which is a huge bummer for me, but the Pastor meat was seasoned nicely and was very tender.  The Barbacoa was ok, it needed some spice and maybe salt, it was pretty much like eating plain meat with pickled veggies. Tortillas for any Mexican style restaurant should always be handmade or at the least locally made and sent over. The Steak Fajitas, like the Barbacoa, just needed more seasoning and salt, not much really going on here.

Chompie's has an overwhelmingly large menu and the service by many young college girls that they employ as waitresses is very eager and friendly. The food has always been good and the price is fair because of the overwhelming quantity of food that you receive.

We stopped in yesterday for lunch after visiting the ASU Art Museum for Family Fun Day. My wife had a large bowl of split pea soup, the kids split a chicken fingers and a chocolate-chip bagel and I had the Mitch's Brooklyner sandwich which is a three layer sandwich consisting of pastrami, corned beef and brisket on rye.

The other thing I love is that Chompie's is one of the few places that still sells salt bagels which are my favorite.

Now I'm not Jewish and I'm not from New York, so I'm sure that there are those who would disagree, but Chompie's is far and away the best option for a deli and bakery that I have found in the Valley.",2011-07-10 14:12:50

Kaya is a nice sushi bar to meet up after drinking or for a late night bite.  I love the decor in this place and the music is contemporary, so that's  nice.  What's missing from here is better service and food, in my opinion.

After reviewing their menu I found that their prices are reasonable, so we ordered tempura appetizer and 2 orders of their fried chicken.  While we waited we had some water, chatted for a few minutes, and then our tempura arrives.  Five dollars for 3 small shrimp?  REALLY???  I pay that much and I get at least 5 pieces or more everywhere else.  I guess it's because they are posh, or they think three is enough for two people.  I should've ordered one more, so that may have been my fault.

Twenty minutes later a plate comes out with lots of chicken, pickled radish mixed with carrots, and this shredded cabbage heap with ketchup and mayo latticed on top.  (see pic)  Interesting, but definitely NOT korean fried chicken.  I mean, technically it is because of where we bought it, but in terms of how it was prepared and how it came out, definitely not.

The chicken was fried TO DEATH--leather is easier to chew.  The crust is very crispy, but it won't save the leather within.  I love picked radish, but there's was definitely frozen and thawed somehow before serving it to me, because there was a ton of ice left in my dish mixed in with the radish.  Freaky.  I've never seen a restaurant use frozen daikon, or maybe there the first to get caught.  Either way it made it somewhat a challenge to eat because the radish was soggy to chew, which is honestly gross.

The salad was basically--when you mix the ketchup and mayo--thousand island dressing on salad, but I don't dig ice in my cabbage, either.

We tried their sushi, which was decent, such as their cali roll, but their tuna looked freakishly pink, so I assume they purchased the dyed fish.  you know, the ones dyed on purpose to not lose color when degrading?  it's an honest business, but it kills the flavor of the fish.

Overall I think if you want AYCE sushi, stick to that when coming here, but in terms of anything else on the menu, I'd be weary.  With my fried chicken experience on top of the sushi and small appetizer, I left sad.  I hate leaving full but sad.

""Not the same but good enough"" were his exact words comparing it to Daikokuya.  Monta Ramen is literally in the midst of other small Asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  I honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  Parking was, for one, a bit limited.  

I walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  It had the same feel of Daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  There were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  I was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so I stood up and told the lady I would wait for a table instead.  The wait staff are Japanese, but noticed 2 Latinos working behind the bar/kitchen with an Asian guy.  Red flag I thought but then again I saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications honoring and awarding Monta as the Best or one of the Best in Las Vegas.   

I sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   The bowls are smaller, I noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  I had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and green onions.  Mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  I come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  Really? for an egg? 

The broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  The wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  Their chasu, however, is to die for!  It's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  For that alone, I will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  For their ramen soups?  I might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.

 I'm someone who usually avoids prepared foods because majority of them don't even come close to tasting good (unless you already fucked up your taste buds with all that chemical laced food) and they friggin' are chalked up with so much things we don't need but the assholes in control of the food industry has pushed it upon the masses and slowly killing everyone. I try to avoid as much as I can especially in the place where I hold the most control in quality- what I'm cooking at home.  Here, I can feel good about some of the prepped foods being a bit better and they actually are pretty good to do on one of those lazy, long weekdays that I just want food without the work of handmaking everything the way I normally do. I also love their wide selection of premade gourmet salads, I usually grab a few to eat at work. For the working family or for people who don't like/""can't"" cook, this is a great place to get prepped food or simple meal ideas with their variety of pre-made pasta sauces, curry sauces, marinated/stuffed meats, etc. 

Their freshfrozen fish is actually pretty good quality and really reasonable. I grab the mahi mahi and tuna steaks to store for those days where I just don't know what to make. Fish+rice+ simple veggies= good healthy meal fast!

Cookies, chocolates, nuts and fruits and chips selection is pretty wide in variety and I try not to read any of them and want any because knowing my BF he will pick up enough junk for the both of us. Haha. His weakness is the shortbread butter cookies with fruit jam and we never leave TJ's without one for him. 

Wine here is a great deal. I cook with wine more than I drink so I at least don't feel bad buying a few here at a decent price than pouring an expensive drinking wine into a sauce base. Beers is a small selection but I like that they either let you buy anything in a pack or per bottle.

Very attentive, personable, and always has great suggestions without being salesy, most importantly he is knowledgable. I've dealt  a couple of times with Veleda English, on the phone and in person and she leaves a lot to be desired. Younger gentleman there that's new, I think he used to be one of the drop off drivers, never dealt business with him so I can't recommend. 

Point is they do have reasonable prices (for a dealership), lots of amenities, and make sure you see Todd or you will regret that you stopped in.",2015-01-20 22:33:08

The dumplings were probably the highlight of both meals and just OK. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. 

The cocktails are serviceable, but definitely not the best in town.  

The star of the show should be the ramen, but both times it fell flat.  I had the tonkatsu on my first visit, and compared to other ramen the broth seemed a little thin and a bit too salty.  The shoyu ramen fared better, but still lacked the richness I would expect out of a ramen restaurant.  I thought the noodles were strange, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Perhaps a little too big and chewy.

It seems that the One Eyed Dog is no longer and now the location is Clancy's Pub. The temporary sign does have a shamrock logo (which we thought may have indicated it was now an Irish bar - nope) and also reads Pizza & Grill.

While the decor is still similar and many of the staff have been retained the big change that disappointed us was a completely new menu. Gone are the English specialties such as shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, bangers beans & chips, Scotch eggs, etc. They've even done away with their excellent fish and chips preparation. To be fair, we didn't try the new twist. One of the big draws for us last visit was an interesting English menu with great execution.

Now the menu is quite bland and the execution wasn't great either.  Our table had a BLT (not bad), a burger and a couple of wraps. Nothing stood out. Nothing super interesting. No raves for any of the food. The menu now consists of burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps, pizza, etc. The one thing that comes to mind is that they have tater tots. 

They've also eliminated some of the interesting beers (Boddington's, etc.) that were also a draw for us.

The staff were nice as before but we probably won't be back.

While some of it may be due to the change and the newness of the menu, I'd rather hit Zipp's next door whose execution of a similar menu is far better (in my opinion).

This Pink Box, in reality, is a Taiwanese Bakery owned by same people that own Rose Tea. It clearly has an awesome name and awesome decor too. It feels like a little square pink box inside. Like you are inside an Xmas present from VS Pink, perhaps. 

Some of the servers are super friendly, although one in particular wasn't. One of the really friendly ones was a beautiful girl from Albania, talking to her was fun. 

I find their baked goods to be somewhat average, made in advance and pre-packaged, and their Bubble Tea reminds me of the one over at the similarly-owned Rose Tea Cafe. I got the black milk tea, and it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as good as the one across the street at Sumi's Cakery. The tapioca balls were kind of squidgy, which I didn't really appreciate.

Then on a separate occasion I waited 20 minutes for a deli sandwich ...as I watched several people walk up and take their sandwiches home I finally had to ask where mine was. I was told "" some asshole took yours""- and then he slammed my sandwich down on the counter in front of me. Well excuse me, last I saw you had to hand the sandwich to that ""asshole"" -so you actually just gave my sandwich to the wrong person. I was honestly stunned by the response.

Sunday night is 'industry night' and after 8:30 there are lots of specials to choose from.  I went with a group tonight and we shared edamame and a variety of rolls, including california, yellowtail, spicy tuna, tootsy maki, salmon nigiri, and more.  I also enjoy the seaweed salad and miso soup at Ra... there is something for everyone from sushi connoisseurs to those that won't touch anything raw.

This location will allow you to bring your dog as long as it's outside of the fence.  Great patio overlooking the Kierland parking lot ;) In summary, I think it's above average sushi for a chain restaurant - don't go in with the highest expectations and you'll be satisfied!

Needless to say, I didn't end up staying the night here because I wasn't in the mood to drive to the strip that night. However, I did drive over to the hotel at 7am, so i had until 12pm to checkout. I had my boyfriend meet me there, so we could have breakfast before he went to work at 8am, but that didn't end up happening because we passed out on the comfy bed. It must've been very comfortable because we ended up sleeping through our phone alarms and waking up at 8:15am (15 minutes after he was suppose to be at work). He actually woke up right before me and said, ""okay, I gotta get ready"" and I said, ""well you better hurry, it's 8:15."" Then he literally jumped out of the bed like a kangaroo on crack and was ready within 30 seconds. 

After he ran out of the room, I went back to sleep for about an hour on the marshmallow-like bed. I really like that the curtain covers up the entire window because it keeps the room cool and it almost looks like nighttime when the whole thing is blocked off. 

When I woke up around 9:30, I decided to relax and take a bath in the awesome tub. I was in the tub for about 5 minutes and I was completely under the water when I heard a knock at the door. Since my whole head was underwater, I wasn't sure if it was actually at my door, so I sat up and listened. That's when I heard another knock at the door, but this time the door was unlocked and OPENED at the same time as the knock! WTF! I didn't want to jump out of the bathtub and run over to the door all naked, so I just kind of hid myself behind the wall of the bathtub and yelled, I'M IN HERE!"" and the lady was like, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I'll come back later"" and she closed the door behind her.  I understand that I didn't have the ""do not disturb"" sign up, but still, that doesn't mean I should be busted in on more than TWO HOURS before checkout time.

I was pretty pissed after the incident, so I just got all of my stuff together and headed out after trying to checkout through the tv, which was not working at the time. 

To sum it all up, I've definitely experienced better, which is why I'm giving Aria 2 stars. The only things I really liked about this place were the bed and the beautiful view from the hotel room. Other than that, the ambiance and decor of the place is pretty ""blah,"" the towels are like worn out sandpaper, the tv checkout service wasn't even working, and I was almost violated by a housekeeper.",2011-04-28 09:18:22

I didn't pay a lot of attention to all the buzz that other reviewers were  talking about, but I have to say Fanny Chadwick did a good job on its design and decor, because that's what caught me! I love checking out trendy diners/cafe around T.O.

From their menu, you can tell they specialize in making everything in-house...their home made apple spice sausage, smoked fish and smoked brisket... 

We ordered a smoke fish benny with salad and a 'farm egg with sausage, toast and potato. 
Smoke Fish Benny - I really liked their hollandaise sauce, it was just right, not too thick and rich. Sometimes it's just too rich with the poach egg, and could really stuff you for the rest of the day. The salad is also one of the best too, really fresh mixed green with their homemade salad dressing (I believe it is made of dijon mustard and some vingerette and honey...it was very refreshing! 
Farm egg with sausage - although it looks very simple, but the egg was so perfectly cooked! This is so hard to find! the potato was just okay..nothing too special. I do have to say their homemade ketchup/tomato sauce was pretty good.

1. Too Americanized. Although decor is very nice and seemingly authentic, there is a touch of fakeness and not authenticity about it all; The waitresses are always recomending the more ""Americanized"" dishes and knew very little of the more traditional Mediterranean dishes the few times that I dined here. 

2. They started offering pasta! dishes!!! What travesty offering run of the mill spaghetti in a Hookah lounge and Mideterranean place, let's focus on the cuisine at hand!!!

3. Kataifi, my favorite desert is gone!!!

I still enjoyed my Fatoush salad and Baklava desert, and teas were certainly good, but food is still far from what it is at the Maryland location.

The patio outside was deserted so we had our pick of seats.  Our food order came up pretty quickly.  

I immediately attacked the poutine and it was amazing.  Squeaky curds, delicious gravy and sweet potato fries for a change.  

Truly, the best poutine I have had in Toronto, better than Poutinis and Smoke's combined!  Hailing from Northern Ontario, poutine was an essential food group, so I know good poutine.  

The bison burger was good - very thick with toppings.  It tasted a bit gamey-er that I'm use to but probably because the meat is fresh and I've only had frozen bison in the past.  They also gave us a free order of regular fries as they had made them by mistake.  A nice touch.

It took me some time to finally try this place. For one, I didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and I had a hard time finding it. It is inside of a plaza where I had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.

My friends that have tried Monta beforehand liked it enough where I had some expectations for this place. It didn't have to be rated G-A-F, but it had to be tasty. The first time I came, I just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and I must say, I was one happy guy afterwards. The noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. The broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. Needless to say, I finished the whole bowl, soup and all! I was really happy. 

The next few times I came, I started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. I added more noodles the next few times, got some of their fried rice, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where I was happy! Their fried rice was pretty tasty. The kimchi fried rice may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. Adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. 

If you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, I highly recommend Monta. The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. People get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits?

Served with house special sauce. Delicious!! The translucent rice paper was softened and easy to eat and the filling was flavorful and most importantly, crunchy! I loved the textures, especially from the crispy spring roll, and the fresh vegetables. The sauce is really wonderful, too. I love peanut sauces and this one is like peanut sauce meets sweet and sour.

Banh Khot ($8.95): Translated as ""Luna Rice Cake"" on the menu. Mini rice pancakes with steamed shrimp, accompanied by herbs and fresh and pickled vegetables. Plus, fish sauce for dipping. These cakes are supposedly tiny versions of their crepe-like pancakes and they definitely have the feel of crepes with more of an egg flavor. Each ""cup"" could have done with more than just half a shrimp, but otherwise, it's a very tasty dish. I enjoyed topping each cup with all the fresh herbs and vegetables, then dipping them into the fish sauce.

Com Tam Bi, Cha, Tau Hu Ky, Tom, Suon Nuong ($13.95): Combination broken rice with pork chop, egg loaf, shredded pork, grilled shrimp, fried shrimp paste in tofu skin, and pickled vegetables. You can choose either Pork Chop (22a) or Grilled Chop (22b) with this combination. I asked for the recommendation of the pork chop and I was very pleased with it. The pork was flavorful and succulent. The egg loaf was similar to a frittata though it wasn't anything special or particularly necessary to the platter. I felt the same way about the shredded pork. The grilled shrimp and fried shrimp paste were both lovely. I'm not sure if I'd like the shrimp paste by itself, but I really enjoyed it wrapped in tofu skin and fried. Overall, I liked this dish, but I'd prefer the toppings on vermicelli bowls (without the vermicelli).

I enjoyed my meal, but the only standout dish was really the Nem Nuong Cuon. The rolls were delicious and I could eat several of them in a sitting! The other dishes, though good, aren't enticing enough to return, but there are so many other dishes to try. Also, I'll definitely look into getting a vermicelli bowl with rice instead.",2016-01-19 08:26:57

Food: 
Great selection of snacks, drinks and desserts.  We tried the Hong Kong style rice roll, mango sago and stewed egg with milk/ginger.  Taste was good and portions are pretty generous.  The Hong Style rice roll could be improved if the pieces weren't chopped out so small so that you can chew and enjoy the texture more.  The mango sago was generous with the amount of mango pieces but overall flavour could be intensified.  The stewed egg with milk/ginger was the best dish I tried.

I believe the tickets to get in are around $12 each, but every time I have gone, I have not paid one penny to get in.  This is because the Improv gives away free tickets ALL the time.  Hey, they've got to keep the room full of laughers.  If you fill out the little form that they place on all the tables, they will call you eventually, guaranteed.  They usually offer you eight free tickets, which you can share with your friends.

They ask you to arrive at the club 45 minutes prior to showtime.  This is so a) you can spend money in the bar drinking, b) they can get everyone seated for the show, and c) they can take your food and drink order.  You do not have a choice in where you sit.  You sit where you are told and if you move, a manager will escort you back to your original seat.  Trust me, don't move or you'll only end up being embarrassed, no matter how persistent you are.  Just make sure they don't seat you by the stage where the national acts will surely make an ass out of you.

The food is very good and reasonably priced.  The servers bring the food during the show in the dark.  However, there are candles on each table which provide enough light to see if your food is cooked all the way.

There are always three acts: the opener, which is someone who works at the club for a while, the follow-up act, and then the headliner.  The headliners are usually the funniest, but not always.  The headliners are usually in a national rotation and most likely, you've seen them on TV before.  

I gave this place a pricey $$$ tag because you have to pay to park ($3.00), most likely, you'll have a beer or two while waiting to get in the theater area ($3.00/ea), if you didn't get free tickets, you have to buy tickets $12/ea, and finally, you will most likely buy dinner while in the club $16/approx w/ tip.  By my score, that's gonna run ya $35 - $45 per person with drinks included.

I came back again to visit after a few months and hoped the hype would have settled down but it didn't. Despite the same long waiting time, I was glad to see that they were willing to compensate their customers by offering a choice of free milk pudding or a free drink under $4.99 if the waiting exceeded over 45 minutes. However, this special offer was only written on the waiting ticket in fine print in Chinese. So if you don't know how to read Chinese, you probably wouldn't know unless the servers tell you (but now you do!). You also get 10% discount if you pay cash :)

ENVIRONMENT: 4/5 
The place is pretty big, hip and modern with large art mural of Taipei's famous JiuFen town. Certainly can accommodate small party of two to large groups. 

FOOD: 4/5 
Their menu was massive with a separate menu for desserts and drinks. They offered a good variety of Asian items (mainly Taiwanese and Japanese), pastas, rice and hot pots. I love getting their mini hot pots, mainly because there were plenty different flavours/options to choose from and easy to share. My favourite was the Milk & Cheese Seafood hot pot, wonderful broth and plenty of seafood. The Lamb with Pickled Cabbage hot pot was very appetizing as well. I was also very excited to see that they offered Taiwanese style oyster omelets as not a lot of places served them. Popcorn chicken was crispy, just a bit more batter than meat but I'd still recommend it. So far, I hadn't been disappointed in their food yet.

DESSERT: 3/5 I tried their cheese tarts but but the shell was a bit hard and the cheese texture wasn't the creamy, molten lava type that I liked. I was very surprised to see that they had Japanese Taiyaki in their menu but it cost $11 for a piece. I thought it was overpriced. The milk pudding was alright as it was free for me at the time but I probably wouldn't order them here. Overall, I felt that their desserts were more on the pricey side.

She totally skipped over me and when I asked ""where's mine"" I got a total fucking attitude. She told me I never asked for one and I explained I'm not a mind reader and she should have offered. She didn't offer to get more, she didn't apologize, whatever. A couple minutes later the couple two stools down from me said this is a great calendar and I replied that I wouldn't know.

I'm not an ASU student and I've only had 1/2 beer at this point. 

I called for a manager and told him I have 1/2 a beer left, I'm not paying for it, I'm leaving and never coming back, and I'm going to tell everyone I know about how rude your bartender is.

So I was driving down Scottsdale/Rural and saw Dutch Bros on my left, with a medium-long drive-thru line. Having heard good things about this place before, I decided to give it a try. 

Pulled into the line and a girl with a super-bubbly personality hopped over to my driver side window to take my order. I mentioned that I had never been before, which is why I wasn't sure what to order, so she helped me choose something (medium, three-shot, sugar-free mocha vanilla latte, I believe it was). Before I knew it, it was my turn at the window to pay. The two guys working the window did the following:

1. Said they understand that I have never been before and welcomed me with a friendly handshake and name introduction.

2. Noticed Ellie, my Jack Russell Terrier, in the back seat and said said that they had something to give my friend (it was a dog treat).

3. Said they had a gift for me, and pulled out a Dutch Bros stamp card with 9 out of the 10 spaces stamped... so I was able come back again for my ""tenth"" time and enjoy a drink on them.

Diamond Market.. named for the Diamond (the former name for Market Square) and the market that used to be here, a long time ago... is a pretty solid place to grab lunch on a workday. The inside gets loud during the lunch rush, but I always enjoy the food... well almost always. 

My only complain is they are among those who have followed this new trend of asking ""pink or no pink"" when you order a burger. I always say ""Pink"" even though I like my burgers medium because I ordered ""no pink"" once and it came VERY well done. I cannot argue with the fact that there was ""no pink"" in the burger, so they were not wrong. Otherwise, I've never had a bad meal here. 

The burgers are juicy, and smothered with toppings. The menu has a good array of options without giving so many that one gets overwhelmed.

It's mostly service driven so maybe it was just a bad night or a bad waiter.  I had Toast bookmarked on Yelp for months, so when I saw they were doing groupon, I purchased it and was excited to put it to use.

I checked out the menu online and was thrilled to see they had a great wine list and that I could do a wine flight to sample a few (or maybe A LOT of wine). When we arrived here and were seated, there were no wine flights on the menu.  I asked the waiter and his response was oh, we hardly ever update the website.   We don't do wine flights any more.  Geez, thanks for backing up what you advertise.  Amusingly enough, less than a week after we dined there, the website has been updated and there are no longer wine flights listed.

We started with the Cheese Board.  Everything on it was great but when it was brought to the table (not by our server), no one walked through the cheeses with us and no one brought us appetizer plates.   When our waiter checked on us, I had to ask for information on the cheeses and for plates.  

My meal was decent.  I opted for the Icelandic Redfish with sweet potato and corn succotash and tarragon butter.  It was good but a little too much butter for me.   It was more like a butter gravy on the succotash than a taste of butter.   

Lastly, the service was just slow.  We waited awhile for anyone to get to our table, for drinks, for dinner, for the dessert menu and the check.  It was a Friday evening and I heard them tell several tables how busy the kitchen was.   I understand that but it's Friday night.   It's not as if you got a suprise crowd on a Tuesday at 3 PM.   And besides, even if the kitchen and bar are slow, the waiter could be attentive at least and provide updates.  I don't mind paying for good food and good service but on my visit, the food was ok and the service was really poor.  It didn't make for a great experience.",2014-07-31 15:35:27

People - once you shop here, you will never buy spices at a Giant Eagle again.  Penzeys spices are:

1. Fresher.
2. Cheaper.
3. Unique-r.

Their spices haven't been chilling out in a storeroom for weeks before you buy them.  The prices are WAAAAAY more fair - you easily pay twice or three times as much at another grocery store, for more poor quality.

Also - their selection is unparalleled.  Got a recipe with some bizarro spices in it?  Where (you ask) will I find annatto seed?  herbes de provence?  fenugreek?  You will find it at Penzeys.

They also have great spice blends - just used their original Taco Seasoning last night to make enchiladas, and they had such a beautiful, authentic flavor.

Overall the vibe and flow was very easygoing. Negatives; we did separate food tickets and asked if our sample mac and cheese muffins could come out first. We had ordered the beer butt chicken and were told there would be an hour wait, no problem since we would be snacking on the muffins while we waited. The cashier said this was how to do it, separate tickets. Nope, all the food arrived at once. We had one muffin each (2) and decided to have the chicken, corn and potatoes because they were getting cold. We loved the chicken, I'll bring my own chicken shears next time because cutting it with a serrated steak knife is silly. We pushed the ten muffins aside intending to get a to-go box.

It's really close to our house but unfortunately the food is just ok, and especially with the price, not really worth the time or expense. We said this the first time we went a year ago and thought maybe it changed.
We wanted to try the tomahawk - 32oz for $120. They took our order and 15 minutes later can to tell us they were out. We would have left if it had been earlier - but what type of steak restaurant doesn't have rib eye which is what the tomahawk is with a bone.
We ended up ordering the 42oz T-bone. We asked for it medium rare. We ate it and didn't complain. It was okay. It was $120 for okay.
We did tell them they over cooked it, and the server checked the meat with a flashlight and offered something else but we declined. We were done and we didn't ask for any discount etc. we just knew we weren't going back. 
The steakhouse salad for $12 was big enough to split and it was good. They have a good breadbasket. And at the end they give you tiny chocolates and key lime tarts.

This restaurant goes above and beyond to serve some of the best Thai cuisine that I've had in town, especially this side of town that's ridden by fast food joints.

If you walk in here and the place is empty, don't sweat and turn around to the exit. The majority of customers order out or come in to pick up their take out orders. Take a seat and start ordering.

Curry Takoyaki: This is a tasty spin on Japanese octopus balls with just a thin drizzle of curry sauce. 

Thai Papaya Salad: Shredded papaya salad with romaine lettuce and tomato wedges. Refreshing and flavorful especially with the inclusion of shrimp - I believe this might be an additional cost.

Panang Cury (sautéed tofu): LOVE this, and it's perfect at a spicy level seven. This is chock-full of soft, sautéed tofu and green and red bell peppers. The curry is exceptionally flavorful.

(Note that all entrees come with rice, and you do have the option to sub out the white rice with brown rice for an additional cost.)

The staff here does a great job ensuring that customers are pleased with their meal and experience. They're always coming around to tables to make sure that beverages receive refills and to clear up plates.

Got here at 6PM on Thursday, the NY Deli theme night, and spent $20 for two using a BOGO coupon and the cardholder's discount. We were able to move to the register pretty quick, but after that it was a good 15 minutes til we were actually seated at a table.

Bonus stars for being able to order the old fashioned Dr. Brown's old fashioned sodas- BF inhaled the black cherry and the cream soda flavors!

NY Deli theme night includes options like lox and capers (though no bagels to put it on, which was odd given the amount of cream cheese they had nearby), pastrami and corned beef (surprisingly NOT good considering they were highlighted), matzo ball soup (better than expected!), cabbage rolls and laktkas. 
Other tasty options included the short ribs, Asian chicken wings and bbq ribs, Greek salad with tons of feta cheese, and fairly decent prime rib- considering their Friday special advertises it as a featured entrée, I didn't expect to see it on other nights.

Like I said, service was slow to get seated, but the food was better quality than I'm used to getting at a buffet- you won't have a mile of different food options, but here they do seem like the focus on doing less dishes to a higher standard rather than putting out a bunch of mediocre dishes just to have ""variety"".

Speaking of the Bubbly, that's exactly how the night started.  I was with a group for an annual holiday dinner, so several of us enjoyed a delicious celebratory glass, followed by a bottle of Cabernet off of their fabulous wine list.  Seriously, great selection at various price points, so it's worth it to get a bottle.

The food was amazing.  I had the rigatoni to start, but tried the Tagliatelle and Gnocchi that a few others ordered for their main course.  They don't indicate it on the menu, but you can get the pasta in a half or full portion.  Half was more than enough as a shared starter if you just want a small amount.  Good luck choosing between the three pastas, because they were all amazing.  The star of the show for me was the Duck, which was so incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly!  I only wish I could make duck as good as Barrington's.  The only regret I have was not saving room for dessert.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to come back!

The decor ie extremely dark and romantic-- like a sensual bedroom. So it's the sort of place I like to come to for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend. But that doesn't stop my BFF and I from ordering the Lover's Thali on occasion.

Their thali meals are great value. For either 2 or 4 persons you can choose from several meat and vegetarian dishes for a very reasonable price. The first time I was here, everything was excellent. Food, service etc. The second and third times the meat in all the curries was so dry I could have rubbed it between my palms and made sawdust.

I have to say that it is probably my favorite burger restaurant in the state. I've been to most of the other popular and trendy places but Zin keeps on living up to the best!

On our latest visit we were seated in the heated patio. The wait for the restaurant was nearly 30 mins or seating right away on the patio. It was chilly out so I was happy for the heat lamps! Not bad at all with them on. 

My wife and I decided to share this time.   It was hard to do, but since its the new year, I wanted to start things right in my whole diet and exercise plan.  Cutting calories in half is a good start right?  We had the ringer with avocado added.  All I can say was wow. Excellent! In the past we have had the Kobe burger with pineapple which was a special back then, and we have ordered that numerous times.  It's been almost a year since I tried that one though. We also shared the truffle fries which were great. 

All in all, it was just the right amount of food for us. I would say this is our fifth time here and I never had a bad experience hence my 5 star review. I think the Ringer is my new all time favorite so I'm sure we will be back here soon for it again!!",2013-01-04 08:43:40

Along with their handmade sundaes and shakes, there's also pints of your favorite ice cream you can take to go, or get yourself an ice cream cake. 

For two birthdays in a row for my boyfriend, this place has saved my ass when other ice cream shops have failed me with cakes. This location in particular helped me out this past July in quickly personalizing a cake for me (cute ninja turtle drawings and all) and really putting effort in helping me out while other places just shrug their shoulders at an order they had 2 weeks to not screw up on(but did).

We walked in late the other night and the hostess looked incredibly confused that we wanted to be seated at a table instead of the bar. But apparently she wasn't able to seat us?!?

Hopped on two stools at the bar and ordered glasses of water. Food was simple: Parmesan truffle fries with bacon on the side, a Neon Dion roll for the Mr, and for me, the green monster burger with their veggie burger instead of beef.

The fries were impressive. As in...we ate them all unapologetically.

It was probably my third time ordering the green monster with a veggie burger, and this time I asked for the bun on the side. Didn't want to miss out on even a forkful of the action. As a side, I went with the cucumbers. 

Let's just say that I looked like a quasi-homeless person scooping burger and cucumber into my face with reckless abandon. It's just so good.

This was also my 1st time at the restaurant and I really didn't know what to expect.  I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday morning. She was seated first, since she was a bit early, and I arrived shortly after.  We we were seated on the side of the restaurant, away from the main dining room.  I found this strange, but my friend mentioned that it was very hot in the restaurant when she walked in, and the hostess recommended sitting over there because it was cooler (I didn't notice the heat).

First of all, I love the decor and vibe of this place.  It's very ""shabby chic."" There are lots of little knick knacks displayed throughout the restaurant and cute art on the walls.

The tables are very close to each other. Luckily, there was nobody seated next to us, so this wasn't an issue.  But I could see it being awkward if it were a busy night.

I was torn between ordering the bottomless mimosas ($20) or the ""create your own"" bloody marys ($22). Once I decided on the bloodys, the server actually talked me out of it - saying that they were much smaller than just ordering them individually, and I would have to do all the work (obviously). I wish I would've just ordered this, but our server convinced me that the bartender makes an awesome bloddy mary (I am very picky about them).  I ended up disappointed. There was just something ""off"" about the drink - it had very little flavor, and although I asked for it to be spicy and also made with horseradish, it wasn't spicy enough and I had the server bring me extra horseradish. Maybe because it was fresh horseradish? I don't know. For my 2nd drink, I ordered the blood orange mimosa, which was very good. 

For food, we started out with the monkey bread. It was a large portion, definitely enough to share ($9). We didn't come close to eating it all! I am not really a sweets person, so I only had a couple of bites.

I was set on ordering the weekend frittata, but my friend changed her mind at the last minute and also decided to order it. So I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict ($22). This was absolutely delicious! There were 2 house made crab cakes, topped with asparagus, 2 poached eggs and hollandaise.  I tasted the frittata and it was also really good! It was much larger than expected and had tons of flavor. She chose to pay $2 extra and add chicken, which I probably wouldn't have done. 

We splurged and had dessert (YOLO, right?!). We shared the Triple Strawberry Shortcake. It looked more like a large biscuit, halved and filled with strawberries and whipped cream. It also had a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  Not sure I would order it again, but as I mentioned I am not a huge sweets eater.

Our server was friendly and helpful. She had a fun, upbeat attitude which is always a plus.  Brunch was good, but there was nothing that wowed me so much that I would drive to the other side of town for.

This place has been around for a while and the quality has always been steady even as the prices have slowly crept up over the years. I would not suggest coming here to work or read since the place is not well lite but it's perfect for chatting and catching up.

1. Poor Air Conditioning- The theaters have been hot during most of the movies I've seen here. Asking management to turn down the A/C did little to resolve the issue. It seems like this is an ongoing problem. 

2. Long Lines - We waited 15 minutes to pick up our tickets we already purchased online. There was no separate line for online buyers to rush through just to print their tickets. If they did create one, they do a poor job of identifying it and there was no person to direct us to it.

3. Kicking People Out of Seats - I have to routinely kick people out of our reserved seats because guests were not properly informed about the reserved seating system in my opinion.

4. Delayed Screening Times - I'm not referring to the movie. I'm referring to the previews not starting on time. During one occasion, we had to tell management to turn the projectors on because it was 30 minutes past the movie time and the previews didn't even start.

The Carbonara pizza was ok.

My favorite dish for the dinner must have been the taliatelle pasta, they had lots of clams and the sauce was so good!

After a terribly disappointing Friday dinner, I was left craving a proper week-end indulgence and Restaurant Europea was it.

Entering there were many other patrons who came through the door within seconds of my party but the hostess not only kept a cool demeanor but with the aid of her coworkers gave a warm & sincere welcome to all and quickly seated us.  Jérôme Ferrer, Grand chef also warmly welcomed all the guests.

We were well impressed with the elegant ambiance of the upper floor. This was sign of the good things to come.

We attended the Simon Durivage, Friends Brunch, a novelty as Restaurant Europea does not usually serve Brunch, and it was their first time.

We started with the viennoiserie; small loaf of brioche (while respectable not my favorite, I prefer Pain Dore's), croissants (the best I've ever tasted) and tasty chocolatines, served with brown whipped butter, plain butter and flower butter (appeared to have violet petals through it). The Fresh squeezed orange juice was sweet and pulpy. Creton a tartiner was finer than those served at Cabin a Sucre. Les oeufs a la Mexicaine de Simon Durivage, looked like the a daisy; the yellow fluffy egg in the centre of the flowered shaped bowl. 

The service was impeccable, when I asked about the ladies room I was escorted to it and the gentleman opened the door for me.

For toppings I added the spicy surimi, seaweed salad, corn, cucumber, and all the crunchies. Definitely add ALL the crunchy toppings- wontons, fried onions and sesame. It gives a much needed crunch to an otherwise all soft burrito or bowl. The burrito was full of flavor and not so huge or overwhelmingly that you'd feel sick.

The location is nicely decorated and modern, the prices are reasonable, the plating is nice, and the service was attentive and personable. But the AYCE menu is limited in some ways that other similarly-priced spots are not (few nigiri options, no dessert). To balance that out, they're one of the only places to offer carpaccio dishes. I found myself preferring their rolls because the fish itself didn't seem to have much flavor on it's own. This took a while to notice because each round we ordered took around 45 minutes to hit the table, other than appetizers, which came out quickly. 

They manage the basics well (the tako and shrimp were better than average), and I like that they make the effort to utilize garnishes that both add flavor and make the dishes visually appealing. But the fish quality itself could be a bit better, or more consistent. The timing issues we experienced I will chalk up to kitchen kinks that will get worked out with time, though I will note that their dining room was half empty when we experienced delays. I'm willing to give this place another try.

My biggest issue is the customer service. They fall flat every time. I just don't understand why they can't grasp how to service customers when they are delivering a good product.

Their customer service is so bad that I don't even like to dine anymore I always order my food to go, but the last two orders that I placed to go there has been so many issues that could've easily been avoided. There's no one at the front door when you walk in. The employees are socializing and all over the place. The orders get mixed up and no one knows who ordered what. They also leave off things such as sauces utensils napkins and even try to stop all of your food into one small bag. It's just annoying.

Management is not too much better. While everyone is friendly, I spoke with a manger when I was served dried out burnt calamari and shrimp. The manager was nice and asked me to com in the following day for a refund and that she would also treat my daughter and I to dinner. She said she would be there all day, but when I arrived the next day she was not there and a man who introduced himself as the general manager was. He said he would give me a refund or food, one or the other which is understandable, but not what Pamela had promised me. I asked for a refund and gave him my card. It took him over 15 min to come back and he had written down my card info and said he would fax it to corporate for a refund. Seriously, all that for a refund? Why should I feel comfortable leaving my card info with them? Very unsafe.

Management at this restaurant needs to hire more help and find some more organization so that customers don't see your employees humiliated when they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing. There's no communication among employees and you have a bunch of young people that don't know how to use their skills and their critical thinking to create solutions for customers.

FOOD (3 stars)
They have many kinds of seafood such as lobster, crab, fish, clam, oyster, and scallop.  I try to avoid having Chinese food because I usually eat Thai food 4-5 days a week already.  Their food is quite similar, and many dishes are oily.  However, many dishes are difficult to deny.  
We often order the same dishes almost every time.  They were Live Lobsters in different kind of sauces, Fried rice with Crabs, Cold Chicken with Jelly Fish, Steamed Live Seabass, Snow Pea Leaves with King Mushrooms, etc.  However, we also tried new items this time too.  We had razor clams in Black Bean Sauce, Stuff Crab Claw and Sautéed Jumbo Shrimp with Szechuan Sauce.  My today favorite was Cold Chicken!  
 
AMBIANCE (3 stars)
They have many round tables. Each table is good for ten people.  The restaurant could seat at least 100 people in their dining room.  The best thing is they close very late on Sunday to Thursday at 2 am. and open until 5 am in the morning on Friday and Saturday.  That is kind of cool for a night owl~

In fact, I'm genuinely shocked to read some of the less-than-stellar reviews here, because my experience here recently with their holiday tasting menu was unquestionably positive.

The ahi tuna tartare had a good balance of flavor and crunchy texture, having been accented with ancho chili, mint, pine nuts, and sesame oil. The lobster pot pie had several nice chunks of lobster in it, plus the broth was savory and creamy without being overwhelming or excessively salty. Meanwhile, the American wagyu ribeye was incredibly flavorful, soft, and tender. A pumpkin tart provided a refreshing coda to a perfect progression of courses. 

The wine list is worth mentioning as the wines that my server Alejandro suggested - the Hattenheimer Nussbrunnen and the Arista pinot noir - paired exceptionally well with the courses on the tasting menu. Alejandro himself was on top of his game, providing flawless service, helpful guidance and context behind the food, and a perfect sense of timing for each course.

I am a regular for 3 years now, or maybe I am addicted to Cora's. Cora's is the only breakfast place that offers o much variety of vegetarian food.

I love their coffee too, sometimes I buy their coffee beans for home. Their crepes, waffles and fruit platter are just as amazing as their lunch menu, or any granola bowl. I am so hooked on their fudge. 

The portions are huge! And they use the quality products and items are served fresh. None other breakfast place has so many vegetarian options. I have been to multiple locations of Cora's, here and in Montreal. This one is my pet now.

My bf ordered chicken dishes.  The 1st time he ordered the orange chicken.  I tried it and it was ok, but 1 bite was enough for me and I ended up sharing some of my tofu dish with him.  The 2nd time he ordered yellow curry chicken.  It was bland in every aspect,  The color of the curry sauce was dull, the spice and flavor of the curry was light, and the consistency of the curry sauce was watery.  The chicken had a weird taste and texture and he ended up only eating a few bites and I had to give up a big portion of my tofu.  Later that night he started complaining about not feeling well, and ended up getting sick.  He normally has a strong stomach.

(3) my father's steak was, surprisingly, the only one that was cooked accordingly. 

(4) so much onions and croutons underneath that cheesy shell. The soup was very delicious, right amount of salt and flavor.

And if something isn't to your liking, tell your server.  This place will bend over backwards to make things perfect. 

So, now onto the review (it's long but I got a lot to rave about today)...

I've held off on reviewing this place for a year because I'm friends with everyone there. I didn't want that to impact my ability to be as honest as possible.  After a full year of eating and drinking here more times than I can count, I feel very comfortable calling this one of my top spots in Cleveland.  I think it's had a few hiccups here and there, but I'm 100% confident that this is a consistent 5-star spot.  It's been that way for a while.

The service is always top notch -- it's exceptional.  The staff is very well versed in the food, preparations, ingredients, and plating.  They know exactly what's going on in the kitchen.  This is incredibly important given the food and the ingredients are made in-house.  This also comes in handy if you walk in with a child or a crazy dietary restrictions.  No kids menu?  Trust me, they can take care of your child's whim.  Or perhaps your vegan or paleo and you don't see a damn thing on the menu that works fully to your needs.  No problem.  Find what you want on the menu and they will make it work.  I've never seen waitstaff and kitchen staff go to such lengths to ensure everyone is happy and full.  But it all starts with that friendly and knowledgeable service.

The bar is damn good too.  Cocktail wise, they make really great craft cocktails at a reasonable price given the quality of ingredients and the attention placed on doing it right. I don't see how $11 or $12 bucks for a craft cocktail is even a bit pricey given the recipes.  You're not getting anything close to well drinks. But, if you want cheap, they do have well drinks available.  All you need to do is ask. I will say they bar had some problems in the first six months of operations, but that's just not an issue anymore.  Service and quality of product are great at the bar.

What about the food?  The food is the star.  It doesn't get any better--it's creative and delicious. How do they make it so damn good?  They not only make the food from scratch, they make the ingredients from scratch.  They grind their own flour, grow their own yeast, ferment their vinegar... they even make their own tofu and miso!  They do the same thing for the bar ingredients too!  A lot of places around Cleveland play the ""farm to table"" card, but when a restaurant goes to the trouble of actually crafting the raw ingredients, they are doing it right.  Of course, someone could go through all the trouble and still make junk food.  Not here; not at The Willeyville.  This place makes damn good food.

The charcuterie is my favorite.  In the past year they have come a long way and I find this to be some of the best charcuterie in the city.  I also love the hanger steak.  Hanger steaks are a dime a dozen in Cleveland, but the way The Willeyville uses a quick cure and sous vide creates the most flavorful and tender hanger in town.  The current adobo hanger prep with hominy, pickled jalapenos, tres pepper sauces, fried shishito peppers, crispy tortillas strips is the best version of their hanger to date.

I could honestly talk about this menu for hours.  You may see a smattering of Asian, Italian, and European dishes.  While that might seem confused, remember that the focus is about true from-scratch cooking.  America is diverse, shoot Cleveland is diverse.  These are all the kinds of foods Clevelanders love, just under one roof and done really freaking well.  Personally, the ricotta gnudi is better than some of the stuff I've had at famous Italian restaurants in very big cities.  The smoked pork belly ramen (yes they even make the noodles in house) is the best bowl of ramen I've had from a restaurant not run by Japanese people. And the ""proper poutine"" while not the traditional poutine I get in Montreal, I just can't hate on it -- the thing makes my mouth and my belly beyond happy.

Don't like fancy things, then get one of the hot dogs or sausages known as  ""Willey Wieners"" during lunch or happy hour at the bar.  They grind, season, and stuff these things all in house to great success.  The Korean and the German variants are my favorite, but they got the traditional Polish boy that does the trick too.  The burgers (traditional and veggie) don't disappoint either.  I'm not a vegetarian, but that veggie burger is something I would eat regardless.   I don't have a huge sweet tooth these days, but I make sure to get desert every time I stop in. 

This place does the trick for me, time and time again.  At this point in time, I can't say a bad thing about the joint.  Stop in for dinner and discover one of the best restaurants in town.   If you aren't like me and you do find something not to your liking, trust me, they will take care of you.",2014-07-01 00:12:15

They're painting it a fresher color, they've really cleaned up the inside.

It definitely FELT cleaner when we walked in, and they seem to be stalking up on more family requested items, instead of the stuff only college students want.
They actually have gluten free items now! (which is GREAT since before, I would have to go to a farther walmart for anything gluten free). They've also put in new self check outs (but which still need some fine tuning.)
And they actually had cashiers when I went. I also think they've gutted a lot of the old employees, because while no one is excited to work at Walmart, they were no longer exuding despair. And I actually had a NICE gal helping me with the self checkout today! Say what? Someone who was actually nice to me?! At THIS walmart?! Impossible`!
The one thing that made me a little irritated was they carry the most awful pet food still. It's the cheap stuff, but it's also the stuff that'll make your animals sick. Where as every other Walmart carries at least one brand of decent food. 
I think they might still be working on updating and improving the rest of the store though...

While Monta isn't my first choice anymore, I don't have any qualms on eating here. My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.

The Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.

A couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.

Our server was fantastic and did not hesitate to be the ""decider"" when I was torn between 2 choices. I ordered a wedge salad with bleu cheese and Bacon (delish) after toying with the idea of lobster bisque. Although I intended to eat steak, the seafood options on the menu looked amazing. I convinced my husband to order blackened mahi mahi and I ordered a petit filet with the intent of creating our own surf and turf plate. We also ordered mushrooms as a side. Wow. Highly recommend.

Started off with the Foie Gras Terrine : Nutella, Raspberry Spaghetti, Figs and Texas Toast. Buttery smooth and creamy, Nutella worked surprisingly well! The Texas toast was warm and also buttery, so the terrine spread smooth. The Raspberry spaghetti, figs and fruit added a touch of flavor and consistency.  One of the best ways I've had Foie Gras with sweets!

First course was Australian Wagyu Carpaccio with Truffle Salad. Carpaccio was tender, tasty, and melt in your mouth! The salad was salty, so the truffle taste was hidden.  I ate up every bite of the beef, but left almost the entire salad, and I love truffles :(

Main course, Bone-In Filet Mignon: Bone Marrow Flan and Port Wine Reduction. First bite, I noticed it was a little ""cooler"" than I am used to...then I realized it was cooked rare. It was pretty tender and flavorful, but towards the bone, I started to hear it Moooing lol. Port Wine reduction was ok, a little distracting personally. No real char on the outside...they probably oven cook it to temp with no major sear.  Bone Marrow Flan didn't do much for me either.

The sides, Parmesan Potato Gratin and Jalapeño Creamed Corn.  Both were creamy and yummy...I liked the melted cheese on top on the potatoes. Good stuff!  And it was very tasty corn! I didn't notice the jalapeno at all though...so no, it was not spicy in the slightest. I did scoop out pretty much all of that corn though! Yum

And for dessert, Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar: Caramel Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. This was super rich and tasty! I love peanut butter desserts!  

Service was a bit slow, steak was cooked wrong, and overall the food was good but not great.  A-OK in my book...

Maybe I'll come back and try the cut of the week deal when the time is right.

Whenever we go to a new restaurant we like to sample a lot of different things and happy hour always helps because prices are lower. So we drive the half hour south and arrive at Pure. There were two groups of people sitting inside, and the patio looked nice so we decided to sit out there. After five minutes or so a waiter brought out waters (which a fly landed on the rim of my glass not a split second after it was put on the table, I know they can't control the outside insects but it was still gross!) so when I wanted some water I drank my bf's. I asked our waiter if the happy hour was only at the bar or if we could order off it outside as well and his response went a little something like this... ""ummmmm, uhhhhh, welllllll we don't have happy hour here, that was at our south location and they ummm closed, we haven't updated our website yet to say that but yeah, we don't do happy hour."" I was shocked. The fact that only one of their locations did happy hour should have been written on the website in the first place.

Ambiance: Classy, intimate, romantic...great place to go on a date, or even go with a group of people. The patio is fabulous, with a view of the lake. Exposed brick wall, high ceilings...you can grab a table or a seat at the bar. I have never been here when it has been busy busy (which is fine with me), but there is always usually a group or two in there having a good time. There's also a pool table that's free to play, and some TVs so you can catch a sports game at the bar.

Drinks: Beer, mixed drinks, liquor, and of course, wine. Each season they change up some specialty drinks they have, and I usually try at least one each time I go. Otherwise, I'm a white wine drinker, while my boyfriend is a red. I prefer to go during happy hour, which is Tuesday all day and Wed-Fri 3pm-7pm ($4 draft beer, $5 wine, and some food is $6).

Food: I have never had a bad dish here ---the food is always so fabulous. Some things change every once in awhile. I love their cheese plate- you get several different types of cheeses with fruit, oil, and jam that I LOVE. It's pretty filling for just cheese and fruit too. Their buffalo chicken sliders: awesome. So good. If you're into fries, yolo fries are also good. I've had their smoked turkey ciabatta--so tasty, and I am usually reluctant try to ciabattas because it usually ends up being too much bread, but that was not the case for this sandwhich. I'm also a fan of their cheese bread. As I was writing this review I pulled up their menu to make sure I didn't miss anything, and it looks like they took something awesome off the menu---Latke. It was so good, if they did get rid of it, I hope the bring it back!!!

Service: It's all right. When they are busy, you can see how some of the servers get a little overwhelmed, but it's not too bad. Once while at the bar, I bought a round of shots for the group I was with. I told the bartender to make ""whatever"" for us, and he made the breakfast shot. I had heard about it but never tried one--take a shot, chase it with something else, and it's supposed to taste like pancakes with syrup. And oh boy, did it. It was so, so good. Cost about $35 for 4 shots, so ehhh, but they were good.

I def. recommend this place to anyone, even if you are not an avid wine drinker. There is a lot of construction on the surrounding streets right now as the city is rerouting the sewer system and connecting w. 73rd to the shoreway--so, at the time I write this review, you do have to take 74th or 76th to get to it. I hope the construction isn't hurting their business!!

I love this place.",2013-10-28 19:29:43

Rest assured, the friendly staff pointed me to the very well stocked cold case and I was able to get a tasty side of mixed fruit with creme fraiche for $3. There were fresh strawberries, grapes and something else, I forgot already, oops. There were definitely other choices in that cold case that I will be back for next time.

We went here after our weekly Thursday meeting, Normally we go (when we go) for Mexican food to another restaurant but we all wanted a different Mexican food establishment this time around. If you have read my reviews about Mexican food restaurants I always start with how the salsa tasted to me and then go from there. The salsa was a combo of other places hot and mild chunky salsa so it was OK but the chips were served hot and added that ""little"" extra that marked their salsa & chips right there with some of the best.

Now to the food: My dish was the Fajitas de Macayo. A flavorful treat of steak Fajitas grilled to perfection on top of  a bed of grilled onions and green chiles. Served with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and refried beans. I asked our server (waitress who's name  I didn't  get) if I could get a side of grilled vegetables instead of the  refried beans. She said no problem so I substituted the  refried beans for a side if grilled vegetables. I expected I would be getting grilled onions, and the other grilled vegetable that came with the meal but instead got grilled zucchini, squash, broccoli and some other grilled veggies. But it was all good just not what I expected.

My wife got a como plate of Shredded Beef Enchilada &  a Shredded Beef Taco served with refried beans  she really liked the Taco and next time wouldn't get the Shredded Beef Enchilada. all in all she liked what she picked out.

FOOD: Everyone in our party liked what they ordered. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: typical modern Mexican restaurant décor .clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Especially considering every had something different . they provided excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a Mexican food restaurant. I'm sure we will be back RETURN FACTOR: 100%

Back in my Vancouver days in the early 90's we used to frequent a place in Gastown called O'Ryan's Piano Bar.  It was so much fun we went every weekend to dance and sing to the duelling piano's. You could also spend extra money on their special drinks (ie hurricanes) and you got to take the glasses home.  I used to have quite a collection of O'Ryans glasses...now I have only one left.  Eventually O'Ryan's disappeared from Vancouver but I was able to enjoy some duelling piano's when we visited New Orleans.

I was very excited when the girls wanted to go to a duelling piano bar in Calgary (I kind of went in with high expectations) and it delivered.  We shared a few appy's (Chook Wings, Chips and Dead Horse and Nacho's).  The food was ok but like my O'Ryan's days the most fun for me was singing and dancing to the duelling piano's.

I went with the small Double Pep which is essentially a pepperoni pizza with TONS of pepperoni.  The pizza is perfect for one person, 4 regular slices with very deep crusts!  Of course I couldn't finish it all by myself so CT was nice enough to eat some of mine with me.  I though the pizza tasted great! Pepperoni overload with very good pepperoni (where can I get those?!) and the amount of cheese on it was amazing.

Call me a purist, non-adventurous, whatever. But I firmly believe that sushi doesn't need to be fried and covered in sauce to be good. In fact, that's my least favorite kind. Unfortunately, most every special roll offered was drowning in ponzu. It was good for the first one or two, but didn't leave a good feeling in my stomach after that. 

The fish it's self wasn't of good quality and that was apparent in the two pieces of nigiri we had- a tuna and salmon. Standard and easy enough to judge across the board. The tuna had a weird texture. It was off. You could tell it was frozen previously and it tasted like nothing. The rice was also lacking in terms of taste and texture. Salmon was the same story. 

By the time we were ready for our check, 3 or 4 other parties had come in. The waitress was notified but decided to take and run orders for 15+ minutes after the fact. We left cash instead of waiting for however much longer we would have had to and dipped.

So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady? 

Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P

The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  

Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was ""full"".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.

I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.

I had the salmon. It came with crunch artichoke hearts, israeli cous cous, and a pesto. It was refreshing and delicious. The best salmon I've ever had, by far.

My husband had the flat iron and was not disappointed, either. It wasn't a strip steak, mind you, but it delivered. It was tender, and accompanied by smashed potatoes. YUM.

We shared a side of mac n cheese, and it was by far the best mac and cheese I've had in my lifetime.

The BEST part, however, was dessert. We tried a brookie, and we scarfed it down so fast, I probably could have eaten two more of them. I'm going to have dreams about the brookie. It was to die for.

But to my incredible astonishment, the owner (and coincidentally the first employee I met here) is a former high school classmate of mine.  Bilal Safi and I were not only classmates but also played on our high school basketball and football teams together.  Bilal and his sister Fahima actually co-own this mashup of Afghani, Pakistani, Indian, and even American cuisines (emphasis on the Afghani portion) on the southwest corner of 24th Street & Indian School.  I'd been eyeing this place for a visit for awhile, but now that I knew Bilal's family were running the show, I was pretty excited to give it a go.

The restaurant itself is pretty unassuming but comfortable with seating for maybe 40 inside.  Here you can order food to go up front or grab a seat and a server takes care of you.  Although I've become more knowledgable about food from the Middle East and African regions in recent years, I really had no clue what to expect when it came to Afghani cuisine.  I took a passing glance through Wikipedia to read up a little on Afghani food in advance so I at least had some idea of what to look for.

To start things off I ordered a glass of Dooge.  It's a cold yogurt based drink mixed with chopped up mint leaves.  It's not as thick as yogurt but has a somewhat similar texture.  The mint adds an extra cooling sensation to the tongue.  Flavor-wise its a little unusual, but then again that's why I'm here.  Bilal warned me in advance that the portions here are on the large side so I skipped the appetizer and went straight for Afghani food 101.  The Qabuli Pulaw is apparently widely considered to be the national dish of Afghanistan, so what better place to start?  At the base of the dish is Pulaw rice, which is white rice cooked with meat stock, carrots, raisins, and herbs and I think I even picked up a hint of pistachio.  Next to the rice is a healthy portion of chopped salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, and a little cilantro as well.  Atop the rice, a footlong meat kabob of seasoned ground beef.  The dish bears a resemblance to similar kabob dishes I've had various Middle Eastern restaurants, but the rice here stands out on its own.  I think its the raisins that really make this dish stand out, adding a subtle and pleasant fruity component.  Coupled with the salad and meat, the Qabuli Pulaw is a solid dish and a great gateway dish for those unsure as to whether they'd really enjoy Afghani food.  If you need a starting point, start with this dish.  Having enough room for dessert, I decided to try the Rusmalai.  I'd read up a little on this dish and ordered it mainly because of how unusual it sounded.  Basically its flatted balls of cheese curd soaked in cow's milk cream, and flavored with cardamom.  From there the flattened balls are cooked in milk, sugar, and rice pudding.  Here they come two flattened balls to an order, still doused with cream.  How to describe this.  Its a sort of sweet spongey, chunky, chewy, dairy bomb.  I actually really liked the cream in this dish, though the texture was certainly a new one on me.

Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $23.  I will say I'm still processing some of the experience as both the Dooge and the Rusmalai were completely new to me.  But the Qubuli Pulaw was an absolutely excellent main course.  Along with Afghani specials here, you'll find several other rice dishes along with curries, kabobs as well as some wraps and fried fish options.  There really are a lot of ways to branch out here while still eating something inherently comfortable and familiar.  Or you can go way outside the box on certain items as I did.  Bilal and Fahima delivered an interesting and tasty meal for me to try this go around, and I suspect they will next time too.  Great to see a fellow Central Bobcat giving the community a great go to spot.  Even if its origins are halfway around the globe.",2018-05-12 02:19:08

Kitchen utensils and ovens are reserved for the preparation and cooking of gluten-free doughs and other goodies. This helps prevent contamination, which can wreak havoc on one later. For the most part, the GF menu is exactly the same as the regular menu and this is a wonderful thing. A GF diet can be VERY restrictive, but Picazzo's has really gone out of its way to accommodate those of us, who cannot tolerate gluten and has won several awards for having done so. How many restaurants can truly say that?

Neither the dough nor the toppings are bland. The salads all taste delicious. The servers are always quick and very courteous, and they take the time to get to know you by name when you are a regular. The prices are a little excessive, but I think the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and that this is well worth paying a little extra to obtain.

They said it would be about $250 and Wednesday morning would work if I'd drop it off in the morning when they open.  So I dropped it off at 715am and called around 2pm after I hadn't heard from them expecting my car to be done or close to done.  Turns out they hadn't even looked at my car yet.  Then they told me they had to fix the oil (?) sensor and wanted to do a blue dye diagnostic test.  I paid about 150 for that.

After about 3k miles I went back and they told me what I had told them in the first place.  Its probably the oil pan gasket and its 250.  They also said it could be something else that cost 850.  I'd invested so much I decided to go for it.  Maybe they're just thorough right?

So a week later I went out of town for a few days and came back and sure enough, oil is still leaking out of my car.  So it must be an $850 repair thing.

However, I'm a bit annoyed that they try to make you schedule an appointment every time, but they don't have the same respect for your time.  After that first time, the next one I asked them how long it would take (a couple hours) so I scheduled to come in first thing (7am).  When I asked them if it would be done by noon they wouldn't even promise me that at first!  That's 5 hrs for something that takes 2hrs according to them.

The pictures didn't look appealing and we could make better food at home. Our friend had their wedding rehearsal dinner here with a group of 30 people. And I must say the staff did an awesome job accommodating us.

Our waitress (forgot her name) was super patient and friendly with our large group. The bussers made sure our glasses were filled and plates were taken away accordingly. The manager came around a few times to make sure we were all happy. They were even nice enough to split up all of our checks. So the stars in this review go to them. 

As for the food, it's a completely different story. The only thing I enjoyed was the chip and salsa bar. The chips were crispy and warm. I liked that there were different salsas so you could try them all. They were all fresh and plentiful. Our main dishes were forgettable. I ordered lettuce wrapped tacos. The lettuce was wilted and the meat was boring. My BF ordered the carne asada. That was also boring and forgettable.

They do hand pulled or knife shaved noodles in a variety of broths or sauces. The last time I was there, we snagged a table in full view of the chef pulling/shaving the noodles, so they are obviously made fresh for your order!

First step is the broth base. My personal preference is the lamb broth, it was light and flavorful without being oily or heavy. If you want something with a bit of kick, the braised beef brisket soup gives an extra bite. You can still taste the beef broth under the spice, so the balance is good.

Noodle choice is next. I like my noodles al dente so the classic noodles was perfect. They stayed chewy and consistent from the first bite to the last. If you like your noodles softer, the knife shaved noodles would be good. Due to the unique shape from the knife shaving through the dough, the noodles start on the chewier side and slowly softens further as it sits in the broth. I did try the curtain noodles, however due to their size, it was unwieldy to eat and I found myself either chewing on noodles alone or drinking soup separately. Probably not the best choice, but an interesting experience. 

Prepare to wait at peak weekend hours. It seems easier to snag tables for two people than for larger groups. The space is small and the tables are packed close together. Be prepared to overhear plenty of neighboring conversations, or have your conversations overheard by others.",2017-02-13 19:27:24

The sandwich came with some cocktail sauce and an aioli mayo or aioli tarter sauce (not quite sure which, but it was very tasty).

I'm really sorry but the excuse and description of low grade uni was just pathetic!!! Do you realize that you've just told pretty much the whole bar area that you serve sub-par quality fish. The only star you're getting from me is the one because you had sake collar that was a chefs special. That item is harder to find so I applaud you for having it. That was probably the one good thing about our meal, besides the convos we struck up w the other dissatisfied restaurant guests.",2016-11-13 05:01:56

1. Cheetah on tap
Not sure about y'all, but this has been the only place in town that I've seen this.  And, it was good.

2. Chic style
Modern feel to the place.  Someone wrote about how this place doesn't seem authentically Indian.  Well, you should know that right when you saw the place.  The food may not be authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not good.

3. Food quality
We were pleasantly surprised.  From the start, the veggie pakoras were different from those around the city, they weren't greasy at all.  The lamb tandoori was very delicious.  Finally, the lamb vindaloo was very nice and spicy (I ordered it medium spicy).

Drawback: portion sizes.  This was the only place in the city where we've eaten Indian, and not had leftovers.  I do agree with one/some of the other reviews on that.  However, it's supposed to be an upscale place, so you're paying for it in that way.

In summary, I'd go back, primarily for the Cheetah draft, and if I were willing to spend for higher end Indian.",2014-02-09 01:08:39

Located next to the shopping mall underneath an apartment building (I do not want to be associated with people who live in apartments basically on top of a mall. Ick.), the Cowfish restaurant seems wildly popular. It has nearly 500 reviews in the solid red-orange range of four stars. My wife and I couldn't get a table at 4:30 on Jan. 1, so we sat at the bar.

Here you can get sushi, or burgers, or a combo of both. I guess this means your health nut friends and your obese unhealthy friends can all get together in one restaurant! For that, Cowfish, many kudos. In fact, more restaurants should be heading in this direction. And for that, you deserve four stars. Below is why I knocked it down a notch.

Step inside the bathroom and you hear automated recordings of a man and a woman taking on a faux North Carolina hick, redneck accent and spewing off a number of homespun axioms. I wish I could remember a few, but they were things like, ""Don't pee on my back and call it rain!"" and they were repeated ad nauseam. It was truly difficult to bear. The next reason Cowfish drops a notch is simply due to its service. It took forever to get a food order, and when we did, the food arrived fairly quickly. I ordered some edamame and sushi. The edamame was good, and not too salty. The sushi was also good: spicy tuna and vegetarian rolls. They were wrapped pretty well, you got a good piece of fish in there, and it tasted fresh.

On the walls are the paintings that are humorous take-offs on famous paintings or art. Some seem mildly offensive or distasteful. One of them is an Asian Mona Lisa. What? Another is a rendering of Picasso's Guernica, which depicts the German bombing of a Basque region during the Spanish Civil War. It's a pretty gut-wrenching painting of a solemn topic. But in the Cowfish's rendering, all the character, people suffering and fleeing from a Nazi bombing, are COWS. It's just not in good taste. Granted, some of the painting are actually funny.

To top it of, after I paid, my server started awkwardly joking with me as I fiddled with my phone. ""I know you want to dance,"" he quipped to the loud pop music pumping in the background. It's okay. Go ahead and dance."" Where was all this attention when I wanted to order a meal? I managed a polite, if feeble, grin, and got the heck outta there.",2014-01-02 14:10:09

For the prices they charge, the food better be damn good, and it is really average.  Went on Sunday, 5/17/15, not overly crowded, plenty of seating, but took at least 20-30 minutes before our food came and it came in spurts.  Ordered Vegas Rib special, came with fries, ordered side of  house salad, and side of cole slaw,  and turkey burger.  First came the fries, then the cole slaw, then the ribs, then the turkey burger, and last came the salad.  Turkey burger was ok, it was actually a turkey breast, not ground turkey, liked the added items, like crispy onions and aioli sauce.  Ribs consisted of kalbi and baby back.  Kalbi was good, baby back not so; kind of dry and did not come off the bone. Fries were extra salty (yuck), cole slaw liquidy and bland, and the salad had some kind of vinegary dressing slathered all over it instead of on the side (no one asked how we wanted the dressing whereas most restaurants do). 

All in all, just another example of  a business wanting you to think they are upscale and trendy.  Sorry, making me order like I'm in McDonalds, then waiting for someone to bring me food, is not my idea of upscale, especially if the food is not that great. And if you take leftover food home, do not ask for a small box because it is only cardboard, has no wax covering on the bottom to hold grease and spills.

They're pretty efficient and only let you order one item per person, so bring some friends if you want to try multiple things.

Obviously their main thing is the giant piece of breaded chicken ($9.99+tax), which comes in three flavours: salt and pepper, spicy, and seaweed.

It's been a long time since I've gone to this grocery store.  I used to come and get the fire roasted green chiles and the in-house made  tortillas.  In the past, I would've given this place a 2 star for disorganization and dirtyness.  To my surprise, it was clean and put together plus they have opened up a restaurant that served Mexican bebidas, menudos, posoles, etc. 

My son was intrigued with someone de-thorning the nopales (cactus pads).  ""Do you eat that?""  He asked the man.  The man nodded and pointed to the cubed ones.  I decided to buy a bag to cook at home.  I'm not a big fan, but I'd eat it.  Then, I picked up some flour tortillas and street style corn tortillas that freezes well as left overs.  One of the workers pointed us towards the indoor gateway to the restaurant.  The chiles were right before the entrance in the refrigerated section.  The small canned version doesn't do the chile justice--but it's convenient to use.  I just grabbed the $2 per bag fire roasted jalapenos without looking and assuming that it's the hatch green chile.  So, look before you take!  I wasn't disappointed with the roasted flavor when I used it as one of the condiments for my chicken and fish tacos.  

We love horchata.  It was hard not to  order one after my son and I peeked through and saw those plastic barrels full of ice cold juices!  It was a little bland, which made me want to make some at home.

The chile relleno burrito at Filiberto's is a case study in why.  A breaded and fried chile stuffed with cheese and drowned in guacamole and pico de gallo, wrapped in a warm, soft tortilla that tastes fresh off the stone - ignoring cholesterol and fat, what could be wrong with that?  Drown it down with a sweet cup of horchata, and you have entered post-drunk, pre-dreamland nirvana.

For meat lovers, the carne asada is yummy, but I think my favorite is the patròn burrito.

Also, Filly B's doesn't use lard in their beans, which makes it a go-to place for my vegan friends when hunger strikes at two in the morning.

If you want fine cuisine, go to the Barrio Cafe and be prepared to pay for it.  if you want delicious and equally authentic Mexican food, visit Filly's, any time.  There's a reason there's a line for breakfast burritos at five in the morning.

Well, that's what you will find if you choose to have dinner at Church Brew Works.  Besides having good food, Church Brew Works brews, and serves its own beers.
It's hard to believe that a building so vast could house a restaurant, but it does.  One of the first times I had dinner at Church Brew Works, I remember entering the parking lot and seeing something peculiar.  There were people standing in the parking lot, looking up.  A large collection of bats were circling the top of the church, hundreds of bats, it was creepy.  Maybe the bats knew something we didn't.  
I had been there before, but my guests hadn't.  They weren't discouraged by the large gathering of bats, thank goodness.  When you first walk in the Church, it's as big as it looks from the outside.  There's a bar on the left hand side, seating on the right.  Up towards the center of the restaurant, there are additional seats, a pizza station, and even some old organ pipes.
You have to try the beer if you come to Church Brew Works.  Some of the selections are, Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkel (G.A.B.F. winner 1998, and 2001), Pipe Organ Pale Ale, Milennium Trippel, and many different types of Stout, all good.  Besides an excellent selection of fresh beers on tap, the bar also offers many different types of home-brewed bottled beers.  We all tried the stout of the week, and it was extremely hoppy and strong; very good.
My favorite appetizer at the Church Brew Works is the Spinach, Feta, and Smoked Gouda Dip ($7.50) served with warm wood-fired flat bread.  It's really a great combination; the gouda and feta cheese are completely different in taste, as well as texture.  It's served hot, so be careful not to burn the roof of your mouth!  The Quesadilla is another favorite of mine ($9.00) filled with chicken, andouille sausage, jack cheese black beans, jalapeno and tomato salsa, served with cilantro sour cream.  The quesadilla is very crisp; it crunches into pieces when you take a bite.  The sausage, bean, and cheese are an unorthodox combination, but quite good.  There are many entrees to choose from.  There's a turkey and Watercress Salad ($11.00), Crab Cakes ($23.00) with potato corn hash, Bourbon and Brown Sugar Glazed Salmon with Spinach and Potato Mash ($17.50), and the Catch of the Day (market price).  Pot pies, steaks, and pork chops are also available.  The pizzas are great, be sure to try them.  My preferred pie is the Pittsburgh Pierogie Pizza ($13.50).  This pizza has potato puree, sautéed sweet onions, garlic, and cheddar cheese- yeah, you heard me, starch on top of starch!  If you're not looking to carb-load, go for the Chicken and Spinach Alfredo Pizza, or the Portobello Pesto Pizza.
The menu is extensive.  Regardless of your culinary wishes, The Church Brew Works has something for you.  It's a great place to hang out during the week, and on the weekends.  It's a grand space, one that needs to be visited if you haven't yet.  And don't forget to try some of the house brewed specialties; they're delicious.",2010-03-21 00:23:10

Went here with my husband for dinner and was pretty disappointed. The chips/salsa and guacamole were good. In fact the house guac was the best part of the visit. But, from there it went downhill.

The service was good, everyone was very friendly and attentive. The bad part is that the bartender got our drinks wrong and the server got my dinner wrong, good part is that they were more than happy to quickly fix.

But, the food... well... it was... ok. Let me preface all of this by saying that I love salt. I mean, if it were socially acceptable I would walk around with a salt lick attached to my wrist. But this meal? Holy salt. I mean it was REALLY over-salted. The food tasted like sub-par Mexican cuisine that was thrown together.

When I asked my husband how he liked it he said, 'this taco is horrible.' It was dry and had no seasoning. He then made the point that if you're going to go downtown, pay the $10-$20 for parking, you want a decent meal out of it and that he would never go back. Either would I.

Also a note on the kitchen staff- I question the cleanliness of everything since they wore gloves to prepare food, but then touched their face/hair/body/other people with those same gloves and went right back to preparing food. Ick.

Agree very much with other reviewers that E.4th can do better and this place is ruining downtown's culinary reputation.",2016-02-13 17:00:28

Along Baldwin Street, between McCaul and Beverley, sits a quaint little creamery producing ""Asian Gelato"". Yes, Asian gelato: gelato with Asian inspired flavours! Produced in small batches to ensure freshness and a smooth creamy texture, gelato at Kekou is flavoured with natural ingredients like tea and real fruit juices.

Walking into this little 'shop' felt more like an ice cream parlor than a gelato store. Chalkboard signs out front, benches, string lights, and wooden steps- it was like stepping into someone's home. Kekou's gelato is in metal canisters with lids, similar to how ice cream is scooped from tubs. The light-up board in the back and small tags placed on top of the counters lists all the available flavours they are serving.

Staple flavours like Vietnamese coffee, Red bean, Mango, are some of the most popular, but Kekou also has changing flavours like Pandan, HK Milk Tea, and Whiskey Green Tea. Like every gelato stand, if you can't make up your mind, or are simply curious to try that delicious Durian gelato, samples are of course free. The gelato is served in your choice of cup or two types of cones: plain or seaweed (really nice touch).

Personally, I'm a huge fan of the Avacado Banana and Pandan but that's a personal taste preference. All the flavours taste exactly what they are listed as, after all, the ingredients are natural.  In addition to gelato, there are beverages as well- Coconut water, Vietnamese coffee, Drip coffee. At the end of the day, we're really here for the gelato right?

Overall, Kekou highlights unique asian flavors which are interesting, creative and tasty. Ever since Gelato flavours have gone rogue, weird and strange have become favourable qualities while digging into our prized frozen treat. Kekou certainly does a great job of showcasing different profiles while staying true to real authentic tastes of Asia.",2014-09-13 15:50:40

Unfortunately, our dinner fell short of expectation. The following dishes fell below expectation: the lobster was overly chewy, the duck breast was chewy and both my husband and I couldn't enjoy it, the clam did not taste very fresh, it had a fishy taste to it and the pork belly left a greasy, oily aftertaste - it seemed as though they were using oil from weeks ago.
The beef tartare was a good dish, as was the tuna albacore (though it was a little softer and mushier than usual). The corn sauce on the lobster dish was tasty, and the two desserts were great. My husband loved the tartness and sweetness of the raspberry white chocolate dessert. For me, it just wasn't the sweet dessert that I prefer.

Another comment about the restaurant that really takes away from the experience of the upscale dinner and ambience is the smell in the dining room.

The Bad: No beer list??! This is NOT the way to either sell beer or serve the customer. Unless you want to make the server or barkeep rattle off 30 beers, the only way to see what they have is to walk over to the taps, standing behind patrons seated at the bar and squint at the often obscure tap handles.

There should be more & bigger TVs (one idea - get rid of the huge ""Pendelton Whisky"" sign and put more TVs there.  The SoundBoxes are nice but you have to ask for them - they're hidden in back.

Javier (aka, ""Haahvee"") is friendly & obviously well-liked by most, but not efficient and is often over-worked/inconsistent.  Especially on Tuesdays, they should have another bartender.  He can't keep up, and you'll see him glad-handing and quickly serving some customers while others wait.  He often forgets orders, etc.  Also, should bring an itemized receipt instead of just the total.  He disappears for literally 10 minutes at a time (another patron at the bar said he was probably actually cooking food), meanwhile, the entire bar's worth of customers have empty drinks/dirty plates, waiting to order/pay, etc., etc.

If I was the owner, I'd realize he is costing me revenue & repeat business at the expense of bigger tips for himself.

 Double order of Over easy eggs with sausage patties.
 Side of hashbrowns to try.
 Side of corn beef n hash.
 And three pancakes(which were included).

 Even worse, they didn't tell us gratuity was included, so we added it. But we had them credit our c/c when we found out. I guess my bad for not reading the bill.

After my Daughter's workday, she wanted some Latte at a place in Boca Park.... Wow! Was this place crowded at around 5pm. Stressful work days in Las Vegas, I guess. Didn't want to compete with the crowds during Happy Hour, so we went ""off the mall""... Happened upon this ""hole in the wall"" Gelato place with no one parked in front. Let's try it out...

$4.55 for a SMALL Cup of Gelato about three inches in diameter, about two inches high... At least the owner didn't try to level off the scoops of Gelato.

Wow! Is this place pricey? (Yeoww! Hurts the wallet....)

As many reviewers have commented on, the Gelato at Vivido Gelato is more like Frozen Ice Cream rather than traditional Gelato.... and the main reason for that is the lack of customers here in this smallish strip mall. Most do not realize that (real) Gelato would have to be disposed of if not consumed in a couple, three days... that's the reason for the limited and small volume production of Gelato... the real kind that is. Looks like the Owner, though Italian, has to produce his Gelato this way to save on waste.

Unfortunately, until there is more customer traffic, his present clientele will not be the beneficiary of the ""real stuff"". Liked the ""different"" piped-in Italian popular music in the background... ""real"" Italian...",2010-05-20 18:10:07

I liked the decoration with inspirational quotes about taking care of our planet.  
I loved the fact that this place uses all organic ingredients and local produce whenever possible.  
Vegan friendly items on the menu are a plus and the fact that they provide the choice of two different vegan cheeses is a humongous plus (for those avoiding soy).  
Fountain drinks (sodas) are all natural, pure cane sugar.  I don't drink soda but I was happy that my hubby and daughter could enjoy their drinks without the chemicals.
Pizza was OK.  Nothing out of this world.  I was expecting more in execution and flavor.  The toppings were scarce.  I had the very vegan with added onions and I swear my personal pizza only had about 1 mushroom sliced and a few scant slices of onions.  I couldn't taste the tomato sauce.  Most of what I tasted was the crust which was just OK.  Honestly, I have made the same pizza at home and it tasted a bit better. 
My daughter had the classic cheese and my hubby had the sausage and 3 pepper and they were not thrilled.  I was disappointed.  I've been to 2 other similar pizza places who serve way better flavors.  I really wish this place was amazing because I prefer to eat organic.
The prices are not terrible considering that you're paying for organic ingredients which are not cheap.  With that in mind, I thought prices were reasonable.

I was craving this place so bad, I had my husband drive from Glendale for take out!!! If I could give this place 6 stars I would! Now get your magically delicious noodle butts to the WESTSIDE!!!!


***Original Review***
We saw this place when we were at Lee's having Bahn Mi and we decided we were gonna try this place next. I am SO GLAD WE DID! This place makes their own noodles on site and I have to say they are the absolute best! We started out with the fried dumplings. These things were so big they could be a meal in itself. They were filled with well seasoned pork and served with a tangy vinegar soy sauce. I have a hard time with dumplings because most places seem to have a weird taste to the pork. They are not that way here. Very fresh!!! I had the Noodles with minced pork and it was amazing! My husband had the pan fried noodles with beef and XO sauce. Both dishes we rediculous!!! The noodles were just out of this world! And the portions are extremely large!!! No complaints here, since we now had leftovers. And living in Glendale makes it quite the trip but a trip I am happy to make!",2015-10-11 01:28:29

nZJjW33tFw8nEpVcBICQ-g,_uqIpl5tzucKuIlZZPBZRw,RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,4,0,1,"We went to Cowfish this past Sunday night and arrived around 6:30 PM.  Who knew that on a Sunday night in Charlotte I'd need a reservation?   Our party of seven waited 45 minutes for a table.  Everyone was very nice, though, and even the manager apologized to us for the long wait.  I think the problem is that Cowfish has a huge bar to sit at (and I mean HUGE; it starts on one side of the restaurant, wraps around, and continues for miles down the other side) and not a lot of ""large"" tables.   Now I know, though, so I won't be caught off guard in the future.  I've never seen a restaurant in Charlotte so busy on a Sunday night, that's why I didn't think to make a reservation.

At any rate, I loved looking around the restaurant.  It's come a long way since it was The Counter.  The walls are painted a deep red and extend high up into the warehouse-like black painted ceiling.  The bar (which I mentioned earlier) takes up a lot of space.  If you're a couple, it makes a great spot to sit, talk, eat, and drink.  Any more than two people, though, and conversation is probably difficult.  The giant paintings on the red wall are humorous knock-offs of famous art pieces or pop culture icons.  Burger King getting dissed by Wendy?  ""Fine, have it your way.""  Classic.  

Our server (very friendly and attentive) explained the menu to us.  If you thought the menu at Cheesecake Factory was a book, check out the menu at Cowfish.  You need about 20 minutes to look over everything just to begin to narrow down your choices. 

Since we had waited so long for a table, we started with the Sticks, Sweets & Strings -- regular fries, sweet potato fries, and onion strings.  For $5, it was incredibly huge and plenty for sharing with a large group.  Plus, it all tasted so good.

While we waited for our table, I noticed a group of women who had HUGE sushi rolls on their plates.  Their diameter was the size of my wrist.  So when I saw the Fusion Specialties section of the menu featuring ""entree-sized sushi rolls"" for more money than the hamburger entrees, I assumed that's what they had ordered.  I finally decided on the ""Mark's Roll"" - fresh tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, kani and scallion roll, coated with panko and flash fried, topped with Japanese cream sauce and sriracha, and served with ponzu dipping sauce.  Everyone else ordered burgers.  When our dinners were delivered, I was quite disappointed to find that my entree-sized sushi roll was no bigger than a larger-sized sushi roll at another restaurant.  It wasn't really ""entree-sized"" when everyone else got a HUGE, stacked burger with fries.  Don't get me wrong -- it was delicious, but I'd stick to getting a couple of the cheaper sushi rolls next time or else a big, thick, juicy burger.  For $10, they looked like quite the value.  

And, speaking of value, the kids' meals are about $5 on average.  There is a wide variety of choices for kids, and the meals come in bento boxes where every little cubby hole is FILLED with different foods.  The kids even got more food than me!

I'm looking forward to going back to Cowfish (despite my smaller meal) because there are SO many things to try on the menu (there's even a wide variety of salad entree choices), the prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is classy, yet casual.  I'll just remember to make a reservation next time!  (Or sit at one of the many, many spots along the lonnnnnnnnnnnng bar.) 

And, yes, there really is such a thing as a cowfish.  And you can see them swimming in the giant fish tank on the other side of the bar as you walk in the restaurant.",2011-01-13 17:02:10

I went in at CRAZYTIME. AKA lunch hour. The line was Chipotle-style in length. They had a pretty good system of the sandwich makers waving and a manager escorting those in line to the nearest worker. Very assembly line. That's fine. But for some reason, the bread didn't taste as fresh, the ingredients not as plentiful. That's sad. 

Maybe it was just a fluke. And really, who am I to complain? I got my sandwich fairly quickly and I ate it just as quickly. It tasted fine. But ... it wasn't up to DiBella's standards. Which is five stars all the way.

I'll visit again soon; maybe they're still working out their kinks. I'll try to go at an off-time and see if there's any difference.

By the way, I hate this parking lot. I always park in the back, but even that was a madhouse yesterday. Oh well. All the business dudes in Independence have to eat somewhere, and I suppose this new development is as good a place as any.",2011-07-08 14:05:34

I am not a frequent fast food connoisseur and don't eat it on the regular but the double stack was one of the only exceptions I would make every so often. Well they have taken it off their value menu and raised it to $1.79 and officially made it easy for me to never step foot in a Wendys again. It's just not that good to pay any more for.  They also reduced the nuggets to 4 pieces instead of 5.  And they increased the price of their small chili to $1.49.  I will miss your value meals and dollar double stack and your beautiful red pigtails Wendy. RIP Dave Thomas.,2011-07-07 19:43:33

The oriental wall paper is unique and the booths are comfy. One a Thursday evening at 8:30pm, the place was packed. We had to wait about 20 min before a table opened up. The place is small so be prepared to wait if you go during prime hours. The host was friendly making recommendations and suggestions. Our food came out promptly. 

My favourite dish of the meal was the steamed P.E.I mussels. The mussels were nice and juicy and I loved the tomato broth that came with it. One of my favourite parts of the dish was being able to dip the crunchy bread into it. The bacon bits added an extra depth of flavour, and made the dish extra delicious. 

I enjoyed the Black Angus Burger topped with poutine & red wine sauce. The cheese curds were melted nicely and the poutine topping was great. The burger patty was juicy and cooked well. I personally loved the hand cut fries, which were thick kind and not soggy. Add a little malt vinegar made them perfect.

We also ordered the grilled octopus with chorizo bolognese, fried Kale, & potatoes. The octopus was soft, but I didn't like the texture of the octopus. This was my least favourite dish of the night.

For dessert we got the home made pistachio ice-cream. The ice-cream was smooth, and not overly sweet. I liked the bits of pistachio in the ice-cream.

I got the Ace Manhattan. I was looking for something sweeter, and this cocktail didn't do the trick for me.

We found the produce items we were seeking, and the prices were pretty good.  Their meat counter is less impressive than the one in Mesa.

Their calenderia is good.  Reasonable prices and authentic food.  Their albondigas were really good, and my wife liked her caldo de res.  We consistently get tasty authentic meals there, and it's one of the better Mexican restaurants in the east valley.  But it is a calenderia.  No table service, and the tables aren't really private.

It's not, and thank your stars for that because this wee little cafe serves up an honest-to-goodness brekkie that's about too-good by half when compared to the price you'll pay.  This place is the very definition of good value!

Its simple menu is home cooking done well, with the little things that elevate it beyond most greasy spoons:  generous sides of fruit, fresh herbs for seasonings, presentation beyond just plunking stuff down on a plate.  Their sausages are fantastic, and I really should find out where they source them (or if they make them in-house).

Coffee is good, maaaaaybe a bit on the insipid side but I like my java STRONG, so I'm a bad judge.  It has good flavour, though, so I doubt most drinkers will be disappointed.  They served real cream -- or at least I'm pretty certain it was real -- not the cheapie half 'n' half or that crap that's got thickeners in it to trick you into thinking it's 100% dairy cream.  It sounds small, but it's one of the corners that's usually cut when it comes to a ""cheap breakfast"".

Finally, gotta mention its location -- steps from Kensington, which is always a plus.  Have a great breakfast in a quaint cafe, then hit up the hippies for some wicked shopping and people watching.

I don't care about unassigned seating. I always get an aisle seat. Just check in 24 hours early! Most people don't. You can even check in, not have a printer, then just pick up a boarding pass from the machine at the airport. I do that a lot for my return travel. 

Their frequent flyer program is good, I fly on southwest for free, a LOT. I just earned another ticket this week. I think it's my 5th! I also get free drink coupons in the mail from them. I never use them all, and so on a flight I'll be on right before they expire, I'll bring all I have with me and be mr. popular in the area I'm sitting, because I got the other nearby passengers free drinks.

Anyway, what do you expect? All airlines are more or less the same. If you're going to want something to eat or drink on the plane, just pack it with you. Then you can have exactly what you want. 

Southwest is a low priced carrier, but the seats are comfortable and the planes are clean. I mean, I get on the plane, sit in a chair for a few hours, and get off. I don't have too high of an expectation in terms of needing hosts/hostesses to fawn over you or smile or whatever. I just want to get there with my luggage, on time. They generally do that, are usually among the most reasonably priced, and their freq flyer program is great.  So I giver them a high rating!

About their freq flyer thing - when I book my hotel and rental car with it too, I can still use all my normal discount codes etc from membership in whatever, but also double dip on points!!! So - for example - I get say - Hilton points, Hertz points, AND Southwest miles - for booking it through the Southwest site. And the same price as booking directly. I don't know why Southwest doesn't advertise this? With the double dipping and frequent travel, I have been collecting points FAST since I figured this out recently.

We came here during Magic week in Las Vegas, so there were way more people at the restaurant than expected for a Tuesday night.

There was a little wait, but she was so pleasant it made up for any waiting we had to do.

The restaurant itself is really cool.  It's my favorite Cosmo restaurant interior.  I want that flooring in my house!!  I have yet to see the outdoor seating, but I bet it's very fun to eat with that view outside.

If you have never tried the double del cheeseburger, you have not lived.  But anyway, moving on, I have to give it to Comme Ca for cooking it perfectly to order.  The patty is really thick, I was surprised to see the whole burger medium throughout.  Many restaurants cannot do this!  I couldn't stop eating the fries either.

I also had the roasted lamb.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the burger, and it was served with a charred eggplant sauce (never had tried this before).  It was good, but the lamb wasn't very flavorful.  The eggplant sauce wasn't kicking up the party for me either.  But then again, I am no food critic.  It might be a fantastic combo for someone else, I would actually love to hear what people have to say about this dish.

Their menu offers a wide variety of items but what stood out to me was the truffleberry, Nutella and creme brulee. I asked the guy at the register what was in the truffleberry and he said chocolate and berries (might have been raspberries). My friend and I decided to go with hot Nutella latte and a creme brulee latte. A medium and a large came out to be around $9, which isn't bad considering Starbucks prices have gone up within the past year.

We got our drinks within 5 minutes, maybe less. I like my drinks on the stronger side and forgot to tell them less sugar... It was very sweet. Still drinkable but sweet. I also didn't get a hazelnutty taste. I had my friend try it and she couldn't put her finger on the taste either. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away. My friend enjoyed her creme brulee, saying it had a burnt sugar aftertaste. I tried it and it was ok. I think next time if I order a latte I'll ask for less sugar or stick to their classics or pour over coffee. 

I really like the chill atmosphere, not sure how it'll be during busy hours and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get any studying done here but it's a nice place to catch up with friends. Can't wait to come back to try something else!",2016-02-27 03:08:57

We have been to Charlie Palmer's many times and each was a pleasure, but wow, something has changed. We are experienced Vegas steak house clients (SW, STK, Circus Circus Steak, Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris) and we were so disappointed with this visit to Charlie Palmer's. We made a reservation for a special occasion and this was not mentioned when we checked in at the host desk. Service was just OK, we were really not made to feel welcome at all as we had in past visits. My husband's steak was not properly cooked (we both asked for medium rare, mine was perfect, his was almost raw) and the server ARGUED with us about it - amazing. At that price point, even if he asked for well done and it was raw you DO NOT ARGUE, just bring it back. We wanted wine by the glass, saw that it was $11/$12 per glass but it didn't specify the winery on the wine menu, asked the sommelier for his recommendation. Unfortunately we did not check the bill carefully and we eventually discovered that the wine was $28 per glass, shame on us, but one more mark against them that night. The food was OK, just OK for the price point - at that cost you are looking for the total experience, which Charlie Palmers has always provided in the past - we were so, so disappointed. The special occasion was just never mentioned - this has never happened before. We will not be back anytime soon.

A+ for atmosphere, I love the high ceilings, unique lanterns, and wood finishing on everything.  But let's get down to what really counts--the food!

Pineapple fried rice---The first thing we noticed is that it was a SOGGY mess.  Any Asian person knows that to make good fried rice, you need day old rice.  I was kind of hoping for fresh pineapple, but of course it was canned.  

Plum sushi lunch special--An assortment of fish with a roll.  Very nice presentation, not expertly put together roll but it was passable.

Tea leaf salad--A disappointment but of course I am comparing it to THE tea leaf salad from Burma Superstar in SF (and there's no comparing to that!).  Still, for what is basically just SALAD, they should not be charging 8 dollars.

Walking distance from St. Henri metro. Owned and operated by Tony Campanelli. He's the  same owner of Campanelli. I was looking forward in trying this pizza joint, sadly my eyes, palette, and wallet were not not at all pleased. Here's why.. 
To begin with, parking is a true challenge! Either it's reserved for residents only with permits, or there is no space to park. Let's not forget orange construction cones everywhere as well. 
As I walked into Adamo, I was taken by surprise as to how small and compact the store is. I say the store mainly because there are no tables or chairs to eat. You're surrounded by big bulky bags of flour and and cans of tomatoes. Along with a small fridge and a TV. That's right! You either order for take-out or you eat it on the dusty sidewalk. Of course that's if you can park! 
I had in mind to order a whole pizza to share with friends. The lady at the counter told me that was not possible. I was only allow to purchase the pizza by the slice. No whole pizza?! It had begin by a whole pizza in order to be sliced, no? Anywho. 
So I ordered two slices $4.00 per slice. Ouch! I still wanted to try it. My curiosity took over my wallet. 
So I ordered the tomato and cheese. Along with the cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil.  
The slices of pizza were nicely warmed up, upon ordering them. That was nice! 
As for the pizza slices.. Thin as a paper plate, dry, and quite tough to chew as well. The pizza with the cherry tomatoes had two squished tomatoes, three thinly sliced of basic and a dash of cheese. I'm not into oily and extreme cheese pizzas, but I do like to taste each ingredient. 
The tomato and cheese pizza was just ""Ok!"" I certainly won't brag about it. The canned tomato sauce had a nice taste. As for the cheese? No taste and very little melting factor. Bonus point for not being oily. Yet once again, it was dry!  
It's safe to say that I don't plan to return to Adamo anytime soon. With the combination of parking being a challenge, pizza being pricey, along with bland and dry. I will continue to visit many other wonderful pizza parlours throughout our city.",2016-06-26 20:29:19

Probably the best veal sandwich I've had in the city so far (I'm sorry, San Francesco's). These sandwiches are a little more expensive ($8.05 vs $6.50)...but they do accept Credit which is convenient . Only possible  down sides other than that:
-Location
-Lunch is busy and can get tight with heavy-set and sweaty blue collar dudes coughing 
-Takes a while to get (I waited aprx 15 minutes)

So call ahead, bring your visa, and enjoy the sandwich.

The place is nice, the decor is modernized with a contemporary flare, art paintings were out in the lobby as well as inside. It's a very intimate space because it's dark and a place where you would bring a date to. The bathrooms were very nice as well. Granite counter tops and unique faucets. This place also had a small bar by the bathrooms and had a lounge area too. 

For drinks, I had their Passion Drink Martini which tasted strong but well worth it because it went well with my dinner. My friend just ordered their Sapporo beer there.

Compliments from the chef - a small pastry with cream cheese and an Asian sausage. Tasted like pizza and it was one small bite of ""can i have another one""
After a few minutes, fresh bread was passed around my friend got their soft dough with rice wine painted on top and I got the crispy baguette. Both tasted scrumptious. 

For an appetizer, we ordered their Pepsi Shrimp because we were just curious with how they would incorporate the Pepsi in it. Kind of disappointed, didn't taste much of the Pepsi batter. It was just fried shrimp in a martini glass with a cucumber and pepper salad with fried white noodles. 

For our main course, I ordered their seared tuna with tomato-mango risotto and my friend ordered their Shellfish Bouillabaisse. The tuna was cooked perfectly and drizzled on top was a tangy sauce that I didn't care too much for. In the middle, it has the vegetable medley with colored cauliflower (orange and purple ones which I find interesting) which were edible. The risotto was somehow disappointing. From other places I've ate, risotto rice is short-grain and this version was long because it's Asian rice. Prepared with cream sauce, this risotto was a bit heavy for me. 

The Bouillabaisse was however, the best dish and wished i had ordered the same. It had a variety of seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops along with rice noodles and vegetables. The exact description is on their website. The broth tasted right with the curry coconut milk they had listed and the portion of this dish is very generous. It came out as a boat and literally could probably feed 1-3 people. 

I'd come again and try some of their other dishes.",2012-01-10 06:20:56

There were 4 of us plus an infant and the place was packed there's only 5 chairs to sit in and wait so you can imagine how there were people waiting everywhere. We stood against the wall for 55 minutes and I decided to go up to the host and ask how much longer. She told us it would be another 45 minutes. This is not ok. I told her we had already been waiting an hour and she explained she was sorry but there was a table of 20 waiting before us. That's fine however it's better to tell people ahead of time when they check in, that way we can make the decision of whether or not we want to wait. This is the second time this has happened to us.

I have to say Slab served me up a pretty delicious bacon cheese burger last night served on a fresh toasted bun, along with very fresh toppings, and free too!  A very good burger in my opinion. Although if i was to nit-pick, my only complaint would be their conservative use of bacon, it was delicious, cooked per order, but it was very thin and there was just not enough of it to really have much impact on the flavour of my burger. 

Their Poutine here was pretty good too, the serving for a small was quite generous, my only knock against it was that the gravy was just ok, it really could use more salt and spices, as it was really on the bland side, it wasn't terrible by any means, was just ""ok"", good fries, fresh Quebec curds, and again, great burgers, I'll definitely return.

And I'm a little thrown off at Bernie C.'s review below, he compares these fresh unfrozen, filler and preservative free burgers to a hybrid between the filler filled chewy and dry Harvey's factory made and frozen vs. Hero's filler filled chewy and dry factory made and frozen lol, did you even try the burger? or are you just trying to accumulate as many useless reviews as possible to pad your total?  Or maybe, and most likely, you just have no idea what a good burger is, I guess if you spending money on purpose at t Harvey's and Hero, you likely don't know much about burgers, as anyone patronizing those places sober couldn't possibly know what a good or decent burger is even if it slapped him/her in the face. :)

But enough about me, what you really want to know is why you should eat here:

1) I have never had a dish that I didn't like from Short Leash! It's hard to narrow it down to few favorites, but I definitely recommend the Aiko (add Sriracha if you like spicy), Moki, and Devil Dog. And definitely get the chips for your side. They are homemade and delicious! The fried pickles are also a great choice if you're looking to start with an appetizer.

If you happen to be here for dinner,  get the bacon-wrapped cheddar brats since they only serve it after 5 p.m. and also because it's amazing.

2) Not only are the toppings unique and interesting, but there is enough variety to satisfy everyone in a group. I have vegetarian friends that love Short Leash, and if you happen to have friends who eat gluten free, they can leave happy too.

3) You can definitely taste the freshness of your ingredients, and I love that everything comes from local vendors.

4) The staff at Short Leash are always super nice and welcoming, especially the owners Brad and Kat. 

5) Booze! They have a great selection of craft beers and they also have local AZ wines on tap. The truck was great on its own, but now that I can have a beer with my hot dog, it's just that much better.

6) Brunch! You might be wondering how a hot dog could possibly taste good at breakfast. I'm not quiet sure either, but Short Leash has found the secret, and it is damn delicious.

After all the hubbub about building this place, I am so glad they did.  It is going to become one of the biggest attractions in Vegas soon.  It is well done, well organized, engaging, and interesting.

If you go here, give yourself a lot of time!  There are 3 levels of exhibits and I spent 2 hours here.  And I would have spent longer reading all of the information in depth, but my husband and father in law were hungry.  There are so many interactive moments in this museum like shooting a Tommy Gun, lifting up the window on a brothel for more info (felt like a Peeping Tom!), the computerized model of the strip where you can zoom mobsters around on these hockey puck things and then they expand to show info about that particular person (I seriously played with that thing for about 20 minutes alone), and some nice, plush red theater seats where they show you the history of mobsters on film.  And I can't forget the actual courtroom where real trials were held.  They show this reenactment of a trial on three different screens, so you get a kind of 3D effect.

The wall of pictures showing all the gruesome deaths of mobsters was fascinating and terrifying.  I also really like the part at the end where they tell you secret mob code words.  At the end when you go through the gift shop, I was really tempted to buy all sorts of stuff!  Especially the dog toy shaped like a flask that says, ""Booze Hound.""
 
Oh!  And prices!  Locals are $10, but we bought a membership for $50 which gets us free admission for a year, plus any out of town guests get the locals rate, PLUS you can write it off on your taxes because it's technically a charitable contribution!

When the four of us stepped up to be seated the hostess never asked for a name just looked at her seating chart and sat us.  I personally did not feel warmly welcomed. And there were no other tables.   So you suggest I shouldn't taken care of it then instead of via social media.   Maybe the hostess should've acknowledge the reservation when we walked up and warmly suggest a drink at the bar until a more inviting table became available but instead treated us like walk ins and sat us in the far dark corner.

The first is that people who live in the Roosevelt Square probably can't afford to eat there very often. The second is that its location is a bit strange (no visible parking, the apartment gym on one side, a hippie coffee shop on the other). The last thing I've noticed is that it never seems to be busy. We went on a Friday night last year with a group of 11 or 12 and were seated within 15 minutes. Sure, they suffer because of the lightrail but I really just think it is a poor location.

Central Ave doesn't link to the freeway. Portland's is practically on top of the deck park tunnel which means anyone going to or getting off the freeway is going to miss it. There is a large gap between the north and south-bound sides of Central that also prevents North-bound drivers from seeing it. They are more likely to notice the Best Western (and its humble diner) than they are to spot Portland's. Apart from the Channel 12 news people who I see there on numerous occasions, my friends who live in Roosevelt Square never eat there. Sure this place will be buzzing when the lightrail stop directly across the street opens up, but until then, it is just sad.

Inside however, you will find a very elegant decor with plenty of that ""mood lighting"" that expensive restaurants use to mask the prices as well as the small portions of food you are receiving. The bar is very nice and well stocked with some of the best bar tenders this side of Mill Ave. The menu, with things like ostrich and a lasagna dish fail to make the grade. Everything is flavorless or over-complicated with drizzles and twigs/trees/lettuce/parsley. You'd probably enjoy this place for a date but not as a regular dine-out destination.

It is worth a stop. Walk by on a First Fridays and check out the menu. If you don't see anything that appeals to you, you're not alone, but sit down at the bar and grab a glass of wine and enjoy the mood lighting.",2008-12-16 06:15:04

I could have literally purchased one of everything but I took it easy as I know I'll be back.

The taste was boring and bland and salty. The portion was so pathetically small that I swallowed in 2 bites, for $5 (I chose not to include drink).

My friend had burger steak. It actually came with a side cole slaw too. It was salisbury steak with mushroom sauce. I had a bite....  Wow! The cole slaw tasted OK in a Filipino fast foods chain.

My man and I walked in on a random Tuesday night to a fully packed house. The 2 servers looked a bit overwhelmed but ushered us to a table (I was glad I had made a reservation!) and gave us some menus. As I looked around the restaurant, my excitement only grew. Lola's certainly makes you feel like you're at someone's kitchen in New Orleans. Several New Orleans photos hang on the walls, and a Saints flag is on display at the front of the restaurant. And, while the colorful umbrellas hanging from the pipes were a bit kitch, they were cute kitch. 

Unfortunately, it was the food that disappointed. First, bread caked with butter (I'm assuming garlic bread but we were not sure) came out to the table. It was almost inedible. Thankfully, the charbroiled oysters came out next, and they were delish. Soon to follow were the crawfish puppies (they taste a lot like conch fritters), which were also pretty good. Finally, what should have been the star of the show, the bronzed catfish served over grits, came out. As I dug into my first bite of the grits, any excitement I had for eating grits in Vegas went out the door... the grits were stone cold. I mean, super duper cold. When I asked my server if grits were supposed to be served cold, she said no and promptly took our plate back to the kitchen. I assumed that she was going to have the chef remake the plate and send it back (as we had like 4 bites total of the fish). Instead, they had simply removed the old grits, plopped new (potentially microwaved) grits on the plate, and reserved the same plate! Unfortunately, the fish got cold because it took about 5 minutes to bring the plate back! And, any stock on the plate had now disappeared because they had scooped it all out when getting rid of the old grits so that the food became extremely dry.

Service:
We had a large group that they weren't expecting.  Ok, we get that.  However, my friend tried for a week leading to our gathering to contact the Beer Market to ask about accommodating a group and reserving tables.  No answer, no message, no online web form, basically - no way to contact them.  So we went early to grab some tables.  The wait staff said, ""no problem, glad to have you.""  But they (two girls who were sisters) quickly mixed up orders, didn't bring drinks out, went missing for extending periods of time (only to come back from an obvious smoke break), and were unreliable.  Our group could really only succeed in getting a drink by going up to the bar and ordering one on their own.

Availability:
So there is about a 20 page menu of glorious beers at the Beer Market.  Almost any thing you can think of they have it ON THE MENU.  Yes, on the menu, but not in reality.

One or two, ok, but FIVE in a ROW, I don't think so.  And this happened over and over again as the night went on.

The amazing Michael Symon-style stone oven pizzas are definitely the highlight of the menu, along with the Belgian Frites.  Also recommend the Mussels.  I love that they always have a house white and house red wine on the menu for just $5.  Service is always friendly, and they carry Jeni's Ice Creams for dessert.  Love Bar Cento!

The food came quickly, and that was no small Greek salad!  They also had pita along with the salad, so it looked like a lot of food.  The salad itself looked fresh, but the dressing was overkill.  For being a ""healthy"" place, a dressing that tastes and looks like mayonnaise all over a salad does not qualify as healthy.  Something was off there.  As for my friend, she said the hummus was bland and no where near Pita Jungle's.  While I don't agree Pita Jungle is the best or most authentic hummus, to each their own.

Justin Beckett has done an excellent job of rehabbing this old restaurant into an attractive compound of businesses that includes Southern Rail and First Draft Book Bar. Southern Rail is the crown jewel. The booths are holdovers from Beefeaters, but everything else seems to be new. I especially liked the large windows that open up to a patio facing Camelback; the light rail whizzes right past. 

I was mixed on the food and drinks. I got a Rail Runner, which didn't taste as good as the description (bulleit bourbon, lemonade, soda) and came in a fairly small julep cup. The cornbread was tasty and I liked the accompanying black pepper honey butter, but it only came with 3 small cornbread muffins. My wife got the flatiron, which was cooked well and had a bit of spice to it that we enjoyed. Surprisingly, my gumbo was not spicy at all. The andouille sausage was pretty good (but still not that spicy), but everything else fell flat. That was the most disappointing, as the gumbo seems to be one of the featured items. The mac n' cheese came to the rescue, however. You'd think mac n' cheese would always be good, but I've had some fairly mediocre mac at restaurants, so I complement Southern Rail's.

All of the foregoing could be forgiven except for the fact that Southern Rail is pricey. Being pricey is okay where you feel like you're getting the right bang for the buck, like at the sister restaurant Beckett's Table, but that wasn't the case for me here. The high price point makes me consider this more of a 2.5 star review.",2014-09-14 19:53:28

Everything here is slightly more compressed than the Matthews location - booths narrower, tables closer. Service more harried because they do a LOT more business here - even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'. 

I could be imagining things, but I feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. Servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm-sized burrito, anyway. 

Onto the food: I got the Macho Burrito, he got the usual (fajitas). Now, I've had the Macho at Don Pedro, the other Azteca location, and here - it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. This was by far the best version I'd had - because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat (which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before). Goooood. A mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack I'm used to, continuing the low-sodium thing (except for the nopales). Awesome.

Fajitas were, well, Azteca Fajitas - smothered in sweet teriyaki-style flavors. Weird.

My boyfriend and I ordered popcorn chicken bento ($6.99), Japanese style tako pancake ($4.49), Takoyaki - squid balls ($4.49) and deep fried pork belly ($5.99).

The Japanese style tako pancake and the squid balls were both disappointment to me. I think I'm just not into this type of fried, doughy dishes. It was a bit too much to share two fried, doughy dishes between two people and I wish we ordered something else.

The deep fried pork belly was a major hit for us. Who can resist pork belly?! It's fried on the outside and cut into thin slices. I would highly recommend anybody to get this dish.

The food is just ok. I guess I was expecting an amazing hamburger and it was just very regular. I didn't enjoy the bun at all and felt the toppings were a bit lacking. I ordered the ""Bull-gogi Burger"" and was expecting a flavor explosion, but it just wasn't. Just a little blander than I was expecting. Still a pretty tasty burger cooked well, but nothing I'm dying to go back and try again. My black cow alcoholic float was pretty good, but honestly I think I would have preferred it without alcohol. The fries were so-so. I got the steak fries, but they were really more like wedges and I wasn't really a fan of the seasoning. I tried my fella's skinny fries and preferred them. 

It was my friend Ryan B's birthday, so we received a free round of jell-o shots and a plethora of outrageous desserts that none of us had room to eat. I tried the carrot cake and the funnel cake and they left a lot to be desired. They just didn't pack the punch I had been hoping. There were interesting, but if you're going to be interesting at least try to make them tasty. The carrot cake was shaped like a carrot and was a super cute concept albeit somewhat phallic. It was paired with carrot ice cream, but I really wasn't feeling it. The funnel cakes were topped with ground up cereal, but I would have preferred a fruit or creamy topping.

The menu here is nothing special they have the staples of any hotel menu, while everything is prepared correctly, well seasoned, and has a nice presentation; I feel the food lacks a ""WOW"" factor. Everything seems very ordinary to me, like the way the flat bread looks like a pizza, even though is just flat bread. The food is good but not exceptional, plus they don't have something that is uniquely theirs. Something that makes their restaurant stand out. 

A few weeks back they were selling hotdogs outside on the street making competition for the hard working hotdog vendors that depend on that for their livelihood. ""Good job SOCO!"" he said in a sarcastic tone...

This neighborhood pub attempts to make everyone feel at home with their comfortable interior and friendly service.

Dora here. Oops. Forgot to snap a picture of that comfortable, inviting interior. I was so impressed with all the beautiful exterior seating.

While we waited for our appetizer, the server dropped off complimentary scones. Fresh out of the oven hot, the coconut pineapple pecan scones melted in my mouth although I couldn't really taste the pineapple.

Dora here. I'd go back just for the scones! Soft, light and delicious!

The Mexican Street Corn Fritters may be some of the best I've ever eaten! Roasted corn on the inside, good texture and golden brown on the outside. The honey-lime cilantro aioli paired perfectly with the fritters.

Dora here. Such a wonderful blend of textures with the crisp outside and soft inside, and loaded with corn. Loved, loved, loved the lime aioli. 

The Chicken and Waffles dish was huge! Chicken battered in 12 Herbs and Spices, malted milk waffles, Vermont maple syrup and two soft scrambled eggs. The eggs and waffle took a back seat to the fried chicken. Crispy, tender and moist. Outstanding!

Dora here. I visited Peculiar Rabbit with a dear friend a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it so much, I was anxious to bring Ernie back. The last time, I sampled the PR Burger. Awesome, btw, but this time I ordered the Chicken Biscuit. A giant cheddar biscuit with fried chicken breast, American cheese, hot sauce and mayo served with crispy breakfast potatoes. Yum! A tad spicy, which I like, but I preferred to eat the chicken and biscuit separately. The breakfast potatoes were tasty with the perfect amount of seasoning. I wanted to cry that I had to leave some on my plate. Maybe the next time we'll check out that rooftop deck. :)

I have been here twice so far and it is about time I show some love with a review! 

I have to admit, went here once during the Summer, BAD mistake. Yeah it must have been close to 103 degrees that night. Rather than watching a movie we ended up playing an unplanned session of wet t-shirt contest. I will never forget the echo in my ear's ""we need more ice ...and fast...I am dying"" 

The first visit was flat out miserable, yet due to a lack of judgment and being the spontaneous type that we are, made for an interesting night in the car! Yeah we were not thinking clearly, hmmm it is 10pm and still 103 in the desert? Uh hello! We are lunatics! 

The second visit was much better as I went during Winter! Yay! We had a blast and truly enjoyed ourselves ""watching the movie that is""! lol 

I think I counted four screens so you also have a choice in movies!

The snack shop is awesome, has all of the goodies you would want and need for a fun drive-in snack experience. 

Popcorn, Nathan's hot dogs, tons of ice cream, frozen lemonade, assortment of candies, sodas, etc. 

This is a treat and so glad we have a real drive-in still left!

Walking in there are a number of things that catch your eye - a nice wide room, old school kitchy tables and chairs,  odd dragon sculptures over the bar and various toys, knick-knacks surround you - nothing quite matches but somehow it all fits together. A cute couple of tables set apart up a step or two seems a great place for a private conversation. The bar is situated in the middle of the room with a number of beers - definitely their focus and typical stocked alcohol beyond that. Sadly for me wine choices are limited to two: red or white. But found it was drinkable nonetheless. 

The hook for me are the FREE old school arcade games at the back - hello Tetris!! Something I hope they retain although to be honest, I'd probably pay to play too. 

The crowd is decidedly hipster with a mix of young and...more mature revellers. It can get loud but it was a friendly and happy place. And the prices are more than fair - I'd even say possibly even on the cheap side!

This is not Northern Mexico/Sonoran food. These are from family recipes from the region around Mexico City. All of these reviews claiming inauthentic food are from dumb know-it-all's that have never had anything but sonoran style. 

The food is spiced very differently. Words like quesadilla refer to something entirely different. Once you let go of your filibertos based preconceptions you are in for a treat!

I usually recommend the #5, #6 or Clare Burro for first timers. Either of the combos will treat you too the incredible chorizo. This delicately spiced meat is much more subtle in spice and more finely ground than its boarder land counter part. The #5 will offer the chorizo atop a tostada, while the #6 will present it on their sope. Here a sope is sort of like a tostada with fried masa instead of a fried tortilla. Finally the Clare Burro is a whole bean burrito with avocado, an amazing house green sauce, and the always spectacular white Mexican cheese.

I like some semblance of authenticity, but keep an open mind that things end up ""Americanized"" to make it more appealing to the masses. 

I tend to find that ""hole in the wall"" establishments are the best. This place is no exception. The neighborhood this divey restaurant is in is dicey at best. Definitely a little unnerving in the evening times. If you were to judge this place at ""face value"" you wouldn't go in. The building is not at all attractive and looks more like a corner bar from the outside. But, momma always told me not to judge a book by it's cover.

I bought a Groupon to this place and boy, am I glad I did. What a gem! The inside is huge. Honestly, you'd never guess it from just the outside view. Well, that and the fact they have like 10 parking spots. The parking sucks...just being honest. So, if you come here when it is busy, expect to park on the side street. But back to the inside....the decor in here is pretty cool. It is well maintained and is definitely clean. Clean is like number one for me when I review a restaurant. I do not care how good the food is, if it is dirty, you have lost me. Plenty of seating to accommodate large groups or just a simple one on one date. The menu is simple with the typical Mexican fare. Nothing crazy out of the ordinary. We came right at 3 and placed our to go order. Within 15 minutes we were on our way to Edgewater to enjoy our little picnic.

1) Chicken burrito ala carte: This burrito was definitely on the larger side but very very simple. Definitely a more traditional burrito. Lots of shredded chicken, a nice soft tortilla and plenty of yummy and bubbly cheese. Simple flavors that just plain work!

2) Chicken fajita dinner: I am a fajita-aholic. I love fajita....and this dish definitely didn't disappoint. Lots of yummy veggies, tender and juicy chicken and just the right amount of spices and flavor. The veggies were cooked perfectly too. Not all soggy and gross....just enough bite! The fajita dinner comes with pico, refried beans, guac and Spanish rice. I will break these down one by one:

a) The pico was super fresh and full of flavor. I could tell this stuff was hand done and I love the amount of cilantro they used. I could eat this stuff as a side on it's own. 
b) The refried beans have to be some of the best I have had. Again, simple yet effective flavors. They are cooked perfectly too. Nice and moist and not at all greasy. Topped with some yummy cheese that is broiled to a nice bubbly brown.
c) I absolutely loved the guac. I cannot say enough about the flavor of this stuff. It was perfect and definitely fresh. Another thing I could eat as a side on it's own!
d) Spanish rice is a hit or miss at most places. This place is a hit. Perfectly cooked (not soggy, not hard) and just the right about of flavor. Some places serve you bland and soggy rice. Not here. This stuff was right on point!

It's in the middle of the up and coming (but don't tell the hipsters holed up there) Polish Hill and its bright red sign sticks out pleasantly amongst the drab row houses surrounding it.

The inside is eclectic and interesting. Posed figures walk up walls and odd art gives you something cool to look at while you sip your coffee. Their lunch selection seems interesting enough that I made a mental note to come back and try it. Their posts on Facebook about their weekend brunches make me feel like I need to go back very very soon.

The lattes we ordered were good, not great. I'm a bit spoiled with my close proximity to Tazza D'Oro, what can I say. My large latte came in a tall, glass drinking cup which I found kind of cool in an off-kilter way. Kinda like drinking wine out of chipped mugs while wearing flannel.

The pineapple upside down cake I bought was gooey and delicious. All of their  other homemade baked goods looked killer as well.

The barista behind the counter was bearded and all smiles and even brought out drinks to the table, something I didn't expect but turned out to be one of those little, warm things that make a place stand out.

I definitely want to check out Lili again, even if it's a bit too far away to be my local haunt. I'm especially interested in their brunch and lunch selection.",2011-02-25 04:28:53

Service was excellent...until they got busy. We arrived around 6 and they only had 2 other tables and a few people at the bar. We seated immediately, our server got us water and took our drink orders immediately. He explained the menu and made recommendations, food came out pretty quickly and he came back to check-in our us regularly. Towards the end of our meal was then they got busy, the restaurant filled up and it was clear they were under-staffed. I asked for a soda re-filled and waited about 15 minutes until I got it, we just asked for the check and left. Even though service lacked a little towards the end I would say service was really good. The 3 start is for the food. 

Presentation was excellent, very instagram worthy. I think they have unique ideas and concepts but lacked flavors in my opinion. 

Oysters - We got them with the spicy cocktail sauce which I liked and the Thai chili granita which I did not care for. But my biggest issue with these oysters as that they were very warm, like a couple degrees above room temperature. I am not an oyster expert or anything but I have always had oysters cold...these were so warm they feel like eating cheap Chinese buffet oysters. That totally killed the dish for me. 

Crisply Octopus - Love the idea of fried octopus and really liked the curry sauce that came with it but the octopus itself was too tough and hard to eat. It is very lightly breaded but too tough to eat, doesn't have have chewy sharpness that octopus usually has. 

Bao Sliders - These were so cute to look at! The buns were fluffy and sweet, love the quail egg on top, but even with the pork sausages and the aioli it tasted very bland. The flavors did not pop at all, I tasted the slight sweetness of the buns and the slight saltiness of the sausages, no strong flavor to hold everything together. 

Salmon Clay Pot - Extremely disappointed with this dish. Big and delicous piece of salmon...the only good thing about the dish. The eggplant and the farro were so bland..none of us liked this dish. If they had some sauces on top or on the side that would have helped. Salmon is bland on its own, the farro and eggplant added to the blandness. 

Duroc Pork Belly and Slow Cooked Short Rib - These two dishes were delicious. The meats melts in your mouth, so soft and sweet. Strong flavors, love the sticky rice that came with the pork belly. Very impressed with these two. 

So out of the 3 appetizers and 3 main dishes I only enjoyed the two main dishes. I think this place has potential, they have interesting ideas but I think they need to work on adding more flavors to their dishes. Most of the dishes were bland and just did not satisfy my appetite as much as I would have liked.",2017-06-10 16:58:09

First, the food.  a wide selection of burgers (and other dishes). I'm a sucker for the Hula (swiss cheese, mushrooms).  You can get a turkey burger or a veggie burger instead of the beef (I opt for the turkey which is very good).  You can also choose a wheat or white bun.  Both are very good. 

Your burger comes with fries or onion rings or veggies.  The fries are just the way I like them, crisp on the outside, soft in the middle.  The onion rings are OK but not great.

Now the service.  Outstanding!  I think the average age of the servers is 18.

This weekend my husband soundly chewed me out because, according to him, in my haste to complete the long delayed bathroom project, I prematurely removed the wad of plastic grocery bags that he had shoved in the open floor drain to protect it from the aforementioned toddler.  

After reinstalling our toilet we discovered that the toilet drain was now hopelessly clogged.  

We tried plunging it.
We tried snaking it.
We even tried chemical main line drain cleaner.

Nada, zip, zilch.

It was blocked solid and bubbling up into the shower when we ran water into that drain.  

CRAP!!! (Literally.)

In desperation I turned to Yelp for a plumber and here I found Ron and his company.  I called Ron at 7 AM today and left a message, explaining my issue and asking if there was any chance he could come by today since I was off work.

Not only did he call me right back, but he was on his way to my house within an hour and within 20 minutes had found the problem and fixed it!  Not only did he clear the main line obstruction, but he ALSO reinstalled my toilet for me as a favor! Folks, I could not be more impressed!  I will definitely be calling him again anytime I have a plumbing issue.  Heck, Ron even invited me to call him if I just have a plumbing question!  How many professionals offer that kind of service?

So, to sum it up:

Main line snaked and obstruction removed by the nicest plumber in Phoenix? $120

Town Square needed a delicious Cantina and Tequila Bar and sadly.....this place gets two thumbs way down from moi. The only reason Lolita's is getting one star is for the cocktails. Other than that I have nothing positive to say about this place! Let me break it down for you.

Decor/Atmosphere: Blah. The furniture and decorations appear very cheap and lacking style. Almost as if it was thrown together at the last minute. The interior designer should be fired. They also can't seem to get the lighting down either. The music was too loud for my taste, too. 

Food: Double blah. The salsa will usually set the mood for the rest of the meal and this left alot to be desired. Bland and too much of a sweet tomatoe taste. Secondly we had the mini quesadillas which tasted as if they were straight out of the freezer section at the grocery store and lacking depth in flavor. Lastly for my entree I chose the Carne Asada Plate which was just aweful. The meat was tough and chewy and had tons of grizzle. The black beans were bland as hell. Do you even think I felt like wasting another dime on dessert? No way, Jose. 

Service: Triple Blah!!! All I expect from servers is to keep my glass full, table semi-clean, and bring to the table what I ordered. Simple? For starters the drink I ordered was a Kettle-GingerAle and I was delivered a Jack and Coke. My guest also was delivered the wrong beverage. Then when it came to the food it took seconds for our appetizer which only confirms it was frozen and it felt like five years to get my beef jerky Carne Asada dish.

This is a huge consignment store. Most consignment stores I have visited will have price tags on the item. This store has 6 digit number on the tag. You then go to an electronic kiosk and type in the number and a photo and description pops up on the screen along with a price. I knew I was in trouble when the employee orienting me to this complex process tells me that items that come up at less than $20 are the actual price, but that anything over $20 and you are supposed to hunt down an employee and have them submit a bid on the item. They then communicate with the seller (allow 10 minutes for each bid) and see if the seller wants to make a counter offer and so forth.
I browsed the stuff in the store. Most was garage sale type items. I did find a nice wheel chair in good condition for my husband. I went to the kiosk and saw that the asking price was $249. I had thought it was worth about $50 used. I'm thinking that it would take at least 4 bids and counter offers to come to a price that was acceptable.

I've been Yelping on and off for about nine months and during that time never --- I say NEVER ---  have given five stars to any restaurant.  Much to my surprise and delight, I've found the perfect quick serve meal in the most unlikely of places: a food truck!

The local food trucks and specifically, Short Leash, have had their fair share of ""ink"" recently and I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me.  The long line in the hot Phoenix weather during last week's Food Truck Friday was long forgotten once I bit into a ""Regular"" (pictured) with ""Lady"" toppings.  The hot dog was cooked to perfection with it's slightly crispy casing and flavorful meatiness.  I had no idea it would be served on naan, but loved the soft, light freshness of it all.  And the toppings?  The Lady includes Chipotle Cream Cheese, sauteed Onions and fried Pickles ... all of which created a wonderful combination of flavors, though did not overpower the flavor of the meat.

I was so impressed with Short Leash that I made a point of visiting again THE VERY NEXT DAY!  This time it was The Chicken (pictured) with Aoki toppings (Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo) which blew me away.  Whoever came up with these flavor combinations is a genius!

This Marriott is in the process of being upgrade to meet the new Marriott Branding. As of July 2016, the Restaurant, Lobby, and Concierge Lounge are still under reservations, and for that reason, I can't fairly comment on those until they have been completed. 

Pro's: 

+Location - Conventionally located with in walking distance to many of the sports stadiums, restaurants, the transportation center, and the convention center. It is within a quick ~15 minute Uber/Lyft ride to the airport depending upon the traffic.

+Room setup- You will either love the new setup or hate it. The design is geared towards Millennials. The carpet is now replaced by hardwood floors and the desk and chair is replaced by a long wall bench and small table

+TV-  They have upgraded their TVs to be the larger smart TVs. Have a Netflix or Hulu account, just logon to it to stream to your hearts content

+Gym- Marriott has seriously upgraded this. Rows of treadmills, an on demand studio where you can workout the the tv, free weights, and more

+Power Outlets - Many are located throughout the room with USB ports as well

+Wifi- Two tiered and works well. See cons

+ Staff - extremely helpful and friendly

+Shower - tall shower head, plus with a smaller extension to use

+Restaurant - new and improved menu. Gluten Free items are clearly marked


Con's:

- Wifi- Expect to pay if you don't have status. $9.95/day lower speed, high speed is $14.95/day  high speed

-Parking is valet only and $25/day

-Noise - if your room is off of Trade Street, you can hear some noise, even at higher levels

-Rack Rate- It is not the cheapest. Look for one off days for cheaper rates. Also, currently considered a Category 7, so expect for higher point redemption rate.",2016-07-08 03:58:43

I ordered the bossam (steamed pork).. and that was amazing.. making a little Korean wrap with the radish and the kimchee.. Awesome! 

and the wife got yookgaejang.. meh.. good broth.. not to spicy but they can definitely accommodate to your spice level fix.. i only tasted it so i cant really say much.. 

rice was good and perfectly cooked.. and the water was cold.. and i really liked that they have metal / thermal whatever cup carafe for the water.. 

and they got metal chopsticks.. (they also offer wooden chopsticks)..

Justine aka Foodigatorj highly recommended that I try Galleria Supermarket's Mom's Chicken which is only available at the Toronto Branch. I probably go there 2-3 times a month to stock up on Korean Noodles and Kimchi, so it was no brainer for us.

 A whole Chicken cost around $20 (also available in 1/2) and takes 30 minutes to make, so I'll recommend ordering it as soon as you get there and do your shopping while you wait.

We decided to eat it there as lunch and the 2 of us can barely finish the 1/2 Chicken.

You get to choose between regular and spicy.... we ordered spicy but it was very mild, the pieces are very huge which made it rather messy to eat. I would def bring it home to eat next time and would be perfect with a glass of beer or Makkoli (Korean rice wine).
 
You can actually watch how it's made at the open kitchen... it's coated with a seasoned flour and water mixture and deep fried for at least 15 minutes. Then it is toss very generously in a gochujang (Korean spicy red pepper paste)  mixture / sauce.

It came with a side of vinegar pickled radish (Korean version of slaw / celery stick) which was very cooling and refreshing after eating the sticky saucy chicken.

 Verdict :
 Crunchy, moist and recklessly sauced goodness

I am a meat eater, but I like to eat as little as I can to help the environment more. This is one of the places that could convince me that I don't need to eat it at all.  They have super creative dishes that are homemade and tasty.  I've been here twice now and only got one thing that a small disappointment (stuffed cabbage with bulgar wheat).  It's currently not on the menu, so I think they got enough feedback that it was just ""meh.""  On the latest visit we got the pierogis, tartines, both kinds of sandwiches (Baba Jaga and Special) and the kluski slaskie.   All were either very good or excellent.  Pierogis were definitely the favorite of the table.  The only quibble with the sandwiches were that they were messy to eat with hands (but so tasty!).  So I tried to cut and eat them and it was hard to cut the bread with a knife for some reason.  Our neighbors got the soup and they said it was delicious.  At the end, we had the Piernik dessert which was gingerbread with prune puree in the middle.  One of my friends thought it was too much prune (I think a personal preference).  I did not feel the same. I that it worked well together and was a great ending to a very different eating experience.  

Logistics of the restaurant are a little different than normal sit down places.  You have to know what you want when you walk in and go to the counter to order.  Then they give you a number, you have to find a place to sit and your food is brought to you.  You still have a server who refills water, clears plates and brings you a box. I'm not sure what would happen if you forgot to order something and wanted to add it.  Would you have to wait in line again or could your server add something on and charge you for it?  Probably because they also serve cocktails and beer so you might want to order more of those, but not sure.  My recommendation is go online and look at the menu, confirm that it's still on the board when you get there and order everything at beginning.  They won't bring your dessert until you ask for it which was nice.",2017-04-10 16:26:13

The nigiri and the oysters are awesome.  Not a huge or creative selection of sushi rolls but the quality and cuts of the fish are great.  I don't think this place will win any design awards because it's pretty divey, but when I sat at the sushi bar the chef washed his hands between every single order.  Plus I have never gotten sick so I guess they must have a better level of cleanliness than you would think at first glance.  

I realize now this doesn't seem like a glowing 5 star review, but take my word for it, if you like nigiri and oysters this place is really freaking good.",2017-05-17 20:47:37

Since the opening of this location last year, my parents have been wanting to bring the family here because it was one of their favorite restaurants when they lived on the East Coast years ago.

Cracker Barrel definitely gives me that mom-and-pop feel. You walk up to the restaurant to find a long porch lined with wooden rocking chairs from beginning to end and as soon as you go through the double doors, you'll find yourself in well, the ""Old Country Store"". There are a lot of novelty items for sale such as sodas in glass bottles and old fashioned candies and snacks that are sure to get the nostalgia flowing. Our wait time for the table was about 15 minutes or less and it went by fast since we were all browsing the gift shop.

The dining area of Cracker Barrel was a lot smaller than I had imagined and the table we were at was a bit close to the party next to us, so it was difficult to get in and out of your chair without bumping into someone. Our server Jeff was very friendly. He took the time to explain the menu to us as well as what specials were being offered. We all ordered a meal from the Fancy Fixin's menu. It came with your choice of any three Country Vegetables N' Sides and two made-from-scratch Buttermilk Biscuits or Corn Muffins.

I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken and chose mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and whole kernel corn. I also opted for one buttermilk biscuit and one corn muffin since I couldn't choose between the two. Our meals came out in a decent amount of time. I looked at my plate and was reminded of those TV dinners that my mom would tell us to nuke in the microwave when she didn't feel like cooking. The chicken fried chicken was nice and crispy. I like that the sausage gravy didn't make it soggy. The portion was huge! I could not finish it. My sides were okay, nothing special. I'm def a fan of the buttermilk biscuits though. Corn muffins were a little salty and didn't really taste like corn bread.

Everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was good and prices were great! We will be back again soon, but for breakfast! If you're looking for a decent, filling, homestyle meal, Cracker Barrel's got you covered.",2017-05-28 17:01:10

I love those, but they have no clue how to prepare them.  It should be ham, turkey, swiss on bread that is egg dipped and deep fried then sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Side for added flavor is either maple syrup or a sweet jelly/jam such as strawberry.  Well,  they got the ham, turkey and cheese ok (but not much of it) and the bread was like almost a whole loaf!  It was deep fried but you though you were eating slightly flavored bread.  They provided some sort of a berry ""dip"" to spread but overall it couldn't hold a candle to New York Deli (that burned down 10 years ago) or the Pine Tree Restaurant of Spring Mountain that CLOSED two years ago.  Short version... there's no where in Southern Nevada that knows how to make a Monte Cristo.

Part two...my wife had the bar-b-que sandwich which was ok BUT...they provided their version of a bar-b-que sauce that was the color, consistency and FLAVOR of catsup with a little bit of pickle in it.  She ate the sandwich but the sauce was a waste of time.

1.  Service - Friendly staff and quick to serve you. Young and pretty cool.

2.  Quality - So far, I would say, I cannot tell any difference. It seems just like new!  The screen was left with all the technician's smudge marks on it, however, that is neutral for me and not an issue. These guys are good and busy, so wiping a screen is not the concern.  Although when you pay for Apple to fix this stuff, they usually will clean the screen and package the repair nicely. (Of course it costs more too.)

3.  Price - I read the other reviews where people who paid 40.00 to repair cracked glass.  So, either I was ripped off, or the others that reviewed did not have an ipod touch 4g.  In any case, I believe I got a great price as at the Apple on line, the repair is gonna cost 149.00, if it is not ""abused"".  And, they may give you a replacement, meaning all your data is gone.....

HOW IT WORKS: It's a ceramic studio filled with plain, unfired pottery pieces from christmas ornaments, cups, interesting mugs, plates, ice-cream shaped containers, dinosaur figures etc. You pay a studio fee for each person participating ($8 for adults, $6 for kids) to paint, glaze, and fire the piece you choose. Then, you get to choose from their wide selection of ceramic pieces. Each item price varies depending on what it is. It can be pricey ($3 - $40?) There's plenty of pieces for $15-$25 from when I checked (mugs for ours). This outing can be expensive, but pretty cheap if you plan on doing something small.  

You get to use as much paint as you like (wide selection of different hues to get just the right one you envision!), and for however long as you like.  Definitely fun to look at the different types of blues and purples they have. There's plenty of tables set up with a slew of different brushes to use.  They also have lots of stencils (symbols, letters, numbers etc.) for us artistically challenged! The sponges, pencils, and markers are there to help you plan out your favorite design. There's also a blow dryer there for you to use to get a coat to dry faster. 

If you want to copy a specific image (example: logo) onto your piece, just ask the awesome staff there to show you how. You can pull up the image on the computer they have set up there, resize it to your liking, and then print it. They'll show you how to etch it on there using copy paper and you just trace it! What ends up happening is that the image's outline you traced will end up on the piece. And then you just go over it with paint.   

If you're afraid of being clumsy with the paint brushes, there's no worries. They have a pen-needle paint dispensers for each color (think of those kiddle glue containers, but way less bulky and the point is needle-thin) for you to hold like a pencil and use to paint for the detailed stuff (e.g. handwriting a quote, numbers etc.). 

Once you're done painting, just tell the someone and they'll do the glazing for you and you get a call to come back and pick up your piece around 4-7 days. It's fun to see the colors saturate from pastel to bright hues! Definitely a fun outing.

We went here for a night-time date and we didn't get to finish painting because of closing time. Did not expect to take so long to decide what to design on our cups! If you don't finish by closing time, no worries, they let you come back whenever you want to finish up (have your receipt ready) My suggestion is to definitely go during the day.  This place is perfect for kids! Or for an outing with some friends. Also a great choice for a date for your boyfriend or your girlfriend to make fun of each other and get creative. I had so much fun here and the staff is really helpful! They helped us out with lots of different techniques and for whatever questions we asked. We hope to come back sometime soon =]",2013-02-03 10:36:00

Each of their cakes and flavour combinations are well thought out. Delicate, flavourful, light and absolutely delicious. Their soft serve is amazingly simply yet addictive with a silky smooth texture. Cookies are some of the best I've ever had; buttery, crumbly and very flavourful.

For such an extensive  wait, it's fair to assume that you are ordering something made-to-order and done to perfection... Not in this case. For starters, the appropriate description for this failure should be ""would you like a doughy crust with your cheese explosion"". There was easily over 36 ounces of cheese mixed with uncooked peppers and onions and a small portion of protein tucked under the cheese bed, then tomato paste slathered over the top. 

My family made the decision to go to dinner because we were hungry. The bar was raised a notch when we opted in to the hour pizza. It was such a bust that 2 bites in, we began brainstorming on how we could put it in our new-wave oven at home and cook it till the doughy crust was done, but would that mean the raw peppers and onions mixed in with the cheese would be done too? Wait a second here, that's why we came out to dinner... for the Oreganos chefs to do that part.

Blueberry Cake Donut

Apple Fritter

Considering myself a bit of a donut connoisseur I found it somewhat surprising that I'd not heard of KD's Donuts and Kolaches when browsing local eateries down in Henderson, the small shop with more than a handful of Yelp! reviews and a fair number of Foursquare Check-Ins, as well.  Located on Sunset with clever signage and clean décor it was to an admittedly amusing display that I entered the small store and left with plenty of time to peruse the options as an elderly couple attempted to speak English to a store clerk lacking knowledge of even the difference between 'yes' and 'no' I took a simple point-and-nod approach, my three item order tallying just $3.47 as I sat to dine-in.  Admittedly a skeptic based on an already diminished selection as early as 9:00am it was with a small fritter that my sampling began and as the lone one remaining my early suspicions were quickly confirmed, the doughy disc either a day-old or the result of a base entirely lacking anything but flour.  Discarding the fritter after only one bite it was onto the old fashioned that I moved and although a step in the right direction the results were not much better - a bit of tang amidst a decent crumb beneath a sugary glaze flecked with dark bits of unidentifiable taste.  Last, and thankfully not least, a basic blueberry cake donut was clearly artificially flavored but at least offering some semblance of freshness it was the only option of which I ate more than a bit, the server staring blankly from behind a small television as I discarded the rest and made my way to the street.

Failing at even the most basic task of serving fresh donuts while presenting the sort of language barrier I'd assumed only present by crossing a border I cannot fathom why anyone would visit KDs except out of convenience, and even then I'd much rather spend the money on gas than suffer such a lackluster experience.",2014-09-28 00:11:43

The matcha cream puff was light and featured a crisp exterior pastry. The inside cream filling was delightful with their strong matcha. They use some great quality matcha here and it was not overly sweet. 

The kurogama latte wasn't anything to write home about though. It wasn't warm enough and the black sesame was really light. It was lacking a richness.

Calme en après-midi et agitée en soirée, le Réservoir est un endroit qui s'affiche discrètement sur la liste des brasseries montréalaises. Pourtant elle mérite le détour, ne serait-ce que pour goûter les produits qu'elle propose.

Leurs bières anonymes, uniquement définies par le genre (Noire, Rousse, Blonde, Blanche, Scotch Ale, Weizen, etc.) ne sont pas pour autant sans âme. La Blonde (Pilesener), très céréalière et anormalement limpide, semble cependant avoir été étouffée par une montagne de houblon, comme si l'on avait voulu cacher quelconque anomalie gustative... La bière aux cerises se démarque du lot.

Les plats sont assez élaborés; le ragoût de pieuvre et chorizo ou encore l'assiette de fromage, pour ne nommer que ceux-là, tenteront sans doute les adeptes de tentacules et de moisissures bon goût...

A good example is our most recent visit last night. Our server Tim was first rate and we experienced no problems. In fact, Tim as great. Now I order the French Dip as I have recently, but last night they...  well served some well done and hard to digest meat (photo). I've also posted another French Dip photo from 6 months ago.

Popped has everything you've ever wanted out of popcorn. From the super inviting to popcorn shop to the endless delivery trucks of popcorn, Popped is popping in Vegas and serving nationwide.

Let's get started with all this preposterous nonsense about Frozen Popcorn. It all starts with your choice of a sweet flavored popcorn. The sweet flavors include Bling Bling Cookies and Cream, Chocolate Tide, Coconut Marilyn, Nerds Pink'adelic, S'mores, and more! After you've chosen your flavor, let them know that you want yours frozen. Next, get your camera phone ready and let the show begin! The popcorn expert is going to come out with your popcorn and turn on this magical mist (liquid nitrogen). They will stir your popcorn in this now magic potion and then it is ready for you to eat! 

Some helpful tips:
1. Stand next to the counter while they are making it and you are sure to feel to cold nitrogen against your skin.
2. Eat your frozen popcorn with you mouth open or you'll look like a dragon with steam coming out of your nose.
3. Eat your frozen popcorn immediately. Some people want to ""save it for later"" but the liquid nitrogen can cause your popcorn to become soggy once it cools down to room temperature.

Next, I have to talk about their savory popcorn. Some of the savory flavors include Salt & Vinegar, White Cheddar, Buffalo Hot & Ranch, Dilly Pickle, and much more! I recommend trying the Dilly Pickle at least once. Yes, it sounds weird and yes, it may taste weird to some people, but you'll never understand how great the Dilly Pickle Popcorn is until you've tried it! My personal favorite popcorn is the White Cheddar Popcorn because it is light in flavor, is savory, and a little sweet.

Popped is your stop for anything from a little fun snack, a big tin of shareable goodness, or bulk orders for parties and events!",2016-06-15 20:30:34

The bread is pretty fantastic - it's very soft but substantial (no doughy), with a perfect crust.  

On our first visit, we started with a pear salad, which was nice but fairly average.  The dressing was a light mustard over arugula leaves with blue cheese and pear - very innocuous and delicate. 

For dinner, we had the Eggplant Torta.  The eggplant is firm and lightly breaded.  It's smothered in a light, delectable rose sauce and a small amount of cheese.  The accompanying butternut squash ravioli is served with a touch of cream sauce and has cinnamon mixed inside.  All of the flavors perfectly complement one another.  It's a remarkably smooth, subtle and delicious dish!  

We were trying to decide between two entrees and our server highly recommended the eggplant - he has our gratitude!  He said it's his favorite on the menu, plus it's a generous portion (perfect to split) - great call.  The rest of their service was also really polite and efficient.  The kitchen split both plates for us and the bus boy refilled my water every few minutes (the glasses were small and I drink a lot - huge kudos on this) and brought more bread. 

Since we've been back, I'd highly recommend the shrimp and crab ravioli appetizer and the Pasta Trio - each one sublime!  

The only item I'd warn against is the chocolate mousse cake - it tasted like an escapee from a diner (poor quality and texture meets artificial flavor) and totally didn't belong at such a fine establishment - maybe get the cannoli instead.",2014-03-20 14:10:18

They also marked the parking spaces VERY wide apart.  Basically each car is 2 parking spaces wide.  WHY?

The walk way from the parking lot to the casino is just ugly!  It's nothing but monotone gray.  There were 3  chrome sculptures by the entrance which weren't all that interesting.

New Yorker - yes. YES YES YES. SO GOOD! If you haven't tried this one, please do. Everything from the crust, marinara, and toppings were amazing!
Old Chicago - Another YES. This was probably my favorite. Mostly because of that sausage. 

Overall, this place was amazing. My favorite thing - the ricotta cheese. That stuff was so light, fluffy and flavorful. I don't eat pizza that often, but I have never craved it so much that I can't stop thinking about it for the next few days.

I ordered the beef shabu shabu with medium Japanese curry and a chicken karage with mild Japanese curry.  I had them put the curry on the side bcs I didn't want the rice to soak up all the curry since we weren't going to eat it right away.  

The karage pieces were a bit underwhelming at first  and a lil too small for my taste.  They were one biters and after a while I kinda liked that one bite taste and texture.  So maybe they are on to something.  
Ok so the shabu shabu beef was kinda weird... the one we are use to in Hawaii is really thinly sliced and it was just meat and curry.  Curry Hut had put in onions and peppers and we had to dig them out.  Also the meat was sliced a little too thick and tasted old.  The rice also tasted old like it's been 2 days since they cooked it.  He also felt like there wasn't enough curry because he didn't have enough to cover his rice.  For me the curry was just enough bcs I don't cover my rice, as I try not to eat too much rice.  So next time I'll get extra curry for him.  I did feel bad for my boyfriend bcs his favorite curry is the shabu shabu and no other curry place in Vegas carries that.  He was pretty disappointed with his plate but he was hungry and he ate it.  I hope he doesn't get an upset stomach from the old meat and rice.

Last thing I got was the Hawaiian slushie and that thing did not disappoint!  It was tasty, cold and refreshing.  Would love to try the other flavors soon. 

All in all the shabu beef was a miss but my chicken was ok.  The curry was good, like the stuff out of the box.  The slushie was excellent and I'll be trying that boba stuff next. 
This is not like Curry House out in Hawaii (which we loved) but it's a nice place to pick up some curry if I don't wanna cook.  I just might have to cook my own rice and just ask for some French fries.",2018-05-20 20:12:24

I ordered the Montana Steak Sandwich.  What I received was essentially 3 small pieces of steak smothered in mushroom sauce with button mushrooms on top of thick toast and a plate full of steak fries.  The steak was prepared well but the menu description did not fit what I received, in fact several people at the table commented on that.  

My daughter ordered the Ravioli which came swimming in a buttery cream like sauce.  Let me give MMC a little advice.  Over saucing does not compensate for small portions of food, lack of quality ingredients or make the plate look more appetizing.  She enjoyed the ravioli's which were, when the sauce was dripped off, pretty tasty.  The garlic toast it came with was pretty lame.  

The rest of the group enjoyed their entrees and the breakfast plate looked good.

Other than being overly sauced and lacking in actual entree portion size once you got through the sauce, the food was well prepared and tasty.

I inquired ahead of time to make sure they had vegetarian options because on the menu online only listed meat or seafood mains. To be honest, I am not that interested in eating a salad or a basic veggie pasta for dinner if I make the effort to go out to a nice restaurant for a good meal. Why should I suffer or miss out on good food just because I choose to not eat meat? Anyway, so I inquired ahead and was offered a salad (pass), mushroom pasta (pass), a platter of steam veggies (boring!), or the chef can make a vegetable tart (sold!) and that tart was fab!

I ordered a mushroom salad ($17) to start. I believe it was chanterelle mushrooms or a mixture of that plus others on some mixed greens. It was a ""special of the day"" salad and I ordered it minus the meat.
For my main, I had the vegetable tart ($18). It had zucchini, tomato, roasted red peppers, cheese and sprinkles of truffles. This was simple and delicious. I would definitely come back and have this again if it is available.  For dessert, I had a passion fruit sorbet ($8.00) and a cup of mint tea. The sorbet was delightful. I love the little flowers they put in. 

Overall, it was a really enjoyable meal. Food was great, service was great, the only complaint I have about the restaurant is the fact that it was so hot and muggy when I was there. I think they must've left the AC off by mistake. Also, the restaurant was really noisy (think Beer Bistro level of noisy) so I felt like I had to yell just to talk to my friends.

That being said, I was really happy that they created a vegetarian tart off the menu for me and I hope this will eventually make it to the menu as a permanent item.",2009-08-24 18:29:48

The Mac and cheese with shrimp and bacon was a taste bud surprise! Yum. The buffalo wings were dripping in sauce and had a nice flavor to them.

The main course was where a was let down. I ordered a Mushroom Jalapeño Swiss. I asked for it medium rare. When the burger came it was covered in onions. I don't like onions and there was no mention of them on the menu. The burger was also cooked well done. There was not a spot of pink in it.

 Thank God I ordered both, these were smaller than appetizers, I was told that Lunch had full size portions? O well I guess~ at least it was really good.~ Although I did have a problem with the shrimp, it tasted like cleaner, they brought me a couple more crab-cakes instead.

 side note*= tables have no salt, pepper or sweeteners, I ordered an ice tea and still was not offered any sugar.



Second trip Brunch= I had already made reservations for brunch prior to my first visit.

 So here we are again no salt and pepper or sweeteners, there was 3 of us and only two table setting up until right before our food came out.

 Ordered Ice tea and still had to ask for sweeteners.

 What we ordered:

 Ham and biscuits=Fresh Baked Biscuits, Virginia Ham, Poached Eggs, Champagne Hollandaise (see pics) $12

The ""ham"" was not ham but extremely cheap and salty prosciutto, I put it aside, the rest was quite good although rather tiny. 
I informed the waiter , he comes back with the chefs apologies and some lame excuse saying ""well its American prosciutto that's why we call it ham"" WTH the menu says Virginia ham?

 Virginia Ham Monte Cristo=Edwards and Sons Ham, Sourdough French Toast, Swiss Cheese (see pics) $11.
 Very Good, probably the best thing between us all and it had the ham that it described.

 Sunny Side Up Eggs=Organic Eggs, Smoked Bacon, Hash Browns (see pics) $9
This was not on the kids menu by the way and very sadly it was served with Denny's hash-browns, this is a fancier restaurant shouldn't those be taboo??

 Buttermilk Pancakes=House-made Butter, Fig and Peach Syrup (see pics) $10

Every employee was extremely courteous, never allowing us to walk by without a good morning/good afternoon. The receptionists also made it known to us that ""no"" is not in their vocabulary. Sweet. We used the concierge to get on the guest list of popular nightclubs throughout the city so we never had to wait in line or pay cover! Be sure to take advantage of the VIP concierge when booking reservations for shows, restaurants, nightclubs, etc. We also received a line pass for the Aria Buffet (terrible), and Cafe Vettro (have not tried yet).

Baja Burrito is good but they always overheat the tortilla so you get a crispy bite instead of a soft chewy bite.  Steak filling was a bit fatty-I don't think I'll be getting this one again.

This is what I have found. Since I am in summer work out mode I tend to eat salads and protein a ton. What's better than a Buffalo Brgr! I get this as my lunch every so often. Juicy, lean, flavorful, bison, cooked medium well! No bun with a side of broccoli. It keeps me full, tastes wonderful and powers me up for a P90 workout! 

I also LOVE the Pulled pork sandwich and Cuban! I did like the pulled pork better when they served it on a pumpernickel raisin bun! 

So lets talk fire brick oven pizza! I like simplicity so the mozzarella, basil is my favorite! Pair that with the beer sampler and you have quite a nice Saturday afternoon couples outing! 

The last time I went to dine with my family we all ordered different items then shared everything! We had the shrimp carbonara, crispy vegetarian polenta, and the Buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf. The carbonara was creamy and bacony, just as it should be. The meatloaf was super juicy and had a very good flavor, my dish the veggie polenta was tomato based and just ok, It is perfect option if you are vegan or watching calories! 

I just love bringing out of towners here, the majestic space and the ambiance, are unmatched. Be ready to become infused with a hoppy humidity! There is also a cute outdoor patio that is very inviting. Everyone in Pitt should frequent here! 

On a side note, I had ordered a pizza to go for my family the day we went since they had helped me move. It ended up being burned on the top so check your to go's! Management was extremely accommodating and hooked me up with a pie when I brought my friend for the sampler! Thanks Brew works!!",2011-07-07 15:27:26

So you enter through the outdoor patio, walk on into the dance floor and there's two bars inside to make it more convenient for you, one at both ends of the building. The music is more hip-hop/rap and the crowd is in their early 20's to mid 40's. There's nice tables for reservations if you're interested, and you can dance on top of the couches while holding the ceiling bars or just sit down on top of them if you prefer that. Some people even danced on the tables while holding the ceiling bars. The dance floor is actually quite large and the bathrooms are nice. Yelp needs to consider this a dance club as well as a bar. The energy definitely died down around 1am, so try to go before then. I didn't really find it quite special, just a nice little bar and club place. But if you like cozy and you like hip-hop, this is where you need to be. I personally like large dance clubs so as you can see, not the place for me.",2013-10-29 06:21:58

I love Thai food but am particular about the Tom Yum soup.  This Thai Rama location makes the best Tom Yum soup, and I have asked for specific veggies, and they listen and make it the way I like.  I have ordered a side of veg and rice as well, and it's always fresh and delicious.   I get take out, since I'm often on my way home from work.  I go in around 4p, so it's an odd hour for dinner, so it's not crowded then.  The service is friendly, but I haven't dine in so haven't had that experience yet. 

The only complaint I have is that sometimes on weekends, I call and call and call, and I never get an answer, so I make the trek up to the Thai Rama Tempe, which is similar but not quite as good.

EDIT in 2016:

I have dined in with Thai Rama several times: quick service, fresh and hot food, and decent prices.  The Tom Yum soup remains the best.

However, I would say a major change to my previous review - the Tempe location is not so good at all. This location compared to the Thai Ramas in Phoenix and Tempe far outshines the other two.  I'm glad I am in Chandler every couple weeks to enjoy this place!",2011-12-10 14:39:23
-QAahE75H3RnGhvdTdGrJg,YKx4wqrFxNS1TexLQ9HB7Q,T_uWz_xoYH4AYLEFb7dbCg,1,0,1,0,"I've had one experience with this CVS pharmacy and it will definitely be my last. Walgreens will be my only pharmacy from now on. Here's what happened: A doctor called in a prescription for anti-biotics for my brother on Sunday. When my brother went to pick it up, they told him that they did not have it. The next day my brother calls the doctor and explains that the prescription is not there. The doctor promptly calls the pharmacy and is told that the prescription is in fact there and ready for pickup. The following day (which is now 2 days past when he needed to start taking the meds), my brother goes back to the pharmacy and is once again told that his prescription is not there. At this point, I'm frustrated, so I call the pharmacy myself. I get a very nice girl on the phone, but a person who clearly doesn't know what she is doing because after every question I asked, she needed to put me on hold and ask someone else. She once again tells me that the prescription is not there and I explain that the doctor checked the day before and was told that it is there. I ask her multiple times if she can query her system by DOB in case the name was entered incorrectly and she tells me that she cannot. My brother again calls the doctor back, who at this point is really irritated with the pharmacy, as well, because he keeps having to bother with this. Finally a man gets on the phone with the doctor and says that my brother's name was entered wrong and that the girl should've searched for the prescription a different way.  So, needless to say, my brother had to wait three days to get his anti-biotics and everyone had to waste their time with this. I'm not sure if this is a training issue or if this girl shouldn't be working there, but it seems to me that if she couldn't resolve this problem, she should've gone to someone who could. I suppose this type of incompetance would be a little more acceptable at McDonalds, but for obvious reasons, I have higher standards for people working in a pharmacy.

rTgXlvl2UicRLmXsWMt5rg,bfCyqpNNOL0tO5TmlHOxAQ,kPorLswaS8h4xy-notLk9Q,3,0,0,0,"I attended their Free Fry's Weekend last Sunday early afternoon (most recommended day & time to attend- less crowded, fewer kids & those stupid strollers with sleeping babies).  It was my 1st visit and likely my last....
I had been curious about the Center and decided to take advantage of the annual free admission offered by Fry's foods, since the local libraries seem to be out of the Culture Pass for free admission to the Center to attend any time.
I pre-registered on the website and selected Will Call.  Upon showing up, I was bypassed the long lines by the staff but when I got to the table, they didn't even know how to do Will Call.  I had to tell them my name's on their computer because that's what Will Call is: your name/info is on the computer.  Duh.  A bearded bespectacled guy in a blue shirt spotted my name on the 'puter and motioned to the blue-shirted gal back to that table to hand me the white wristband as proof of admission.  As I proceeded into the Center, I was fascinated by the interactive scientific workshops in the engaging atmosphere that screamed ""north pole-esque"".  My favorite room was the Freeman Gallery, which was geared more for adults .  It curated vintage Arizona from the past couple centuries up to the 1960s featuring homes built throughout the years and how the building of the authentic pipes, toilets, walls, ceilings had evolved.  It also showcased various ways of how they kept cool in Arizona over the years.  My all-time favorite part of the Gallery was actually the beautiful scaled miniaturized homes from various decades, built by hand that were housed inside each glass.  I bet Mike Brady would proudly gaze at them for hours on end ;)  Most other (free) galleries were geared towards kids.  There were paid-for / long-lined showcases such as Zip Bike ride up in the ceiling (with a safety net below it) and a Dorrance Planetarium, but I wasn't interested since I wanted to see how much you could do and enjoy on a freebie only.  They had a cafe (which offered 10% discount if you showed your Fry's VIP shopper card) and a separate concession stand.  And, a gift shop.
Overall, the couple hours I spent there was worth it only on a free admission.  I give kudos to the artists, builders, creators, photographers, scientists, etc. who donated their ""inventions"" to the Center for us to enjoy ogling over.  I thank Fry's for the generous admission.  However, there were awkward moments besides that Wall Call.  I couldn't tell who working there was staff, ""docent"", or security?  How do I flag who when I needed something?  What did the (too-casual) blue or yellow shirt stood for?  Most working there appeared overwhelmed and under-trained.  They seemed more interested in just walking around or chatting amongst each other, a few gave me empathetic shrugs when I asked if they had a map or brochure or rules or anything that represented the freebie weekend, and they did not interact with the kids & parents associated with the displays so the kids ended up entertaining themselves and barely learning anything science-wise.  And, that creepy man-cave unbathed-looking bearded bespectacled reject of a guy who processed my Will Call accosted me a half-hour later as a lone female of the moment and tried to tell me something.  He appeared rushed.  They usually say something to you if they wanted something from you or if you're doing something wrong, right?  I am hearing-impaired and had no idea what he was saying so I just smiled without interest and walked away.  I may look normal and attractive on the outside but you don't know me.  I could be handicapped or a foreigner and you couldn't tell so he had no business to attempt to talk to me (no, I could tell it wasn't an emergency and I checked around my surroundings to be sure).  I did nothing that warranted special attention.  Or, if he knew I was hearing-impaired, I did not request assistance associated with it.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Happily, no one noticed or cared, so no awkward scenario.  I will also be forwarding this to the administration.
In concluding, why isn't it called ""Arizona Science 'Museum'""?  Oh, I think I got it!

UPDATE: As of today October 9, 2017, I still have yet to hear from an administrator regarding that bespectacled staff member in the blue shirt.  I sent a request on their contact form for the correct e-mail so I could forward that photo of the bespectacled staffer (which you can't do in their contact form).  Since this page is Claimed by the Center and an employee responded to a reviewer in the past, I hope it is a sign that they are reading this and addressing the staff member.  Just so they know, if they don't take action (responding to me or handling that guy), karma will bite them in the arse- and hard!  I will update some more if I hear back eventually...",2017-10-03 22:52:42

Do yourself a favor and order Susur's signature Singaporean-style slaw. It's very fresh and healthy, has 19 different ingredients, and very filling despite being a ""salad,"" probably because of the peanuts. You can also add sashimi slices on the side for extra protein. And for $25, this dish can feed 4-6 people. As vegetarians, we also ordered the chickpea tempura tofu lion-head ($15) and the handmade gnocchi ($28). Tbh Bent is probably not a great restaurant option for vegetarians and especially vegans given the heavier focus on meats/seafood, but there definitely are a few different plant-based options to choose from. 

For a pricier place I felt that the ambiance was actually pretty chill in spite of the dim lighting, candles, etc. A few couples were celebrating their anniversaries here and one pair dressed up -so Bent can be that kind of place too. Noise level was moderate as the place was definitely pretty busy.

We didn't order any drinks, but peeked at the drinks menu and saw some pretty innovative cocktails!

Service 5/5 - we probably had 3 servers come around regularly to refill our glasses, literally clean the table between each dish, and even to toss our slaw

They'd probably be in fields such as Muppet Engineering or Bagel Architecture, though.  Huh?  What I'm saying is, even though I've eaten a lot of fish and rice over the years, a sushi expert I am not, but I absolutely enjoyed my dining experience at Kabuto.  Both times.  In the same week.

I'm not going to say this is ""real"" sushi since I have nothing to back that up with, but I will say that this is the first Edomae style sushi I've had.  Your meal is paced much, much slower than an AYCE restaurant, with only one item being served to you at a time.  Each piece of nigiri is prepared in front of you, with the sushi chef telling you about the fish and its country of origin.  Everything being served has gone from the ocean to Kabuto's kitchen in a span of 24 hours or less.  You can start calling at 3:30pm to see what fish has been delivered for that day.  You may even be able to sweet talk them into saving specific items for you!

At Kabuto, quality is king, and it will leave a lasting impression on you.  Every piece of fish I've had since has been compared to Kabuto, and I can't see myself dropping that comparison anytime soon.  The only real solution is to get back to my sushi studies by going back to Kabuto.  This is one class that I won't mind repeating.",2012-06-04 19:57:08

The actual bar actually isn't spacious or particularly amazingly decorated, but they have since opened up the upstairs and it's great with more tables, another bar, and I believe even a patio overlooking Market Square.

I surprisingly enjoyed it. the BBQ pork are thick cut, very tender and the tomato sauce is the one used for baked pork chop dishes. It wasn't overwhelming with cheese because I mentioned it during ordering. The server may have said sth which is nice! The egg is not poached at all...I think that should be changed on the menu. 

The menu features a page of small bites/started-sized items like okra. I would definitely come back to try them during dinner or go with more people to try some of these.

The menu is nearly identical to its Point Breeze sibling (which I also love). Overall, I think I prefer Point Brugge, but I can't exactly pinpoint the reason. Maybe my experiences have been just a bit better there. It could also be because the restaurant is a block from my house. 

Anyway, Park Bruges offers a mix of sandwiches, salads, and larger entrees. Two other items they are known for are poutine and mussels. I have had mussels at Point Brugge and they were great, so I would imagine the same would be true here. 

On my most recent trip (last night) I had the flat iron steak salad, which was delicious. In addition to the juicy, medium-rare steak, the salad came complete with bleu cheese, tomatoes, herbed potatoes, and a champagne vinaigrette. Totally awesome. 

In the past I have also had some of their pasta dishes which have all been excellent as well. Dessert items vary, but last night we had a flourless cake with raspberry mousse filling and, while one slice is large enough to share, I could have eaten literally the entire cake. It was that good.

Not going to lie, it's really really expensive. This was my first time ever to a butcher shop and now I understand why. $16.99 a lb for a boneless ribeye, which is normally like $6.99 a lb in a regular grocery store. That's the comparison. I haven't tried both steaks side by side but it's not too different I believe. What we got was called 1855 upper choice boneless ribeye steak. It was huge and and came out delicious. 

What grocery stores don't have that you can get from here is Dry aged Prime ribeye. Which is like an aged dried out meat that they keep in the fridge at a certain temperature. This was $28.99 a lb. Reiterating that yes it's very expensive. But you can't get this at a regular grocery store. You may have to go to a really good steakhouse. We got one of these to share and this was quite different than the regular steaks. I believe it holds more flavor.

The selections were decent, but nothing amazing - we had the salmon and gnocchi, and they were both mediocre. Nothing special, quite bland to be more specific. Same with the appetizers.

I wasn't expecting a handout or some kind of a comp. considering the menu is already set quite reasonably, but I was surprised that I wasn't even offered one. When I dine at finer establishments, I'm normally offered free dry cleaning or an appetizer/drink of choice. Not the case. I don't think the server even elevated the issue to anyone - am I weird for having expected a customary table touch?

May return to check out the resort for a weekend, but I will not be returning to the restaurant.",2012-11-09 03:13:42

Appetizer - Alice chicken quesadilla with honey mustard -a little weird with the honey mustard but it was ok.

Salad - tangy tomato dressing all the way.  Love love love their salads

(we both ordered) Chicken on the Barbie - overcooked and dry :(  the BBQ sauce is yummy 
Mashed potatoes - Nothing to write home about but I do like the little chunks of potato
Baked potato - BF explained it as a scrub potato (thumbs down)-it looked small and bottom of the bag
*for the ""2 for"" special there lacked a little love in these dishes.

Bread is always awesome.

I came in for my first time to see Rachele, based off a recommendation from a friend of mine that's a regular. I enjoyed the atmosphere from the second I walked in. Everyone was dressed up in their witch costumes. So cute! I guess they're all dressing up for Halloween, which is adorable. I was instantly greeted by another hair stylist & she got Rachele to come out.

I can't stress enough how important it is for you to be comfortable with the person doing your hair. Rachele was more than I expected. Upon meeting her, she already gave me good vibes. After she sat me down, we discussed what would look good on me. She then explained every process she was going to do with my hair and why she was doing it that way. She made sure I was okay with every step of it. Not only did she do that, she also took the time to make sure I had water and would make sure I was comfortable. She is also very very personable & easy to make conversation with. I think it's important for hair stylists to be conversationalists because they're usually with a client for long periods of time. Gets awkward after awhile of silence.. LOL. 

Anyway, besides all that, Rachele did an absolute exceptional job on my hair. She took my grown out, brassy, ombré and restored it completely. I showed her pictures of what interested me & she took my ideas and put her on twist to it. She ended up giving me highlights along with lowlights to break up the brassy-ness of my ombré. Having Asian hair, my hair doesn't lift as easy therefore getting it to the shade I want is going to take a few sessions. However, I am completely satisfied with our session today. She lifted my hair as much as possible without damaging it. She also used a hydration shampoo on my hair which totally revived it. 

What I like about Rachele is that she's a realist. She'll tell you what can be done with your hair & she will take her time. (not too much time). Her prices are also very reasonable. She also gives you suggestions of different products, but she doesn't try to just push the products they have at the salon. I'm grateful that I was able to get my hair done by such an awesome individual. I already have my next two appointments booked.",2015-10-09 21:58:38

Used to love this wonderful hipster pizza and salad spot. I'm an old customer that has been a fan since the day they opened so many years ago. 

Tried to order an avocado pizza and salad to go. Not busy at all on this Tuesday night about 6:30pm. Ran into some snafus with their brand new (apparently first day) fancy point of sale system. Felt bad for the friendly young lady who spent nearly 10 min trying to run my card through their malfunctioning POS system. Again and again we tried. I was calm. I was friendly. I was patient. 

""It's been like this all day,"" she groaned in exasperation. Finally a manager came over and verified the charge. No problem. 

Waiting for pizza (really excited as it's been 6+ months since last here. Years ago we would eat here sometimes 2-3 x a month). Oh - I see a cute book to buy my daughter!  $20? Bah, that's ok she's worth it I say. 

I go to the wine/gifts register. ""POS system has been having problems all day,"" the young lady complained. Spinning hourglass. Spinning hourglass. Wait wait. 10 min go by. We give up. Can't buy the book. 

I go over to get my pizza finally and I see a bearded be-speckled manager ADAM who looks grumpy and mad. I tell him respectfully that their new fancy POS system was a disaster - ""someone made a mistake,"" I say after wasting 20+ minutes with it. 

Instead of apologizing or smiling - Adam barks at me. He literally shoves the half closed so Pizza box in my stomach like a jerk. Wow. 

Ok guys. You win. I won't come back ok? 

It's pretty apparent somebody's not minding the manners store at La Grande Orange. I'm sorry I'm spending money here. Sorry you guys aren't what you used to be apparently.

No.  A Chinese buffet?  No.  Chain restaurant PF Chang's?  No.  An 1980s-decorated Chinese sit-down restaurant?  Definitely, no.   That's when he remembered seeing a new place being built in Matthews.  We drove by Ming Fu to see if it was open yet.  We had been at this establishment before just a couple of years ago when it was a burger place.  It was very nicely decorated inside before, but walking into Ming Fu now, you wouldn't even recognize it from before.  They've totally redone the inside and gave it a very modern, calming Zen-like feel.  It was beautifully, yet simply, decorated, and I was already immediately impressed upon walking in the doorway.  

The menu options were very diverse without being overwhelming like at some Chinese restaurants.  There were decent typical Chinese $10ish meals or, if you wanted to get something a little more high-end, there were $15ish meals.  We opted for the first, along with a couple of cups of soup.  

Our server brought out complimentary fried Chinese noodles with a spicy mustard and sweet and sour dipping sauce, and all of these were tasty.  The hot and sour soup was good, but not as flavorful, peppery, or spicy as some I've had.  The Sa Cha Chicken entree (broccoli, water chestnuts, snap peas, brown sauce) was very good, too, with a ""just right""-sized portion served on modern dinnerware.  Although denoted as spicy, it too wasn't anywhere what I'd call spicy.  I like some heat!  Some sriracha or hot chile sauce/paste on the table would have been a much welcome addition.  I had to resort to adding heat by using the Chinese mustard.

Toppings are high quality, fresh and scrumptious. I had spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and extra fresh garlic. No problem or charge if you want extra cheese or toppings.

The crust is wonderfully thin but crispy on the edges; the exemplar of a very fine pie IMO and unlike some places, not one spot of the pie was undercooked. Spinach and mushrooms are yummily marinated and spicy sausage was perfect. The fresh garlic adds a surprising, but very welcome bite.

Salads are the same price roughly and are substantially filling. This is no skimpy dinner salad!

The only drawback is that the line can be out the door at lunch; a testament to how good the pies are. I highly recommend going at off times if possible, but go regardless. All other pies I have tried recently cannot stack up for the value.",2014-07-02 16:52:01

It lacked regular salt and pepper.  My friend's shrimp and black bean curry dish did NOT have any black beans in it what so ever.  The curry sauce also didn't taste like much.

The hubs thought both tasted different from the typical tacos we've had in the past; I agree, but I wasn't a fan of the taste of either of them.

CONS: This is a tiny restaurant. I mean really tiny for Charlotte standards. Then you get used to it and it feels homey with a neighborhood feel. But that neighborhood is high end South Park where the people who live there act and look like no others in town. It's true, every time I have dinner in a South Park restaurant I keep thinking 'where am I'? Maybe I should get some botox, a Rolex, Hermes scarf, and throw some money around to fit in! 

The check- I was in a group of 6 people. The restaurant was full and the service was very slow. There were other tables that came and went when we were still there. They just brought one check and we split it 6 ways (I guess the place is too posh to split out checks). I know that 2 bottles of wine were ordered, and we all had max 2 glasses each. The bill was $77 a person plus tip. My dinner and dessert were $23 + $10. Not sure how the $77 happened unless the wine was super expensive. So I was in for over $90 with the tip. How could that even be worth the money for what I ordered? I will go back again but with just one other person, a date night perhaps and try my luck again.",2015-11-24 02:58:05

My experience was solid...  Our bartender Michael was an absolute delight... He was attentive and offered suggestions...  Since I already had dinner for the night, I wasn't very hungry, but I was interested in trying something... I decided on the potato and leek soup, which was incredibly creamy and delicious...  For drinks, I had the Jameson Rose (which was a vibrant pink... I don't know why that surprised me as much as it did, but it was pretty cool... lol) and a beer flight for $6.  The beer flight was Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's and a mixture of Harp and Guiness called the Half and Half... I thought it was a great value with some quality beers.  

My cousin thoroughly enjoyed her nachos, but she sent back a cocktail... She apparently ordered a drink that no one ever asks for because Michael had to check the menu to remember how to make it... It didn't sound like it would taste great from the description and my cousin is ultra picky, so I don't fault him at all... lol

I said I wanted to check this place out after my friends raved about it. We made a date and, voila, dejeuner!

Straight to the good stuff: Crepes!

As it says on my profile... I don't eat much, but I eat well. That's also the best excuse *ever* to order too much and, if needed, send it home with Mom. ;)

Savory: The Caprese (extra pesto, please!). The mozzarella was fresh and creamy, the tomatoes firm and bright and sweetly tangy, the basil was sweet and fragrant, and the pesto was... 

.
.
.

... oh, uh, my apologies... I was daydreaming about the pesto. Thicker than some pestos, the flavors were deep - nutty, cheesy, garlicky, basily (are these words?!) - *without* being heavy or oily. Absolutely on my faves list now.

Savory: The Grand Turk. Tender, tender turkey makes this crepe fantastic. The other ingredients: guacamole, olives, cheese, are great accompaniments, yes, but the Grand Turk is not just named for it's protein base, but truly because the turkey shines. Sauteed, it has a smokey roasted/grilled taste that really makes it stand out.

Sweet: The Avalon. Sauteed, buttered pears, walnuts, honey, and goat cheese. An amazing combination that ends up just sweet enough. The nuts and cheese keep the honey and pears perfectly balanced. I had only one wish, and I expressed this to Ana when she stopped over to chat, was that it had more of the goat cheese and the creamy tang that it imparts into the dish.

Sweet: The Frisco. Blueberries and lemon curd. One bite and Mom just smiled with that ""oh, yes, my mouth is happy"" look that she gets over good food. I loved the freshness of the berries, that ripeness that brings a perfectly sweet/tart juicy bite. Add the zest of an amazing lemon curd? Fab, fab dish! Ana even took the time to talk to us about how she worked through the dish to perfect it, and shared some ideas on lemon curd outside of the crepes! 

I mention a lot that I don't eat bread, rice, potatoes or pastas but for a small bite here and there. So, I can admit to leaving way more crepe behind on the plate than should be legal. That said, I *do* taste things, and I had quite a few tastes of the crepes themselves, not just the amazing filling. Light batter that packs a great flavor, perfectly griddled, and even consistency are important in a crepe. Crepe Expectations has got this hands down and, dare I say it, easily rivaling my favorite little spot in Seattle's Pike Market.

Add to all of this the lemon and cucumber waters (cool, tasty without being overpowering, and oh-so-refreshing!), the large menu of libations (coffees, teas, juices, wines... so many options!), there is something for every person (and to complement every crepe!).

The service is phenomenal. Larry and Ana know what customer service means. They will chat you up if you want to chat, share their experiences, and truly try to get to know you. Much like I try to never meet a stranger, they easily make friends of their customers. The rest of the staff is friendly, fast-moving but laid back, and the whole of the experience is inviting.

Something else I noticed: From posted signs (no smoking! wash your hands!) to the artwork, to the light switches to the bathroom lighting: everything is coordinated, put together with purpose, and cohesive. 

With that kind of attention to detail, plus the amazing food and the stellar service, this is easily on my Must Go Often And Bring Everyone Here list.",2011-08-01 18:51:36

The service, however, is why this place only gets 3 stars. I'm a big fan of ZTejas, and go to the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations often. Yet for some reason, the service here is - for the most part - consistently bad. I think I had two decent experiences at this particular location out of the several times I've been here. 

Every other time, including tonight, the waiter/waitress just disappears after taking our order, doesn't show up until we're halfway through our meal and if we have a question, we have to wait until they come back. Odd thing is, we don't go at busy times so you'd think patrons would get more attention. For tonight in particular, we were one of maybe 5 tables seated in the non-bar area. Our waitress looked like she had us (2.5 top) and a 2-top. Here's what went wrong:

-We didn't receive our cornbread until we reminded whoever brought out our meal (not our waitress). Also cornbread was much drier than usual. 
-Drinks were empty until we asked the guy who brought our food for more water (and our other beverages). He only brought water. 
-We'd ordered bottomless chips and salsa. The guy who brought out the food brought us more chips when he brought the water, took the empty salsa dish away and nobody came back. 
-When our waitress finally appeared again, we were more than halfway through our meal. She refilled our non water beverages and we asked for more salsa. Waitress disappears. 
-Waitress comes back after a long while with another beverage, no salsa, and we request three boxes. Waitress returns with two boxes moments later. 

We were going to order dessert, but really didn't feel like dealing with the crummy service anymore, so we cashed out. 

Also unsure if there was a manager present. Every other ZTejas, the manager stops by. Not this one.

The theater is no doubt stunning, large, surrounded by high tech equipment, the ushers are dressed up in performance attire, but the real jewel is the stage. The stage is an enormous square  platform where most of the action happens. The performances that take place on the platform certainly highlight the acrobats of the performers. The story seemed to be heavily influenced by marital arts and probably about 14 acts. Without spoiling the story, Ka is about two twins whom are separated after their palace is raided in which the twins go through adventures finding themselves. 

There was one particular scene that amazed me which was when the sister seems to be swimming down the ocean to rescue the nursemaid, but in reality the performer whom play the twin was on a rope against the enormous curtain pretending to swim while the nursemaid is slowly departing into the deep ocean. The swimming was very convincing and my mind was blown, that is all. 

If you plan on buying a frozen drink before the show I would advise you to go with the beer. The Ka Peche was super expensive ($14?) and tasted mostly like cheap super sweet peach drink mix. Where was my rum rum rum?

Yes, I know it says NY style and I know these folks are from NY, but in all my travels throughout the West Coast that never matters much. Well, being from Staten Island some would argue is not really being from NY. There was a reason that was the only borough I never set foot in growing up in the big apple. It doesn't mean that all Staten Island pizza is bad, but this pizza was just a plain fraud. The crust did not crack upon folding and was way too dry to even choke down. Everything else just was chain like and miserable and lack of sauce or any actual seasonings in sauce was quite evident.. Somehow, these folks have two locations, but people in Phoenix, which contain mostly midwest folks, have no clue about good NY pizza, so they obviously are taking the bait.

After seeing multiple delicious pizzas make their rounds throughout the market to tables seated with happily expectant guests, the time was nigh.

Hanging out on a Saturday morning at the market is great. Tons of hustle and bustle. Hungry folks exploring the various vendors and stands. We enjoyed the morning crowd and had an early lunch. 

My wife ordered the mushroom on the sprouted ancient grain crust and I ordered the chorizo pie on the traditional white crust. The mushroom had incredible, robust aromatics. Local shitaki mushrooms and a nice whisper of truffle. The crust is thin and chewy with tons of grainy flavor. That subtle truffle oil flavor....heaven. The chorizo was great. I appreciated the lime wedge to squeeze over the pie. It added the needed sourness to enhance the other savory flavors. I enjoyed chorizo, but the mushroom definitely took first prize of the two. Easily one of the best craft pizzas I've had in the QC.

They also have some great drink choices. Ting? I haven't seen this except at Jamaican restaurants and ethnic markets! How cool! I LOVE Ting. I used to drink it as a kid. It's a nice, perky flavor and works well with the pizza. 

Price point is very fair for the craft they churn out, they bring the pizza to you where ever you are in the market, and you can even custom your pie to the world's end. I'm so stoked this place set up in the 7th Street Market!

This is a Canyon Creek location I frequent.  I've always had good meals and good service here.  But my most recent visit was not up to expectations - I'll chalk it up as an ""off"" visit, and will not abandon ship just yet.  But I do indeed hope it's a one-off!

We arrived at an odd time - 430pm, wanting an early dinner since we had skipped lunch.  As Club members, we had just received an email offering a free Salted Dark Chocolate ganache with the purchase of an entree.  This enticed us sufficiently to choose Canyon Creek.

Since it was an odd time, I did find that I stood at the front for approx 5 minutes before a hostess was in sight.  It was Family Day, so the restaurant was a somewhat busy despite the unusual hour.  A server came quickly to take drink orders, and we were ready to place a food order when he returned.  He told us bread was not immediately available, as it was still in the oven, and that he'd bring some along when it was ready.  We didn't mind, as this meant fresh baked bread!  It did take some time, but our patience was rewarded.

I had ordered the large 14oz prime rib.  I asked for it to be ""as rare as possible"", but  acknowledged that with prime rib, they often don't have any very rare cuts.  My friend ordered the 10oz at medium rare.  We also ordered a side of mushrooms, and I had a ceasar salad.  

While eating the ceasar salad, our prime rib entrees were served.  The server also quickly returned to ask if everything was OK. Since I was still having my salad, I did not check my prime rib just then.  Once I finished my salad, I cut into my prime rib, and saw that the meat was WELL DONE - not even a hint of pink to be seen.  Ack!  It took forever to flag down the server (they seemed short-staffed), and he said he would replace the dish.  When he returned, he came with a slightly pink cut, stating that this was as rare as they had - I would qualify the doneness as medium to medium-well.  This is a real DISAPPOINTMENT, as I've never had problems at Canyon Creek before even when requesting ""as rare as possible"" for their prime rib.  My friend's ""medium rare"" order was more like medium / medium well with just a hint of pink.  We're not sure but are guessing perhaps this is a prime rib from lunch hour, that sat under a heat lamp?  We did hear later during our meal as another party ordered prime rib that prime rib would not be ready for another half hour.  So yeah...we definitely got the end of the last roast.

I had ordered the large prime rib with the intention of having left overs - now I'm not looking forward to having the left overs, since warming up my medium-well prime rib will make it even more well-done than I like.  Sigh...

As I said, one of the reasons we chose to dine at Canyon Creek was the offer of the free dessert Salted Dark Chocolate ganache.  When we inquired about it, the server had no idea what we were talking about, and looked at us in disbelief and confusion.  He (probably not intentionally) made us feel like we were trying to scam him.  But he did say he would inquire, and sure enough, we were each served this dessert on his return.  The restaurant should make sure staff is up-to-date on current promotions.  Fortunately, we had the emails on our phones, in case it came to that.

So lesson learned here?  Do not come at a ""strange"" hour if you're looking for rare to medium-rare prime rib;  you'll likely be served what was made for lunch, and kept warm (getting more well done by the minute).  Come later in the evening, and the prime rib should be just right.  At least we've been fortunate in many past visits never to have run into over-cooked prime rib by visiting during the evenings.

Being one of my favourite Canyon Creek locations, we'll still come back and give it another chance.  Let's hope this visit was a one-off!",2017-02-21 19:03:33

I've seen that wait times can be upwards of an hour around lunch. Don't wait until you're starving to go.

I ordered the 2 combo meal with pulled pork and brisket, green beans, and mac and cheese + cornbread. First, get the cornbread. Always get the cornbread. Hands down, best cornbread I've ever had. It tastes like a cakey Nilla wafer. It's basically a small corn cake. Delicious.

The mac and cheese used bigger noodles than your standard Kraft fare. I'm not sure about the cheese. I think it's just personal preference, but the cheese flavor doesn't really do it for me. The green beans looked like they're cooked with ham pieces, and they're smokey.

Now, the meat: the brisket is super tender and the fat melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is also super tender and has been marinaded in the one of the best barbecue sauces I've tried.

xJyPa9d9BcZcBXQfoRkxng,yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ,50UjA4nDdqypN-hBUOAPmQ,5,4,0,1,"My boyfriend and I came here with a reservation on a Friday night around 6:30.  We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles.  Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief).  The restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around.  You might not even need a reservation.

Our server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform).  His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated.

The menu changes daily, so there are no specials.  Everything is a special, in that sense.  The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle.  Lovely!  I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience.  We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert.  I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine.  Hard to beat.

We had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved.  Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store.  Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers.  The Mac 'n' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun.  But the Peppers  - just to die for.  To.  Die.  They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage.  We were both bowled over.  If this is on the menu, don't miss it.  Their sausage is the real deal.

Next we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines.  Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak.  The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious.  Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual.  Just high quality food.  The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better.  The sweet potato mash alongside was great.  My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty.  Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste.  I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend.  We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt.

For dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the ""peanut butter ice cream sandwich"" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining?  It was very good and a great end to the meal.

All this for about $75.  The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect.  I'd recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers.  It was such a treat, and didn't break the bank.",2011-03-26 19:28:02

As someone who has been to the UK and had a fair share of fish and chips while there, I can say without a doubt that Brit & Chips does the classic staple justice on many fronts.

I decided to go with the standard choice of cod coated in a Burgundy batter with chips as well as a pint of Burgundy Lion on the side. Brought out steaming hot and fresh from the fryer and served on newspaper, I was salivating in anticipation and excitement, and it did not disappoint. The fish was fried to a perfect crisp, even to the point where I could hear the crunch after biting into it. It was also juicy and went along amazingly with the tartar sauce and lemon, creating a savory, creamy, and tangy experience all in one bite. The chips were cut into decently thick slices and were soft but not soggy and maintained an edge to that differentiated them from your typical fries. The Burgundy Lion beer complemented the fish very nicely and I could actually stomach tasting it unlike most beers, and I could see myself drinking it voluntarily on a regular basis (not trying to sound like an alcoholic or anything).

I have also been to Comptoir 21 for fish and chips, but I have to say that Brit & Chips wins the battle hands down. The offerings overall stay way more true to what you would actually get in the UK, and it shows in the quality of the food and drinks. I would definitely come back here again with friends so I can spread the love for this place and make it more known because that's what it most definitely deserves.",2016-08-08 04:10:36

FULL STORY:  Have only gotten delivery from here.  I like it -- one of the better takeout/delivery options I've had in CLE. 

They manage orders through their own website (nice organization, easy to use, even has check boxes for soy sauce type, extra wasabi, etc) with a very reasonable delivery fee of $2.  It arrived exactly within their projected window, delivery person came right up without any confusion or calls.

We ordered a few different things, and all were tasty and arrived totally intact -- they were packed really thoughtfully!

I especially like that they offer a veggie roll with tons of veggies in it aside from the usual cucumber rolls (this one had red bell pepper, asparagus, cucumber, green bean, avocado, lettuce, spinach, and inari).  Light on the rice, which I think is good.  Speaking of rice... they offer brown rice with any of the rolls without an up-charge. Awesome.

Their inari was tasty and not too tough.  Really pleasant.  Sweet potato roll isn't heavy like they can sometimes be.  They can also make it ""inside out"" with sesame seeds on the outside. 

Can't speak for the fish options (which, granted, is why most people want sushi), but as a veggie person, I thought these rolls tasted fresher and overall better than what we had at Ginko. 

Looks like they have some good lunch options that I haven't tried... and I still want to try the kimchee + noodles (sold out when we ordered).  

Minor gripes (that are mostly outweighed by positives) are that they don't offer water bottles or pepsi products (just coke / diet coke / sprite / tea online)... they close early for delivery (9pm), they still use styrofoam, and my order had one mistake in it... (small - not even worth correcting).

She looked at me as if she had something to say then said alright let me look. The second menu she handed me was satisfactory.

After sitting down it took about 15 min for our waitress to come over. As soon as she comes over I ordered the Gorgonzola apple salad, and the honey pie. The salad was very mediocre; the pizza was tasty but had a few flaws. The main flaw being the fried onion strings on top of the pizza.

I always end up having a great time here.
Word of caution is that the food tends to be a bit ""spicy"" -although I think that is how it should be. The portions are just enough so that you can share with a friend - which is a handy thing when you're all new to Indian food and are scared to order a whole dis to yourself.

I think this AYCE sushi restaurant recently opened in Oct/Nov. 
One thing to note that they have the exact same AYCE menu for both lunch and dinner and its the same price for both lunch and dinner ($27 per person). Like many new AYCE sushi placed, you order through the iPad.
90% of our items came out; the other 10% needed reminders which is not bad. 

1) seaweed was very soggy and salty.
2) Sushi quality is pretty decent for AYCE standard. They have spider roll (which is usually not offered at other AYCE); spider roll is a bit disappointing though; too salty. 
We liked the: spicy salmon, spicy tuna, rainbow, black and green dragon, twin dragon. Rolls were good; not too much rice. 
Hand rolls were yummy. 

3) We didn't like the grilled items that much. Beef ribs were too fatty and the steak cubes were too chewy. 
Escargo was good, interesting taste.

4) sashimi was fresh for the most part; salmon, tuna, red snapper, surf clam were fresh. 
Octopus and scallop sashimi (only available on weekend) were kinda fishy IMO. I didn't enjoy these two.

5) Torched sushi were okay; nothing fancy. I prefer the non-torched sushi better. It's nice that they offer torched sushi as an option. 

5) Last, dessert selection was quite small. I'm disappointed with dessert menu. There were ice cream (green tea, vanilla, mango, and red bean), mousse (Strawberry and chocolate), and pudding (coconut and mango milk pudding).
I had the green tea; taste like green tea ice cream anywhere else. Mango pudding was not very good. 
My hubby was disappointed that they didn't have deep fried banana to go with his ice cream

On a recent red rock adventure I wanted to see what all the local buzz was about so I decided to give Ice Box canyon a try. I got to red rock a little later than expected which wasn't too good since Red Rock closes early in the Winter. Decided to press on and just go for it. The trail doesn't look like much at the beginning but you really got to work at it for the pay off at the end. You can go through one of two paths, either the narrow trail or through the wash. The trail path is quite narrow so you can't really go fast pace, especially if there are fellow hikers going the opposite way. The canyon lives up to it's name as it gets pretty chilly in the shadows so bring something warm.  After a mile and a half i was wondering if it would ever pay off with some type of scenery. I asked a fellow hiker who informed me of a frozen waterfall just ahead, i stopped briefly to snap some photos then kept up the hike. My friend i brought along was not in the hiking mood, so I had to stop multiple times for them to catch up.  Another fellow hiker informed us what awaited at the end of the trail. The last half mile or so gets very narrow into the canyon. There is definitely some tricky maneuvering involved. Once you reach the end, or where i felt most comfortable it was cool to see the little puddle of water with ice sheets on top flowing from under the rocks as well as the frozen waterfalls.  We stopped a short while to take a break , hydrate and admire. Looking at my watch , knew it was time to turn tail and head back to the truck. We decided to go through the wash area, thinking it would be quicker. It started out well enough but trudging over the harsh terrain and rocks was slowing down our pace. Halfway through i decided to walk back up to the actual trail , we hauled ass back to the truck leaving 5 mins to spare before they start kicking people out. I had just enough time to throw my stuff in the back , grab my extra water and head on out of the park before closing. All in all it was a good adventure, although seeing the waterfalls was pretty cool, I prefer Pine Creek Canyon. However my goal is to try each trail here.

We had a delicious red which was medium priced (on their list, expensive by most other lists). The staff were incredibly helpful and informed when it came to both booze and food. For starters I had a crispy duck salad which was served on a bed of cold noodles. The duck was indeed crispy (read: delicious!!) and the noodles were flavorful. I could have done without the chopsticks because I think they're pretentious in a non-Asian restaurant, but it wasn't the end of the world.

The chicken and rice dishes are characterized by lemon, spices and Peri-Peri. Peri-Peri is African Birdseye Chili and has a sweet distinctive flavour, definitely goes hand in hand w/ lemon and garlic.

Overall I feel the food is overpriced for what you get. I do enjoy some meals at Nando's, yet some meals remain under par. At times the chicken is way overcooked, rendering thee meat dry and burnt. Other times the chicken is cooked well, but there's barely any meat on the bone, especially with their wings. The portions and quality of food is inconsistent, questionable for the price you pay. 

I do really enjoy the Peri-Peri seasoned chips (fries), they are always a staple for me if I eat chez Nando's. Other sides include spiced rice, baked potatoes, coleslaw and corn. Whenever ordering my meal I always use a fair amount of Nando's house sauces such as the hot Peri-Peri and Garlic sauce.

I couldn't see myself going out of my way to eat at Nando's, but it is a decent restaurant with good service. A big plus for them is they have a well crafted and interactive website. It provides you with a solid history of the franchise, as well as recipes to their dishes! I find that to be so rare these days. If you're interested in hitting this joint ;) find a place near you.

It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher). 

A smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better. 

I got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it. 

The brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality. 

We had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)",2012-09-15 19:08:35

One thing in general about Vegas is that dining in large groups just screws everything up and I really feel that the service since they add gratuity automatically they feel they can just shut down quality service automatically. It took at least 20 minutes to get a seat on a fairly slow 11 am on a Monday. When we were finally seated we waited another 30 just to get our orders in. I understand that restaurants want to get the food out all at once. But, I really feel that if the food is done they should starting bringing it out. My whole crew ordered breakfast except me who ordered a club sandwich. The food no joke took almost an hour to come out and mine must of been finished first because the fries were ice cold and sandwich was soggy all the way through the bread. When it was time to pay we were not allowed to split up the check any less than 2 ways. The whole fiasco took over 2 hours and wasted a good chunk of the day for a group of my friends that were leaving that day. Never again and stay away.",2011-05-01 07:47:30

We went in through the store, the place is cavernous. We were directed to the food truck.  Saw pEople working out in the boxing ring.  It was chilly,  headed to a table with a heater to wait for the food.  There is table tennis,  cornhole, and foosball to play while you wait.  The food was very good,  We tried the pecan French toast,  mac and cheese muffins,  homemade chips with onion dip,  strawberry bruschetta and pb and jam sliders.  They were out of jam,  so they used honey and bananas. The hot chocolate was made from scratch,  so it took a half hour to make.  Other than a few glitches,  it was a fun place to go with tasty food.  Next Time,  I would try at night to see the vibe and have drinks at their antique bar.",2015-01-07 19:33:16

Cute train track that goes around the restaurant, the rest of the decor can use some updating. Some tables and chairs were recognizably uneven. The staff was nice and efficient, very accommodating. Food came quick. Sucks that the meals don't include bacon, so it cost almost $4 for 3 strips...boo!  So, didn't have bacon with breakfast.  I had the Island Favorite w/ Portuguese sausage (simple breakfast w/ rice and 2 over-easy eggs) and hubby had the Denver omelet (he said bell pepper pieces were cut way too big, not diced like he's used to); we ordered a short stack to share (ok, but much better at the cafe).  The food was fine, but not any more special than what we can get at the buffet or even at the cafes and the price is way more expensive here.  Felt ripped off, I guess I'm just used to either getting late night/early morning cafe deals or paying breakfast buffet prices and getting more for my money that way. I'd rate the food quantity and price at a 2, and the food quality at a 3. This should be a 2.5 star review, but upped it to 3 stars since our server actually did a great job...i think his name was Ethan, or something that started with an E...nice Hawaiian guy, may have been a manager. Glad I tried this place out, now I can cross them off my list - too bad they didn't make my repeat list though - we won't be back.",2016-08-07 06:17:50

We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant definitely embraced the ""lazy sunday afternoon"" moniker.  Many of the tables still were occupied with the empty vessels of diners before and the waitstaff was almost non existent.  Once we did get the privilege of ordering our food, we again waited....and waited...and waited...for our food. I was very underwhelmed by the Bob's Bad Breath Burger.  While the description sounds amazing, the execution was poor.  It left me neither satisfied nor with bad breath.  
I have eaten here in the past and was always happy when I left.  Is it the case that the restaurant staff had post-freakfest hangovers or is the restaurant simply resting on its laurels and hopes the bearded and the flannel bearers keeping flocking to a declining (and very average) restaurant?  I don't know the answer but probably am not going to give it a second chance to find out..",2013-10-29 14:14:41

Since it was her birthday she got 50% off. Adults are $27.99 on a weekend which is pretty expensive when there isn't a huge selection of foods to choose from. I noticed that they have lots of different promotions going on like they have a ladies night where ladies get a discounted price.

The decor of the buffet is very nice for a buffet -- contemporary and chic. The rotating ice cream display is pretty cool. You'll see it when you walk into the buffet area. On to the food, there wasn't a huge selection of foods to choose from compared to Mandarin. It seemed like half of the buffet were desserts. The hot food stations were meh and it seemed like it wasn't replaced often with fresh foods. They also have a sushi station which I didn't really try except the salmon sashimi (which tasted pretty decent for a buffet). There's also a seafood bar which has scallops, oysters, squid, etc, which you typically don't see at many buffets.

Overall, I'd prefer going to Mandarin over Spoonful because there's a larger selection and it's not so salty. Oh btw, Spoonful is related to Imperial Buffet if you didn't know.",2013-06-01 21:10:15

Ritual offers a great day of pampering if you have time to go beyond the ""cut and color"".  Everyone there is skilled at what they do and are a pleasure to do business with.

Size- they are about 2-3x the size of a ""normal donut"" 2.) Flavor- the flavors are unique and even the funny-sounding ones are magic in your mouth. I got a dozen for my work group the other day. The salted caramel was delicious as was the peanut butter. I also tried the lemon cake donut which was great! Bananna puddin and the bacon one were hits too! Coffee is dark, robust and great! Some of the donuts are too much cake/dough and could use less of that so you can taste the other flavors. Highly recommend to all donut lovers out there :)",2017-01-17 22:47:50

I used to see her down at the King location and she is seriously my skin and nutrition life saver. Very chatty, but very informative (smart woman!). I always learn something new coming out of my appointment regarding my skin, nutrition, and health. 

They have monthly specials and it's  great deal to try one of their deluxe facials when it's on sale. Very nice staff. 

The entrance is a little odd. I entered on Avenue Rd. and you have to walk down a hallway passing by some of the treatment rooms before hitting the store/front desk. The design looks very similar to all the other pure and simples.

There's something missing here and I can't put my finger on it.   

The service is a bit overly attentive - for example, we were seated, given menus and then - literally - 30 seconds later the young server came to take our order.   We asked for a few minutes to open our menus, ordered some sodas and then started looking.   

As we were READING the menu and 1 minute later ... Back she was with our drinks and ready to take our order.  A total of -maybe- three minutes had passed since we entered the place.  Server seemed completely thrown and perplexed that we weren't ready to order.  She was a sweet young girl, but didn't quite get the timing.  I appreciate that folks want to zoom in/out at lunch and its better than peering into the horizon looking for a server, but ... Really?

Their drinks are great also, and they have good options between tea and coffee. I'd recommend their passionfruit iced tea or their raspberry leaf hot tea, which aren't too bitter, not too sweet, just a perfect balance. The desserts are also recommended. The green tea matcha crepe cake was light and creamy without being too overpowering or too sweet. The green tea ice cream and green tea sauce also complemented it well. One thing I do have to say though is their buttercream tasted like a lot of egg whites, it had that egg-y aftertaste to it and that left a weird taste in my mouth. That being said, would I come back?

rLWg2eNPuwkebwwdwMkqKg,Ozp9AQ9EOaw3ZQnVE6TDFA,DEF77d-_S0UT2OI-njM5fQ,2,3,1,0,"This is another place where I wish I could give the service and food 2 different ratings.
The service here was fantastic - 5 stars. Our server was attentive, and made great recommendations. My table was very needy, and he did not seem to mind at all, and really seemed to enjoy his job. A++ for effort. The ambiance was fun. This is definitely a hipster-y place with succulents in the tables and Edison bulbs.
The food...was worse than mediocre, and we ordered quite a few items. I'm about to kind of rip them apart, and I'm sorry for that. 
Street corn - DELISH! So amazing. Possibly the only good dish we ate. 
Crab Rangoon Nachos - These were interesting. I'm not sure I found any crab, and there was little Rangoon. It was mostly slaw. The chili sauce tasted like any other sauce you buy at a store. We basically ate slaw with chili sauce. 
Smoked Pork Quesadilla - This could have been good. The pork was nice, but a little bland. The problem with this was nothing was mixed together, so with each bite you got a different component of the quesadilla, instead of having bites with all the good stuff. So the first few bites were torilla and cheese. The next were tortilla and pork. The last were tortilla and veggies. If they were mixed together it probably would have been good, even if the pork lacked flavor. 
Smoked Chicken Wings - These were like regular wings. Again, the sauce tasted generic like it came from a bottle. They were chewy too, so I'm guessing they should have been cooked longer which was kind of scary. The ""scallion crema"" sauce was just plain yogurt. 
Clam Chowder - Very thin, and not chowder-like at all. Again, bland. 
Spicy Korean Pork Tacos - I like the idea that they are served in lettuce. The execution needs work though. They don't use 1 large piece of lettuce for each taco, but multiple small pieces, making them even messier than they already are. The pork used here was the same pork from the quesadilla, and still bland. It seems like they make a huge batch of pork and use it in everything. The kimchi was hard to eat. Literally. It was in HUGE pieces, and impossible to bite through (or even cut through). No bueno. 
Pork Belly Bahn Mi - The baguette was nice and crunchy. The texture was great, and I love the spicy mayo. No one at my table actually had any pork in their piece, though. It was all fat. I'm aware that pork belly is very fatty...but usually there is a little hunk of meat in there. Not in our piece! I couldn't even eat it. I

I recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread.

Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted.  They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.

Either way she forgot to add the discount to the end of the bill ...it's ok ...it's only money and we all know that comes and goes ..well to me or in my world it sure does . So if your super adamant about your discount than I guess double check before you pay !?

Many claim to be sushi spots, but they lack the culture that we look for in a sushi restaurant. Some chains have tried to make sushi hip, cool, and corporate,by pushing out the culture that invented it in the first place. Atami is authentic, JAPANESE, sushi, and it is oh so tasty, and reasonably priced. The spot is owned by a friendly Japanese couple. The husband handles the sushi right behind the sushi bar. 

LOCATION
This spot is a hole in the wall location right next to a SUBWAY and some independent businesses. Boo on you if you let the location deter you, and you chicken out and you opt for SUBWAY! Where is your sense of adventure? You are missing out. Some of the best food comes from these types of locations.

RESTAURANT
Before you walk in, you'll see their ""A"" Grade proudly posted in their window for everyone to see. An ""A"" Grade is more than enough reason to set my foot in the door!!! It is very neat and clean. The restaurant is tiny. It is sit down, or take out. It has a sushi bar where you can see how your food is prepped. It also has booths and tables.

FOOD

You can order sushi and other Asian dishes from the menu, and they are reasonably price. This is not an easy find. Sushi is often overpriced. One of the highlights of this location is the Bento Special. The Bento Special includes your choice of an entree that comes with soup, rice, 4 California Roll pieces, and a Spring Roll for 6.99. You can tack on their 2 sushi roll combo for an additional $7. The food is fresh and is served on something that is not your traditional white plate. At this location presentation matters.

The menu is nice, but the highlight of this location is the sushi. The sushi is the first thing that you should try. I heart Atami and you should too!!!! Support this local business YELPERS. This place needs to be around because it is legit, and it is oh so tasty.",2012-10-12 03:47:36

The sauce of this tofu was delicious - definitely recommend!

As for their Tempura Lunch Box, it consisted of two shrimps with many other vegetables such as sweet potato, asparagus, eggplant, etc. It would be preferable if they had written in mixed vegetable tempura on the menu or what types of tempura they consisted of because I presumed that there would be more shrimp tempura in this lunch box.

I went with the apple of my eye the second time and was not expecting a slush at all. While it was good, it was a tad too sweet. I did request less sugar but was told that the sugar amount was fixed (as they use apple cider and that probably would have come at the expense of less apple taste). They probably could have also put less tapioca the second time as nearly a third of my drink is tapioca.

The Alley is definitely a trendy spot for bubbletea. The vibe is relaxed and rustic. Be prepared to wait but it's well worth it.",2016-09-06 23:53:07

The bartender was very helpful in recommending some dishes for us to try. 

For those of you that have never been to a tapas restaurant, tapas are ""small dishes"" so you can order as many as you want so that you are not focused on eating one big main dish. 

Here is what we ended up ordering:

Goat Cheese Salad ( I love goat cheese and I really liked the hint of mint that accompanied the salad)

Ahi Tuna Tempura ( The wasabi foam that they served was good, not over powering but just wished it was a little more than just a dab)

Stuffed Piquillo Peppers ( with goat cheese and mushrooms....YUM!)

Roasted Marcona Almonds (Don't Bother ordering this)

Cheese Platter ( Cana De Cabra, Manchego, Cabrales, La Serena)

I was contacted by the owner to come back in and review the place again.

And then my girlfriend and I started trying other Vietnamese Restaurants and have kind of forgotten about them over the years. Honestly, I wasn't quite sure just precisely why we had forgotten, until a recent refresher visit helped to remind me.

The menu is what you'd typically expect, which is always a bit overwhelming and confusing if you're not familiar with this style of food. I've always found that Vietnamese restaurants are the type where I'm very happy that Yelp pictures are available to give you an idea of what you're getting into.

During our recent visit, my fried rice dish just tasted off, having this weird, funky flavor that I can only describe as being like a greasy and dirty grill. My girlfriend's chicken slab was tough, difficult to cut, and just simply not very good in comparison to what we're used to. Maybe it was an off night in the kitchen? I recall the food being much better. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and maintain that if it's a good night, you'll be pleased.

For desserts, they offer a fried banana that comes with some vanilla ice cream. It can range from very good to just okay, depending on whether the ice cream is at the ""freezer burn"" stage or not. They also offer snoh, but given its current popularity and comparing it to other places, we were quite disappointed, mainly due to the incredibly stale mochi balls.

Okay, so maybe I'm being a little too hard on them. Vietnamese cuisine has picked up a bit in recent years in Phoenix, which probably factors a bit into my overall rating.

It's (usually) good based on many of our past experiences - but you can definitely do better if you know where to look.",2018-07-10 15:25:54

The restaurant is spacious and clean, but definitely not fancy. I would not advise bringing someone you are looking to impress here largely because the environs are sparse. 

I am sad to say that the curries were disappointing. I ordered the massaman, and my husband went with the panang. Both were on the watery side, and the flavors were thin too. Specifically, my massaman, which in my past experience has been a sweeter curry, was very sour and did not have the rich complexity that I savor in an ideal massaman. The panang was pretty standard. The menu indicates that the panang comes without vegetables, and it lived up to its description. The curry was literally tofu cubes in a thin curry with 4 thin slices of red pepper on top. I have never seen a curry without a speck of vegetables. Their spice level is on an American scale, so don't be scared of the spice! Go for 8.

Perhaps the menu shines in other areas, but I wouldn't head back for curry. Based on my experience, I suggest trying their specials, something besides their curry.",2012-01-08 00:58:02

Hog wash. I'll return to the big dudes in a second. But get this. They sell ""bundtlets"" for $4.09.  Think of it as a reward. It's about the size of a man's hand. These can be purchased by the dozen for $46. (If you'd like to be creative they can be personalized.) Products are carefully packaged so that the frosting will not smudge in your travels.

Super tini ""bundtinis"" are sold by the dozen for $18.50. These are perfect for a party. Bite sized.

8"" cakes serve 8-10, $19.50 frosted in a box
8"" cake decorated $29.50
10"" cake serves 18-20, frosted in a bakery box, $29.50
10"" decorated, $39.50

If you're stumped for creative ideas have no fear. There's a big book for you to flip thru with categories. You'll look awesome carrying a cake in from here. The turn around time to place an order is fairly short. Don't panic - this store can help. Gluten free options are available. If you'd prefer an alternative to the traditional thick frosting petals a ""drizzle frosting"" is available.

""Would you like a fork with that?"" is one of the most loaded questions on earth. When asked at Nothing bundt Cakes in Phoenix I laughed. Had I been given a fork with my order there is no way my purchase would have made it home.

There is beauty in life. When hiking a person learns not to touch all the beautiful things as they can be dangerous. In this simply adorable store every space is too cute for words. It's dangerous in that you want to eat every item that is food. (If you're an Olympic swimmer who can pack in one million calories, good for you.)

Why the lack of self control? It's not just because of the eye candy. When you sample a bite (and they have sampling stations right up front) your belly wants more. Impulse control is gone. After nibbling (yeah right, gorging myself) at a few food festivals with these sweets I had to find the source. 

Suzanne, the owner, is divine. Even though we were attacking her like zombies at the Scottsdale Spice event she paused to explain the story. By now you've figured out this store specializes in bundt cakes. On top they are artistically layered with frosting. This is unbelievably delicious due to their fresh product. Apparently I love real butter. (You should too. Don't judge. Just eat.) Fresh eggs and real cream cheese. That's it. That's the magic.

The cakes themselves could be stand alone products. There are nine classic flavors offered. (Yes, there is red velvet! Yes, there is chocolate. Variations of it too. Yes, carrot. Lemon, pecan, cinnamon, and a few other gems.) Each month there is a special flavor. For October you'll never guess what was in store. Pumpkin! (Wait, you weren't surprised? :)

Orders can be placed online. To be frank, I was shocked to test their mobile version. It's super duper easy. My 84 year old Dad can do this.  They deliver. If you're within a 10 mile radius the charge is $10. Over 10 miles the charge is $20.

A lot of people seem to come here for take outs, maybe because the place itself is not that big and there's a lot of houses in the area. This place is also always full so prepare to wait or just call in to get take out.

Portions are not huge, but a 'good enough' size (maybe because I'm a big eater...). Reminds me of street food in Taiwan, but that is what they're going for anyway so sizes will more or less resemble that. As a rice fan, I thought their Taiwanese Sausage and Minced Pork Rice was sooo good... period.

Be sure to try their drinks before you leave; it's in a take out cup anyway. Personal fave is the pudding milk tea - not overly sweet like a lot of bubble tea chains but still creamy, and you can taste the 'tea' in it. Also has huge chunks of yellow pudding in it, yum. Another must try is their popcorn chicken that pretty much everyone is raving about. It's bite sized, nicely seasoned and crispy on the outside, while the inside is tender and still nice and hot when they serve it.

I also found their tea to be very flavourful. Not the tea you'd order from their menu, but just the tea they give out. One of the staff mentioned they use 'special' tea leaves or whatever, which I'm not complaining about because they were pretty good, almost like jasmine and very fragrant. 

They've done menu revamps after the owner went somewhere to bring back new dishes so prepare to see some new additions if you haven't been already. The only thing that wasn't balanced imo here were the portion sizes and prices. It's not expensive to say the least, affordable actually, but for the portions they give it's not as well balanced. For the times I've been here I can never be completely 'full' unless I order a huge amount of food on the table, which isn't that big to begin with since the place is small.

All in all though, definitely a fan of Pa Pa Chang's.",2016-03-22 13:23:59

That would have been a regrettable and huge mistake, but thankfully I was directed to visit by fellow foodies. The back patio was cozy and intimate with the smoker housed in the corner where the next day's carnivorous meats were being prepared.

As I sat and drank, the first round of BBQ rib tips (smoked then deep fried and double glazed with Memphis and Carolina sauces) were presented. Needless to say they were a textural dynamite and packed with sweet, sour, tangy flavor. Anything smothered in a terrific mustard sauce is a winner in my books.
 
After the ribs, a glass of Kensington watermelon wheat beer, with the shot of Bookers to follow to complete the Deep South BBQ experience right?

It was at this point we went inside to sit down to enjoy a fantastic version of a Cobb salad. Not your average Cobb salad, but with smoked turkey, blue cheese, eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato, arugula, all lightly dressed. Combined, it was a great balance of flavor and textures, a salad I would even order not being a salad kind of guy.

For the main event (believe it or not) a variety platter of their other smoked offerings.  A stack of 1.5 hr smoked, fried and glazed wings, a mound of 15hr smoked brisket smothered in bbq sauce and topped with pickled onions, a heap of succulent pulled pork, double smoked beans, a three cheese Mac and cheese,  and coleslaw.

 he brisket was tender, fatty and just simply melt in your mouth good. The coleslaw was not over dressed and retained a great crunch. The beans were my favorite side, double smoked and made with a chili base which stole my heart. I enjoyed the beans with the pulled pork, they complemented each perfectly. 
 
The mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy but remained light, not heavy.
 
The one made one mistake that night, I ate the wings last. I regret that. They were amazingly crisp and moist for being smoked in a BBQ, with slight smoke and sweetness that took them over the edge. Altogether, completely awesome and worth the visit alone.

Last out was a smoked peach cobbler with a crème Anglais for dessert. A sweet, creamy, smokey, and perfect finish for what I believed to be, the ultimate BBQ meal.",2015-07-06 20:14:39

Can't say that about this joint.  Our waitress was Lindsey and she was on the ball from the second we got there.  Ordered a pear martini and a craft beer flight, calamari for appetizer and then shared the shrimp tacos and bleu cheese burger that was on special.

The main courses were a little cold when they came out, but the flavor was great for everything so it wasn't a deal breaker.  Calamari was crispy and fresh, the aioli to dip them in was perfectly seasoned and both the tacos and burger were cooked and seasoned to perfection.

While removing the plates from our table, a salsa spilled and splashed onto our clothes.  This kind of thing happens often to us, for reasons unknown, but the way it was handled was as good as it could be without discounting the check.  After apologizing, the manager stopped by to make sure everything was ok.

While there I noticed you can get 1/2 price off your pizza if you're there before or after a movie, which is something to remember for next time.

That was unfortunate for me because salmon is my favorite!  Throughout the night I also had the agedashi tofu, which was pretty bland with not much flavor, even while soaked in sauce.  I also tried a few rolls, but I can't recall what they were as they were ordered by others.  (I'm looking at you Elnino...)

Outside of the mackerel and yellowtail, nothing else really stood out to me.  It all seemed average; which maybe explains why they offer the all you can eat sashimi.  Not a place I would frequent on a regular basis, but I would come back again.",2010-05-24 04:13:30

You usually get these as a side with every Mexican dish, so they better be good. Their beans are always piping hot and creamy and their rice is super flavorful and extremely moist! Their chips and salsa are delicioso! Chips are served hot and this salsa is very unique and has a garlicy flavor.

We waited 20 minutes before she even got her sandwich, if anything she should have gotten it first before our food.  I know its the not fault of the waiter, but the kitchens.  However, it took us 15 minutes to get the attention of the waiter.  The waiter was slow to get our drinks and refills as well.

I loved the bar design with its white and gold accents. The decanters on display were beautiful and the stools were comfortable . 

We ended up waiting a while for the table and when we saw them set up a table for two at the window we thought for sure it was ours but the hostess ended up seating two guys that just came in. When my husband inquired, they immediately set up another window seat that just became available. It was fine and we had no issue. The manager came over to apologize and offered us sparkling wine. 

The waiter was fine, not overly friendly but wasn't rude. He did his thing and we did ours. another waiter cane by our table to drop give our appetizer and he was good with some recommendations.
The food - I don't remember the names of the menu items. 
1. Zucchini frites - yes! The lemon and honey was a fresh twist along side the fried zucchini. It made a light but tastey dish. I'd go back just for that.
2. Lamb. - got it medium rare, it was so good! 
3. Duck pasta - also good. Lots of duck and mushroom, creamy sauce.
4. Pancetta pizza - this is probably the only thing I wouldn't get back. The pizza was very cheesy and I thought the pancetta would cut through that. But it kind of just blended in. The waiter did say we can get pizza anytime but we didn't listen - I suppose we were just hungry
5. Dessert I forgot what we got. We were so full we got it to go.

The service was awful - we asked our server three times for our drinks. There wasn't much of a veggie selection either which threw a wrench in the gears for my gluten free friend. They would not make an exception or alteration to the menu so she asked for a la carte instead which they did not take well what so ever.

The kitchen items were duplicated and at one point we had to ask the staff to stop bringing things out as they were already received (and eaten!) The food we ordered tasted alright, nothing to complain about there. The menu is a bit misleading though, for example: the spicy crunchy salmon description says green onions and is served without. I am not a fan of the green onions so I was happy but others who do like it may end up disappointed. Kyoto also uses so much rice in their sushi! 3/4 of us had plates full of rice but thankfully we were not charged or harassed about this.

They do have high ceilings so be warned, it can get very, very loud during peak hours.

Basic casual dining. Order at the counter, get a number, fill your drink, and head on over to sit at a table that's a tad too small and wait for your food (Which is generally not long at all! They are speedy!) 
They do have beer and wine offered and specials at times for 2. (Pizza, salad, and wine for 20 bucks). The wine is always a little on the lukewarm side, but I ain't too proud to ice it down (though I would prefer not to, really). 
The salads are spectacular. VERY fresh spinach and other ingredients. I would recommend these over anything else on the limited menu. The pasta dishes are also fresh, hot and seem quality. I'm not bagging on the pizza here, because it's fine. It's just not what I expect from Fox. It's never hot, always greasy and basically bland.

I decided to cheer myself up with a Pomegranate Martini. It was delicious. Definitely a bit tart but I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. You could hardly taste the alcohol, but it definitely packed a punch towards the end.

As the second location, it doesn't lose its touch or style, embracing the same exposed wood block/grid walls, long counters with metal accents and stools. The menu is the same too, equally delicious Ramen in fatty rich broth, choice of pork, veggie, or chicken and thin or thick noodles. 

I like the miso broth most, although it doesn't come with the seaweed sheets or perfect hardboiled egg (which to some, is very very necessary and to me a sad thing to let go) accoutrements, it packs the flavor I look for in Ramen. Pork belly is also the way to go, they torch that thick slab of juicy tender goodness like it's your birthday... even when it's not.

Spicy Chicken Karaage is a pretty good fail-safe too.

The green tea latte came out to be around $6.50-7 and the hazelnut latte was about $5. 

I liked how drinks are brought out to you. There were a bunch of people sitting outside and their food and drinks were brought out to them. Some people were studying inside but I felt that the music was too loud and it was too dark. 

2/5: The green tea latte was ok, it lacked a strong matcha flavor in my opinion but wasn't overly sweet like other places I've been to. My friend said that this drink was a lot better at Starbucks... and I had to agree with her.

1/5: hazelnut latte. Not sure if it's because I ordered it less sweet, but it almost had no flavor. I felt like I was drinking hot milk with a hint of sugar. The espresso shots (not sure how many they put in a medium) wasn't aromatic, smooth or strong. I was extremely disappointed.

And while I didn't quite have my mind blown in the same manner that most people seem to, I did feel their tacos were definitely in the higher ranks of the many, many options that we have here in Phoenix.

My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night. The neighborhood itself is a bit sketchy. I'm not even sure if I'm supposed to be here after sundown. The joint itself is very small and was extremely packed with customers and a small group of musicians. This definitely isn't your white-washed 4 dollar taco shop, that's for damned sure! It's the real deal - or at least as real as you can get for street tacos without buying directly from a truck.

The ordering system is kind of weird. You order your food, they take note, prepare/serve you the food at the counter, and then you pay whenever you're finished. A bit odd, since it's an open invite for people to just take their food and not come back and pay.

I thought their carna asada and barbacoa were both excellent, with a surprisingly good quesadilla offering to boot. Tacos are presented bare, so experiment as you wish at the salsa bar.  

Are they the best tacos I've ever had in Phoenix? Not quite. I feel that Backyard Taco in Mesa has them beat, but I'm definitely not discrediting this place. If you're into authentic street tacos, you'll be quite pleased.

Also, the line stretched to the door and moved sloooow.  I guess that's because the teenager was on a break?  When she came back from break suddenly everything started to move.  So you can't function properly without the 15 year old at the helm?

You know Krispy and Pinkbox are just down the street, right?

As usual, I was craving a crab cake but also Caesar salad. I was sitting at the bar with a friend, so I asked the bartender about the crab cakes specifically I wanted to know if it was heavy on the breading and filler. He told me it was almost identical to another restaurants recipe (which tells me it's the same), but I had never had it from the other restaurant, so I asked again. He assured me it is fantastic and suggested I get it on the salad, thus killing 2 birds with 1 stone.  Sounded perfect to me.

I wish I had taken a picture of the crab cake because quite frankly, I'm not sure there was actually ANY crab IN IT!!!!!  It was like eating a crab flavored ball of dough. Possibly the WORST I've ever had to date. The fact that they charge $16 for it is insulting to truly delicious crab cakes.

I guess at least now I also know not to waste my time and money at the ""other"" restaurant also.  

Aside from the food sucking royally, the atmosphere was unexpectedly not great. Maybe it was the day we went. It just didn't feel like a place I'd ever want to return to. I mean, you park in a boat docking area and walk around to the bar. It's just weird. I prob won't go back.",2016-07-15 20:46:47

My strategy:
1) Go only when not rushed

4) Visit frequently and don't feel obligated to search the entire store at each visit.  Usually I do shoes and clothes in separate visits. (remember, I live close)
5) Take the whole thing in stride - think of it as a cultural experience.

Ok, I guess they get busy. So they did sit us around 10 minutes after we arrived. We ended up sitting at our table at least 20 minutes. There were people that had gotten sat after us that were getting served. We started giving dirty looks to anyone we could and were just about ready to throw in the towel and leave. Finally one of the waiters.. that we were giving dirty looks to.. came over and asked if we had been helped. So, he got a waitress to come over and take our order. We ordered some drinks which i cannot recall the names but where pretty tasty. We ordered a fllet to share. The filet was cooked well. I was not too impressed with he potatoes on the bottom as they appeared to be a large smashed tatter tot. I also got the orange zest edibame which was good but appeared overpriced at $7. We next ordered the apple pie desert and the brooklyn brownie. The brownie with the cookie that I read so much about.. was ok. It didn't knock my socks off or anything. The apple pie desert on the other hand was delish. It comes served which looks like a paper bag around it. 

The decor was modern. Liked the funky mirrors hanging all over, the salt in the bathrooms for hand washing and the old looking lamps to light the place. They do have a cute patio area which no one was taking advantage of.. I guess it was still in the 60 out so probably not too appealing for many. 

It was also interesting to check out the crowd.. as I sat waiting to get served for 20 min.... there was a good mix of people dressed to the nines and people dressed in sweat pants. So come and wear what you like!

Our Caesar salad with pink peppercorns was amazing. Loved the accent those brought out of a shopworn standard without the easy fat and distractions of a bacon. 

When in a traditional joint, embrace the traditions. The ravioli was the best I've ever had, perfectly cooked and such a nice creamy indulgence in perfect marinara. 

The gnocchi were also house made beauty, and I loved that their meat sauce was more big crumbled and chunks of plum tomatoes so you got some textural relief from a dish that can be heavy and repetitive for mouth feel.

uhWhhSzggDsmmersCimKpA,p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A,4,7,4,5,"The menu at China Magic Noodle House represents the school of thought that if you're going to make just one thing, it's got to be good. They pretty much only serve one thing -- noodles.

Located in the Lee Lee shopping center in Chandler, the owners have done a great job of making the interior bright, clean and welcoming. Greeted with a smile, we were seated in the one of the generously sized booths, as if they knew about the feast we were going to order.

On the farthest wall a large window provides a view of the kitchen where the magic happens. After you place your order, you're welcome to go to the window and watch the noodle master go to work. Each order is hand pulled, something that's amazing to witness. I was put into a foodie-induced trance while he twisted and beat the dough. The noodle master makes it look so easy, but it takes a ton of practice and skill honing.

Wanting to attack the menu from all sides, we ordered a Chinese noodle feast. When the first dish arrived we knew we were in for a treat. The huge made-by-hand Pan Fried Dumpling ($4.95) was stuffed with seasoned minced pork. Alongside was a bowl of a vinegar-based dipping sauce, which brought a bright tang to each pork bite. I enjoyed the fact that the skin was thick since each bite was substantial and toothsome.

The Hot Spring Beef Tender ($4.50) was kind of a surprise when it arrived. My impression when ordering this dish was that it would be tender sliced beef, but when it arrived it was a plate full of paper-thin slices of spiced marinated beef tendon. I love beef tendon, so it wasn't much of a problem. Our waiter explained that the tendon is tender, and pointed out that the Marinated Beef ($4.50) was sliced beef.

There's a choice of five types of noodles, but we homed in on the hand-pulled version. They also offer wide noodles, shaved noodles, thick noodles and vegetable noodles.

Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce ($5.50) offered chewy bites studded with green onion and little pieces of ground pork. The noodles did a great job of absorbing all of the flavors of the dish. I'd order this one again.

Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce ($7.95) is similar to a house lo-mein, but this was bursting with taste. The Spicy XO Sauce added a salty and savory dimension to the noodles and tender beef that was indeed spicy, but not overly so. If you need additional spice there is a jar of red chile oil on every table.

I jumped at the chance to try their version of Homemade Lemonade ($2). Sweet and tangy, this is how good lemonade should be made. The Homemade Lemon Tea ($2) pretty much bests any other Arnold Palmer. Both drinks did a great job of cutting through the richness of the highly flavored noodle dishes.

Similar to Vietnamese pho, Ox-Tail with Soup Noodles ($5.95) were so comforting, I can imagine these on a cold day warming your belly and your soul. The broth was complex and each bite of fall-off-the-bone tender ox-tail and chewy noodles were a joy to slurp.

The only negative thing I can say about China Magic Noodle House is that they aren't closer to where I live, though on second thought, this might be a good thing.",2010-05-28 02:43:19

This noodle house is very, very small and has a very limited amount of seating.

Since I don't eat meat, I ordered the vegetarian option that isn't on the menu (you need to ask your server to special request this since not many people know unless you ask). Our server was very knowledgeable and lively with the words she used to describe the ingredients and taste of their dishes. Delicious, all the way! I only tried the vegetarian option, but I certainly will be back when I'm in the area to try all the other items.

Keep in mind this place IS very small, so you're best bet would be to probably swing in on the less busy nights or for lunch during weekdays.

 I called for reservations, the hostess was sweet and helpful, she told me a chef would come to the table to get our input. Wow!
 The day of our reservations we pulled into the parking garage to learn its $15 to valet park! Yow! We did anyway, and they were great!
 We get to the Rainforest, after a wait at the
Host stand for a MIA hostess we get checked in. Up four flights of stairs and waited some more, then sat.
 Our server was right there to get drink orders, but shaky on which kids drinks were dairy free. I told him I wanted the kids collectible glass, the elephant, and would pay for the smoothie but just wanted apple juice. He said a clean one would be downstairs waiting.
 We ordered, a chef did come out but only after we requested it, and went over the options. Kayden ordered the hot dog and fruit. What was brought out was chicken strips which DO have milk, but when pointed out it was traded quickly, accidents happen.
 The food was ok. I got the Shrimp Platter, two of the three styles of Shrimp were just meh.
They sang to the birthday peeps and gave them cupcakes, no dairy free option for dessert at all.  :(
Then we went down to pay. The glass they offered me wasn't the kids glass it was a glass for adults. I explained to the cashier who called a manager. No biggie. Then the manager swooped out. She was abrasive from the get go, and cranky that I made a mistake. I kept telling her it was ok, I just wanted the glass for Kayden. She informed me I DIDNT PAY FOR IT! I finally told her to refund the money for the wrong glass, I'd buy the right one! She snapped that the glass is ONLY $1.50 and stared at me. I told her I'd ale the $1.50, and where would I buy the elephant glass with a straw for the child who is now crying because he was told he got to take a cup home.
Another half hour and finally she walks me to a bar and tells the bartender I need to order a
Kids smoothie. She leaves to get the cup. Still being a grouchy Cword.
 I told my grandson we would find a cup somewhere where the people didn't yell at little boys and we walked, no cup.
 Seriously this ruined the night. All the fun we had been having was hard to remember as we walked back down.

grrf1JM-O4ckM8S_TB7Cew,KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,bhpsxX-g9yWx4XsSFsWnKA,5,0,0,0,"I was so excited to read online that Mousso opened a bar next door to its current location. I came here with my cousin and a friend. One is vegetarian and the other is on the Keto diet. That being said they still managed to find something to eat so that says something! It's pricy so we each ordered two-three plates and my cousin and friend left hungry. I, on the other hand, ordered two plates and shared one with my cousin and felt so full because the two dishes I ordered came with tons of bread and I ate all of it.

The location was a bit confusing because it wasn't indicated very well which part of the establishment was Mousso and which part was Petit Mousso. We asked for Petit and they brought us to a room on the left which I immediately recognized from having been there once. Turns out what used to be Mousso is now Petit Mousso. So basically Petit Mousso is the room on the left and Mousso is the room on the right behind a curtain. 

My friend took me to Mousso for my bday and it was just heaven! One of the best bday gifts for sure! If you haven't gone, you need to go! So I was so excited to try Petit Mousso. Mousso only had a tasting menu but Petit allows you to select from a small menu. Both have different menus but are very similar in style. 

I read online that it was supposed to be fancy bar food but it's not at all. I def think it's more of a resto then a bar. For one thing they only have three signature cocktails and the rest are wine bottles that you can buy. The cocktails did not look appealing on the menu because i didn't recognize any of the alcohol names and there was weird stuff in the cocktails such as tomatoes! I ordered the third cocktail on the list and it was amazing! It had a liquor similar to aperol and it was decorated with pretty purple flowers on top. It was refreshing. 

Online I read that they offer snacks so in my head I was expecting fancy bar food like gourmet sliders and fries. They did have potatoes with cheese and truffles but for $15 I rather eat meat or fish for that price. 

I started off with the mousse de foie with elderberries and walnuts on top. It came with four big slices of bread and it was my favorite thing! So delicious! The perfect balance between sweet and salty! If you like foie gras definitely get this!  

I tried my cousin's doré (walleye) crudo and it was good! Light and lemony! The pieces of fish were so small. My friend had the cold soup with veggies inside (not a gaspacho). She said this was her favourite dish of the night. 

Secondly I ordered the raw lamb with tomatoes and onions. This dish also came with bread. My cousin said it tasted like tomato paste.  I enjoyed it but it was definitely not a must have. 

My cousin then had the pea with sturgeon and this was better than lamb dish. 

Lastly we shared the beef short rib that is cooked for three days with their homemade ranch sauce and on a bed of greens. The beef was so good. It perhaps a tad too salty  but I try not to add that much salt in my food at home. I loved the ranch sauce and Chinese celery that came with it. 

I left feeling full and satisfied but I think it was mostly due to the bread that I was full. The portions are very small so definitely get a few to share. The plating is superbe. The food looks like a work of art! I loved it and I definitely recommend it but honestly I probably would only come back for a special occasion because of the price.",2018-07-27 02:05:48

Kinda awkward when there's only two of us and they just squished us between two groups. Just thought it would be nice if the server asked if that was ok before doing that.

I ordered the khao soi and crispy spring rolls. Khao soi tasted good, the coconut milk curry soup base really hit the spot! They had a fair amount of chicken and the egg noodles were perfectly cooked. 

The crispy spring rolls were your average vegetable spring rolls. Maybe bigger and crispier. Oh and there was fish sauce which made the dish 10x better haha.

I like the diversity of the menu, that you can choose between vegetarian, chicken or pork broth (not just the latter). And you're not just stuck with pork as a protein either. The broth was tasty and wasn't overly salty. I wouldn't go with the garlic broth + salt though. 

They also had appetizers like dumplings and takoyaki, if noodles aren't enough. 

The portions are not as big as some of the other competitors, but it was enough. Noticeably was the amount of 'stuff' in the soup that seemed missing, but you can add for an extra cost. It only comes with 1 egg, some seaweed and one slice of the protein you chose.",2015-04-03 16:11:11

With three hours to kill this time, meanwhile, I finally caved it and was more than disappointed. A two-meat combo and a drink set me back $20 and most ended in the trash. This tasted like precooked BBQ and brings no value to anyone that's had real BBQ. There's no doubt good BBQ is tough to find in airports and you aren't going to find it here (you'll likely have to go to DFW or Austin to achieve that feat). 

Why was it so bad? Let's start with the chopped chicken. I took one bite and threw the rest away. This surely couldn't have been chicken (photo attached). It was dry, almost like a dried out sloppy Joe, yet worse. The turkey was overcooked and dry as well. As for the sides the sweet potato fries were clearly frozen and from a bag although the corn wasn't bad and the sweet sauce that comes with it is fine. 

If you eat at fast food places like McDonalds you'll think this is good BBQ, but if you've even been to places in Charlotte like Mac's, Jim N Nicks or Midwood avoid a bite here. This is even a grade lower than Sonny's BBQ Pit and makes Shane's Rib Shack look good.",2016-03-20 10:18:38

We opted for both the de leche and the chocolate ones and both were really tasty.  The churros were freshly fried so was piping hot when we got it and both the del leche and chocolate sauce complimented well with the sugar cinnamon coating.  Of the two we prefer the de leche one.  Price wise the churros were 3 for $5 or 6 for $9.

They also had churro cones but we only got to try the regular churro sticks.  When we left the line up went out the door so its obviously a popular place.

Prohibition looked promising, but it was such a nice day and we wanted a brighter atmosphere to match our moods. Bonjour Brioche and Lady Marmalade had the usual lineups and so we rejected these prospects. There were a few other options that we flirted with before settling on the Riverside version of the County General. It looked warm and inviting.

This was the highlight for me:

French Toast Fried Chicken, Maple Syrup, Buttermilk Ranch 14

What came first, the chicken or the egg? They both arrived together in perfect harmony inside of my mouth. 

Sweet, salt, fat, crisp, wow. 

The chicken tasted like it was battered in crispy kettle chips and the meat was tender inside. I created perfect savoury and sweet bites of bird dipped into a creamy and chive-filled sauce, paired with eggy toast and caramelized syrup and sometimes a bit of slaw to cut the richness. 

I'm not sure what some people are saying about portion sizes (along with some other random complaints). This is a rich dish and it is perfectly portioned. It got to the point where I felt like I was overeating before it was finished and I wasn't hungry until much later that evening around 9:30 -10 pm.

My mom also enjoyed her dish and we went against grain by sipping on Americanos instead of brunch libations. We had an attentive and friendly server - the type to check and see how our first bites were after dropping off our plates a couple of minutes earlier.

The Bucantini has guancuale in it that is like smooth nutter. The sauce is light in flavor and onions soft and it is blended well. The wood fired pizza is a great pizza that has a nice blended flavor that your mouth enjoys. The sauce is refreshing and not over bearing so you enjoy all the other layers.

The crowd was grungy, they all had their computers, and pompously sipped away while writing their blog praises of the OWS movement.  Ok, I'm stereotyping.  But hell, it's my review.

To the pastries...the tiramisu was good - I liked how light the dessert was and how it didn't try to overpower anything with an excess of amaretto or espresso dust.  The ricotta version of the same dish was meh - I didn't like how the cheese taste came back into the dish so easily.  The apricot pastry and cherry turnovers were good - they even heated them up in a spot oven like the Subway folks.  The aroma filled up the car and tempted us to tear into them in the car.  We didn't though - we wanted to give the 'rents first crack at the goodies.

Didn't try the coffee as it was already 9:30pm and I wanted to make sure The Wife could sleep so I could sneak out and go gambling with my bro - but maybe next time if I'm back in the area.

My wife and I have MoviePass, so we have to purchase our tickets separately. I got my ticket but then my wife wasn't able to get her seat next to mine, since it said we weren't allowed to leave a one seat gap. Which is ridiculous.

The chicken is excellently cooked, but I find the ""Jaco"" (pronounced jack-o) sauce something you want to skip because it overwhelms the flavor of the dish. You can be very happy with nothing more than a half or quarter chicken and a side. My favorite is the squash casserole. Also try the chicken on rice con queso which is sometimes a little light on the chicken but the rice and queso (cheese sauce) is great!

Daily specials, when the guys in the office go together, we try to get here on pot-pie day (four stars) or meatloaf day (five stars!).

I think if I had another food craving I will more likely just walk a bit further over to Ginger which has more standard quality pho with better pricing.

The service started off great and lasted through the entire meal.  We started with the beet carpaccio (tasty sauce, strange texture, still delicious), and shiitake ceviche, which was amazing with the vegetable chips. The ceviche was a bit on the small side, so I'm glad we ordered 2 appetizers.

For our main dishes, the fiancee had the spicy cauliflower with tofu and I had the peanut lentil curry with tofu.  My only reason for taking off 1 star is because I specifically asked how spicy and peanut curry was, and my waitress assured me it was not spicy at all.  I know I can't handle that much spice, but wow, it was a bit too spicy for my taste!  On the other hand, my fiancee thought the spicy cauliflower could have tripled in spice.

This originally would've been a 4 star rating but since I wanted to leave in a timely manner and couldn't, I'm docking that extra star.

After the second server came over to confirm that, it still took him awhile until he actually got our checks. What's up with that? And it's not like they were short staffed because there were a few of them running around. The 5 of us just sat there wondering when we'll get our checks.

Entry- $10.00/Person
Food- Ranges between $7.00-$30.00 per item
Drinks- Ranges Between $6.00-$12.00 per drink
Games- $5.00/Game but usually everyone wins at least a little something
Rides- $30.00 for an all access wrist band.

Not a cheap fair by any means.

I love the Noodle Man so I was so excited to try out this place since it has a similar concept. The place is new so very clean and modern looking. They have a bunch of smaller tables, probably not the best place for large parties, especially if they get busy it will be difficult to pull tables together. The waitress was very sweet and made good recommendations. 

For appetizers we ordred spicy wontons and beef and onions pot stickers, both came after we got our noodles (not much of an appetizer if it comes after the meal), but this wasn't a big deal to us. The spicy wonton looked really small but there were about 8 wontons in there, so pretty good portion; however, being called ""spicy"" wonton it was not spicy at all, there is a sweetness to the sauce that I did not expect, I would have liked for it to be spicer. The pot sticker came after we finished our noodles, the waitress said they were experimenting with a new pot and it messed up the pot stickers so they had to re-make it, they gave us a plate of the cucumber salad complimentary for the wait, which was very sweet of them. The skin on the pot sticker was too thick for my liking, the meat was kind of bland and dry, nothing special really. The sauce was really good though. 

I got the pork belly with knife-shaved noodles. The broth as really good, very flavorful, but they gave me very little broth. The noodle was very thick and stuck together, it was hard to pick up each noodle, it stuck together like a big...glob. My sister got the Shang's noodle with hand pulled noodles, her broth was good but a bit warm, not as hot as she would have liked. She also said it was a little bland, she expected it to have chilli like at other places, but maybe it is just a different style.

The host (I suspect manager - an asian guy in his 30's) talked to me for a bit in the lounge while I waited for my friend. Two guys at the bar apparently knew everybody in sight and the chef came out to speak with them so I was able to see him and say ""hi.""

This place gets a star for not turning my friend away at the door.

My salad was pretty tiny and bland, so I mixed in a bit of the blue cheese dipping sauce from the fries and it was better. My friend didn't eat much of her salad but said it was good. She took it to go.

We still had $10 left to play with for the meal, so we ordered the donuts to go because we weren't hungry and didn't feel like eating them.

First off, this place doesn't even pretend to be a ""mall"". This is a small little shopping area that connects a few shops and this itself is a plus point in my books compared to huge pretentious American style shopping malls that are WAY more confusing and laborious to navigate.

Highlights:

- Small and easy to navigate.
- A movie theatre, drug store, bookstore, 24-hour grocery store, LCBO, dollar store, shoe repairs, dry cleaners, a bunch of clothing stores, cafeteria, and subway station all in the same place!
- Clean and newly renovated.
- Located within walking distance from many shops and restaurants in the young and eligible hood.

For those following my reviews, I am Yelping from Sendai city in beautiful Miyagi prefecture (two hours north of Tokyo).  I am working here as an ALT, so I'm going to be here for a while.  I'm going to get my last reviews in because I miss Yelp, and wish I could yelp some of the great places I've been to here in Japan.

(Sorry for that tangent... on to the review!)

I came to Paymon's about a month ago when I was supervising a group of international students to Sin City.  Echoing my previous reviews, I find that the best restaurants and treasures in Vegas definitely come from the locals, and it wasn't long before buddy Francis C. took me here for a late lunch.

Paymon's specializes in Mediterranean café style foods- a cuisine I've never really touched before, so my choices here were definitely on the safe side.  Conveniently located a few blocks away from the Strip, Paymon's offers a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice meal, as well as a hookah bar right next door (however, you must be 21 or older to enter).  When we went, we sat in between the restaurant and the bar in this extremely nice patio area, where natural sunlight was where it was at.

Service that day was decent.  We placed a few orders of fries, and I ordered the chicken marsala for my hefty meal.  Our food took a bit for it to come out, which confused us because a couple of other parties received theirs before ours (and we felt it was a pretty small meal).  When I finally received my chicken marsala, I was ready to sink my mouth into that piece of chicken.   In terms of the taste, the flavors didn't do much for me.  It wasn't bad at all, but nothing about my meal struck me.  The piece of fried chicken breast was okay, and my sauce over the noodles were simply average.  However, they do give a good sized portion for you hungry gamblers out there.

Even though my meal wasn't completely mind-blowing, I did enjoy the French fries and the on-and-off lighting inside the patio.  Next time I come, I will definitely venture off and try the more Mediterranean options that Paymon's is known for.

The chef's special was also pretty good (although in my opinion the sauce makes it kind of hard to tell the difference between the chicken and fish) and it was covered in chives. My only real issue was I wished they gave more food because it's kinda pricey. 

Service was okay...our waitress was actually kinda rude at the end.

I've tried several different ones.  My favorite that stands out is the Supreme Tostada.  It's topped high with seasoned taco meat, cheese blend, Queso, refried beans, jalapeños, sour cream and guacamole.  My husband doesn't like cilantro so our waitress out the pico de gallo on the side for me.  They no longer have two different sizes if nachos.  The one size they do offer is plenty to split between two people.  Delicious! 

We also split the fajita cheesesteak sandwich.  Absolutely wonderful with seared sirloin, onions, peppers and white Queso.  Again this was huge enough to split.  You offer sweet potato fries? Sign me up! They were perfectly crisp and soft at the same time.  Yum!

Service here is hit and miss.  When we sit in the bar area, it's not as good.  But when in the dining area, it's fantastic! Chelsea, who was our most recent waitress, was awesome! She had a fun and bubbly personality that made our visit even more wonderful.

At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.

Zoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.

The food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.

After catching probably the worst cinematic rendition of my favourite tragedy; The Great Gatsby, my friend Harry and I decided to grab something some eat.  We hopped into my truck, and drove exactly 100metres, circling the First Markham Place in a true display of laziness.  The restaurant was literally a stone's throw away, and the fact that my vehicle was a gas guzzling beast was the icing on the cake...or the cherry on the icing..or whatever it's a thing.

The booth we sat in was the only authentic thing about this Vietnamese restaurant, as a corpulent person could never dream of fitting in here.  I was brought immediately to the table's edge, which meant each time I was to lean inwards slight for the food, I would be at risk of gay kissing Harry if he was to perform the same action.
This could be a good thing if Harry was Harriet, and I was that cunning. 
I got the curry goat, which I highly suspected it being lamb, and Harry got a bowl of beef pho.  I asked the waiter what the 'shredded pork crepe was', he must have lied to me because I ended up getting it, and only to find out it was just a Vietnamese spring roll with the pork instead of the shrimp.  Was pork so unseasonal that it cannot be associated with the word spring?  I was euchred!
The meal was unsatisfying, Harry complained about his broth tasting too strongly of MSGs, and we were so closely situated with one another, we kept accidentally playing games of footsies.  
My friend Lucy joked the evening before about me going to the movies with a guy friend with not-so-subtle insinuations, I strongly believe she has cursed us by doing this, and perhaps this is proof that she is a practicing witch...and her craft involved conjuring queer moments between straight men, the darkest of all magics. 

I do have to admit, the lazy decor did remind me of a few very shabby restaurants I visited while in Vietnam, however those restaurants produced some of the best food I've ever had.  VIP Vietnamese Cuisine's culinary productions were so far off from anything authentic, I cannot help to re-repress this experience.  It's like that movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I found my way to a place where I forced myself to forget, only to rediscover it in a most foul way. 
Why is it even called VIP?  There's not a single pole for dancing anywhere!

One of my favorite things is parking. There is a HUGE and FREE and PAVED parking lot right across the way and plenty of bars to stop by before the show.

The staff is efficient and friendly and lines are usually short or non-existent. 

When you first walk in, the stage is right in front of you and slightly to the right. You'll probably notice the ornate chandeliers and disco balls on the ceiling, which is a corporate Fillmore thing--all of them have it.

There are bars in every corner of this place and have yet to really wait for a drink. I have never had a bad experience with the bartenders who seem to always be friendly.

Now I must tell you, drinks are NOT cheap. Expect to pay around $11 for small mixed drinks, $9 for Coorslight/Budlight tall boys and $12 for large craft draft beers. They usually have a decent selection of local and non-local craft beers. They even had Saranac on draft last week ,which I rarely find in grocery markets!

The other issue I have is the bathroom location. They are on the opposite side of the entrance in the corner and when shows are sold out or even near sold out it is almost impossible to get to during the show. To make it worse, this is also where you go to get to the smoking deck (stage of the amphitheater) so during set breaks its like heard of slow moving cattle and takes forever to get anywhere.

Despite an awkward bathroom location configuration, they are immaculate and plentiful. Some of the best bathroom facilities I have ever been in and I don't recall ever having to wait in line.

The stage is high off the ground and there are a few raised sections off the floor each with a banister to set drinks on. In short, there is not a bad spot in this place.

The acoustic and sound is always impeccable. Some of my favorite shows have been here and there seems to always be a good crowd. 

The Fillmore brings in quite a wide variety of different genres and is a routine stop for some of my favorite artists during their national tours. I do wish they booked more jamband/bluegrass type acts and less punk/mental, but hey! That's just me.

Whenever I was in my postpartum (4x btw), my korean friend said that the Korean seaweed soup (miyeokguk) is what Korean mothers would eat because it helps with their bm supply.

Red Robin is one of those places you go to as an adult to grab a beer and burger without thinking about it.  We went over the weekend for our first Red Robin experience and was pleasantly surprised to see how crowded it was.  I assumed that, based on the number of seats taken that it would be a great place to eat a burger.  I also noticed that majority of the patrons were families with small children, so the whole beer and burger thing may be a tad of a stretch, at least for the crowd I saw.

We ordered the classic with cheese and some steak fries, a mint shake and one soda.  The shake comes with the mixer container still half full, which was nice for the five dollar price tag, and was a fairly good shake.  Standard, nothing mind blowing or amazing, but good.  The burgers came out really fast, and I was happy with the short wait.  They were wrapped in wax paper and came in baskets, which was nostalgic.  To top it off, they were huge!  I couldn't wrap my mouth around one, for some reason.  Still, once I took the first bite I was satisfied but not pleased.  I expected their burgers to somehow be different, more authentic or genuine in taste, but I didn't get that.  Although a good burger, I could get the same one for less somewhere else.  Overall, good burger and fries (especially since they are endless refills), but nothing that I'd go back for.

I was a bit iffy about ordering a pie to go, but it wasn't for me so who cares right?  Who am I kidding? I know I'm going to have one regardless.

Of course i saw meatballs on the menu, and if you know me I'm a sucker for protein in all form and shape.  The bartender told me that they do not use bread crumbs in their recipes.  Even better, and man, were they worth it! Each bite were divine, and the marinara sauce was a great addition.  They give you plenty.  I had enough sauce to make sure each bite was coated for maximum decomposition.  Heck, it was even a dipping sauce for my pizza crust! Zing! Choice of lollipop or in a bread roll.  

Our Big Apple Pizza aka meat lovers came NY style thin crust..  It had Ham, Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, and lots of Basil.  Sooo good that i wanted another slice, but fortunately for me it was all gone before i could do myself anymore harm.  The pie was a bit soggy in the middle, but i think it was due to all the hearty toppings.  Then again it could have been more mushy if it wasn't for the  neo mesh (aka honeycomb) underneath the pizza.  The mat helps fend off the condensation, so our happy pizza kept us happy.  Kudos to Dom DeMarco's for being thoughtful.

While waiting for my order i had a good convo with the bartender.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and even gave me a little extra 411 about the place.  Like how they use ingredients imported from Italy, and how they use a water filtration system that mimic the water in NY.  Just some of the measure they use to mirror their pizza in NY which happen to be voted #1 by Zagat. 

Verdict: My new Pizza Spot!",2012-01-08 03:28:13

Expect a delay, we were there at 1100 on a Saturday, and had about a 45 min wait.  You can hang out in the sunken lounge if you want, that was kind of neat, and the drinks were good.  The dining area is a zoo, very busy.  That was my only critique; the waitress was so busy, our water glasses never got refilled.  The food was great and the portions were huge, think almost Hash House A-Go-Go big.  My omelet was the size of a football, and my buddy's pancakes were the size of a large plate.

Come to find out, most of my kids (have 4 total and not so much on the kid side anymore ranging frm 22 to 17) have been to Organ Stop and do enjoy it. (I fully believe they live a secret life when my eyes were closed, I thought they were out running the streets, but nope it was hanging out at Organ Stop haha) So Organ Stop Pizza was the place picked, time to meet up was a Friday night at 6:30pm. Off we went

We got there a little before 6:30 because wanted to make sure to get tables and set up for everyone, and damn the parking lot is FULL, Yep I was shocked! Didn't know it was such a hot spot to go to.  Prior to coming my (2nd oldest) daughter told me to find tables on the 1st floor (1st floor??? WTH this is a pizza joint right??? 2 floors?) And after walking in I saw what she meant. When you 1st walk in you are facing the menu board to order pizza, I'll get back to that, but if you go to your right you will see the dining room, and low and behold it has 2 floors of seating. 1st floor was completely filled up, so I went upstairs and found us 2 long tables.  Then I stopped and really looked around. 1st observation, DAMN THAT'S A HUGE ORGAN, and not so much a HUGE ORGAN, it's the pipes, they are in the walls, and all over, is this a sound proof building? Can you hear it on the street??  2nd, this must have been an old church, that's the feeling it gives from the 2 floors and seating arrangements.   I have to say hearing scores of the Phantom of the Opera played on that bad ass organ sounded amazing and the light show that went with it, I liked it. 

Ok like I said when you 1st walk in you are faced with ordering your pizza. This is where the place loses points, it's all scattered. In one place you order your pizza and pay for it, then get into another line, order your salad and pay for it, then get into another line for drinks and pay for it.  Why can't it be one stop shopping experience?  Oh and everything is CASH ONLY.  I ordered 1 large Hawaiian, 1 Large Combination, 1 medium Spicy Italian for 54 bucks, then ordered 3 pitchers of soda (MT Dew, Root beer, Sierra Mist) for 15 bucks. I tried the Hawaiian & Combination, the Hawaiian had chopped ham throughout the pizza and good amount of pineapple, the combo pizza wasn't lacking the bell peppers, for that's all I remember from it, but the pizza itself was not that great, it's like Little Creasers pizza but with a car dealership sticker price. 

Do I feel like I got my money's worth? No not really, but what I did get was a meal with all 4 of my kids, 3 of my grandkids, tons of family and friends, some laughter and smiles, and that right there is what counts.   Return factor though is really low.",2013-12-16 15:34:28

When dining at Inatei, we usually order some sushi/sashimi first and then find some small appetizers to share. We move onto cooked foods and rice/noodles.

Wait time from ordering to receiving food = 8 minutes!! 
VERDICT? Worth the wait AND lives up to the hype! 

As a local, my reasons to come to the Strip are limited to work, a special event or visiting friends and family. Since the Cosmo now charges an unavoidable parking fee, this once favorite casino of mine sees a lot less of my patronage. But, when I was scheduled to work PAINWeek 2017 here, I made a point to build in some extra time to check out the hype. 

I showed up at about 9:10am on a Friday and the line was wrapped around and down the hallway. But they've got a giant menu posted on that same wall, so be polite and decide what you'll order early!

I opted for The Slut (because, why wouldn't you?) which came in an adorably tiny glass mason jar. I appreciated that it came lidded, making it easy to take to-go. I also appreciated that they ""Recycle their Sluts"" (aka the jars,) although I kept mine! 

I'd never had eggs prepared this way. It's a consistency similar to poached but fluffier, because they're cooked inside the glass jars in hot water. The woman who served it to me was awesome in asking if I'd had The Slut before and instructed me to ""mix the slut well...otherwise you'll just get salt and chives."" ...good advice! The egg turns into a whipped butter consistency that you spread on your bread like butter (or dip, your preference!) and even though I ran out of bread, I ate the rest by the spoonful right out of the jar! 

Honestly, the wait isn't any longer than at a sit-down restaurant. At one point, a single cashier was manning BOTH registers. Taking new orders on one while processing payment from the previous order on the other. 

There's plenty of table/high-top seating if you choose to stay, but the food is just as easy to grab and go, if you don't! You can also rep an official ""Eggslut"" T-Shirt in Men's or fitted women's. 

If you're not a morning person, find a friend who is and have them order for the crew. It's a breakfast worth waking (or staying) up for!",2017-09-13 04:59:57

Go to the company store.

This place has shwag out the wazoo.  Golf balls, t-shirts, jackets, cups, stickers, magnets, you name it.  You can get most of this online, but if you're in the area and don't feel like paying shipping, this might be worth it.

Unfortunately, this location sucks for two reasons.  First, it is right next to one of the busiest In-N-Out joints I've ever seen.  Second, the store itself is only as large as one shopping aisle at a grocery store and it's packed full of people and crap.  Now that I've done it once, I'll go to the website instead.

Raijin Ramen offers good ramen overall, and I like how it is very spacious compared to other major ramen places in downtown.

The menu is typical mediterranean with a kosher bias. On my first visit, I opted for the falafel pita. I wasn't sure what really to expect, I thought maybe 3 or 4 falafel along with some lettuce, tomato, and hummus. I could not have been more wrong. They take a warm, fluffy pita and stuff it with as many falafel as they can stuff into it, usually anywhere from 6-8. After that, you are asked what you would like on your flafel/sandwich: hummus, tahini, hot sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled vegetables, tzatziki are just some of the condiments you can choose to top your order with.
The falafels themselves, are moist and nicely seasoned. All this delicious goodness for less than $8 is definitely a good value. If you decide to eat in, you can have AYCE picled vegetables and salads for $3! 

I have been back several times and although the owners can, at first, appear intimidating, service has always been friendly and quick. Everytime I have returned, I have ordered the falafel pita.

Skip the paninis, and opt straight for the bruschetta.
Do not hesitate to order the ""proscuitto with mascarpone and figs""
What I love about the menu is that one can order up to 4 selections of the bruschetta for $12.75.  This is a very filling choice, but with groups of four you can extend up to 8.

Recommendations below are my tops, my do or dies:

fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil
smoked salmon
prosciutto with figs and mascarpone
brie and apples with fig spread

Molly assisted me and was SO awesome. She took my order around 9am and scheduled it for me to pick up at 2pm. I showed up a little bit early and found her to be just as fantastic in person. She signed me up for a loyalty card and delayed my order so I could have a beer and throw some money in a machine. Once I was ready for my food, she let the kitchen know to prepare everything. The wings were tasty, as were the tots we ordered. The beer was cold, my machine was hot and overall it was a great experience. I will definitely be back!",2018-02-14 21:52:37

I saw this little restaurant and decided to give it a try.

When you enter in the place has a nice ambiance and decor theme that enjoyable. 

I was immediately greeted and seated and ordered a beer while I look through the menu.

It looks as though noodles bowls and sushi are a large part of their offerings. I chose to order a Teriyaki Chicken bento instead.

The bento arrived and It looked ok. I think the portion of chicken was meager portion & for the salad, it was simply iceberg lettuce with a tomato wedge dressed in thousand island dressing. I could make this entire meal at home. I was hoping for something a little more authentic, less Americanized, especially being in China Town.

I wouldn't recommend this place, there are better places to enjoy noodle bowls and basic teriyaki chicken.

Perhaps, dine at my house.  :)

There are ins & outs once you get stamped, so after we had climbed up all of those warehouse looking stairs, we THEN decided to go get some free drinks at another place before the cut off time... so yes, we walked back down those flights of stairs just for free drinks.  

The last time I was here, I got kicked out b/c I couldn't handle a drink a guy at the bar bought me and my b/f (jager, goldschlagger, & patron, but I think the bartender used cabo wabo instead).  So it was like I was seeing the nightclub for the first time!  I didn't make it to the Library, but I enjoyed the Mainstage & the Boombox room.  The patio side was also very nice (what I see most of my visits at Marquee).  I went on a Friday and it was crowded, but it honestly wasn't horrible. We were able to walk around and dance w/o being pushed around (with the exception of the mainstage dance floor).

Drinks are still great and well worth it (I usually get an Adios or Long Island).  
Not sure if walking up and down the flights of stairs is the new thing they're doing now, but all of the other times I've gone, I entered and exited through the 2nd floor elevators which took us up to the nightclub level and back down to the hotel level.

The service is very friendly and prompt. I feel like the servers might need a little more exposure to the drinks and food that they serve so that they can provide better feedback to customers when they are asked how something is. But on the whole the servers are great and really considerate about your experience there, so I'm sure things will improve.

We had the Corned Beef Hash, a Hot Cross Bun, a Salmon and Egg Toast, omelette and panko-crusted egg salad thingie. All of our food was very good to delicious.

The menus could use a little work. If the servers can't provide detailed descriptions of all of your items, then the menu needs to be a little more self-explanatory.

Word spreads around quickly....if you think they are like a copycat Capital Boil, that would be incorrect and an understatement...capital boil opened too quickly sacrificing quality...another discussion for another day.. Lol.. 

Back to Good Catch, we were served promptly to a table, our Server, Carrie (sorry if I spelt it wrong)  was very nice and advised us in the beginning that it's kind of a busy night and she will try her best to attend to us. I didn't feel any service was compromised.. 

We order some appys, oyster sliders (yummm)  lobster nachos (must try)  oysters... They were all well presented and delicious...the taste in everything worked like marriage... ..we ordered quite some alcohol, 3 bottles of wine,  flight beer and etc...we ordered dungeoness crab with curry, that was very delish!  The curry is better than Saigon Star, personally speaking...mussels with Good Catch blend and clams... Everything worked well... The sauces were not overpowering that compromised the seafood...they are open till late!

It has one of the biggest casts so it makes it very entertaining and action packed. The first time I saw the show, we sat in category 3 (section 201) and I thought it was a pretty good view for the price we paid. There is so much action around the stage and the sides of the stage you don't feel like you're missing anything. The most recent time we watched the show, we sat in category 2 (section 103) for only $55 bucks! (READ ON!) And that was pretty awesome, although since you're so close to the stage, a little bit of the magic is ruined since you can clearly see all the wires the actors are hanging from. (Ref their seating chart: http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/~/media/shows/ka/pdf/KA_Seating.pdf)

Since everyone's talked about how great the show is, here are ways to get cheap tickets:

- students get 35% off
- military get 35% off
- check on their website for 25% off tickets (http://www.mgmgrand.com/entertainment/ka-cirque-du-soleil-show.aspx)
- children also get discounted tickets (http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/ka/tickets.aspx)
- the best deal is through the Cirque Du Soleil's website. Every summer they have $55 tickets for category 2 seating (http://promo-www.cirquedusoleil.com/las-vegas/summer-2010/index.htm) you can also sign up for the CirqueClub for free and get notification of deals/sales (http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/home.aspx#/en/home/americas/usa.aspx)
- if you forget to book your tickets online you could go to those kiosks on the strip like ""Tix 4 Tonight"" but it's not cheaper since they have a service charge
- if you're staying at an MGM property, you could always try and ask your concierge if they have discounted ticket; or make the call through your Players Card number",2010-09-02 03:34:55

A co-worker of mine had told me about this place and after having walked/biked past it hundreds of times without knowing what it was, we stopped in after a lunch to get some desert. Where before I was blind....now I see! The quality of ingredients, the attention to detail, the actual craftsmanship that go into these creations make the prices they charge seem almost like a bargain. It's pricey for sure, but it's French pastry so that's a given. But it's as good as the hype says it is. My co-worker is from Paris and knows a thing or two about French pastry and she wasn't lying when she spoke well about Delysees. 

I had the chocolate coffee eclair. It was fantastic. There's lots of types to choose from, varying between chocolate varieties to fruit based kinds. I didn't try them all, but they all looked great and judging by the one I chose, I think it's safe to say they'd all be pretty good. The cost is $4.50, but it's worth it. Again, not a sweets guy but I definitely think this place deserves all the praise it gets. There's lots of other pastries to try, such as rum balls, donuts, croissants and coffee and tea.

I didn't know how busy they were so I called and made an appointment, and the gentleman who answered the phone, Levi, was extremely friendly and courteous. (When I couldn't find exactly where it was, I called back and he gave me directions... Lol. I was directionally challenged this time.)

We walked in and were greeted by friendly staff and of course, Levi, who asked us to sign in and then pick out our colors for our mani/pedis. (I chose Tiffany blue). Then we got to sit in the comfy chairs and get our nails done while relaxing and chit chatting -- the nail techs were absolutely wonderful! John did my nails and was great! I also told him that I wanted a design, anything but flowers, and he said his colleague would be better at that, and wow did she do an amazing job with the design! I couldn't decide what color to do my manicure though; I was thinking gold, and Levi must've brought over 10 different shades of gold and painted his own nails so I could see the actual color. I finally chose one, which wasn't exactly what I expected, but close enough, and John did an amazing job with my manicure as well. (Don't mind the picture where the paint job on my nails is ruined; I'm terrible at getting my manicure done, I always mess them up! Haha). 

The staff and Levi are extremely friendly and I really enjoyed getting my nails done here. They engaged the customers in conversation and made us all feel welcomed.

We started with the pretzel and beer cheese. Awesome. Soft pretzel be read with a generous portion of beer cheese. 

My lovely wife ordered a cheese burger - medium cooked. It came out way over cooked like well.done. It had a decent beef flavor. Big l1/2 pound size. My wife said it was not.good.

We also had a small portion of the green chili Mac and Cheese. We so wanted this to be good. It was not. Almost no cheese sauce. Lots of heat from the green chilli but very little flavor other then the pasta. Watery. Very disappointed. 

I had the pork adovodo. Very favorable. Delicious. Perfectly cooked intense pork flavored dish.

I will be reviewing the Ossington location in this review.

i deal coffee  is known for selling their own coffee beans. The coffee beans are roasted every Sunday at their Kensington location, so they are always fresh. They like to keep their focus primarily on their coffee so you won't find any syrups here.

I ordered a mocha. Whenever I think of mocha, or anything chocolate-like, I would automatically assumed it is sweet but this one was bland and I had to sugared and honeyed it up before I was satisfied.

The cafe's design is lacklustre for my taste and I felt could've been better decorated. It has that worn-down and mismatched look that just didn't strike me. However, I do prefer this one over their Kensington's location. Though what lacked in the interior decorating department is compensated in their customer service. Heidi, the barista, is a perky happy girl who answered my questions regarding the cafe. She even took back my mocha and added more foam to make it more appealing for picture-taking purposes.

The cafe definitely had its peak time, I noticed. I was there from approximately late 3 PM till it closed at 7 PM. The peak time was around 4 PM before there was a slow-down.

I advise you to go there late in the morning or early in the afternoon during the week. We tried to visit at least twice before only to leave in frustration because we could not find a parking spot.

With that word of guidance, I can candidly say that The Original Pancake House was worth the effort. Kay and I each had an unplanned day off last week, and we knew this would likely be our best chance to go. Arriving at around 11AM, we were at first dismayed to find the lot full yet again after traveling that winding, mountainous, nearly endless road to what comes off as a shining castle in the sky, but before we could even think of turning back, a silver-haired gent in an equally cinereal luxury car began to pull out. With glee, we took that vacated space, entered the restaurant, and were seated with no wait whatsoever.  

Kay and I were welcomed by a greying, urbane, sociable, modish, and towering fellow I'll refer to as The Brunchman. He was elated that we finally made it and seemed to be precognitive; we felt he knew us despite never having met him. 

""You've come to us at last,"" he declared as he gracefully skirred towards an empty and clean table with Kay and I in pursuit.

Just as we sat down, our young, lanky, bespectacled server appeared before us seemingly instantaneously. Her name was (I think?) Nicole, and she is not only an aspiring model but also previously hailed from Kay's general area. In Nicole, we both made a new friend, discussing concerts, food, and life with her as we indulged on delecacies from OPH's expansive bill of fare.

When I saw that the strawberries came with fresh whipped cream, I knew what my first course would be considering my obsession with said dairy product. The strawberries themselves were ripe and pure. In a separate bowl came an alabaster cloud of felicity, and through the cloud were the strawberries dredged, making for simple, natural pleasures of the palate.

A Crabcake Eggs Benedict came next, and with that, my lone complaint. Hollandaise Sauce is a tricky thing to master. I've tried to make it myself with somewhat mixed results. In this case, it simply tasted like warmed over, unseasoned egg yolks. However, the eggs were poached expertly, the duo of crabcakes were crammed with genuine crustacean meat, the buttery English muffins were plush, and the pink remoulade, the dish's saving grace, was such a wedding of tangy and creamy that the bland Hollandaise sauce was easily overpowered and forgotten.

Psst. Brunchman. My mom will sell you her Hollandaise recipe. 

Kay had the Coconut Pancakes, which were as crispy as they were fluffy and came with exquisitely airy whipped butter as well as an edibly esoteric ""hot tropical syrup"" that evoked sheer Paradise with its fruity sugariness. Also eaten by Kay was an order of Corned Beef Hash. I found the large, chunky, auroral potatoes to be flawless and the plentiful corned beef to be as keenly kosher and arcanely flavorful as any I've ever had, but Kay didn't like it as much as I did, sadly enough. Thankfully, her pancakes made her happy.

Enter: The Dutch Baby. My mother had spoken of it in whispers when telling me of her experience with the North Hills OPH. Since it takes 20 minutes to prepare, it is recommended that one order it with the rest of brunch. 

Minutes before it was placed in front of me, The Brunchman dramatically gave me a consultation. 

With his eyes ablaze and his long arms oscillating as if he was about to cast a spell, he said ""Take the butter, spread it...AROUND the interior of the...errr...baby. Then squeeze some lemon onto it and dust it with the powdered sugar."" After his lecture, he kissed his fingers and floated away, asking rhetorically with a beam across his lips, ""You'll be back tomorrow morning, no?"" 

When it was ready for service, I followed The Brunchman's instructions closely. The Dutch Baby is not a pancake; it is a bowl of doughy love, made lardy by the butter, lightly sweet by the powdered sugar, and acidic by the lemon. However, something was amiss. Syrup! I drizzled some onto the puff, and Nicole leaped forward to stop me only to be held back gently by the grinning Brunchman. He pressed a finger to her lips, shook his head, and looked my way only to nod in approval. 

""I was hoping you'd do that,"" The Brunchman said. ""I forgot to mention the syrup. You did well, young man."" 

The syrup would be what took this pudding-like dish, also known as a Bismarck, into Shangri-la. 

As I finished, The Brunchman provided a history lesson, and Nicole spoke with us some more, this time about her cosmetology goals and former places of employment. Kay and I were so taken by the OPH's hospitality, we almost forgot that we weren't at someone's home and had other plans for the day. Although our hunger had been abated, we felt compelled to stay...and return...",2012-03-11 22:41:03

I must admit walking up the front steps felt a little odd and is somewhat a peculiar entrance for a business that offer a great selection of beers and very generous pours of your favorite booze I assume the patrons have mastered exiting this pub one step at a time because I certainly didn't see much teetotalism practiced here.

It seems that Darby's truly promotes an atmosphere of celebration, it appears most were meeting here for a round of cocktails or a cold microbrew, but some were still downing the domestics like the water it truly is. The dining area to the left was filled with booths of after-workers loudly discussing their day, each speaking a little louder than the other ensuring most in the bar could hear their victories or struggles both equally exaggerating the acoustical problems that has the old timers leaning over a little closer or just hand signaling the server for another pour. 

I was fortunate to find a seat midway on the front side of the bar, Courtney the bartender was quick to offer up a menu and get a cocktail in my hand, she was very friendly and was a pro at handling the older couple to the right of me that were pounding martinis and scotch on the rocks like it was a daily task - as I sipped my Basil-Hayden it became apparent there are no strangers here. 

I ordered the deceiving large portion ""Small Plate"" of filet mignon tacos with a side of made to order Mac n Cheese. The three tacos arrived filled with tender beef with thinly sliced sautéed onions, peppers and fresh lettuce with a large dollop of crema, they were delicious but I think I'd order the crema on the side there was just a little to much for my liking. The Mac n Cheese was delicious as well it was really cheesy sprinkled with fine bread crumbles nothing to adjust no matter what you do there will still be a dish of melted cheese remaining when you're done.

Except for the recent addition of Wicked Spoon in Cosmopolitan, buffets... just aren't that fun anymore. It's always the same items. However, Leonard W knew of an AYCE Japanese spot about 5 miles away from the strip so before we left Vegas, decided to check out Hikari for some $27 AYCE!

The place is quite small and most of the people are local but we were able to get a seat at the sushi bar, which really is the place to sit.  You can order whenever you want and the chefs work super fast to bring your order out.

Decided to order the following items:

+ Salmon skin salad - the dressing was sorta like... a sweet teriyaki dressing. LOTS of salmon skin.
+ Sashimi sampler - came with tuna, salmon and hamachi sashimi.  Good combo!
+ Fried soft shell crab - whole pieces of fried crab. Yum :]
+ Japanese style oysters - oysters with a little of tabasco and some vinegar.  Some people ordered by the plates. Ridiculous.
+ Negi hama - very simple roll with hamachi and green onion. The only roll we ordered, since we wanted to focus on the items that were worth more!
+ Hama kama - yellowtail fish collar. As many as you want!
+ Unagi nigiri - soliddddd! I think I ate 2 orders just by myself haha.
+ Shrimp tempura - ONLY shrimp. Hikari is awesome.
+ Shrimp fried rice - nicely done, with the rice fluffly.
+ Uni sushi - still learning to love it but... for the uni lovers, NO LIMIT on how many you can have!
+ Frallops - nice crunch and could probably do without the aioli and eat it with katsu sauce instead, but man, fried scallop may just be my new seafood obsession.

Also, rather than order sushi, nigiri, or the sashimi sampler you can order sashimi only!  We got salmon, tuna, fatty white tuna, seared albacore, and hamachi.  Yes, it was probably frozen but still, it's quite fresh for an AYCE spot and they are not shy with the portion!  

Ladies, go after 10p and you can get the ""hot girl"" discount!

Hikari is definitely a great find and I'm still amazed how you can just order whatever you want and they won't even raise a fuss. The service was great too, and the people working at the restaurant are actually Japanese, so that's always a plus. Can't wait to go back!",2011-07-07 21:04:04

Little sis and I walked in not knowing what to expect and the whole layout of the store is pretty cool. The tavern has a great wood feel like a normal bar and we just sat down near a window and waited for a menu.

There is a huge variety of things to choose from that are all freshly made in the kitchen on the other side of the store. We started off like true boomba's and went for the pretzel bread with beer cheese. YUM it had a kick to it that was a secret but it was awesome. 

I ended up continuing with the boomba and grabbing the fried chicken with mash and veggies. Everything was great. Little sis got the kale salad which she loved. I am not a kale fan but she is and said it was great. 

They have both beer and wine and I had a white wine that the actual maker was tasting in the store that day. 

I would definitely go back here and try more things in the tavern and they might just make me want to go into the store and look around...smart move there Whole Foods...you little devil you.",2014-01-03 02:56:22

But I just can't bring myself to hate it!

Went here after work today.  First plus: Nelson's ""Love and Affection"" was playing on the speakers as I walked in, followed by other tunes of the late '80s and early '90s.  Second plus: we got seated right away. (it was actually quite comical; we walked up, gave our name, then as we were walking away we heard ""Jessica, party of two?""  It was a bit stupid, but we laughed.  It's too bad they weren't doing that to be funny!)

Third plus was the service.  Our waiter was awesome.  We wanted for nothing.

The food was pretty good.  I had a really fresh, citrusy arugula salad and a frickin' enormous plate of pasta.  Then of course I had to have cheesecake.  Yum.

One hint to staff: you don't have to give me a separate bag for each item! I got a bag for my leftover meal, then a separate bag for the other piece of cheesecake I ordered to go, and finally, when I wanted to wrap up what was left of my own cheesecake, I got a third bag.  Watch it, guys! Be greener and stuff.

I was expecting the Cheesecake Factory to be out-of-your-mind expensive, but I was actually pleasantly surprised when the bill came.  

But can I mention that Legacy Village makes me feel queasy?  So many cars!  So many lights! I felt like I was going to have a seizure.  It doesn't have to be Christmas all year round, people.",2010-01-30 01:50:06

Luckily for my friend and I the bartender felt bad for us having to deal with the angry toddler because he definitely cut us an awesome deal on our bar tab (plus the fact we already had two free drinks from Twitter). Oh, did I mention he made us free shots? Yah, we had a lot of awesome going on that night.

I had the Sunflower - such a wonderful refreshing cocktail. I also had a whisky-based drink which packed quite a punch. I ended on a glass of Chardonnay. The bartender was nice enough to pour me a sample of the two types he had behind the bar and I selected the one I liked best. Ummm yes, I selected the much more expensive one without knowing the price. Haha, so just be aware they have some pricey wines back there. ;)

I  like the interesting shops in the area and a few restaurants.  Unfortunately, many of the restaurants are national chains like this one.  However, this place knows what it is doing.  You won't be blown away, but I've never had a bad meal here.  I went today with a couple friends and sat at the bar.  The space is nice enough with plenty of seating and high ceilings.  The bar area is pretty nice with a few hightops scattered about.  On the weekends this place can get pretty busy at the bar.  Today we were the only ones there.  The bartender Jen used to  work here and then she was at the Library down the street and now she's back again.  She's competent and friendly enough.  She said she makes a terrific bloody mary, so we ordered a few.  The bloody mary was very spicy and very strong.  It was a  good bloody mary and certainly wouldn't take more than two of these to wake you up in the am.  We started out with a nice very fresh sourdough bread with butter.  The sourdough was great.  I'm thinking ""Breadworks"".  I tried a smoked salmon appetizer that was served with red onions, capers, and chopped eggs.  It was very much a brunch dish.  The salmon was tasty and their were plenty of toppings.  The salmon was served on these crispy crackers with some type of flavorless sauce.  When  you  bite into the crackers the whole thing basically explodes.  It's not a very user friendly way to serve the salmon.  This would have been much better with just a bagel and some cream cheese.  I tried a friends ""Firecracker"" rolls.  It was basically a chicken egg roll.  It was okay, but not memorable.  He also ordered a reuben which he said was good.  I tried one of his fries that looked good, but was kind of mushy instead of crispy.  I had a tilapia which was served encrusted with some type of nut (pecans maybe, don't quite  recall).  It was cooked perfectly and quite frankly a little too big for a lunch portion.  Served with a nice tasty rice pilaf and some green beens.  This was good, but heavier than I would have liked with the topping on the fish.  Overall this place does fish quite well.

Ordered the tofurkey sandwich (veganized - tofurkey, vegan cheez, tomato, spinach, red bell pepper, hummus on whole grain bread) and my friend got the An Alien Left a Burrito in the Middle East (hehehe), veganized - spinach tortilla w/ beans, vegan cheese, hummus, couscous, and veggies.  I had a bite and it was nummers! I'm gonna get that next time for sure. 

They also have a black bean sandwich (not veganizable) and breakfast items (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito!).  Reasonably priced coffee drinks, lots of teas (including a very tasty local organic ""Summer Orchard"").

Very friendly staff, and we got our food and drinks really quickly.  Was surprised at how inexpensive it was, bonus! 

Looks like it would be a fun place to hang out with a few friends on one of the sofas (they had several board games).

Besides that, the food was really good.  But the service was super slow for some breakfast food.  My recommendation is to know what you plan on ordering before arriving at the restaurant.  That way, when the waiter asks for your drink order...you can go ahead and place your food order.  And once you place your order, be prepared that it's going to take 20 minutes regardless if you ordered a plate of eggs.  Crazy, I know.  The food was good enough for me to come back.

The decor is beyond gorgeous!  Beautiful glass baubles hanging all over the room, a giant silver horse, sheer painted screens, painted mountain landscapes, and very nice private dining rooms as well.  It is pretty quiet and relaxing, even though there is a sea of slots in front of it.

We started with the egg drop soup, which was very light and not salty.  We also ordered the pot stickers, which were very light and tasty.  They are so cute-you get 6 mini ones.  I could have gone for a touch more vinegar in the sauce that comes with, but was good nonetheless.   We also had the Mongolian beef, which was delicious, tender, and full of flavor, and the bbq pork and shrimp fried rice-nice dish, not greasy, I just wish it had a little more shrimp in it.  The dessert we had, some kind of fried banana with a banana cream 'dip' was just alright.  I've had better desserts like that before.  It was very rich and the batter a little on the heavy side.  They also presented us with a tiramisu-like cake with a candle for my birthday, which was light and fluffy....And then there was the fortune cookie...the best of the desserts.  Homemade, semi soft cookie with a nice fortune inside served alongside a shot of Baileys.  We were so full! 

For such a posh place to eat in Vegas that isn't terribly expensive in general, but a little pricey for Chinese, I think it's worth the trip.  All our food, dessert, and 1/2 bottle of wine was $100 including tip.  Staff is very nice, I didn't need to ask for a thing!

All of these choices are good, although I will say that the mushroom & almond sausage tasted a bit dry and could use a bit more moisture. Though it seems that since I've went, they've changed it into a dinner only venue with private brunches/parties, which is a bit of a shame considering that their brunch menu is definitely pretty dope.

My hubby was hesitant at first because its location is not where you would think a good breakfast place would be (it's in a strip mall next to a faucet store and a hardware shop).

The moment we walked in we received top notch service. The kitchen is behind an open counter and all of the guys behind it said hello and welcomed us. There were about 5 other tables but one was like a party of 10 plus. We sat next to a table of a couple who apparently were regulars because both waitresses referred to them by name and gave them an affectionate hug and ""how have you been"". All good signs.

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and I took the waitresses advice and ordered a daily special - the breakfast sandwich and beverage for 7.25. I had went online took advantage of Yelp's 10 for 20 deal but our bill only came to 19 bucks so I didn't.

The steak looked awesome and the gravy looked delicious. The hubby ate it right up. He said that he like it - it wasn't too greasy or fatty and the gravy was great. My sandwich was quite yummy - but the bacon was the chewy kind - not the crisp kind like I like...but my honey told me that he prefers the chewy kind (I learned something new :) so no fault there.

I must say I really enjoyed the coffee and I'm quite the coffee snob! My only complaint was the eggs were underseasoned - both mine and his but nothing horrible - they were definitely cooked perfectly.

I thoroughly enjoyed when the owner\manager guy came by and asked us how the food was. He ended it with a sincere ""I appreciate you guys, Thank you"". And for whatever reason -- I really believed the guy -- he seemed like he really meant it!! Plus the waitress was really on it and she even said, ""did yelp bring you guys in"" and we were like yes... I still can't figure out how she knew that.....lol


We are definitely coming back. The hubby was drooling over the Mama's burger pictures so we are itching to use the coupon for a big lunch.

The price, service, and food were top notch and we are looking forward to coming back!

Definitely recommend!",2013-02-26 15:24:18

I've finally dipped my sinful fingers in a one pound bag of shrimp, drenched with SHABANG sauce. The controversal question that lingers everyone's mind is...HOT AND JUICY OR BOILING CRAB? Who is the king of ocean shell eats?!?!?! A great first for me tonight at Boiling Crab, and I must confess, my heart is in the middle.  I'm at a 50/50 decision here where one seafood joint outruns one trait and another for something different.

Here are the pros and cons: While the 1 pound shrimp may feel like you're being swindled in quantity, I think the quality of shrimp cancels it out. The shrimp SIZE is big. Which I am thankful for since it requires less work in peeling shrimp, and the taste of wonderful shrimp does suffice at every bite. It gets discouraging sometimes peeling small shrimp, and feeling like you didn't pop enough shrimp in your mouth to enjoy it. The SHABANG SAUCE tastes different from HOT AND JUICY's house sauce. Shabang is a bit more tangy, salty, and less spicy. Which I actually love. If you're an indecisive person when pick a good sauce, pick the Shabang since it compiles all the sauces together. I went for mild tonight to be safe, and thankfully it wasn't as spicy as I would have assumed.

25 cents for a cup of water. This turned me off a bit since that was a first for me, and I always thought water is complementary in every restaurant. Also, I heard from my friends the catfish isn't that great. But, I think thats expected because fried catfish isn't fried catfish unless its from the south, or with a little soul! 

Service was great! They were very friendly, and always returned with your requests promptly. The fun part is the idea of writing on the wall. I mean, you came, you saw, you conquered. Might as well let everyone know you were there!",2012-01-14 08:20:06

The old cafe looked similar to the Peppermill Lounge on Las Vegas Blvd - with bright colors and neon lights.  They've recently (within the last year - I'm behind on updates) remodeled the entire place.  The decor is much more neutral and modern and quite a few of the tvs were removed (sad).

The prices have gone up about $1 per meal, but are still impossible to beat.  I had a porterhouse special on a Tuesday night, and at $7.99 (with a salad or soup and a baked potato) it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Never thought I'd say that about this place!

It's a small place, located in a small casino and it gets crowded on evenings, weekends and holidays.  Lots of locals love this place, so be prepared to wait for a table at peak times.

The service has always been friendly and prompt and they have a lot of servers in the room so that nobody is overwhelmed by tables.

We waited a very long time to order drinks several times, when the waitress would come to the table she would take only a few people's drink orders and not the whole table, the food runner kept placing food items anywhere he wanted on the table and not in front of who ordered it, so we kept having to get up and go to the other side of the table to get what each of us had actually ordered, it was just kind of a mess. It is also strange that their happy hour consists of 50% off any drink you can think of, but NOT any of their specialty drinks, I've never been anywhere where that is the case.

Weekday evening dinner for this place was somewhat quiet and on a rainy day I might add. The decor of the restaurant is beautifully designed to make you feel like you are at an international location. 

We were the first since we came early for dinner. So here is my review.

Drinks
Lemon Grass Ginger Cocktail- Very smooth and not sugary like many other drinks. Nicely made.

Good selection of wines to select from. Seeing more and more wines from Paso Robles, CA- They make good wines. 

Falafel- Very crunchy and crispy. Lots of fresh parsley which I like.

Entrees/2 sides
Rosemary Rack of Lamb- Delicious and cooked to perfection. This is my favorite dish and will come back and order this. Yes, it is a bit pricey.

This entree also came with 2 sides- the Potato Harra- Love potatoes, the way they make it here was a little too lemony for me. The Baba Ghannouj- was very good

The Lamb Kabob- Nicely prepared and tasty. The ordered were Hummus and Tabbouleh. Hummus- very good.

When I go to a restaurant, I like to look at the menu and discuss with others what to get and then decide on the bottle of wine to go with the meal. I really do not like being hurried or rushed. We were the only customer there. Don't get me wrong the waiter- he was good. Great job with bringing the food to the table and bringing new plates. But he kept coming to ask for our order. We need a minute or two to make our selection. He did not even notice that the water glass was empty for the longest time and I had to flag him down.",2015-04-19 11:55:19

Staff at the restaurant are always friendly. I simply know to find a booth. It's trying to figure out what I want to each that is a challenge. 

I have had the coconut slushie in the past. You get real coconuts and milk in it. I loved it so much. It was refreshing. I have also had the house vermicelli with a spring roll. It was yummy!

I had rare beef and beef ball pho, with grilled chicken rolls as appetizers. The latter was flavourful in the sweet dipping sauce. I was asked whether I wanted bean sprouts in my pho. Yes, please! I do recommend trying the squeeze of lime in your pho broth. It is wonderful.

As for the food, everything was amazing from the grilled calmari to the fresh salad, to the amazing rosted hen. Deserts we fantastic too, I suggest the taster platter where you get a variety of mini desserts. 

Staff was great, they even check-in your coat, which is fantastic specially with those big winter coats.

I will definetily go back.

The prices for oysters are reasonable. The ones I had just weren't shucked properly. Every one I slurped came with an unexpected piece of shell. It was really a bummer. This place does have a helluva lot of sauces to choose from, though, if you're adventurous. 

Their Happy Hour menu isn't anything impressive. Not at all. Yucky American beer, like Bud, counts toward the $3.25 pint. Nothing else does. They do have a great Honey Ale and also offer Moose Drool here, as well as Orion, the best Japanese beer you'll find. And it costs $7.50 for the 22 oz, whereas you'll pay $9.00 for the same at Kabuki.

They also have a short sushi menu. It's not too impressive, but it's enough to pique your interest. I really loved their Rainbow Roll. 

Maybe it's b/c we sat at the bar, but we barely got any service. And it began to annoy me. We had to ask for water. We had to ask to order. We had to ask for another 'round. We had to ask for soy sauce trays. We had to ask for just about everything, in fact. 

The atmosphere is ordinary - what you might expect from a place called a ""Fish House."" Nothing really stood out to me. 

Would I be back? Uhm, maybe, since they do have a couple good beers available, they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from... I just hope next time they're shucked properly. 

I would like to try their King Crab/Shrimp appetizer. It was served to the gentleman beside us. It sounded good on the menu. It looked even better in person.

The food was amazing and the service was exceptional. Their wines were great and the prices quite reasonable. The server even gave us complimentary coconut jelly to soothe our mouths after eating too many hot peppers. I tried several things on the menu, and after careful deliberation I can confidently recommend the following dishes:

- Khao Tung Nah Tang - shrimp crackers with a crab dip, looked meh but tasted amazing!
- Roy Thai Dumpling Platter - do not skimp at order one platter per two people. These dumplings were truly beautiful little works of art, inventive and delicious.
- Yum Tua Plu - wing bean stir fry. From the menu description it didn't sound too appealing but we took our server's word for it and lo and behold it was great
- Khao Yum rice - delicious medley of different coloured rice and fragrant flowers/herbs
- Beef short rib - SOOOO good especially with their house-made roti dipped in the delicious sauce

There are many bars in Vegas, tons.  Particularly gaming bars.  This one takes the cake.  Their cocktail waitresses are attentive and friendly and their food is above par.

Susie was the cocktail waitress taking care of me and my friends.  She was clearly aware of everything that was happening with my friends and I at all times and offered all of the right things at the right time.  If you visit many bars, then you know how fantastic that is, particularly in Vegas.  Many Vegas cocktail waitresses these days seem to have an attitude of ""I will get to you when I feel like it"" while making you wait till they remember you are there.  Susie was there before I even thought to look for her.  Not just once, not just twice, but over and over again from the moment I got there till I left.  She might be the greatest cocktail waitress I have ever witnessed, and I have visited many bars.  I can't think of a single word except perfection.  Sounds a bit over the top, I know, but I am a service junkie.  I can only dream that every bar I go to has a cocktail waitress like Susie.

This is coming from a guy who hates gaming bars.  I can't stand them.  Here though, I recieved better service than many upscale bars I attend regularly.  Notably better.

Is that all?  No.  I was hungry and in the mood for spinach.  Yes spinach, I like spinach and on occasion I crave spinach.  A spinach salad at a gaming bar? ""I will just hope for the best"" I thought.  Then it came.  A perfect looking, fresh spinach salad that also had a touch of personality.  Strawberries and glazed walnuts with goat cheese and a maple vinaigrette.  I was astonished how great this salad was, and I am a tough critic with food.

The only downside to this bar is that it is very far from my home and on the complete opposite side of town.  I hope that the fundamentals that make this place great are maintained and expanded upon with success and new locations closer to me.  The only suggestion I would give is to give your bar and future bars a more unique look and feel to astetically separate them from the mess that is the mass of other gaming bars in Vegas that are no where near your level.

Thank you for the refreshing experience.  I wish you great success.",2013-01-06 14:00:13

First off, the theater and stage.  Each seat has a surround sound system built in, so the music surrounds you and envelops you and takes you away to this far off land.  The stage itself is just awe inspiring.  It is continually moving the entire show.  It changes, rotates, disappears, and transforms into so many different surfaces, that you never know what is going to happen.  The stage itself is a character in the show.  There is also a lot of interaction between the performers and the audience, which always makes for a more entertaining show in my book.

Secondly, this is the only Cirque show that I have seen that actually has a linear story line.  All of the other Cirque shows I have seen have a main theme with vignettes running throughout the show itself, but not a story.  So if you have seen other Cirques, it is a little different, but fun to go on a ride with the Imperial Twins as their search for each other. 

Lastly, their is a sense of martial arts throughout this show.  I am not into martial arts at all, but watching this show, you really get a great sense of the art and really appreciate the artform itself.  I am still not watching Bruce Lee movies, but I very much appreciate martial arts now.  

Overall, I think KA is a fun adventure that you should try out.    If you do go to see it, buy your tickets ahead of time and directly through the MGM box office whenever you decide you are going to see it.  The theater is huge and if you wait too long, you may be stuck in the back. There are a lot of ticket brokers that will take advantage of you here in town. They will promise one thing, but you get stuck in the back corner in the left over seats and no one wants that, especially for the price you pay for Cirque. I am a local and used to work in the concierge business, so trust me on that one.   

KA seems the least appreciated Cirque show in town, but go see it anyway. It was even in a CSI episode, take that ""O""!",2013-04-21 04:14:38

We started off at the bar getting 2 drinks, since we had to wait for a seat (about 10 min) at which time the hostess came over and politely lead us to our seats.

We started with the calamari appetizer ($9), which was very good if not a rather large portion; they also fry up sweet potato strips that come mixed in with the calamari. The calamari had a nice texture, good flavor and was not overcooked or chewy. 

I ordered the herb crusted prime rib ($24) and a baked potato ($6) and I have to say I really enjoyed the prime rib. It came hot and med rare just as I ordered it. It was tender and I loved the herb crust, it is a nice difference from the general pepper crusted prime ribs you generally find around town. The baked potato was not the best it looks and tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.

My Girlfriend ordered the bone in New York ($34) and mashed potatoes ($6) and We were both floored by the flavor of that steak. It had great grill marks, had great flavor, was a thick cut, and seasoned properly. It also came medium just as she ordered it.  (I will be ordering this next time lol) the mashed potatoes are really nice and I would call them garlic mashed potatoes since they have it in them but its not to strong. 

She also ordered a glass of wine which was nice and I had a few beers myself, which went well to compliment and stand up to the intense flavors of our meal. We finished off with a cappuccino for each of us.

The wait staff was very friendly; always close enough to check on us without being in the way. I ended up tipping the server $20+ since he was probably the best server I have had in some time and it went along with the bill ;)

I do not live very close to henderson, which is GREAT for my waistline because if I did - I'd be here every week.

The first time i went to Nacho Daddy was for brunch on sunday with my husband and we ordered the bacon & egg nachos. What an AWESOME concept - eggs on nachos!! The house made flour chips are thick, crispy and oh-so tasty!  The entire entree was the perfect ratio of crunch, gooey cheese, fluffy eggs, and tasty bacon.

I have also had the buffalo chicken nachos (subbed the chips for the flour chips because they're awesome), Nacho Average Burger Nachos, the spicy shrimp nachos, and the hubby ordered the country fried steak nachos and the BBQ chicken nachos.

While a fan of the buffalo chicken the others were good but not AS good. Hubby liked the C.F. Steak nachos (not for me - I'm not a fan of the gravy) but said the BBQ chicken nachos had a tang to it that he wasn't excited about.

BUT it's the bacon & egg nachos that we keep coming back for. They are only available on the brunch menu (which I believe is now available 7 days a week 9-2??) but they are definitely worth driving 11 miles for.

Liege waffle is a little more dense, chewier and can be quite filling. And since Waffle U let you pick unlimited toppings and the nice owner even offered if I want extra ice cream, I was on serious sugar high.

Only 99 waffles are available everyday. So if you are planning to be here later in the evening, it is best to message or pm before coming so he can save you 1 or 2 orders.

If you are into sweet, I strongly recommend you give Waffle U a try. I just love freshly made waffle straight from the oven. There might be a little wait for your custom made waffle, but it  definitely worth the wait.

$10 tax in per order is a little pricey but for frequent buyer you get 1 free for every 3 waffles purchased.

They had this neat veil that came across the middle of the restaurant to separate the bar from the dining room for private parties which was really different.

Our bartender Shea was great! He was friendly, he knew just what to suggest, and he was funny. We had the house cabernet which was Bench 2015 and it is now my favorite cabernet. I even went out to buy some from the liquor store yesterday.

For an appetizer my friend and I had the shrimp and lobster cocktail. They were both chilled and succulent. Next we had the endive salad. The blue cheese, arugula, and beets were put together well, however I wasn't a huge fan of the endives. None the less still satisfying.

For entrees we had the 12oz NY Strip prepared medium with a red wine reduction sauce that was perfect! The steak was cooked properly, the meat was tender, and the sauce was scrumptious!

The fried chicken was our second entrée and it had to be the best fried chicken I've ever had!! Definitely recommend! It was crispy, salty, a little spicy, and the meat was moist. So good oh my goodness! I could rave about this all night. The only thing I wasn't too much a fan of was the gravy on the mash, it was a bit sweet like honey. 

Overall, this restaurant was great! The service was excellent and so was the food!",2017-06-10 03:17:52

The bartenders, even though they are super busy, they are friendly.  First let me start with the impeccable service in the booth area around the bar.  It is seat yourself and immediately as Susie introduced herself and said chips are on the way, chips came... unlike Boccacha, which I'll review later own of course.   The Red Pepper salsa is also excellent excellent along with their own salsa.  

My mom loves Mexican food so have taken her on a Mexican food tour so now I can dish out a mom's review with my own.

Jalapeño Margaritas with salt and since mom wasn't feeling a salted rim, Susie said how about half-salted rim.  Perfect.  I also always ask for the Habanero hot sauce which I really love over the Ensalada de Asada salad. 

Healthy options:
Ensalada de Asada is my absolute favorite menu item.  The champagne vinaigrette is lite and blends the fresh veggies together beautifully!  I need that champagne vinaigrette recipe please!  

Ceviche de Pulpo.  The octopus in the Ceviche melts in your mouth with the tanginess of the sauces mmm!  Taste buds dancing, I swear!  The Ceviche trio is an easy way to find your perfect Ceviche favorite!  Trust me the trio is very filling so order as you go like I do.  Sometimes I like to have a long, couple of hour lunch after a long day.  No rush just order as I eat and relax!  I also like to bounce around eating in the hotels.  

Pollo Asado is fantastic for a hearty and healthy Mexican dish.  The chicken breast is moist not like the chicken taco side.  I ate this for almost a year only eating this and the Ensalada de Asada!  It doesn't go against the rules of dieting.  Nice piece of protein and veggies.  

Camarones Rancheros is not as healthy, but close and absolutely divine.  Wild premium Mexican white prawns sautéed with garlic butter, poblano chiles, onions and tomato flavored with fresh cilantro.  Cooked to perfection, not chewy. 

On to the Enchiladas!  The real deal Mexican food!  

Dad didn't feel like meat today so ordered the Spinach Enchiladas which not only look mouthwatering, but dad said he couldn't tell that there wasn't any meat cause it was hearty.  'It was the best.  It had the same taste as a regular meat enchilada.  The combo of the spinach, black beans and rice were absolutely perfect.'  He would get it next time for sure.  It was his first time trying an Enchilada without meat.

Mom and I got the same delicious thing, Beef Enchilada, Chile Relleno and a Chicken taco.  The chicken was so dry in the taco and I would have to say it's the second or so time that I've had that dish and it's been the same.  Note to self:  no chicken in the side taco that the dish comes with.  

I have tried many amazing dishes here!  If you do not like cooked bell pepper and onions, like me, that are already cooked into the beef, then ask for the grilled steak that is fantastic to get in the beef enchiladas, tacos, etc. 

I love the rosé and champagne mumm split besides the specialty drinks.  Mike, Mike, Jose and the girl that works there are great.  She has a unique name like me, but my memory fails me right now.   

Please check out my photos for more.  Thank you for reading this, trusting in my reviews and loving food like I do!

Here, you can find a large selection of men's, women's, and children's clothing from the Japanese retailer. Most clothes are made for everyday wear, so, the style is casual (for the most part). They've got anything from outerwear (notably, their ultra light down line) to slippers. I bought jeans which are so far so good. I've heard great things about their Heattech line as well. Uniqlo also features some items from the Drake General Store at the back of the ground floor.
This store is large, the selection is good, and the employees are friendly. But, there are things that can be improved on at this location. My main concern is the fitting rooms. There's no illusion of privacy. The fitting rooms are located on a fairly busy corner of the store (near the cashiers). The doors of each room were quite high off the ground--outsiders could see at least a feet from the bottom of your door. Needless to say, it's incredibly awkward changing clothes in there. Also, the fitting room line was long, but it's all part of the grand opening rush, I suppose.

This busy Chinatown sushi joint was packed with hungry U of T students and lunchers a like.  We ordered from a long list of lunch specials (all $6.50) - California & Crunchy Rolls and the Teriyaki Beef Bento Box.  Our meals came with free green tea, miso soup and salad which is pretty standard.  

Service is quick and food came not too long after ordering.  The bento box is definitely the better value for the money and big eaters.  It comes with rice, 3 pieces of sushi, 6 pieces of tempura veggies and tender pieces of medium done beef teriyaki.  The sushi special wasn't anything special.  Standard, run of the mill rolls, slightly better than getting them at Loblaws.

The bill was accompanied by fresh chunks of orange.  They were sour but it was a nice added touch.  Overall, not a horrible experience for us as described by a few reviews below.

At first I was going to get just a pasta but ended up including a personal sized pizza as well incase I didn't get a chance to come back to the neighborhood any time soon. All of us also got a free dessert because we checked in on our Yelp app so that was a bonus treat :-)

I ordered the Patate Pizza because the description for it stood out among the list of pizzas available. The portion size for the personal pizza that I ordered is enough to fill up someone who wants to enjoy the dining experience but is watching the amount that they eat. And also if shared among four people, it works as a good appetizer and the toppings were distributed evenly enough that for each smaller piece you could taste all the flavors on the pizza. But I think I'm going try out their tomato based pizzas next time.

When I was looking at pictures of the pastas for the Sudbury St location, the Rigatoni stood out as having the most balanced ratio of meat to pasta, as in there was a enough meat accompany every forkful of pasta! And I was not wrong in making a smart choice to get that dish. The braised beef was so tender and it complimented the texture of the rigatoni. And the generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, slowly melts into the sauce and adds some creaminess to it. The Rigatoni had already become my instant favorite even beforeseeing it for real. Coincidentally the Rigatoni seems to be a favorite of most diners because I saw more pictures of this dish on the reviews, and also three of us (out of five) ended up ordering this dish. The restaurant did not hesitate with the amount of cheese they put on some of the pasta dishes and also the pizzas. The Patate pizza also had a good amount of parmesan on it which was also distributed to the sides of the plate, so I could even add more cheese on top of what was already on the pizza. 

For dessert, I had my heart set on the Panna Cotta but ended up picking the Coconut Cake with a really tasty frosting or sauce and I'm not sure what the featured ingredient in it was. And it also had a decent amount of coconut and chopped pistachios on it. The cake itself had the texture and sharpness with the spices as that of a carrot cake but with coconut instead. I'm not a big fan of coconut based desserts and treats but this cake was delicious enough especially with the sweet sauce. But I'm still going to get the panna cotta next time I'm there.

The service of the restaurant was upbeat and the staff there were pretty friendly and also accommodating, especially when we wanted to move to a different table. Hopefully the quality of service will remain the same, you can't go wrong with that, certainly not.

Club Tavern has been described to be as a ""dive bar"" on many occasions, and in some aspects, I can see that is true. It's dimly lit, the floor is sticky in places, the bathrooms look like they haven't been updated in decades (but are kept surprisingly clean), and it isn't surprising to see a fight break out now and again (it never gets dangerous, don't worry). Still, the place has a very cozy feel, and if you're a decent human being, the staff treats you practically like family.

Drinks here are cheap, and if you come often and tip well, they pour 'em strong. There's daily specials too that you can't go wrong with. $3 Long Islands on Saturdays is phenomenal. Food is your typical bar-fare. It's gotten a bit pricey for most of it, but I've never had a bad experience with how it tastes. You can buy 75 cent tacos on Tuesdays as well, and you really can't beat that. Their Friday night Fish Fry is surprisingly good, and is actually miles better than what I've had at The Vintage. Breakfasts are dirt cheap, and you get nice portions too.

Bands play on certain nights - usually Friday or the weekends. Those are really hit-and-miss though, so don't let it sour your opinion of the establishment if you catch one of the lamer acts. They have Trivia on Tuesdays which is completely free and is great fun. They don't skimp on the prizes either, but you'll have to come check it out to find out what those are. There's Karaoke on Wednesdays as well, with a pretty standard selection of songs.

The patrons here are also great. The nice, friendly people are treated well and encouraged to come back, while the rowdy troublemakers and abusive arseholes are quickly removed and never heard from again.

Whether you're looking for a place to stop in and have a bite to eat with a glass of beer, or are looking for a new bar to frequent, Club Tavern is a fine choice.",2016-09-19 23:45:56

The size of the burger and fries seem to portray similarity to the In-N-Out burger. The difference of the fries is that they are a bit more ""soggy."" The taste was just mediocre in comparison to other burger joints.

I do like the variety they provide for people with things such as rice, fruits, frozen items, Korean specialties, etc. The food court though has gone down hill to say the least compared to when it first opened. The food court was my favorite part of going to Greenland and people loved going there, but now the food court is relatively empty and dead now.

The supermarket itself is nice. My favorite part is shopping for where all the meat is because of all the different Korean meats you can get. They range from different kinds of beef, spicy pork, and chicken. Their snacks that they have, are filled with variety. My personal favorite are the shrimp crackers! Those are a MUST try. I do like these seaweed flavored chips by Calbee (if I remember correctly). They are different, but a good different for me. It may sound really Asian of me, but I like that they have all the different kinds of rice you can choose from. I like short grained rice, and they do a really good job of having a variety of those. Line things that I didn't like is that they discontinued their rewards program, for whatever reason. I think that was pretty selfish of them, but hey, what can you do about it?

This Greenland supermarket has a good court in it, so that has to play a role in my rating. I really really loved the good court. I would go with my family at least a few times a month, and then they started changing. Things became different and less people started showing up for whatever reason, and then the restaurants started closing down. I don't really know what happened, but I was bummed out about it. Currently, they reopened it with a few restaurants up, but it is nowhere near the same as it use to. People who did come during the prime of its life know how it was, and it was amazing. I don't think it can ever go back to being like that, but we could sure hope one day.",2013-11-02 10:13:11

Founded by the Bromberg Brothers and featuring the duo's first foray into the 'burbs, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken arrived in Downtown Summerlin by way of New York earlier this summer and although the quick casual concept has been questioned for high prices as well as uneven cooking ever since opening it was with a friend and his child that I sat down for lunch on Saturday, almost every off-putting rumor soon confirmed.

Nicely lit and well adorned with amenities including motion sensing trash compactors, LCD televisions, housemade sauces, plus a fountain featuring artisan sodas from Boylan's, a visit to Blue Ribbon begins at a counter with smiling servers - the dining decisions largely sandwiches, combos, and sides with additional options for shakes or salads, plus single tenders, wings, or thighs.

Taking note of a few specials, the August-only ""Smorgasbird"" with a portion of the proceeds benefiting  Multiple Sclerosis offered in addition to perplexingly priced hush puppies - $3.75 for a half-dozen or $7.95 for ten - it was after some perusal that an order soon completed, the fifteen minute wait with one of those vibrating flashy buzzers spent sitting in one of several unpadded booths.

Certainly not a cheap meal, the total before tax and tip north of $55 for what would prove less than enough to sate a family of four were it not for the three excellent pieces of egg bread wrapped around the charitable sandwich, it was largely a matter of principle that the Smorgasbird was ordered and with two boneless cutlets spiced quite unlike the Bromberg chicken at Blue Ribbon or Brooklyn Bowl suffice it to say that each piece was almost too dry on its own to be enjoyable, the better bites found in barbequed bits serve atop cheesy fries tinged in peppers while anemic looking tomatoes made one question sourcing during the ingredients peak time of year.

Finding the tenders to be as oddly spiced and devoid of moisture as the cutlets while wings at least maintained their texture thanks to the presence of a bone, it was onward to sides that the meal progressed and although the hushpuppies were each quite small the flavors of sweet corn were thankfully prominent, the same not to be said of soft collards barely bolstered by pork let alone the 'adobo corn' which certainly would have benefited greatly from some salt.

At this point seeing the emperor for his lack of clothes while wondering why the duo opts to change their chicken at each venue when the original version is the one that earned them such acclaim, it was in a trio of shakes that the meal concluded and although none were particularly innovative each was clearly crafted of good ice cream, the vanilla trending a bit thin and mellow while the Nutella and caramel were decidedly sweet and thick enough to stick a spoon up straight.

Overpriced and overseasoned with little more than a 'name' to justify the hype Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken joins the likes of most of Downtown Summerlin's imported eateries, a situation that makes one wonder just how long the public will continue to bite.",2015-09-03 04:28:54

Went with my family and we pretty much ordered everything that was the most popular items that most people ate. 

-Lobster roll with hot butter was amazing! Lots of flavor and the lobster meat was delicious! 
-Softshell crab sandwich was really tasty as well. Soft crab meat and not overly fried 
-The oyster slider! Super tasty! Probably one the best tasting sliders I've eaten that wasn't beef. 
- The cajun bag shrimps! Yum yum! loaded with flavor since its marinated in the sauce so the shrimps really soak up the juices. 

Also got the wings which were decent! The wings were larger than what I expected and bigger in size than usual places imo. 

Really enjoyed this place for their seafood! Definitely would come again and eat the same things since it was so good!

The staff were quick and old-fashioned as well. But they failed to talk up the best menu items, (making a point to tell me the crab in the crab and shrimp role is canned) and didn't adequately explain the fry options. 
I ordered the shrimp and crab roll, despite the sub-par recommendation, served with house-made spicy chips.  
The other folks at my table ordered the quarter chicken meal, served with fries.

Appeteizer - Shrimp & Scallop Lettuce Wrap 
Entrees - Braised Sea Bass, Tofu & Shredded Pork

                 String-Fried String Beans with Spicy XO Sauce

The food was excellent.  I really enjoyed the Beef Tenderloin which was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The Lettuce Wraps had great texture and was a perfect small bite for 3 to share.  The Sea Bass also had a great flavor and any tofu bowl is tasty.  The Stewed E Fu noodles were a little bit over sauced but still yummy.

The bill came out to about 55-60 per person.  That's definitely expensive for Chinese.  But I don't think you can argue that food here is bad.  

Basically what you're paying for is the service and decor.  Let's face it - You don't go to a chinese restaurant to get good service.  Sometimes the service you receive is outright rude.  It's not a stereotype - it's the truth and I'm Chinese. 

This place is beautiful and the service is akin to a fine dining establishment.

But a fine dining chinese restaurant will never be able to stand on its legs when compared to fine dining Italian, French, and other cuisines.  If you can chop and stir fry 80% of the entrees in minutes, it's hard to argue ---  Fine dining Chinese is at a disadvantage.

Went with family to celebrate a birthday dinner, at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon. There were only two other parties in the place.  In spite of the dead slow time, the waitress refused to help us split up a check (""You ordered appetizers, and those are too hard to split."" Huh?), and seemed relatively uninterested in us most of the time we were there.

I wasn't super hungry, so asked to get the lunch portion of the Bangers & Mash after she talked about their homemade sausages. She said I couldn't do that on a weekend, but I'd want the dinner portion anyway.

That dinner portion had a pile of fairly tasty homemade potatoes, but only three halves of sausages.  Not three sausages, three HALVES cut lengthwise. So 1 1/2 bangers for a dinner portion.  That's not banging, that's barely mild thumping! And they were curled up from being overcooked. They seemed like they could have been tasty had they been cooked decent.

Oh, and the dinner special fried chicken?  All out for the day. At 3:30?  Seems like if you're going to run a dinner special, and have it on your special's board, you should, I dunno, HAVE the special in the kitchen somewhere.

My Guinness was also flat when I got it, and as I think about it... I started this review with two stars but I'm going down to one.  An English pub that can't nail a Guinness and Bangers & Mash might want to rethink their priorities. I haven't been this disappointed in a pub in a long time, and I won't be back.

Consistent screw ups, we've never been through the drive thru and usually just eat right there ,but it's no different.  If something came out wrong, or if only one of us got our order and 10 minutes later the other person still didn't get theirs - the staff AVOID you like the plague!  I guess they think if they avoid eye contact with you, then you'll just go away.  There just shouldn't be that much drama in a bagel joint.

2. Bathrooms were disgusting. I even brought it up to a supervisor and she was like oh well. Well let me tell you that when someone goes to bathroom they want it clean. Again look at the other amusement park/water parks across the country and you will see what bathrooms are supposed to look at
3. The wave pool has no waves. I'm not kidding the waves suck and aren't even high enough to make it a wave pool. I don't know if their insurance says you can't be high or not but it was very disappointing
4. Lazy river is more of a kids destination now instead of a relaxation ride. The lifeguards are doing more flirting with the girls or guys then watching

Not only do they cell homemade ice cream, but they sell homemade cookies that you can choose to make your personalized ice cream sandwich, aka ""sammies.""

I came here on a Saturday evening with my cousins. It was my first time and the staff was very helpful explaining the steps and letting me sample all the delicious ice cream flavors. If you like the circus white and pink animal cookies, they have this special flavor with animal cookies in it. My cousin wanted to order it but they didn't have the flavor out in the display. Luckily, they were able to check the back and they had one. They let us order some scoops before they put it back in the freezer.

They offer a wide variety of flavors, from classics like chocolate to some unique rotating flavors. The nice thing about the ice cream sandwiches is the option to select 2 different cookies and have a split scoop for your sandwich! It was such a unique concept and delicious experience! I highly recommend trying the coffee and double chocolate ice cream flavors!

I highly recommend coming here with an appetite because their single scoop is pretty large, especially when you order the ""ice cream sammie."" They have indoor and outdoor seating, but their outdoor seating didn't have any heaters when we were there, so we opted to sit inside.",2016-12-06 01:39:20

Believe it or not, I actually think this place is quite underrated. Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in Scarborough, especially for the price you pay. I was somewhat of a regular here back when I still lived in Toronto, and came back here when I revisited here for the holidays.

Fisherman Villa is located east of Midland, just north of Sheppard on Glen Watford Drive. It's hard to miss as the restaurant is quite big, although from the outside it looks like it could have a makeover or two.

Most of the menu is in Chinese, so if you're Chinese illiterate you would be better dining with someone who can read the language. My family ordered a chicken shark fin soup, sesame chicken, peking duck, and mixed veggies. Everything combined was only $90; an extremely cheap price for the quality you get.

I highly recommend the sesame chicken here, it's crispy and sweet at the same time, and the chicken pieces were actually quite good in quality. The peking duck is also one of the better ones you can get in Scarborough, although the pancakes used to roll the fillings here would get quite hard if you don't eat them immediately. The shark fin soup is above average for the price you pay, but I've had better in other restaurants. Finally I found the mixed veggies to be decent, again very good value for the price you pay.

Service was very good the entire time. I haven't been here for dim sum so I can't vouch for that, but I can definitely vouch for dinner in here.",2017-01-07 04:54:08

It was hard getting to the venue by transportation, since you literally have to walk the whole square all around to get there 20 mins walk in addition to taking the bus. The show started late. The lineup inside of the Treasure island casino was long as was the wait. We had good seats-with bottles of champagne waiting for us at our table-we went through 3 bottles as drinks were included part of the package. The quality of the buffet was average -it had an array of brunch items-the pancakes and bacon were my favourites. Once we settled down with food the show started. It was around an hour long-the drag Queens would perform and then walk around for tip. They were great!

The truck just uses plain white bread, but it gets perfectly toasted and ends up working very well because it doesn't overpower the other flavors.

Another sign of the  of the changing times on the Ossington Strip, BB (in a former garage nonetheless) is a great new addition.

I've been wanting to go there for a while, a while being the month that it's been open! I was curious about the buzz that it's generated in such a short while and also curious to see what the proprietors had done with the place that had been in their possession for a bit and counting. 

My curiosity was amply rewarded. Goes to prove an old adage wrong. 

We had to wait approximately 15-25 mins at 9 pm on a Friday evening  but noticed that the lineup got longer as the evening progressed.

Very minimalistic decor, cavernous tanks, high ceilings give the renovated garage a feeling of ample leg space even though it's admittedly not very large. 

I was glad that it's not a very large space inside because that meant we got to experience the patio! Sitting on picnic tables made from freshly cut pine under clear skys, sipping delicious beer, laughing with old friends and making new friends: definitely a great summer evening!


I started with the Farmhouse Saison which was very light, smooth, fruity and summery. Moved on to the double IPA which packed a stronger punch and was very citrusy. Lastly, had what I call the 'coffee brew': smelled deliciously like caffeine, tasted smooth with a shot of espresso in it, and packed the strongest punch at 9.5%. I enjoyed the gradual progression of beers and appreciated the input of the servers!

The bar snacks on the other hand were disappointing. As much as i like trying out new things the pairings were off: boiled potato pieces on a stick with anchovie mayo and lamb tongue just didn't seem to gel with the beer. One needs something heartier with beer like duck fat fries or proper skewers or mini sausages or something!

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at BB and will most definitely head back a few times more before the sun sets on Summer'12.",2012-06-02 13:50:30

I got ""the great big one"" and a side of fries and it was all awesome! Don't be too intimidated when they throw that frisbee-sized burger patty down on the grill (it shrinks up to just a bit larger than the bun). The thinness allows them to handle the large volume of customers and leaves you with a perfectly-cooked burger. I'm not sure what their blend is, but it's a delicious patty! The fries are pretty standard, but they were cooked perfectly (not too dry, not too soft, and not too salty).

The fixin' bar is nicely stocked and clean, despite what you'd expect upon entering a place with such divey vibes, as well. The only thing that was a bit intimidating as first-timers was the ordering process. If it's your first time, maybe check the menu online before you go. If the lines are long, don't be surprised if they ask you what you want well before you get close enough to the menu to make your decision. The staff is nice, but you certainly feel a bit rushed by their system! Luckily, I'm guessing they do a pretty good job with whatever they turn out, so you could likely order anything on-the-fly, and you won't be disappointed.

I was hesitant to pick up tickets because the line-ups were not too appealing to me and going to fests in general at my old age has lost much of its appeal.

Having a fest like this in Vegas' urban core was a wonderful experience. Everything I witnessed was so well organized. The public art was my personal favorite - so many great and beautiful murals on dead buildings was a welcomed sight downtown. Yes, food and drinks were a little pricey (some of it well worth it - pork belly from Nobu!), but that is the reality of a festival of this size. 

I find some of the hipsterphobia coming against this festival to be rather humorous. Hipsters are about the most harmless group you could possibly attack, but people seem to be all against them. Additionally, it is such an ill-defined term as it seems like any curmudgeon 30 or 40-something (acting like someone twice their age) cannot stand hipsters - which seems to now mean anyone who is young and likes indie music (The horror!).

They can get away with it because it is obvious, based on their menu, they step their sliders up a whole 'nother level.  Everything (even the vegetarian options) read so appetizing.  The dribbles were making my way to my chin.  It would be embarrassing, but  I'm sure they see it all the time. 

Their service was very friendly and efficient.  My order was styrofoamed in two minutes.

I was in the mood for Italian, but also wanted something spicy to battle my sinuses. I opted for two mix/match sliders and chips combo.  The sliders were; ""Powerball"" - homemade marina-soaked juicy meatball stuffed with gooey mozzarella with deliciously fresh basil leaves floating in the sauce & ""Italy on Wisconsin"" -- a roma tomato and fresh mozzarella slice topped with the basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Too finish it off, I had to snag the handmade thick-cut potato chips with garlic wasabi!  

The meatball slider was perfect old school Italian-American with a touch of class stepping it up with basil and perfectly oozing mozzarella.  Even better was the incredible ""Italy on Wisconsin"" - AKA 'Caprese Salad on a Bun""; I never thought that it could work so well, but it was, so fresh and saliva inducing, I wanted more!  Of course their buns are perfect (don't say that in the wrong company)!  Finally, I finished with the chips.  There was a massive mound of perfectly crispy, crunchy and salted real potato-ey goodness.  The wasabi sauce was sinus-clearing and delicious -- the garlic was a light undercurrent, but added to its robust flavor. 

The budget gourmet lunch was only $8.00!  It was certainly more satisfying than grabbing a Pop Tart from vending or walking further for a bland sub or a slice of grease-drenched pizza.

My first impression, real nice and organized inside. Lots of seating and flat screens. I liked how they have a express line for only boba and coffee orders. They have a voice automated that calls out your ticket number when your order is ready. I was a bit thrown off because it wasn't going in order, so at first I thought they skipped me. Perhaps whoever's order is easier to make is called out first. 

I ordered the chicken banh mi sandwich with and iced coffee plus $1.00 coconut waffle. I'm not so much a fan of there sandwiches - bread is hard. The coffee is good- strong. However, they put only a small amount of coffee and then a grip load of ice! The coconut waffle (green) sells for $1.00 in which you can find them in single packages at the front register. My colleague loves it apparently. I don't know what she loves about it though. It was so dry that I literally was about to choke on the piece of waffle bc I couldn't get it to go down!

I rarely revisit the same restaurant within a week....but this place deserved another visit and I'm already planning to go back yet again next week.  I think I'm becoming a Kabuto-addict as many are going to be if you have been yearning for an authentic edomae style sushi.

They started an Omakase menu today, so I gave that a try.  

The difference between Omakase and Nigiri course is that they include miso soup as well as sashimi plate that included blue fine tuna, houbou (blue fin robbin), and kasuga dai (baby sea bream) as well as grilled plate, in which today they had Kamasu (barracuda? sort of), australian wagyu, and anago (salt water eel) with sansho spice with anago liver.  It did come with pinapple flavored sake aperitif as well as today's sakizuke (amuse bouche) was grilled kasugodai (baby sea bream) and wakame salad.  

Nigiri started out with Kinme (golden eye snapper or alfonsino), blue fine tuna, kanpachi (amberjack), kisu (sand whiting), surume ika (squid), ishidai (striped beakperch), blue fin tuna chutoro, then negitoro hand roll.  I also ordered hotate (scallops) and aoyagi (orange clam) a la carte.  In Omakase, it doesn't come with tamago (eggs) which nigiri course comes with.  

I believe that most fish came from Japan again, except for clams (hotate, orange clam from boston), amberjack from kona, HI, and Tuna from Spain again.  They only received 3 Kisu from which they can only make 2 sushi from each fish, so that was pretty nice for itamae-san to save it for me, as kisu as a sushi ingredient is not very common even in Japan as it's a tricky fish to prepare.  It's used a lot in Tempura.  

I feel that Omakase is great for those people who want to drink some sake beforehand and eat some sashimi and grilled fish before starting Nigiri.  If you are a straight nigiri kind of person then I'd probably stick with nigiri course.  

I just can't say enough good things about this place or hide my excitement.  I love the fact that most of the fish is different from week to week as they get different fish as REAL sushiya does instead of having the same old same old frozen/defrosted fish.  

Several words of advice for the edomae sushi noobs:
  1)  don't ask for soy sauce. You don't need it unless you have sashimi or hand roll and the wait staff will bring it to you as it becomes necessary.  Besides, they use a special soy sauce that's aged 3 years, so they certainly don't want to leave a big container for people to pour out liberally.  Don't ask for extra wasabi as there is no need for it. Putting wasabi in soy sauce is a huge no-no as it destroys the flagrance.  

  2)  Try to use your fingers, not chopsticks.  If the itamae sees that you are using a chopstick then he will probably make the nigiri a little firmer so that it doesn't fall apart, but nigiri needs to be soft enough with enough air in the rice portion so that it falls apart as you put it in your mouth.  The proper way is to pick it up with your fingers (thumb/index, middle finger), then rotate it and put it on your tongue with fish part facing down toward your tongue.  In most sushi places you may need to dip the fish part (NOT rice) in soy sauce, therefore nigiri needs to be inverted anyway, but in a proper place like Kabuto, soy sauce is already painted on so it's not necessary to dip in soy sauce.  You want to put the fish down first so that you can feel the texture of the fish, and you do NOT want to put the rice on the tongue first because vinegared sushi rice is too strong of a flavor for you to enjoy each fish's texture/flagrance/taste. 

3)  Do not insult the itamae by ordering NON edomae neta (sushi ingredient) such as salmon, unagi, or any silly sounding rolls because they won't have any of that.  Instead, ask the itamae for some edomae neta, which are not commonly seen in the U.S., which are things like anago, kohada (shad), nihama (cooked clam), saba (mackerel), etc.  Can you tell what they have in common??  Yes, they are all cooked or vinegared.  In Japanese, we call them sushi netas that have some ""work"" done to them.  It takes more skill/time/experience to make them as opposed to just cutting raw fish, but those are the classic edomae neta's that separate the real sushi ya's from the wannabes.

4)  As it is still BYOB, try to go out and get yourself some real sake to go with your sushi.  A good sake will go VERY WELL with sushi, especially properly vinegared sushi rice. If you don't like sake, you probably haven't had a good one.  Go to place like total wine and look for a JYUNMAI sake, meaning pure rice sake.  It is sad to admit that the Japanese sake industry has been corrupt for decades, and big companies like shochikubai and ozeki have been making crap sake with additives for decades.  You want to get jyunmai sake that is made of rice and water, nothing else.  Or even better, GINJYO or Daiginjyo are premium sake made from shaved down rice only using the central part, which has more of a fruity aroma.",2012-05-02 07:10:05

I've had their buffalo seitan pizza and a mushroom pizza. Their vegan cheese is so soft and melty, I love it. Their seitan is very textured and delicious. They make their own homemade seitan! And their vegan ranch is to DIE for! I can't get enough. The pizza is super tasty here. 

The seitan cheesesteak is unbelievable. I couldn't fathom how it wasn't actually meat! They slice the seitan like thinly sliced steak and top it with vegan cheese, mayo and vegetables. It was super good. The seitan wings were really good too!

After an x-ray and a few tests, Dr. Otten had an idea what was going on - and miracle of all miracles, he was able to give me some anti-inflammatory meds that were able to get me through my marathon somewhat pain free.

I went with a go to, an Old Fashioned.  The gentleman behind the bar went to work and it was almost hypnotic watching him make the drink. It was like watching an artist working with his medium of choice. It took him a few minutes to assemble and put some finishing touches on it but was totally worth the wait. After tasting the drink I can honestly say I don't think I've ever had a true Old Fashioned until that very moment!  It was amazing and eye opening!

The center is rarely underdone or droopy. They cut it into squares rather than pie slices, which is a minor annoyance.

Stay away from the pasta; it's wet, the marinara is obviously canned and quite runny, and it's overloaded with cheese. The garlic bread is ok, but it won't save one of their pasta dinners. But it's a pizza place, so I won't ding them for bad pasta. The salads are so-so; heavy on the iceberg lettuce but still fresh, so don't shy away if you want to combine a salad with a little pizza for a lighter dinner.

The milk tea is on the spot, you have to order that, the balance of milk and tea is just right...I would definitely say they top it for most of the other HK style cafes...

You can either order from the menu or you can delicate your meal to the staff who can arrange a chef table recommendation for you.  From the chef recommendation will have different sashimi, I mean sometimes the whole fish presented sliced into sashimi.  At the end, the fish bone will be used to boil a tasty soup.   Not to miss the desserts that are one of a kind - ice cream, crème burlee, pudding.

If you are a sake drinker, here they have lots of choices.  I tried a Pears sake which is smooth, chilled and really good while and after your sashimi consumption.

The blue fin tuna has 3 different choices from different part of the fish - they are so good and each has a different texture and your taste buds started to turn.  If you stick with blue fin, you will not like Hamachi and salmon any more.

The grilled mackerel is grilled in front of you with a burner, very entertaining.

The black cod is so flaky added a boost in flavor.

Keep in mind for those who never had it, you have to keep mixing the rice and everything together because the hot stone pot would basically burn your rice. So for me, I kinda liked that crispy taste.

Yes, I understand that it is oxtail soup and perhaps having the veggie variety defeats the purpose, but for me, there is nothing finer than a pho full of green delights. Make the broth with oxtail or other meaty parts, but bring it to me with leaves and things. Pho 87 was a disappointment.

Their veggie pho comes with onions, and maybe I am a greedy green monster, but I want bok choy and celery and carrots and broccoli and... The plate of side veggies was fresh, but small. Plus, for the little portion of tofu they added to the bowl, they charged $2. With the tofu surcharge, the pho was a relatively expensive offering. Nothing is quite as saddening as expensive pho, except perhaps expensive Thai. 

As for the broth, it was definitely clean, which for me means plain. It wasn't complex or flavorful. Perhaps, I have been swayed by MSG in other pho or perhaps it was a bad night, but I don't know for certain. For me, it was missing some sweetness. The predominant flavor profile was a sourness.

The service was quirky in a fun? way. When we arrived, the proprietor was chowing down on an ear of corn, and she joked, ""This is not on the menu,"" as she led us to the table with menus in one hand and cob in the other.

Accepts vicinity card if you're part of that loyalty program.
Definitely liked the taste and the texture. Didn't feel too diluted.

One thing that's a bit interesting with this location is the design of the walls. Because there was a long line-up, I found myself leaning against a wall on the side while looking at my phone (aka a distracted person). Next thing you know, I find myself falling into the wall, only to realize that this was a camouflaged door, which we referred to as ""the trap door"", because right after falling in, you just see stairs heading down into the basement to the washrooms. 

I've seen this kind of design at some other bubble tea places (in particular, several Cha Time places have this), but the key difference here is those places usually don't have a flight of stairs behind the door and you won't casually lean against it while you're waiting in line. I don't have an issue with this because it was an amusing experience, but I can imagine accidents may happen if you're not careful.

If you order Nachos your order will come swiftly as that is what they have readily. The other orders will take a normal cooking time. The only gripe was that we came on a Sunday around 3:00, and it wasn't too busy from what I could see. The service was a bit slow at the end with my check. No big deal but thought to mention it.

This is a newer place and it's kind of in an odd location. Hopefully for them, they'll survive due to the food. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: They only have 1 type of tequila. It isn't very good and it comes with a nice little hangover the next day. So beware. 

We ordered the guacamole--it was super good. Nice and full of avacado chunks. 
Shrimp and fish tacos -- I didn't have any, but my fiance said they were delicious. 
I ordered the Waygu beef steak. It doesn't come with tortillas, which it should. But I did order flour tortillas as a side. Mine was almost cold...but everyone else said their food was hot.
The steak itself was really good and cooked how I asked. It wasn't as tender as Waygu noramlly is. And it was a little overpowered by the cumin. So that was nice to taste the rest of the night. :| 

Everyone else loved their dishes. We did have someone order shrimp enchiladas, but it was chicken. They did comp her dish.

They keep saying how great it is and as a fast food connoisseur, it was definitely on my list the next time I made it back there.  Well much like finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans, I was driving down Decatur in part of town I rarely roll to and lo and behold, there was a Farmer Boys staring me in the face.  Waiting was no longer needed.....it was go time!

The place was epically busy during lunch, which is a good sign.  I ordered the Farmer Burger which is a half pound burger with cheese, bacon and avocado (got to go with the namesake) and made it a combo.  I duly paid up and when the transaction was complete I asked for my cup for a soda, the gentleman taking the order was like ""Oh you wanted a combo, I didnt ring it up as such.""  I said no problemo, I'll pay the difference, but he was insistent that it was his fault and that he'd take care of it.  I felt bad and wanted to pay but he wouldn't let me so I put what it would cost me into the tip jar.  I thought that was a nice, albeit really unnecessary, customer service gesture.  Not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.

As for the food, the burger was outstanding.  One of the better fast food burgers I have ever had.  The bacon was crisp, the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.  I struggled to finish the whole thing, which is a rare occurrence.  The fries were good but relatively unspectacular.  I wish the fries were top notch because I would not hesitate to give Farmer Boys a 5 star ranking in that case.  Although, there is hope.  The menu is extensive and I have barely scratched the surface with this matinee performance.  When I make my return, there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakfast menu which is served all day (awesome!) and intriguing salad and wrap options too.  So basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening salvo, while further visits will reveal the true nature of this place. 

Prices were decent, especially considering the quality of the ingredients.  Service was friendly and the dining atmosphere was kitschy, rustic, farmy fun.  I also respect that they rock the drive-thru as well so if that REO Speedwagon song I'm rocking too is just to good to turn off, I can keep the party going without missing a beat.

Always assume gym salesmen are either lying or misinformed and proceed accordingly.  I got the same nonsense about ""oh, yeah, contract doesn't say what I told you it says, I'll email something to you.""

The music is WAY too loud and it's the usual gymmusic crap.  I've given up listening to my earbuds, it's impossible.  The building is quite large with plenty of room for a wide variety of stuff. Yet there is no wide variety when it comes to ""machines"".  There is a terrible selection of machines sort of in the middle.  And most of the machines were designed by people unfamiliar with human anatomy.  The angles and pivot points on many of them defy the movement of human bodies.  The handle grips  on the ONE bicep machine squeak like they came off a Model T.

So what is all the space taken up with?  LIterally there is an ocean of unused treadmills and ellipticals.  I've never seen more than 8 in use at any one time.  Maybe everyone is in the movie room.  It sure would have been nice if they had gotten more  machines and more variety of machines instead of the dead ocean of treadmills they have. And when you are on this LONG double line of treadmills what can you watch?  There are two or three smallish overhead tvs on one end that NEVER have the closed captions on.  On the other end there are about 8 treadmills with little individual TVs.  In the vast middle there is just the view of the central ""grass"" area where people stretch and roll and push balls around.

From an architectural/aesthetic standpoint the place is awful.  It's like they said ""Why hire a professional space designer, my Uncle Milt can do it on a napkin and we'll just paint the walls off white and the ceiling black.""  Parking is terrible but that's not EOSs fault.

I am currently a member here as well as at Planet Fitness.  There is literally only two things better about EOS.  1) they have rowing machines which Planet fitness doesn't have at all.  2) they are half a mile from my house instead of 6 miles away.  The machines at PlanetF are much better designed and there is a much wider variety, the layout there is much better, the music is not intrusive, and the staff is far more professional. 

 Ten years ago I was a member of Pure Fitness, which used to be at this exact same spot and was much better in every way but like most gyms they peaked and crashed and were bought out.  LA fitness bought them.  My membership transferred to LA fitness which was not as good.  It suffered from the same lack of variety on their ""Machines"" and they cost too much.  So I moved to 24 hour fitness.  They were OK although still not as good as Pure Fitness was for variety.  Then PlanetF opened up with better prices and more variety so I switched to them.  

And now I'm trying EOS.  I haven't decided yet if their more convenient location is sufficient to switch to them or if I should just stay with Planet FItness and make the drive.  Based on the typical lifespan of these gyms I expect that within 5 years one of them will be out of business.",2016-02-17 17:24:38

The portion was perfect since it wasn't too much food but enough to be filling.

The 14 came with rice and beans(was supposed to be rice only). The 4 came with beans only(was supposed to be rice and beans). When I pointed this out, the waiter ran off like he was going to take care of something. He came back with no solution so I told him to just bring us a side of rice.

The food was WARM, no flavor and the beef taco was greasy.

When I first came to Salon 1226, I was just having Ian cut my hair, as I was coloring it myself. Ian always did a fantastic job. He eventually convinced me to let him color my hair as well -- complete game-changer. This dude is the real deal.

I have a pixie cut that I've been rocking for several years. Ian has taken it above and beyond through his artistry. Depending on the season and the look I'm going for, we work together and change up my style every couple of visits. He takes such good care of me. I can't imagine going anywhere else for any sort of hair service.

The salon itself is very enjoyable. It's not sterile or pretentious like your salons in Southpark. The vibe is comfortable and accessible. I'm always greeted by name, and I'm always complimented on my way out. It's clear that everyone at 1226 works exceptionally well together and enjoys what they do. There is a lot of collaboration here, and the end results are consistently excellent.

Also, if you're busy, there are several options for booking your appointment. You can book directly through their website, fill out a form to discuss your services, or call to arrange your service. I generally prefer to set up my next appointment before I leave, but when I've been in a pinch or I've had an event I need to get cleaned up for, I've submitted a message through the website and have always heard back quickly and with a helpful response. 

Frankly, I've been hesitant to leave a review of Ian and 1226 because I believe in the power of a well-kept secret -- but everything here is so great that I can't keep my mouth shut. If you're on the fence, book a service and let them wow you.",2017-02-01 17:35:17

Everything is well placed so you can get a great workout. I Iove it because the prices are also pretty fair. If you're a student taking at least 3 credits it's free.

2. Free bread was amazing - crispy edges and soft interior, and the butter was soft and creamy.

3. Grilled Escarole with Jowl Bacon - A nice appetizer salad where the flavors really popped.  I actually liked the bitter greens and how the mustard vinaigrette dressing imparted some tartness.  And who can so no to bacon, especially jowl bacon - we're having soul food after all.

4. Chewy Steak Bavette - Similar to hangar steak.  I got this medium rare per the house recommendation.  Incredibly juicy and flavorful meat here.  They had a small side of couscous and another grilled veggie - some sort of endive which soaked up the red sauce well.

The only thing I tried so far that I didn't care for was the spicy tzatziki. Had kind of a weird flavor.

Sure some of the restaurants have been replaced with others.  Some have reno'd and have new signage, but one thing is for sure, nothing beats K-Town for K-Food.

I didn't go to Korea House that much as a youngster but it was close to where I parked and didn't feel like walking that much.  Popped in and I swear that not much has changed in years.  Like stepping back in time!  Hope that the food quality and recipe hasn't changed either.

It was well past the dinner hours and the clientele at that time of night seems to be University crowd having some food before they head out to the clubs or a house party.  Wow - does bring back distant memories.

Had the Dduk-Man-Du-Gook (dumpling and rice cakes), LA-Kalbi, and a stew.  The food was almost like I remember it.  The Kalbi was sweet and tasty.  The dumplings were well stuffed and the broth was a bit salty.  Maybe as the day comes to an end, they add a little more salt and water as their broth supplies dwindles - not an uncommon practice as the restaurant closes.  Nonetheless, still better than a lot of pretenders up in the 905.

Service is ok - if you are looking for prompt professional service, then go elsewhere.  The young gals do a good job overall.  Trust me, they rather be k-popping somewhere else but they still manage to be courteous and polite to us old folks.

Parking is road or Green-P.  Lots of them around.  Use the Green P app so you don't overpay for parking - you can add time by blocks of mins - Nice!

An almost 4 star!

I don't hand out that many 5 star places, even some of my favouritest places still get a 4 star-but I really couldn't think of any way this place could be improved except for one tiny billing thing (they don't do automatic gratuity for partys 6 or more). That is IT.

So, anywho, we had people waiting for us who due to our large party of 9 people, went ahead and ordered one of every dish. Finding the place was easy enough off Cameback, we had a small private lot to the side, and we walked in, stunned by the dark ambiance, the dinner din and the sight of the cooks to our immediate left cookin' up food. We snaked back to a tall table (which I normally HATE, but I was fine with this one) that seated us all comfortably. We had some vegetarians (and the lonely lactose intolerant me), but most of the plates are seafood or veggie friendly, a perfect place for the vegetarian in your life (a really pleasant surprise). The asparagus was incredible and Stevey and I kept stealing extra stalks. I did try the shrimp, and it was just plain perfect, the sauce with garlic was impeccible. There was a soft cheese with fruit with brioche style bread that I thought was soft garlic at first-I did eat some (to some regrettable stomach problems later-but it was SO GOOD)-but that was a special that night so don't offer it regularly.  There was an eggplant dish that was savoury and not too oily. Damn, and some kind of infused olive oil with doughy soft bread slices. Oh, and plenty of olives, PLENTY-me and Jeff the other olive lover went ballistic-and we still didn't finish all of 'em....yuuummers.

Steve and I indulged in some simple (cheap) red wine by the glass, and the glass lasted through out dinner (we did two rounds of all the dishes) for like 7.50. Valerie had the sangria, which had a strong taste of strawberries (also had strawberries floating in the glass), and I found it refreshing, but didn't think it paired great with the savoury, warm tastes of the tapas. The bathroom was clean, nice. The service was friendly and down to earth-and we couldn't have done desert if we tried. We ended up doing 30 per person (including tip) on our cards, so for large groups this is a great deal for grazing, the conversation we could all hear each other despite the large size and the restaurant was cosy but not clausterphobic.

We went on a Food Truck Round up night here and the place was packed! We waited a while to get a beer but it was well worth the wait. Even tho it was packed the staff were patient and explained all the beers to us and helped us choose the perfect one. The price was very reasonable for a micro brew as well, $6.50 for the one I bought.  The area was so simple and so well designed and decorated. The rough walls and large antique wood doors really pulled it all together. (I wonder if you could rent it for a wedding reception or something? Oh wedding bells!!) Even with all the people, it was quiet and I could have a conversation with my friends without having to yell. (or wish I had more friends who knew sign language.)

They have a dog just running around that was so sweet and so cute and I just loved him! (Side note*: I love all dogs so it could have been the meanest little shit dog and i'd be like, ""look at his growl, isn't that cute!"" But really this one was nice and I kissed him lol) 

The bathroom was large and painted a dark green color with some flowers in the corner. It was cute and clean! I had to wait a while to get into the bathroom, but there may have been another one, I'm not 100% sure.

Melissa spent about 45 minutes going over the technique of turning the glass rod, controlling the flame, adding color, and shaping the pieces, and then we had the remainder to work on our own pieces. Fortunately for us, there was only one other couple there, so we got lots of individual attention...I think my strawberry wine stopper would have been a freak fruit without her help!

While one class definitely does not an expert make, I am looking forward to trying some of their other classes now that I have a better sense of how to fix my (many) mistakes. This is a great date idea for a more established couple, as it provides lots of fodder for conversation after the class, but not much opportunity while you're staring down at the flame.

But i have had tried a good number of the meats on the menu to give you some insight if you have never been there or you have not tried something in particular.

First thing, I have never had any problem with the customer service at this location thank god= 1 star.
Food:
Carnitas- The only thing on the menu i would get multiple times next to the jade red chicken(spicier version of like a sweet and sour chicken but better flavor!) Now for the carnitas its got such awesome flavors i mean not mind blowing OH MY GOD flavors where you make those stupid rachel ray moments where you can not help it but good enough to where you can order it multiple times because its not boring or bland.
I cannot stress to you how much i hate the rest of some of the chickens on the menu like the teriyaki chicken or the emerald(my friend LOVES this one. I HATE IT i try to like it on plenty occasions like today and since they use this sliced chicken that are like flat strips or thicker strips of deli chicken you get from frys, with some okay sauce that had so much potential it fails to catch me every time no matter how i eat it, in a quesadilla, burrito, plain, you name it. JUST DISAPPOINTING!)

The jerk chicken is good for those who love REALLY SPICY kicks!
The henegrade or whatever is below it but i didn't care for that either.
i needed something closer to the jerk but not that intense. I can eat the jerk chicken fried rice but not extra jerk chicken.

The combo plates come with two types of meat however you want it plain, quesadilla, or burrito. Fried rice is extra, white rice is included unless you pay extra. Beans you get either re fried or the spicy cuban black beans. I just get extra jerk chicken fried rice in my combo plate.
The hot sauce/salsa whatever is now pre packaged for you near the fountain soda machine so you don't make a mess pouring it into cups.

My other favorite item on the menu that comes with your combo plate is a cookie weekdays is snicker doodle which are AMAZING but on weekends is the volcano cookie which is like a brownie cookie which is my personal favorite!!! minus the powdered sugar that falls all over the place so eat with caution or a napkin below your mouth so don't look like an idiot. 
the food gets a star and the cookie gets its own star. I don't want to rate them any higher than a 3 because i don't love chino that much to call myself a fan.  Why i continue to go here is to change it up once in awhile every couple months to get my boyfriend the carnitas and jade red chicken. I love their cookies more than their meats but i wont come here just for cookies.

We were the first people seated as they opened at 5 as it was a Saturday.  They serve  lunch and happy hour during the week. They just did a nice renovation and I hear they added some windows and changed the seating in the dining room. It's a nice bright room I. The late afternoon and facing east is not at all hot.
Our server Logan was a nice guy. I got the impression that he was a relatively new server. Not because he wasn't great, because he was, it was that he still had that ""I actually care and am listening to you, and I am into the food we serve here"" phase of most newish floor staff life. Hopefully he is able to hang onto that and not drift into fake-nice-busy-robot that many servers end up. I doubt he will. Likely he will be a graphic designer or chiropractor or maybe rock star. 
We had chips and salsa which was really good as both are made in house and are unique and flavorful without being too spicy or too salty, a path oft taken in salsas. Their salsa is neither red nor green but both together in that it pleased both the red and green salsa parts of my salsa palate. Bravo!
My pal had chicken enchiladas which looked great: smothered in white cheese with a nice sauce served with tasty fluffy seasoned rice and some great looking pinto beans which were served in a small bowl on the side: a nice touch that keeps the plate clean and pretty. He loved every bite!
I opted for fish tacos of the day which were talapia. Also very fresh and tasty served with cabbage, fresh lime, cilantro and avocado, and I had the same great rice but opted for the black beans which were perfect and topped lightly with Mexican cheese also on the side in a bowl Yum! I gobbled my food it was that good. 
The beers we had were served with chilled glasses, another nice touch.
I couldn't help but notice that an older lady came in solo and sat next to our table. She was a little confused at the Spanish titles on the dishes but Logan very patiently explained everything to her and ended up deducing that what she really wanted was a beef taco salad, which isn't on the menu. However between Logan and the obviously expert chef, they produced a perfect crispy taco bowl filled with tasty salad with beef. I love it when establishments find a way to say yes and make something happen rather than just say sorry just what you see on the menu. When the place is slammed I could see that not happening, but kudos to Mejico staff for bringing customer service to that next level of awesome! She dug right in and was happily munching when we left.
They recently added a lovely patio and once the temp drops back to double digits, I don't doubt they will do a brisk business out there. They have amazing 3-6pm m-f happy hour specials with cheap drinks and tasty priced appies so check that out too. 
I will definitely make this one of my go to places as it is quite near my place and I know my wife will love it as we like Mexican food and love having it at an actual restaurant. I will be back with her pronto!
Ps: When you leave go back out the driveway you came in on as the pass through on the east side is now the new patio.",2014-06-29 02:49:48

I love to support local, but I make an exception for DB.  The company empowers employees who ""have shown desire, drive and determination to run a Dutch Bros location of their own.""  They have a unique franchising strategy in that they only grant franchises to employees that have already proven themselves in the role from the ground up; franchising with Dutch Bros is closed to the public.  Pretty impressive!

From my various visits to different DB locations, it's apparent that they support local NPOs, and they consistently employ some of the friendliest (and wackiest) people you'll ever meet.  Even if you drive up in a sour mode, or wait in a long line before being greeted, I guarantee these peeps will put a smile on your face, and if they don't, order a delicious drink and that should do the trick.

What about the cupcakes? Well... like I said, they look fantastic but to be honest, the one I had was somewhat dry (oh my gosh, ganache). Maybe they should offer milk at the cupcakery? The frosting was fairly good and tasted homemade, but I found I had to scrape about half of it off because it was so overwhelming. Also, they are kind of pricey at $2.50 a pop, but I suppose that it is good because the price will keep you from overindulging.

The interior is absolutely gorgeous. We made reservations for a late dinner Friday night and the place was bumping. Clearly, this was the place to be. The mix of picnic tables, booths and bar seats along with the hanging plants and open air concept makes for a cozy, hip dining room. Very similar vibe to Pigeonhole.

There were four of us so we decided to share a bit of everything. When we asked our waiter for recommendations, he said everything was good (eyeroll). How helpful.

- Crudo ($14.00) - yooo, this was delicious but you only get three TINY slices of yellow fin.

- Omelette ($11.00) - this was light, airy and way better than expected, especially coming from someone that isn't obsessed with eggs. The sprinkle of truffle complimented the omelette perfectly.

- Tomatoes ($14.00) - the bread was great and I liked how they grilled it but to be honest, this dish was just average. The tomatoes weren't bursting with fresh, summery flavour and the whipped feta was really, really subtle.

- Adobo chicken ($21.00) - interesting with the Filipino twist. The chicken was tender, juicy, moist but again, small portion.

- Cacio e pepe ($16.00) - Tomtom was in heaven with this dish and said he could have ate a whole plate himself. The pasta was al dente, very cheesy and rich.

- Dumplings ($9.00) - the ""dumplings"" reminded me of the ones you get at German restaurants (knödel) but TFH's version was bland and pure gluten. Don't waste your money on this one.

Right now, I'm on the fence on whether I'm a fan of TFH or not. Some good dishes, some misses - I'd need to come back and try a few more dishes to get a better gauge on things. 3.5 stars.",2017-02-13 16:18:27

I would suggest to order this way: Order 2-3 plates per persons and then as you taste and contemplate the size of your meal order more as you please. Don't worry, the service is really fast.

The only dish I could not stomach was the takowasabi. It's a small bowl of slimy octopus bits in a marinade of wasabi. I love wasabi. (I also love horseradish, but that not the same thing) But, in this case, it tasted like cleaning products. Maybe if you are a true diehard fan of wasabi it can be your thing. But to me, no more.

But the rest was amazing! Of this round, my 3 stars goes to: In third place: The warm ozeki sake suggested by my server. Second place: The carpaccio of octopus and on first: The maguro dango soup, which is a dashi soup with tuna fish cake.

First off, the tomato soup was terrible.   One bite and I couldn't go back for more.  It was waaaayy too thick for my taste....think tomato sauce in a bowl.   

I had the 'smack yo mama' grilled cheese which was pulled bbq chicken, beer cheese and onion straws.  I actually subbed out the onion straws for fries.  The bread was toasted perfectly, and I bit right in to some wonderful flavors.  My only complaint was that twice in the course of my lunch, I bit into hard pieces of gristle that shouldn't have made it anywhere into my sandwich.   By that point I was picking through my chicken so much, I wasn't enjoying it.   

I also had the garlic Parmesan chips with the sandwich.   They were good but I would have liked more flavor.  Lastly, they bring your sandwich, chips and cup of soup out on this little wooden cutting board.  I personally think it's too small to hold everything and was struggling to cut my sandwich in half without knocking stuff off the board. 

Regardless, they did a good job on redoing the space.  It's still an overall awkward space but it was much more comfortable and inviting than the last restaurant in the space.",2015-10-09 01:56:51

First of all they were extremely accommodating to our patio reservation request and we ended up having a different number of guests than the reservation was for and they did not have an issue with rearranging us! The ambiance was beautiful as well, I suggest everyone hitting their patio before the summer is over! 

I really do not think I have a single complaint about anything I drank or ate.  I got the cocktail Picnic Day and it was delicious, not too sweet, not to bitter just a great combination of alcohol and mixers, I ended up drinking two they were so good. As appetizers we got the calamari and brussels sprouts and both were delicious.  The calamari had deep fried shrimp in with it and the sauce it was served with was delicious! The sprouts were cooked perfectly with the crisper chips that I love! 

For dinner a few of us ordered the pizzas and a few ordered some of the specials and then the birthday girl ordered the gnocchi and each of the meals kept everyone quite.  I got the prosciutto pizza and it was really good, a friend got the spicy one and I think I may have likes his better though! The dough is thin and crispy with a nice big crust (my favorite way!).  The size was large as well, each had 8 slices in it and not small slices either.  The gnocchi with short ribs was delicious! I don't think I would of been able to each an entire bowl of it because of the truffle oil and how rich it was but everything was cooked so perfectly, I ended up having more than just one bite of it! 

We didn't order any desserts but I have heard really good things.  In addition the restaurant was able to also do an over the phone order for some friends that couldn't attend the party who ordered a round of drinks for everyone which was really accommodating!

rL2zxTZRyXKq-JMaPX-WVA,loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,4,1,1,1,"3.5 stars but I'll round it up to 4 because I think the food deserves it. I can best describe this resto as being a nice little upscale southern spot located in the Venetian. Definitely a place for special occasions if you're into Southern food. Thankfully a friend of mine treated me here because I was hosting him for a bit over the weekend and felt that it was necessary to do so. 

Fried Green Tomato BLT- there was definitely a lot going on here compared to your traditional fried green tomatoes, but I assume that should be expected since everything in it was in the description. The pork belly was perfectly done and cheese pimento combine the 2 major components (pork and tomato) nicely. There was also a jam at the bottom of the tomato between the place and that made it a bit much with too many flavors going on. To top it off there was some type of greens, which added height. Although this was a very busy appetizer, my friend and I both agreed this was our favorite part of the meal.

Salisbury steak- we enjoyed this dish as well. The mushrooms, shallots and gravy was delicious- to the point that they out-shined the steak itself. The steak was very ordinary, nothing special almost homemade like at your Aunt's house or something but I guess that what the other components was for. 

Sides- biscuits, mac n cheese, and corn bread. The biscuits was very upscale flakey and were delish. I loved dipping this into the gravy of our main entree. This also came with honey butter and jam. The honey butter was good, but not as mind blowing as other southern places I've tried. Mac n cheese was a solid dish as well, which came in a mini cast iron. The corn bread was pretty moist from what I remember. 

All in all the food here is a step of from your typical Southern food, but safe at the same time... I don't know if that makes sense, but if you eat here you'll know what I'm talking about. The service was of course impeccable, which is expected for a restaurant at this price point. Honestly, the food here was $3-$5 priced more than it should actually be. I'm a local so I can complain about that, but my friend who was a tourist said it's ""strip prices"" which is absolutely true. Although I enjoyed my overall experience here, I don't think I'll be coming again because it's a bit much for my budget.",2015-06-11 20:49:18

Tucked away in a suburban shopping center in north Scottsdale, it looks unassuming enough from the outside, but the inside is über clean, modern and trendy like you'd expect for the Grayhawk area.

I've been here several times now.  Most recently before Sunday's Pirates game. It's quickly becoming a favorite stop of mine on the North Shore.  I love the ambiance and the large variety of beers to sample.  There is a ton of seating... booths, bar tops, tables, indoor/outdoor options.  They have TVs on to watch sports and I've also been here when there's live music (stage for bands/performers).

If you stop here before a sporting event be prepared to wait around 10 minutes for beer.  It will be crowded.  If you really think you'll find a place that close to the stadiums that won't be crowded... you're crazy. 

Tip 1: An intelligent drinker would order an extra drink if the place is crowded, so they didn't have to wait as long.

Tip 2: Stop complaining.  It's a buzz-kill.

Another great part of this establishment is that they allow you to bring in outside food, since they do not have food.  On one occasion we has a pizza delivered right to the bar and another we brought in take-out from one of the nearby restaurants.

What a beuatiful space. Just what this area needed,  is an upscale, trendy breakfast and lunch spot!

First thing you encounter when you walk into the restaurant is the amazing circular Bloody Mary bar, with so many accompaniments to your deliciously mixed breakfast boozy drink. You can add as little or as much to your Bloody Mary as you would like. Crazy.

The benedicts are out of this world. I had the crab cake benedict, and it was amazing. It was packed with fresh crab and the hollandaise was savory with just a touch of lemon. I actually added avocado to mine, which I think completed the flavor.

Coffee is served in individual tall French presses, finished at the table. Very nice touch! The coffee they use is organic Lavazza coffee from Italy. Lavazza just happens to be my favorite,  because it has such a mild, nutty flavor with a hint of chocolate without any bitterness.

The brisket hash will have you drooling, it was so good. They smoke the brisket in house,  since they own the BBQ place next door. The flavor complimented the scrambled eggs we had, which we also added cheese to.

We can't wait to come back for lunch, they have some really good looking sandwiches on the menu we want to try.

The service was excellent, everyone was all smiles and very attentive. The owners Joey and Cristina were on hand to greet guests and make sure everyone loved their food. Their hands on approach makes a difference, they were so nice.

Overall, a definite regular spot. The food was very good, menu had plenty of choices and attentive service.",2015-07-17 18:32:42

Service:
Jacob our server was amazing. He defiantly made this place special! He brought Horchata to go with the coffee in addition to cream without asking to give us something different to try. He also was super creative with the menu substitutions we could make. We stayed two weeks at the Claredon and got free breakfast daily, by the end of the week we started getting bored.

Drinks:
I had a few cocktails at the bar and poolside. One cool thing is they let you double any drink for 1/2 more. i.e. $15 gets you 2x $10 drinks combined!
Cocktails I liked were the Mezcal one, and the margarita with St. George Spirits Raspberry Liquor.

I think the bar is this places best asset. They do drinks really well, and it is a chic atmosphere.

Food:
Well I'm super picky. That's what living in the bay area does to you. We had breakfast every day here for two weeks and I tried almost all of the menu. The pancakes are really awesome, so was the scramble, but only because I asked for them to custom make me something. I would ask for bell peppers, onion, cheese, chorizo, and it would taste amazing. The secret: they add taco seasoning to the eggs! Highly recommend you do that. 

The chilaquiles and huevos rancheros were both disappointing. The chilaquiles for some odd reason had carrots in it! Didn't exactly go with eggs. Their scramble off the menu - spinach and mushroom was also pretty boring. These guys could be a 4 star on food if they gave the chef some creative freedom and added more stuff to the breakfast menu. They have 8 items; not a lot of selection..... it would be super easy to add omelets for example.

The margarita was simple, but so delicious-you can tell it's made with high quality ingredients. We started off with the salsa trio  & chips which was great. Between my husband, friend & myself we tried one of each of the taco CRUjientes (beef, lamb & pork) which were all delicious. Simple but well seasoned.

I purchased an egg white omelet with spinach and sundried tomato's and sweet potato hash.  The sweet potatoes were very heavy on spices in a way that completely overwhelmed the omelet.  I took two bites but could not eat the rest.  

I purchased a chicken salad snack, but the chicken salad was a bit on the sweet side for me.  I was glad that I only purchased one of the chicken salad options they had available.

I purchased a snack with seasoned chicken, walnuts, apples, oranges, grapefruit and grapes, but the herbs on the chicken were a bit overdone.  It was ok as long as I ate a bite of fruit with each bite of chicken, but I would not buy this again.

The food was fresh and healthy.  Apparently the herbs and spices are used heavily so that you don't notice the lack of salt, but I found the amount of seasoning off-putting.  Nothing that I purchased had more than 270 calories.

The food was easy to prepare.  Instructions for heating were very accurate.  The smaller portion sizes were perfect for me.

The staff was very helpful.  They stay nearby and anticipate questions you may have as you browse the cases.  The cases were well organized into breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack sections.  Everything was color coded according to which meal they were, and large versus regular sizes.  Everything was also labeled with calories and relative to food sensitivities.

The food is not inexpensive, but is cheaper than eating out by a few dollars.  As a single person, it is also cheaper than purchasing raw ingredients that would likely go to waste.

Paid for VIP washes and on one visit tires weren't done and interior not vacuumed. Another time they only cleaned (barely) the tires on one side! After getting the car back I have to pull over and really clean all the clearly evident spots that were missed.

I've always passed by it on previous visits at the Linq, and was always curious as it seemed busy each time.

Service: 4/5  The young asian hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us down promptly.  We sat at the bar and had great service from Lea.  She was very friendly and gave us an awesome recommendation with the Rolled Asparagus.  She kept our drinks fresh and made sure our food came out timely.  

Food: 4/5  I had the Lamb Gyro Cheesesteak with the truffle fries.  Both were very big portions and were tasty.  Lots of cheese with the Gyro which I adored and appreciated.  The fiery BBFF took down the Lobster Ravioli.  She enjoyed it and I tried it.  Ravioli was on point as well as the sauce.  The MVP of the night is the rolled NY Strip w/ Asparagus!  Menu description: NY strip stuffed with provolone cheese, basil and sun dried tomatoes, with asparagus tips/spears and smothered in Marsala mushroom sauce.  This meat and cheese combo is the best duo put together since Daenerys Targaryen & Tyrion Lannister.  Fantastic, fantastic....

Value: 3/5 Typical casual restaurant pricing on the Strip.  The Lamb Gyro Cheeseteak was $17 and the MVP Rolled NY Strip with Asaparagus was $15.  The Lobster Ravioli was good, but not $27 good.  I think if you add the word lobster to an entree, you get to jack up the price $10. My Tito's and tonics were $10 a glass.

Ambiance: 4/5 Classy Bistro Vibe that is lively as it opens to the walkway of Linq promenade on one side with an entrance to the casino on the other side.  It will be noisy but not too loud as to interrupt your most interesting dinner conversation.  They use big plates which i always appreciate because I'm claustrophobic with my food and I'm a messy eater.

I had a great first visit and I'm looking forward to trying more things off their menu on my next visit.  The fact that it's open 24 hours is fantastic and just adds to it's appeal knowing that if I'm in the area, good food is always available.  One more time, if you like meat and cheese try the rolled NY strip.   This might be my new go-to pre-game spot when I'm on the strip.  Enjoy..",2017-07-21 18:47:05

I came here once before about 6 months ago.  Sat at the bar and service was great but the food wasn't impressive.  Decided to give them another try.  Booked a reservation on Open Table and decided it would be a good place for a late night meal after a Britney Spears concert. It's located at the Linq so it was just a 5-10 minute walk from Planet Hollywood.

Our server was Josh.  He made some great suggestions and was very friendly.  He suggested the NY strip wrapped asparagus to start and the Truffle Mac and Cheese as a side.  He also recommended the Pesto Salmon and Atlantic Salmon.  We went with his suggestions.  Oh and we started off with some great drinks.  I had the Moscow Mule that was perfectly made. 

The food came out promptly and Josh's recommendations were amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Mac and Cheese and Atlantic Salmon.  Everything tasted fresh and the flavors were amazing.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, I hate when salmon is overcooked, which unfortunately happens at a lot of restaurants. 

Definitely a great late night place to eat.  They also have 2 happy hours with $7 snacks/meals and great drink specials.  I'll definitely come back for the happy hour specials next time.

We started going there about 6 years ago when we lived in the FQ Story district.  We love dive bars, and the best time to go is during the week or on a Sunday afternoon if you really want to get a feel for the typical clientele.  I love the wackiness of this place and believe it or not, they have cleaned up the place a bit.

This was the very first bar that anyone ever bought us a drink for no reason.  The owner was hanging out with her CSI buddies and her boyfriend brought us over two beers.  In Buffalo, regulars and bartenders often buy drinks for other clientele, but we had not yet experienced this in Phoenix.  This man renewed our faith in bar etiquette.

More recently, we spent NYE here and even though I was the designated driver, I had a great time.  We walked in and before my cohort could decide what they wanted to drink, we noticed that a gentleman had left his dentures in his hat on the bar while he was about 10 feet away playing video crack.  Where else does this happen but the Bikini?

Later, my husband was outside smoking and some guy with no shoes came up to him to ask ""Are you down for whatever?""  Again, where else would this happen?

And, we managed to entertain ourselves throughout the night by sending boys into the restroom to purchase postage stamp sized porn from the porn and wierd condom machine. Hilarious.

I ended up ordering the nigiri sampler, albacore sashimi with crispy onion, the tuna taki roll, the tuna tataki with crispy onion, and the Sahara roll. Their rolls and nigiri were great (4/5), but their sashimi were amazing (5/5). The sashimi were just so flavourful and fresh.

I wasn't a fan of the noodles in the sauce, but knowing where it was coming from, I think it would be excellent for the right person. The dumplings were large and intense. Two could have been a meal easily and were great for a side or appetizer, the sauce was sour and complimented the dumplings well, but the dough was almost too heavy for me. Again, I was expecting something lighter, but knowing now what they are, I'll get them when the time is right, but probably will go with a HK style dumpling next time.

The soups looked incredible, and I believe that most people in the restaurant had soup ordered, so I'll come back again and get that immediately.

The desserts, as expected, were very good. Rich and indulgent. The first visit my friend ordered a divine black forest cake martini. It lived up to it's name and price ($10ish if i recall correctly). We appreciated the wine list and the beer list had enough to offer ( craft beers and domestics).

During my second visit, we ordered a trio of chocolate shooters  which are little milk chocolate cups with your choice of liquor. I would suggest the Chamord. They were a nice treat. Sweet enough to sweeten my palette since I didn't want a full dessert. Still full from dinner I didn't order dessert, and stuck with Apothic Red wine. My companions ordered the peanut butter chocolate cake (which reminded more of snickers than peanut butter)and the chocolate chocolate cake. They were kind enough to share a bite. Again, both were divine and very large. Average price of desserts is $7 - $9. Speciality desserts are also available. I've been spying the $12 s'mores. You get to make your own s'mores at the table. Oh my goodness.

The place was open, decorated upscale, and dimly lit. It had good ambience. It was bustling with activity but quiet enough for conversation. Both visits we were seated promptly. The service was efficient for 1am on crowded nights.

Great place for a date, a girls' night out, a birthday, or for ending your night. I must get those s'mores!",2011-08-28 21:41:40

If they want to leave early they shouldn't make a batch and let them sit there, close early. The last customer deserves  fresh food as the first customer of the day. I work hard for my money, I paid 18.00 for two #1 combos and extra sandwich, it's expensive but I used to think it was worth a treat once in a while. Think about it, if someone gets paid 9.00 and hour they had to work 2 hours tp pay for that, if they earn 18.00 it's still an hour of work to pay for your food, forget about minimum wage!

I ordered one of the power bowls for lunch; you choose a base from brown rice, quinoa, konjac noodles or mixed lettuce, and then a protein from tempeh, tofu cubes, tofu scramble, shiitake teriyaki, or carrot keftedes. i went for the asian Fusion bowl with edamame, kimchi, beets, carrot, broccoli, sprouted mung beans, spiced chickpeas, goji berries, and black sesame seeds over a mixed lettuce base, with shitake mushrooms for protein, and the tamari ginger dressing. Ouf that was as much as a mouthful to say as it was to eat! The regular portion was more than filling and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and mix of textures in the salad.  The ingredients were fresh, well prepared but I found the salad a little heavy with all those beans and not enough greens considering I only had at most half a cup of lettuce. 

The venue itself was clean and well maintained; nothing fancy but it is a chain after all! The service was friendly and personalized, which much like Starbucks, they call you up by name to pick up your order.

As a requirement for college Art 101 class, students are given a list of art supplies to buy at the beginning of the semester. Per my professor's advice, Blick is the first place to run to, second being Desert Art Supplies and not surprisingly, Blick did not disappoint. This place had just about everything an artist needs - portfolios, tortillians, paint brushes, you name it. 

Overwhelmed by the countless shelves of supplies, I resorted to asking one of the staff for help and he willingly walked me through every item on my list, pointing out all the good deals and being so kind as to offering advice on how to get a preferred card that garners a 10% discount. I ended up saving well over 30% considering my professor had ties with the store and folks had the privilege of enjoying their winter art sale that's probably still going on right now. 

Of course, when there's a sale, it's always smart to be ready for alternatives because a lot of the products were already out of stock, and college has been in session for only about 2 weeks. Nevertheless, I got out of there with pretty much everything I need but am set to head back this Thursday for their Blick Madness event that offers coupons for 30% off entire purchase.

We're glad we did because this place did not disappoint!

We parked at Mandalay Bay and walked over to the Four Seasons, whose entrance is located by the lobby of MB. Once you're in the Four Seasons, the restaurant is located on the lower floor so take the grand stairwell and you will be led towards Charlie Palmer and their other restaurant, Veranda. 

We were immediately welcomed as we walked in. We made a reservation a couple days before and it was a nice touch of them to acknowledge us by name. We were seated and handed their regular menu and their RW 2016 menu. 

With the RW Menu I went with:
Billi Bi Soup- WINNER OF THE NIGHT. The soup is first presented to you with just the mussels and garnish then the soup is poured in front of you. The soup was creamy, delicious, and full of flavor! 
Surf & Turf- Meat was tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. Really enjoyed the lobster stuffing that accompanied the decently sized piece of lobster meat. It had an interesting taste that really complemented the taste of the steak!
Lemon Tart- Best way to end the meal, tart but light!

We all received a glass of red wine and white wine to pair with our appetizer and entree. And in case you were wondering...yes, it was a bottomless wine. Between the five of us, we also received 3 sets of Creamed Corn and Mashed Potato to share which was more than enough for us! 

Service was also flawless! Our server Reymond stopped by our table regularly to make sure everything turned out great, the bussers immediately filled our water glasses whenever it's almost empty, and their management team even stopped by that we were well-taken care of!

Since there were just a few folks eating at that time, service was pretty quick so I can't speak to what it is when there is a crowd.  Server was very pleasant although once our order was taken and we got our food, never saw the person again so if there had been a problem, too bad.

Hubby had a king club, he said it was good, not wonderful.  I had a stir fry chicken salad.  It tasted good but was the oddest salad.  I think the lettuce must have walked by the dish and a few leaves jumped in because it was primarily cold noodles, shrimp, the menu said there were veggies in it, couldn't find any and topped with fried rice noodles.

I haven't experienced here any of the grabbing or poking or pushing over that I've had happen to me at sample sales in New York or at the Barney's Warehouse sale (or Black Friday/Boxing day sales). But this is a whole different breed of sales shopping. Clothes are sorted by size and style (sweaters. outerwear. dresses. long-sleeve tops. etc.) so the racks are jumbled and messy. The women's shoes section is frightening because there is just so much product and not enough room in the aisles to check things out without bumping into someone. 

There are a few big labels in the mess, but a lot of is broken. I found Miu Miu flats that were hideous but still $99. I found a pair of Valentino heels that were missing its straps. I found Jimmy Choos that were missing pretty much every embellishment. Most of the stock is from mid-level brands, like Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman, and high street brands like Steve Madden (tons!).

My friends and I came for brunch even though we weren't hungover, since we were looking for a good burger. It was packed at the bar since there were a good amount of people here to watch the conference finals for football, and they were charging a $40 minimum or something crazy to watch from the ""lounge"" area behind the bar seats. We lucked out and got one of the last tables at the restaurant part with a TV, and had a good lunch and spot to watch the game. We tried:

-Complimentary Popcorn (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6A9_UPW4c-N_pt7j2bMD9A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Super addicting- they sprinkle a spicy-ish powder on top, and the popcorn is nice and crispy. A good way to start the meal, but it's also difficult to stop eating.
-Captain Hook (Seared Salmon w/Remoulade Sauce, Smoked Salmon, Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Served w/Fries, $17, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eelZKpVyJlyG3YvjPoapeA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I really liked this burger- the salmon was cooked perfectly, and it was a nice change from the other beef burgers we tried. Recommended! Their regular fries are just average- they needed to be fried more as well as more salt.
-The Fun-Ghi (Beef Patty Topped w/Forest Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion, Gruyere Cheese, Frisee, Truffle Mayo, $17 + Onion Rings $2.50, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kmCDudtCE5AnL5skhFm_aQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good flavor, but really salty. You have to like mushrooms and caramelized onions to like this burger, and the gruyere was quite overpowering. This wasn't a bad burger aside from the saltiness, but I liked the other two we ordered more. The onion rings were pretty disappointing since the breading was way too thick/heavy, so I wouldn't get those again.
 -The Rising Sun (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado, $18 + Sweet Potato Fries $2.50, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KuT9_8CAr2V-s4iULriszQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was our favorite burger since it was also the most unique. It was borderline too salty, but the crispy yam and avocado helped save it. Highly recommended! The sweet potato fries were also our favorite out of the fries/onion ring- they had the perfect amount of crispiness.
-Virgin Frozen Grasshopper Milkshake (Peppermint, Chocolate, $9, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JXv6Xbd4MgSDGFqwgmtNNQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum, this was a good mint chocolate chip inspired milkshake. You'll be crunching on chocolate bits throughout though.
-Bloody Mary ($13): Yuck, do not bother ordering this here, this was a waste of money. It needed more spices, and there was no celery stick! 

Our server was new, and you could tell he was a bit nervous. However, he was really nice as was the other staff- they originally gave me regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered, and were apologetic when I pointed it out and went to put in an order for the sweet potato fries right away.

The space is open, airy and very easy to navigate in a wheelchair. Since it was Mid-October and even in Vegas, there was a little nip in the air I opted to skip the beautiful patio and sit inside. The only negative to this was there was construction going on nearby so it made it quite noisy.

I started with an interesting Cocktail called, It' Still Hot in Mexico.

It was sweet/savory concoction with Espolon Reposado Tequila, Thai Chili, Agave, Lime, Cilantro and Cucumber Juice. It looked like a Green Smoothie, but had a strong, boozy kick and little heat. Although not brave enough to try the Chili Pepper garnish, I did enjoy the two fresh slices of Cucumber while waiting for my food.

My Lunch selection was The Lobster Roll with Maine Lobster, Lemon and Creme Fraiche with Boardwalk Fries.

The Lobster Roll was among the best I've ever had. Just enough Creme Fraiche and Lemon to enhance the sweetness of the perfectly cooked Lobster. I even loved the slightly sweet, split and grilled Hot Dog Bun the Lobster was tucked into. The Boardwalk Fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned ( I think with Old Bay) with a fluffy interior and crisp exterior.

Although quite full, I couldn't resist Dessert. I chose the Butterscotch Panna Cotta with Chantilly Cream, Caramel Corn and Chocolate Crunch.

The perfectly light, sweet ending to great lunch. When the plate came out I figured I would leave the Caramel Corn scattered around the plate untouched, but after one taste, I finished it all!

So I ordered two chicken sandwiches and two cokes.  The girl said something that was not understandable and I said, "" What?  Say again?""  -- she said something garbled again.  I really hate those establishments that hire people who cannot speak English.  I finally figured out she was saying ""do you want fries with that?"".  So I said fries with only one of them.  So she rang me up and pointed to the cash register readout that said $8.68.  So I paid.

When they called my number, I got one sandwich, one small fries, and two small drinks.  I said that I ordered two sandwiches which the girl could not understand again.  So she had to call the Manager over and he told me that my order was for only one sandwich.  So I said, ""$8.68 for one small sandwich (not even a premium sandwich), small fries, and small coke?"".

First, the discounts of course, and then for findng me a really great Optometrist with such an awesome staff! I've seen the YESnick groupon quite frequently, so if you need your eyes check and need new glasses or contacts, I suggest you buy the offer! The groupon deal when I purchased it was $50 for an eye exam (no insurance) and either $250 off glasses or $50 off contacts. 

When I went in for my eye exam, I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff. It wasn't just the simple ""Hi, welcome.."" They actually asked how I was doing, and tried to engage in a conversation with me. When I met with Dr. Yesnick, he did the typical eye exam procedure. What made the experience more special was that as he was checking my eye, he would explain what was being checked and why it needed to be checked -- very thorough so I understood what state my eye was in. 

My astigmatism is really strong in my left eye and he didn't have the type of contacts I needed so he sent me off with a trial pair that could at least fit my right and somewhat my left and had me come back in a 1-2 weeks when the other pair came in. As I was leaving, he asked what type of solution I used and immediately sent someone to grab me a full bottle of solution to take home. A really good first-time experience.

When I came back to get fitted with the new pair, I received the same great service. And before my 3rd visit, I decided I was going to go with glasses. I remembered skimming their collection and they didn't have any frames I liked. I happened to find some Ray-Bans online that I was interested in and called in to ask if they could order the pair for me to try.

We got a baklava to share since it just got out the oven. This would have been pretty good of a pastry but the nuts tasted a little bit burnt so it was toasted a bit longer than it should have been. 

Service was friendly, but a bit slow. This though wasn't because the server wasn't doing his thing, but he was the only server with two big parties and 3 other tables. There were other people prepping and who I think is maybe an owner sitting around, but no one helped him out. 

Overall a pretty decent lunch spot.",2011-06-02 23:19:11

Besides the wholesome beef burger they also have vegetarian and vegan options that are all made to order, that pretty much sum up the draw of this relatively new burger establishment in the SW part of Las Vegas.  

The restaurant was packed on my first visit, and the line was about 15 deep.  And I was looking to see if they have a petting zoo section hidden nearby, where you can hand feed fresh cut grass to some happy cows, considering the large contingent of toddlers and babies in strollers that were at Elevation Burger during that visit.  The middle of the restaurant was literally packed with knee-high kids giggling, running around and some falling down.  It definitely added to the energy of the place.

The menu overall is fairly straight forward.  What kind of patties (options are beef, vegetarian or vegan) do you want, and how many, with or without their aged cheddar cheese ($0.50 extra per burger) and do you want it with or san the buns, plus their plethora of toppings.

They have real ice cream shakes or malt, plus the super duper soda machine that dispenses mind boggling varieties of carbonated and non-carbonated fountain drinks.  If that is not to your liking, they also have bottled drinks in the cooler on your way to the friendly cashier/order taker.  In fact everyone there makes it a priority to be friendly to their customers, which I always appreciate.

As far as the food, my burgers were served hot with fresh cold lettuce, tomato and pickles. The Elevation Burger (2x beef patties) with the cheese upgrade was a solid burger.  The Half The Guilt Burger with the Vegan patty was good and exceeded my expectation (the vegan patty was nicely seasoned and packed with flavors).  It is better than most fast food burgers, but they are still not as good as In-N-Out or The Longhorn (my current favorite burger at LBS).

The chocolate Malt I ordered was creamy and thick. You have the option to add toppings from their menu as well.

I would go back if I am shopping nearby, plus to support a business that is eco-friendly. But I don't think I would be going about my day doing whatever I happened to be doing and get a craving for one of the Elevation Burgers like I would for a Double Double Animal Style.

But if you are counting calories or solidly in the organic food movement, than Elevation Burger is definitely for you.

Service:  4/5  Friendly, but somewhat slow. Then again it was packed when I went.

Price:  3/5  Premium pricing for the healthier for you and the planet organic and sustainable beef patties burger.

Food:  3.5/5  Solid, healthy, lower calories burgers, but maybe some of the potential flavor is reduced as well.

Parking:  3/5  In a busy strip mall, but there are also a lot of parking spaces.

Solid healthy burger joint deserving of a solid A-OK recognition.",2012-06-04 05:28:09

The Salad King serves ""Asian fusion"" cuisine, which is code that means if you've never really had good Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean food you should find their food satisfactory. It's a fast food joint that has the decor of one of the nearby condos. Think: lighting by Ikea.

I find it amusing that people get excited about these places. It's basically a Taco Bell for Pad Thai and Chicken on Rice. There's little flavour, little passion, and little care as they churn out Pad Thai with Chicken ($10) Pad Thai with Shrimp ($10) or Pad Thai with Both! ($10) to a new batch of Condo owners and University students every year. There's some variety in the spiciness of the dishes, but it's nothing you can't simulate at home with some Tabasco sauce or chili pepper flakes.

If you a want a fast plate of food and a hip atmosphere, come here and chat with your buddies before you hit the AMC for the latest Vin Diesel picture. If you want tasty Asian food with some authenticity and complex flavour, put the King in check, and go to one of the 50 better restaurants Toronto offers up.

My husband and I tried the $88 eight course set dinner. Food was thoughtful and fun. I appreciate the texture and creativity the chef put into his food. Highlights were the duck and the almond crumbs + yogurt palate cleanser. The duck was well cooked with the fat nicely rendered leaving a nice crispy skin. 

Space is clean, simple and modern. However the room was cold, most ladies had their jackets on. The bench can be more comfortable. Since dinner took almost 2.5 hours, I would imagine cushions will elevate the experience. Also, the man beside me would shake his legs every so often and the vibration would transfer to me, which was  annoying. Again cushions probably could have prevented this. 

Most disappointing part of our dinner was the service. Not once did anyone check in on our experience. It was also hard to get the servers' attention. They all seemed to walk with a mission dashing back and forth. There was one stand out Server, a lady with the braids. She was cheerful and friendly who looked like she was having fun. When the dishes were dropped off, most of staff sounded like they were just reading words off a mental menu. Come on put some passion into it, romance the food!!! The chef worked so hard to create these intricate dishes, romance it! Appreciate it! Make the customer fall in love with it! 

I overheard a nearby table tell the Servers that it was his companion's birthday, there was no candle on the dessert and no warm wishes. Overall the food was enjoyable. Sadly it was not an experience we had hoped for, wasn't warm nor welcoming. It was also frustrating that no one returned my 2 voicemails the day prior and the day of my reservation. I read on other reviews that we should make sure the duck is available as it's not always on the menu. A courtesy call back would have been appreciated. I hope they work on delivering personalized service to create an ""experience"" for their diners. Th Chef himself can also show more enthusiasm when bringing dishes to the diners.",2018-04-29 05:48:14

Either way, if it is an American corporation that dresses like a mexican spot, call me one to turn the other cheek! I'm just in love with the food and flavor.

Coconut shrimp taco tuesdays. Thats what its all about. They are VERY generous about the shrimp too I may add. I also love the pork barbacoa tacos. The burritos are just too big for my hand to hold, so I opt for the tacos. I love the barbacoa flavor because its sweet, juicy, and meaty as well. The pork is tender and perfectly shredded. Its just so full of flavor, and has that nice marinated bbq taste to it. If you like more soft, and less over powering flavors, I'd try the coconut shrimp, salmon, and mahi mahi. Those are primo. It's not filling, the flavors are very soft and subtle, and the fish is tender as well.

But what makes everything perfect and my personal favorite is the torilla. It's freshly made, and because it trastes so wonderful I always ask to DOUBLE the tortilla. It's a thick tortilla and very soft. It has this light, sweet, doughy taste and texture to it. It's not flat and woodfired or stovetop grilled like most tortillas. Expect to see the cooks in the back making the dough and cooking the tortillas fresh for you. My favorite.

I like the different rooms and the music they play. There's the main floor where they play mostly techno, a hip hop room and the library (I think that's what it's called) where the atmosphere is very chill. You can sit at the bar, play pool or, if it's open, go on the balcony and look down to the main floor.  

Most of the time I don't wait in line, but one time I did and it seemed a bit unorganized. They have signs, but with all the people, you can barely see them so there can be difficulty finding where to go. Plus, depending on what time you get there, the lines can be very long. Something else I didn't like is how small the hip hop room is. When I went in there it was jam packed and I was squeezing my way through people the second I entered. The dance floor is packed as well. It's super hot in there. But, if you get too hot, granted the season isn't summer, you can step outside to cool off.

We stopped in for lunch. I love seeing new restaurants open up on our side of the valley, because I feel North Las Vegas is a lot slower at that in comparison to the Southwest/Southeast. It was a great opportunity to support the Thai movement business in hopes we no longer have to do the drive. We still do...but this place is definitely an emergency lunch option. Emergency as in if I have to sit in the car for 2 minutes more listening to all the shit I hear back there, I am going to lose my head. Jokes aside. 

It was 12 something and we entered. I immediately felt  like it needed to be jazzed up. I get it, they're still new...maybe they're feeling it out before they completely invest anymore money for decor, etc...quickly we were greeted then seated. Great!

We sat and dove right into the menu. I didn't care to go through because I knew I was going to get something off their lunch special. My phone seriously auto-spelled sexual vs special. Good thing I caught thaaat typo. I'm going off the subject again. Once we were seated the waitress went off somewhere so drink orders happened some minutes later.

Lunch specials are 6.95. An entree from selected lunch menu, soup of the day, spring roll, salad, and steamed rice. That's a pretty good deal around this 'hood I must say! I had the spicy eggplant no meat. Husband had the red curry with beef. Ordered the toddlers the beef fried rice. Also, I had to try the Thai iced green tea. 3 bucks free refills! Spiffy! Haven't frequented much Thai joints, but enough to say none of them offers FREE refills on their Thai teas/Thai green teas. Winner.

There was only 1 worker working that room. Upon entering there were about 5 people in there, when we left there were about 6. She did her best being the only one, but we surely experienced the delay between her going back and forth with orders, disappearing for a moments time...I'm thinking she was helping cook too? But I don't know. Although service was a 3 to me...I have to give her 4 stars from being as attentive as she possible could giving her circumstance. 

Soup of the day was a bowl of their tom yum soup. While I didn't think it was bad, I wished it wasn't served so lukewarm, and it also was a lot sweeter than I'm accustomed to. I finished it anyways as it wasn't that bad but certainly isn't the best. 

When we got our food I noticed I had no steamed rice. I looked at my husband then said, this is healthy stuff, I got a salad and spicy eggplant. Do I not get rice or something? He says, of course you do. Yeah...of course I do. I'll wave her down. This is one of the instances disappearing for a moments time is in effect. As my husband is going to town with his curry eating away...I've managed to finish my salad, the salad on my sons plate, my eggroll, and empty out my green tea before I was able to wave her over. She eventually popped out but then she had to help a to-go order, then she was bringing out a dish to an elderly couple, she was busy. I get it. My rice quickly arrived as soon as I told her.

My dish was a 5 level in heat; it packed a pretty good heat. The chest was warm. I thought the weather was cooling down? Lol. They definitely pack heat even at a 5. My husband said his red curry was pretty good. Surprise surprise and surprise surprise that I'm even typing surprise surprise. 

HOWEVER, the beef fried rice was funky. We didn't finish the meat in it. The meat was cold? I thought, maybe it's cold because it sat for a moment before I scooped into it. I tried the meat to begin with 'cause in my mind...if the beef taste good...it's all gonna be good. The beef being cold, the rice warm...do they precook meat? If so...uh, stop. Not only that, the meat was tough and it tasted old. Here's when you know I'm not crazy, even my 3 year old who eats everything quit and said, mommy don't like it. as in don't feed me the meat just give me the rice. 
The rice was more like sticky rice kind fried rice which is good, but wasn't good here. The rice lacked a certain quality or freshness to me, but that's just me. A little salted on some bites. That Thai iced green tea is good stuff. I know for sure I'd be back just so I can order it. 

Overall, twas alright. I'd recommend them for sure because for a 6.95 lunch special paired with refillable Thai teas?! yes please! One of those suffice status restaurants.

I'm lazy and seldom cook, so I'm always looking for healthy takeout options and this is one of the best in the city. I am always craving their Energy Bowl and it's hard to resist grabbing one on my way home from a long day at work. I also love their Black Bean Burrito for a more portable, hands-on option.

Like most of the other locations this Fresh is tiny -- you're lucky to find a seat when things get busy (which is always). Even when grabbing something to go it's hard to find a place to post up for 15 minutes without being in the thick of traffic.

The food is amazing, and you'll likely be more-than-satisfied with any of their menu options. I love Fresh and would eat it every day -- but it's expensive. Like really expensive.

Even with the worst expectations, this festival stooped below that! There is nothing Italian about this festival. It's more like a cinco de mayo carnival or a shitty kabob cook-off. You're better off going to First Friday for quality food! 

People hate this fest - for good reason too. It. was. terrible. So terrible! I had to see it, to believe it. 

When we first moved here a few months ago, we were actually really looking forward to going to the ""Italian Fest"" (...yeah right) since my boyfriend is Italian. But after hearing and reading about all of the horror stories, scams, and terrible food, our enthusiasm died down immediately. Unfortunately, we didn't get to dodge the bullet this time since our friends wanted to meet there for dinner and I didn't have the heart to crush on their plans. 

The verdict? Let me tell you this, it's not worth it at all. At all! Everyone in our party had this look of complete disgust on their face by the end of the night. Talk about buyers remorse! Not only was this ""fake Italian food Fest"" a scam, so were the not-so-Italian vendors acting overly stereotypical ""Italian""

- $18 for 2 adults to enter this hell-hole called San Gennaro Feast

- $8 for doughy-as-hell, stale, and nasty funnel cake from Funnel Cake Factory

- $15 (!!!!?) for a super ripoff ((1 inch)) lobster (cut with all crab) roll from the Lobsta Trap. Are you f'n kidding me?! Who the hell do you think you are playin' with give'n us that ant sized portion!?

- $12 (?!!) for ((3)) !!! offensively-salt-bombed jumbo cajun shrimp from T&T's Shrimp Basket

- $10 for a plate of stupid, overcooked, burnt, rock-hard steak and dry-as-death chicken kabobs with wilted salad and dripping in oil, soggy fries from Kabob House 

^^^ you have been duly warned. 

Only 3 items were actually decent and worth recommending:
- $5 for 2: 1 chicken and 1 pulled pork tacos topped with coleslaw and a side of baked bean chili from Billy's Bar-B-Que. I highly recommend the pull pork tacos topped with coleslaw! Juicy and delicious!!! 5/5

- $4 dried and overcooked BBQ corn from the Roasted Corn on the Cob stand. The corn was overcooked but it was pleasantly sweet. Just make sure to add all of those toppings and you're in business! 3/5

- $5 for a cold, bread-y, mushroom & olive calzone from JR's fine Italian Cuisine. The gal apologized to us that it was cold and took it back to reheat it. That didn't do much to make it better, but my Italian boyfriend ended up finding a glimmer of satisfaction in it. 3/5

All their noodle dishes are excellent, with flavourful but not oversalted stock.  The curry udon is my favorite.

I'm not a fan of crowds, and I typically prefer coffee to tea, so it took me awhile to get around to trying this place out, but I'm glad I finally did.

The first thing I noted here was a curious contradiction of sorts: on one hand, this place appears to be the domain of Calgary's beatniks, bohemians, Rastafarians, and hippies (and FWIW, I don't intend to slight any of the above).   On the other, however, the ambiance and layout of the tea house are ultra-refined, carefully though out, and well tended to, in a way that, from my experience in the Bay Area, would appear to cater more to the Yuppie (is this word still in the vernacular?) set than to the aforementioned groups.  (Again, this isn't meant as a knock on anyone; it's just an observation.)

Regardless, possibly the coolest thing about Oolong is the way that all of the teas (of which there are probably close to a hundred varieties, though I may be exaggerating) are classified and shelved in such a way that they can be browsed (i.e. seen and smelled) prior to selection.  This is a fun part of the Oolong experience, which for me lasted about 15 minutes.

A friend and I shared a large pot of a chocolate-infused mate (around $7), which was tasty, complex, and simultaneously soothing and subtly stimulating, and which seemed to last forever given the fact that it was still potent after two hot water refills (it was pretty interesting to me how the character of the tea completely changed with each refill).   

I still consider myself primarily a coffee drinker, but I suspect I'll be back here often, if for no other reason than that I had a very tough time selecting one from among the teas, and feel compelled to try a few others.",2011-04-28 16:00:17

The good things about this place:
+Fast
+24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes)
+Bright and clean 
+Clean restrooms
+Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing.
+Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.

The caveats:
-The sandwiches (more on that later)
-Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!)
-A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches

The sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh. 

The bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.   

Their ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed! 

I have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya! 

What this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.

As another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!",2013-02-28 02:50:50

Went with four friends for a birthday celebration and we were all like ""this place has great reviews"" when we sat down. Then at the end of the meal we all met eyes and were like ""well, that sucked"". I am sure you know the feeling. The Cuban was mushy shaved pork on a Fry's quality sub roil. Wait, that may not be fair to Fry's. It had this thick greasy paste on it that was like glue, not grilled or prepped in any way. Not even as good as Subway, I kid you not. The hamburgers were small,  and our waiter never asked how we wanted them, they were all cooked to HE-- as a result. The only so-so thing was the grilled cheese but SO SMALL for the money.

As a vegetarian, there are ridiculously limited options when eating out at Japanese restaurants, so I go in expecting that the items I do get are fresh, delicious, and up to par. Hikari did not do any of these things. 

Miso soup - really hard to mess this one up, and they did not. It's miso soup, not much to report. 

Vegetable tempura - YUCK. Whoever cooked these does not know the first thing about cooking vegetables. Not only were they mushy on the inside, but they did not taste fresh at all. No crunch, all mush. Disgusting. 

Trying to compose myself and order something that cannot possibly get messed up, I ordered some mochi ice cream. Make that freezer-burned mochi ice cream. Are you serious?! You can't even keep MOCHI fresh, god knows how old the vegetable dishes I ate were.

Service was excellent, friendly staff and quite attentive. The ambience of the place is great, classy and fits in well with the area.

In terms of price I've seriously spent close to this $amount at dinner at Red Lobster so not sure what's with the complaints about it being too expensive. I mean if you think you can find a place to eat lobster on the cheap show me the place i'll go there every single day.

On to the food:

Oysters: they had a good selection, we tried the west coast oysters and they had a nice clean taste. I enjoyed the dropper bottles that allowed for precise control when adding the various sauces to the oysters.

Jumbo classic lobster roll: this is the hot lobster roll, super buttery and the 6 oz of lobster goes a long way. There was actually alot of meat, flavour wise around as good as an average place in Boston. It's not Neptunes boston (which gives a godly amount of lobster meat and fries) but for TO it's pretty good. Only issue is it doesn't come with fries or like any sides for $31.

Ice cream sando: this had a very good taste and super sweet. They used a different donut than some of the other pics I've seen.

They also have a good selecion of beer, and from what I saw the wine as well.

- Shit line-ups. Line-ups are subjective, so, some people will love it, but no one can say they will remember this line-up years down the road. And I am not speaking purely of the headliners. Anyone can recall a headliner; but, the rest of the line-up (Nights one and two)? Get back to me in a couple of years if you actually go out to shows more than three times a year. 

- Terrible, terrible work crew. Who built that entrance structure? Circus monkeys? Were they hired on-site from among the indigent, regular populace of the ""Zombie Apocalypse of FSE""? It is hard to believe that there was insomuch a minute amount of effort invested in building it structurally sound. Also, empty the fucking garbage (Night one)!

- 4$ bottles of water. Seriously? 4$? 100% more than what Goldenvoice (AEG as well, dudes) sells it for at Coachella. And there is grass at Coachella, not blacktop. Do not do this. Fix it! And it might be useful to have more water points. Install more goddamn water points; what the hell is wrong with you people?

- Shit line-ups. I still cannot believe that the inaugural line-up was so abysmal. I was hoping that I would discover an amazing artist or two. Maybe a Gil-Scott Heron (R.I..P., my poet) would be hidden in there and one could just stumble upon their set and be flabbergasted by the level of artistry. Hard to happen when the lower half just drops into 30-person attendance, tiny-empty club bands.  

Now that I have that off my chest, I do have to admit that the art installations are what saved this shitfest. The permanent murals on the buildings, the interactive festival-goer-driven installations (wall of thanks, bricks, and heart & locks), and the street performers were all a very nice touch. Reps. 

The company -- cannot recall which one -- handing out complimentary hearing protection should get a government grant covering their expenses for such thoughtfulness. You may be inherently evil in all your other business practices, but you won me over with that simple act.

The cops: was it truly necessary to have so many of them, especially when some are just thirstily hanging around trying to throw weak ass game at young, scantily clad girls (Night two)? Perhaps decrease their numbers next year and hire more porta-potty and garbage staff. Or lower the price on the grossly overpriced wristbands. Or add a fucking artist worth traveling for to the line-up. 

What a shitty, fucking line-up (only made to feel shittier by all of the cheerleaders proclaiming this inaugural fest to be the best outdoor event in Vegas history [uh, no] and that it would have Coachella-level headliners [heh, no: KOL cannot headline a fucking Coachella; moreover, what about your sub-HL?). You can do better.  

We can do better. It was just, barely ""A-OK."" - E",2013-11-18 18:26:46

Food on the other hand is meh. we ordered their fried pork and chive dumplings which was good but didn't come with any dipping sauce so we had to ask them for soy sauce and hot sauce. I also ordered their recommended pork chop with rice meal the pork was very dry it really lacked some sauce and flavour. My husband ordered the beef and tomato soup which he really liked it was better than mine. The place inside is very small and needed some renovations wall was torn and cracking chairs were uncomfortable not a place you would come with a family or a big group.

PROS
1) Wonderful wait staff. Our server and his parter were very knowledgable. They both went over the menu and specials with great detail. 
2) The food was very very good. The burrata special was so delicious and the veal ossobucco was outstanding. The veal was super tender and the sauce was so delicious. 
3) The lava cake for dessert is to die for. 
CONS
1) Our server disappeared for a while and we had to wait for a pretty long time between our dinner and dessert course. I think this was a staffing issue and not the waiter's fault. Still, it was disappointing to sit with empty wine glasses and water glasses waiting on our dessert order to be placed.

She asked what I was in there for, and I just wanted to check out some bath bombs. She showed me some really neat bath bombs, my daughter was having so much fun looking at all the colorful items in the store. 

The bath bombs are amazing. I've never used one but always wanted to. So today was the day. I took home 4 bath bombs. 1 of them is a shimmer bomb, it's like constant bubbles. My daughter and I had an hour long bubble bath and we only used a fraction of the bath bomb. It was good stuff. And it didn't leave behind any residue in my tub. 

She recommended some really great bombs for me to relax, help me sleep, and one specifically for Melody to calm her and ease her for bed. If she likes that, I'll have her do one every Sunday before she starts her school week to be on a great, relaxed mindset. 

We walked over to the skin care stuff, because Bekah kept surprising me with all sorts of goodies in the store. They have their own line of skin care products and they uphold their personal values to the brand. Totally for it. Basically, this company uses everything natural under the sun, to make you look and feel your best. 

She showed me some awesome products to try, some I just couldn't say no to. She didn't pressure me at all, which I really appreciated. She convinced me that their products are probably the best I've tried thus far, and I only got a glance of what Lush has to offer. I took home an ocean water mask, which left my hand test area feeling smoother than a baby bottom. The jar is going to be well worth it, and she said it any of the products don't work out within 30 days, come back and see what does work.

I was going to come here (well, the downtown location) with my colleagues on a Thursday night but it was full by the time we got there at about 7:30pm, and we were told it'd be about an hour wait. So I ended up going to the Eglinton location when I was in the area, right when they opened on a Saturday.

The sign on the door as well as the website said this place opened at 11:30am on Saturdays, but the door was locked when I tried to enter at about 11:45am. Someone saw me and let me in right away, but one of the servers told me they were actually open in 15 minutes. Regardless, they let me sit down.

I went for the first three tacos on the menu - the fish, the fried chicken, and the beef cheek. They were decent, but I found the flavours to be very, very acidic in general, which is something I tend to shy away from. I think everything would have tasted much better with more restraint on the citrus juices/vinegars in the sauces. I also understand now why some places double-tortilla their tacos - La Carnita uses just one, which ripped very easily and was messy to eat. I was not given utensils, but I was provided with about 3 thick, good quality serviettes.

The fish was good - nice and crisp. The green apple added even more tartness to the already very sour marinated cabbage, so I found myself kind of wincing when I took bites when there was no fish. The fish was nice and crisp, and it was a good size. I do think they could have drained it a little longer though, before they assembled the taco (it's fried).

The chicken was alright. I liked the sweetness - kind of unusual in tacos and I like it! However, I feel like the chicken could have been a little crispier - it felt like it had been sitting for a while. I wonder if they maybe made this one first and it was waiting while the other two were assembled. The chicken just wasn't as juicy as I was kind of expecting/hoping. But I liked the chunky peanut mole - the sauces were good.

The beef cheek was probably my least favourite - very stringy and dry, and just quite lean-tasting. The marinade/seasoning was good but the meat just tasted quite dry. The toppings and sauce were also quite sour.

The decor is very funky and cool. The hipstery staff were alright - my server was very nice.

All in all, this was alright - I'd return if friends wanted to come but I probably wouldn't come here on my own. And I'd probably stick to the fish!",2016-10-16 23:29:13

Few days later, my bill was changed 3.57 on my credit card.  Called back, told the manager the situation, asked that the bill be corrected once again.  He then haggled over item per item and came up the accurate  total while offering to change it, but due to his attitude over the ""few"" bucks.  I just said, "" you know what leave the bill"".

My experience started off well.  I arrived shortly before 3 pm and I was delighted to have arrived at an hour when they weren't busy at all.  

I was seated immediately in a nice booth, and water was quick to follow.  I spent just a moment reviewing the menu, and just as I made my decisions, my server showed up.  He was a friendly young man, and after answering a couple of questions for me and letting me know that they were out of the Vegetable Medley, he took my order.  I ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner which came with corned beef, cabbage - and I elected to have boiled red potatoes and mashed potatoes with gravy as my two sides.  The dinner also came with soup or salad, and I requested to have the sour cabbage soup to go, and ordered a glass of strawberry lemonade.

My soup to go, and my dinner came out pretty quickly, but as I ate a bite of the red boiled potatoes, I realized that the potatoes were nearly cold.  I checked the rest of my food, and it was all room temperature.  I had to wait a few minutes for my server  to come within view, and I hailed  him.  I explained that my potatoes were cold, and that nothing on the plate was thoroughly heated.  He told me that he would bring me a new plate that was hot as quickly as possible.

The new plate came out a few minutes later, but it was actually the same plate (I had cut a piece or two of corned beef, and sliced my cabbage wedge in half before I realized the food wasn't heated).  I didn't really mind that it wasn't a new plate, it just wasn't what I was told would happen.  No big deal.

The food was still only warm, not hot, but I was hungry and so I didn't send it back again.  Also, my gravy was now missing from the plate.  I didn't make an issue of it since I had decided on taking the masked potatoes home with me, and figured I could just bring me a container of gravy to go when I finished eating.  I knew that I would be taking quite a bit of food home with me as the portions were VERY generous. 

After awhile my server returned to see how my food was.  I said it was better, that I was planning to take my mashed potatoes with me and would need my gravy to go since they hadn't brought it out with my ""new"" plate of food.  He quickly brought me a to go box and a container of gravy.  While he was getting the gravy, I'd noticed that I never got my strawberry lemonade, so when he returned I asked him to take it off my check.  He apologized and said he would bring me one to go for free.  He returned to let me know they didn't have the strawberry mix for the lemonade.  I indicated that plain lemonade was fine.

I packed up my potatoes, gravy and other leftovers into the to go box.  He returned with the lemonade and helped me to bag my to go containers, and took away my now empty plate.  Then, nothing...  I sat there waiting for my check, and waited, and waited.  Part way into my wait I checked my watch, and waited another 10 minutes.  I could see my waiter walking around, standing and talking to other staff members, talking some more, but he never came close enough for me to flag down.  Finally, I took my things, went to the front counter, and told them that I wanted to pay, but I'd been waiting for my check for over 10 minutes.

The gentleman at the front very nicely looked up my table, provided my check, and took my payment.  The restaurant still wasn't very busy, so the issues that I had may just relate to how that location of Chompies is run.

The food, properly heated, would have rated 4 solid stars.  The cold food and service issues don't allow me to spare more than a 2 star rating.  Sorry for the length of this.",2017-03-18 00:39:59

First thing I noticed? The quick and efficient is the barista here. Walked in, ordered my cappuccino and a croissant and before I had time to sit down and pick up the newspaper I was given my treats. I was shocked how quickly it happened. 

And the cappuccino was probably the best I've tasted in Montreal for a long long while. The croissant was disappointing though as it just didn't feel that fresh. I'm unsure if they were made that morning or last night but a greater care must be done to make sure those things stay fresh!

The place is small, able to seat about half a dozen people or so and with the influx of customers coming in and out it can get crowded, pretty damn fast. However, the barista is incredibly good at his trade and those coffees come out like magic. 

Heck, people waited outside on the side window to give their order. It was very impressive and I found myself looking at him work instead of reading the newspaper.

Waited for 40 minutes. Sat on the porch in the rockers and people watched. Not bad at all. The service and food were great. Our server was attentive to all details. We had catfish with wonderful hushpuppies. I ordered the chicken and rice (saturday special). Too bad that item is not on the menu regularly. The meals and sides were great. Was not a huge fan of the cheesy grits. They had some sort of peppers/heat. Not my favorite. The rest was wonderful. Couldn't ask for more. The sweet tea was perfect.

This hotel is the hip spot now, but I guarantee the chandelier get-up will be looking dated sooner than anyone thinks. The dining area feels so much like a regular mall that I was longing for the painted clouds in almost every other casino's faux outdoor mall experience. 

The wait was long, so we sat in the bar lounge across from a World Series of Poker player and her spunky blonde friend. At one point the WSP player went to grab something from her room and a very large man sat on the loveseat right next to the friend. When my companion told him the seat was taken, the very large man replied, ""I know,"" and proceeded to flirt with the lady. Baller!

Anyway, Holstein's makes a really great burger. Had the Korean 'Bull'gogi - its sweet soy marinated beef, fried egg, kimchee slaw, chili mayo, and kalbi glaze had almost nothing to do with any of those items as they're found in Koreatown, but boy, was it tasty. I just have to take a moment and acknowledge the concept (heretofore unexperienced by me) of adding a fucking fried egg to a fucking burger. Hot damn, that's a good gimmick!

The checkin process was easy - went to the kiosk and printed keys. Had a little trouble with the machine reading my id, but there was someone nearby to help. Note - they will ask you if you want to upgrade your room for a fee instead of talking to someone live. And you don't get your Total Rewards coupons from the kiosk (FYI - I usually find one I will use. Not this time.)

The room itself was fine - a little dated and the carpet and wallpaper have seen better days. There is a little fridge - which was nice since most casinos don't have one these days. We faced Bally's, so no noise issues, etc. (This is on the 50-73 wing I believe)

The elevators were great! Coming from some older hotels, they take forever and are always packed. Always had an elevator quickly as they are based on your floor. 

Went to the gym - it is ok. No tvs in each tradmill. They have 6-8 treadmills, 3 or so ellipticals and free weights. You must bring your key and ID to use it. Not bad.

Pool - is ok. It's a huge pool. Kids are allowed. Drinks are not. Be prepared to be taken advantage of by how high the food and drink costs are. $14 sangria, $9 beer. Really a nothing exciting about the pool. It's big. That's about it. Music is ok. Just some soundtrack. But I guess that is to be expected here.

There are several annoying things about Paris:
1) Fees: $10/day to park. Even if you are staying there
2) Fees: The $34/day dreaded resort fee. Casinos should have to abide by airline rules and include fees in their room rates because between the taxes and fees it can more than double the room rate
3) To get from the parking garage to the front desk is quite a walk - and the ""cobblestone"" street is a real headache to drag luggage on.

Parking - you use your key to get out. So don't worry about your ticket if you are staying there. 

Overall, it was a good experience. I am just tired of fees.",2017-05-16 18:10:05

Tasteless. It was like eating a good sub roll that was hollowed out and someone threw in some mozzarella and pepperoni. 
I should preface I am from East coast so I have different idea of what calzone should taste like. Usually even pepperoni calzones have ricotta cheese in with the meat and mozzarella and more meat. Usually a bit more sauce. Outside is usually brushed with butter/garlic a little salt.
Often the filling is seasoned as well.
Dough is a heavier dough more bread like and a bit thicker than traditional.

Therefore, if you see something you like be sure to put it in your shopping basket.  I managed to find my shoes and I feel as though I got a great deal.

The first time I ate at Las Velas, I had a really great experience. I ate really light but it was really good. All I ordered was the tortilla soup and I stole some bites of my cousin's refried beans. Both were excellent.

A few months ago, I met a few friends for dinner at Las Velas and did not have the same feelings about the place I had initially had on that first visit. The food took forever to come out and when it did, I had wished it away. The Seviche was disgusting. I love seviche but this was a soupy mess. Nothing tasted fresh about it. The very look was off-putting. All of our tacos and tostadas had dry meat lacking any true flavor. It was a disaster of a meal.

I did try and go back. I understand where a restaurant may have an off day and was willing to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, when I stopped in the other day I was sat at a dirty table and handed a dirty menu that I stared at for 15 minutes (in solitude because a waiter never came) before walking out. I can only give a restaurant so many chances before I just don't want to risk spending the money on a potentially disappointing meal. Save yourself some frustration and walk over to Bea's Taco Town on Smithfield. You'll be much happier and satiated.",2015-03-22 21:22:58

I had no idea, though, how tiny the place is!  We got there just a few minutes after opening, and all the tables were already taken.

Hubby had a voucher for this restaurant. We were seated at a booth. The waitress who came by took our drink orders. I went with a Diet Coke. As I looked over the menu, I decided to try the seared salmon which came with a scoop of rice along with broccolini and a tiny carrot. The salmon was cooked well. It tasted great because there was pepper and salt on top of the salmon. The rice was perfect. The broccolini had butter melted on top. Delicious meal. It was the perfect amount of food. 

Service was excellent by our waitress. She refilled our drinks as soon as she saw our glasses half empty. She also asked us if we needed anything else. Very nice and made sure we got everything we needed. I definitely would come back here to eat again.

Honestly, I saw that Tyoko wrote a review and thought, ok, I know her, I will try it out! It was semi confusing to get to just because it was in the Venetian and that place was big. We did reserve a table via, Open Table, and after a few wrong turns we found the spot! It was really cute inside. Open, high and low top tables, nice decor, pictures of famous old musicians on the wall. I will say that there was a slide show of musicians where we were seated, but the slide show didn't have a ton of pictures, it repeated a lot. I know that is petty, but if we were there for an hour, every 5 minutes the slideshow repeated, it got boring. 

As I am sitting back in Pittsburgh writing this I am still fondly looking back at the amazing meal that we had. My mouth waters at the salad and entrees, and I wish there was one closer so I could go and maybe try out a dessert or a drink. The food was really good for our only one splurge of the trip. I would say, it was delish and would urge people to try it out. It was expensive The two $$ is a little bit of a stretch. We got two meals and a side salad and it was over $100.  I would say it is more like $$$ than $$. But it was worth it!

Salad: 
Iceberg Wedge: baby iceberg lettuce, charred corn, heirloom tomatoes, house-smoked bacon, avocado, house-made buttermilk ranch dressing. How the heck can a salad be so freaking good? This, and I even cringe thinking about it, ICEBURG lettuce, salad was probably my favorite thing that we ordered, side wise. The tomatoes were so sweet you would have thought they were candied and that house-smoked bacon was more like pork belly than bacon and was just magnificent. We fought over this salad. The dressing, honestly was just as fresh tasting as the rest of the salad. We fought over this salad...it was that good.  

Side:
Macaroni & Cheese: torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust. Honestly, this mac and cheese was just eh. I thought that the noodles were over done and the crispy herb crust tasted just like plain breadcrumbs. I wasn't impressed and wouldn't get it again. Chris thought it was ok. But still meh....and for the price and the size of the plate, its a hard pass for me. 

Meals:
Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken: 1/2 of our famous bird served with honey hot sauce. This was just a plate of fried chicken. BOY was it a huge plate though. The hot sauce was really good too. I enjoyed dipping the chicken into this a lot. My friend, his dish, thought that the chicken should have been done a little more. He enjoys a more crispier crunch to his chicken. I can see where he is coming from. It was still really good and TOO MUCH. We had leftovers for days. 

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles: honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup. OK, the same thing that I wrote about the chicken above goes for this one. I really loved it. I thought that it was done perfectly, but wouldn't have minded more crunch to the chicken myself. I thought that the hot sauce stole the show. The bourbon maple syrup, to me, tasted like straight bourbon. It smelled like bourbon and when you dipped anything it in, it was like a shot. I would pass on this dish just because of that reason. The waffle was good. It was not as crispy as I like my waffles usually nor did it have a really strong cheddar cheese taste to it. I was expecting more from this dish. While good, it was all together, meh. The watermelon too was just meh. It was spiced I think with just mint. Nothing fancy, and for the price of the dish I would have liked more than 6 squares of watermelon. 

Overall, I had a good time here and would have liked to try more things than just the chicken. we realized our mistake when we got the dish and kicked ourselves for not ordering different things so we could try more. I would say, try it if you want, but if the menu seems to meh, there are a ton of other places to go in Vegas.",2017-06-09 02:07:36

Something about this place makes it perfect for the day after a night out. Maybe it's the somewhat ""industrial"" feel to it or the laid back atmosphere? Either way, the food and service are both great and have never had a bad experience here.

For a starter I'd recommend the calamari - it's cooked perfectly and the sauce it comes with is the best. The eggs benny and the fried egg sandwich are my go-to mains, and they never disappoint. The side of potatoes are done right, but never come with enough ketchup so you'll probably have to ask for more. Also the smoothie shot they come with is an injection of sweet, fruity goodness.

The prices are comparable to any other place in the city and very reasonable for the location. 

It's also a great spot to watch sports as they always have the games showing on TV, and the throwback tunes they have playing in the background add to the laid back vibe.

I was leery about trying it out because I checked Yelp beforehand... but I figured I waited this long for the place to open up that I had to try it out.

The clean, modern, open layout of the restaurant first attracted me. On the right side, they have self-serve frozen yogurt which I have yet to try. In the middle is where you line up to place your order and to the left is where you pick up. There are several tables and booths available.

I ordered the special combination banh mi and a thai iced tea with boba. Based on previous reviews, I made sure to request easy ice. Their system is like a well oiled machine. The wait time was less than 5 minutes. There is no chance you would miss your number from being called because there are TV screens that feature the order number and and a robotic voice that calls out the number as well.

The banh mi I ordered was worth the price. For under $4, the foot long baguette was fresh, crunchy on the outside and warm and soft in the inside. The filling was delicious and was the right amount despite what other reviews say. I was completely full and satisfied with my meal.

My one major complaint is that they accept cash only. Thank goodness I had cash because I didn't see a sign and I didn't want to pay the ATM fee. As I was leaving, I looked around everywhere for a ""cash only"" sign and only saw a 2"" x 2"" sign on the door. There is no excuse for an establishment this big to not take debit or credit.

Soup of the day was tasty and quick, but then they made the wrong size flatbread for me and I guess this only came to light when the order came up to serve. Rather than offering me the timesaving option of accepting the smaller-sized order that had been prepared, they just started the order again without letting me know what was going on... until I finally asked what was up (I suspect the extra wait time makes more of an impression when you're dining alone). The flatbread itself was okay, a little dry... after a couple of bites I opted to take it home so I could doctor it up a bit. It wasn't inedible, I just knew it could be a lot better. My soup, beverage and flatbread plus tip came to around $30, which was not exactly a lunch-like price - but again, by the time I was served my entree it was nearly the dinner hour!

We stopped by around 1pm and it was a full house. There's a couple tables outside for outdoor dining available but since it was windy we decided to stick with sitting in the inside. 

This place is a fast casual type of restaurant - no waiter service and you pay when you order and then servers bring you the food. Self-serve iced cucumber water and lemon water are available too.  

Bun got the La Jolla (popular among Yelpers) and I got the Caprese. Total was about $14-$15, per crepe is at least $7.50. Both crepes were good but nothing outstanding or extraordinary. The La Jolla comes with the chipotle sauce while the Caprese comes with a Pesto. It's a light breakfast where it'll fill you up if it's the first thing you eat. Unfortunately though, I think all the ingredients for the crepe are all easy ingredients you could probably make it yourself at home - tomato, lettuce, mozzarella cheese. The presentation was pretty basic too - folding it in half then the corners in (I assume having corners faced on the plate would look better but that's just my opinion)

The soup that comes with the crepe, what I think it taste like - top ramen soup powder mixed with water. that's not to say it taste bad because it didn't, but that's just what I can compare its taste to. While sitting at the bar, Bun and I got to see crepes being made - I understand it's delicate and it was weird because there was one employee who tore every other crepe she was making haha

Generally when I go, I always make it a priority to order off of the sushi menu. Because my mom generally gets large dollar amount comps to the restaurant, we have a bit of money to blow so sushi is always a good choice. If you don't have restaurant comps, it is not cheap but not expensive sushi. Otherwise, everything else on their menu is very competitively priced. 

From their sushi menu, I have tried their salmon sashimi (which is generally pretty good- not the greatest I've had though), surf and turf roll (interesting but good), shrimp tempura roll (good), and then many others. Their sushi is always a solid choice, and usually never disappoints. 

Other than the sushi, I've gotten their mac and cheese which is really good, their noodle bowl (perhaps my favorite thing on the menu), the club sandwich (amazing), and some of their desserts. My favorite dessert of theirs is the brownie with ice cream on top which is really good.

My friend had chosen for us to meet there.  She did not realize that I am not consuming seafood at this time, but I am so good at being a vegetarian that I could make a suitable meal at Hardee's if that were the only option.  We both ordered the spinach salad without bacon.  It came with egg and what appeared to be French fried onions, tossed in a warm balsamic vinaigrette.  When the bartender found out that I was vegetarian, he gave me a little bit of grief about it.  Which is not cool, but I, being the professional vegetarian smarty pants that I am, turned his comments into some off color jokes, making those in earshot snicker.  On the bartender's behalf, he was attentive.
For my entree, I ordered three vegetables:  potatoes au gratin, steamed asparagus, and steamed broccoli.  Generous portions, and I was even more pleasantly surprised that each was perfectly seasoned!

Unlike going out on the strip, getting dressed up and waiting in long lines, you don't have any of that here.

My girlfriends and I come here a few times and we never have to pay a cover fee, wait in a long line, or get dressed up. Score! There is a dress code, but it's much more laid back here. When you walk in, you'll see they have a dance floor, an eatery, bars, and games. When you head outside, there is usually a band playing covers of various songs. They're pretty good and dance-able.  They have your childhood games-foursquare, tether ball, giant Jenga; and other variety of games both indoor and out. 

I especially like coming to Gold Spike because I like to dance and the dj plays good music. You may be wondering what I consider ""good music."" I like to dance to old 90's hip hop & pop. Even throws in some Motown and 80's rock. I jam out to all that.  Sing all the songs. I'm the one who doesn't care what I look like, as long as I'm having a good time with my girls. Every now and then they throw in edm and that's when I go outside to cool off, unless it's summer, I just walk to the other side to chill out. Another reason I like coming here, you can sit down. Inside or outside there are places to sit without paying, or having someone come to you to tell you it will be $1500 for the seat. Drinks here are not as expensive either, which I appreciate.

I would not recommend walking more than a block or two in this area.  Had I known parking would be such a fiasco I would have taken uber from home. The acoustics here aren't good but James Bay's velvety voice couldn't be touched.

We ordered a side of shrimp cold rolls and we each ordered the vermicelli with BBQ chicken, shrimp on sugar cane and spring roll. The cold rolls were way over-priced ($6.50 for two pieces), but the vermicelli dishes were comparable, $9.99 each. It was filling enough but not too much food. The food was good. It came with thicker vermicelli noodles, which is what I prefer. The place was quite crowded during 1pm-ish on a Sunday. 

Overall, good food, quick service and not much to complain about really. Only thing would be that some of their appetizers seemed to be overpriced.

I walked in and saw that it was about what I'd expect from a Ross; nothing fancy, for the most part unorganized, and decent prices. However, I moved to Phoenix in July of 2009 from Tucson and applied to work here since it was down the street from where I'd be living. I thought, ""Okay, I know its a Ross and it's nothing awesome, but can manage this."" Boy, was I wrong!  

During my orientation there, we were told that Ross ""doesn't focus on Customer Service"" and that the customers would rather be left alone. It explained a lot about why at this store when I shopped, I've always been left alone. There were several girls just standing around doing nothing but gossiping when either I, or a customer would ask for help with something. There was a male assistant manager there who would make comments about female customers coming into the store while he was standing around with the ""Loss Prevention"" guy. It was disgusting. 

During that same week, I saw a lady pushing a stroller with a open beer bottle in the cup holder, people pulling shoes off the racks and leaving them all over the floor WHILE someone was organizing them, and several instances of children running wild through the store.

I found this to be truely apalling. 

I don't know what goes on in this store, but I've met someone who worked there over year before I did and she had similar feelings towards this place. I still shop here because its close to home, but nothing has really improved; the staff is still really unhelpful and the store's always a mess. It's hard to find anything here really, but that could be that its one of the busiest Ross' I've ever been in. Yet, I'm not sure if thats a good thing? It's not the worst Ross in terms of the actual store set up and the items they carry, but it's a far cry from being one of the best.

Meat station usually has turkey and roast beef, although on occasion they do cornish game hens or something else meaty-tastic,

Best of all is the omelet station. They can make dang good omelets here. Although I usually always go with ham, cheese and jalapeno. However my sister had a spinach omelet and to me it looked pretty tasty!

Anyway, it's a good buffet. Is the food sometimes sub-par? Yes. But sometimes it's really good. For the cheap price, I think it's worth the gamble.",2012-01-13 22:22:10

Also on the menu are thousand year old eggs (duck...) and smelly tofu. The latter comes with tofu and katsuoboshi. The former comes with some sweet sauce, which is the Taiwanese style of doing it. However, the tables have chili and hot sauce to add to the tofu and cabbage.

The service is prompt and fine.

One major note: there seems to be a perception that this restaurant offers stinky tofu. It does not. What they do have is a slightly pickled tofu they call smelly tofu, which is milder than stinky tofu. It is not possible to find Stinky Tofu in the area since Mama Bear closed. 
People like to review things (see: Millie's 'Japanese' crepes) and bestow authenticity or adjectives to it, but often the information is wrong. That is the case here.

I reluctantly made an appointment because they were having an Allure Bridal trunk show. I was like you and didn't think it was fabulous enough ""for me"" to make an appointment. What a smug biotch I was being, I was completly wrong. 

Ofelia was my stylist and she was a sweetheart with a heart of pure gold! My brother accompanied me with my parents and grandmother.

I am deeply appreciative to Ofelia for making my experience so pleasant and inclusive of my beloved brother. 

Ofelia talked to me about what I liked and was not pushy at all. She gave us free reign of the gown room and she asked me if it was ok to make suggestions. She was very experienced and helpful and my gown is not exactly what I expected it would be when I started this journey, but her expertise to guide me was priceless.

Smashburger is a good choice if your looking to  have a casual lunch that is  reasonably priced. 

Smashburger offers a variety of burgers from which to choose, including build-your-own options. Smashburger has a variety of unique  side dishes, to compliment your burger.  In addition to the traditional fries offered at most burger places, Smashburger offers sweet potato fries, smashfries tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, haystack onions, deep fried pickles, and veggie frites which are flash-fried carrot sticks, green beans and asparagus.

Today, I had the cobb salad. I was pleasantly surprised the salad was fresh, large, and tasty. This was my first time getting a salad at Smashburger. I usually stick with the burger or chicken sandwich. However, this salad was really very good.

The other particular problem was that the movie started 10 minutes late because there was something wrong with the projector.

  I ate lunch here today with my father and was surprised at the amount of people there at 1 p.m. on a Tuesday.  I wondered where they all came from on this desolate stretch of 24/27.  We only had to wait a few moments for a table so I was hopeful that the service would be just as fast.
   We ordered the Venison Quesadillas as an appetizer and waited and waited for them to arrive.  They were very flavorful, a little heavy on the oil/grease from the sauteed veggies but delicious just the same.  Don't be scared to try them thinking they'll taste ""game-y"".
  I ordered the Flounder sand which with their homemade chips and my father ordered the Turkey burger (chips as well).  30 min. later while several other people that were seated after us seemed to get their orders, our food arrived.  Now to me, it doesn't matter how wonderful your food is, if it takes too long to bring out my order, I won't be back....(I'm talking about you Comet Bar and Grill).  
  The Flounder was good and like all fish sammies, it was a little soggy.  What I ate that wasn't sandwiched in between the bun was pretty decent.  I don't know why they don't put fish on a heartier bread than a regular hamburger bun, it always falls apart.  The first chip I bit (or rather chewed) into was very soft and so was the next several chips.  All in all, the batch of chips my dad and I received were a mix of crunchy and stale chips.  Now, I know we were there close to closing and they probably didn't want to ""whip up"" a new batch of  chips just for us but come on, the amount of time it took for our order I would have appreciated it.  My dad said the Turkey burger had a certain spice that he didn't care for and I think he was referencing the Pepper Mayo that came on it.  
   Needless to say, due to the extra long wait time for our food and underwhelming presentation, I won't be back for lunch again.  I may give them a last chance and try the dinner menu but given the lack luster lunch and high cost (for what you get), I think I'll probably end up taking my money, and time, elsewhere.",2013-01-30 06:22:23

Besides the salmon BLT at Four Peaks, I'd say this is one of my favorite sandwiches in the Phoenix Area! I came here with a friend to catch up on some work. I ordered my usual chopped salad and my friend ordered the Mixed Grill. She wanted to try something new so I had one bite of her sandwich. It's savory, sweet, and all around delicious! I thought I was tasting wasabi spread because it's got a hint of spiciness to it. I found out its honey mustard with grilled onion that adds to the flavor. I had sour dough bread with my order and absolutely love this sandwich. I had to come again the following day to order it for myself! I will probably head there this week to eat another!

I only shop at this store if I happen to be in the area and if I am in desperate need of groceries and there are no other options available. In terms of cleanliness, I would say this store is kind of cluttered. I don't think it is DIRTY just a bit messy. The signs above each aisle were very visible and it is easy to find items in their respective categories however there were things lying around on shelves in aisles that didn't belong there (ie. warm sour cream next to the lays potato chips). 

The space is kind of small so the lines sometimes go into the aisles which is a bit of an inconvenience for shoppers. There were abandoned shopping carts in front of the cashier lines that contributed to the traffic congestion and it was a mission to find baskets - which we eventually found piled up just below the conveyor belt of the cash (none by the entrance where you would expect them to be).

I did find that on more than two occasions they have been sold out of items that I need. For instance, I've been there a few times and they were all out of bananas! Or fresh croissants. Bread. Their chip/snack aisle could also use a bit more organic and gluten free options as well. I also find that they never have enough cashiers. There were a few times when the store only had 2 cashiers open during what I would think is a peak time of the week (weekend afternoons). I think Sobeys can afford to have a 3rd or 4th cashier working that shift. Perhaps I just had the misfortune of coming in on days when they were short staffed or when stock just ran out unexpectedly but I would hope that in the future there would be a better back up plan for such occasions, especially for a big grocery store chain such as this one. Anyway, I'm not condemning the place, I'm just saying there could be some improvements made in terms of customer experience. 2 stars overall.",2013-09-08 21:01:47

I first visited The Barley Mill about ten years ago, when I first moved to Calgary as an undergrad.  I was out here with my parents, finding A Place to Call My Own, and we stopped in for a meal.  I remember it being dark and sticky, with a lot of fruit flies.  I didn't return.

Until recently.  I returned to The Barley Mill for the first time a few weeks ago.  I was meeting a friend for afternoon drinks, and when the weather turned bad we were forced to give up on our patio plans and head inside.  Little has changed in ten years.  I know the decor is supposed to be rustic and whatnot, but the finished effect is simply ""dirty"".  It just looks gross.  Our table didn't seem to have been properly cleaned, there were dusty surfaces, and yes- descendents of the original fruit flies still inhabit the restaurant.  

After one drink I was ready to leave.  On the plus side, our server was polite, quick and attentive, so we were able to get in and out quickly.  Staying for a meal was out of the question, both due to the general cleanliness (or lack thereof) and the fact that the menu had few vegetarian choices for me.  Overall, not a winner.

As I was writing this review I couldn't help but feel like I was being a little overly-dramatic about the restaurant's cleanliness.  I guess the best thing to do when you read a review like this one is to check the Alberta Health Services inspection reports for yourself... they do seem a little better than my own perception of The Barley Mill.",2012-06-09 18:07:59

Calamari, Stuffed peppers, Vitello (in bone, rare), Chianti Classico Da Vinci, and a salmon Risotto were our orders and though service was a tad slow, the flavourful servings were just about right in terms of sodium content.  Risotto was cooked well with just a tad of stiffness left.

I suspect that, like Fong, I haven't been eating in a little Italy, and my standards might be too low.  On the other hand, I enjoyed this place thoroughly, despite the relatively high pricepoint.

By the way, the wine selection is thoroughly Italian.  Even the californian wines have an italian twist.  The proprietor, Il Signore Tarantino, does indeed love the homeland.

I am not a fan of country but I had been told that the show was a wonderful production even if the music wasn't especially my type.

I sat in the first row of the rear orchestra near the sound booth, so I had a great seat.  The show started 8 minutes late--about standard for non-Cirque du Soleil shows so that was nothing to be upset about.  The first few numbers lulled me into thinking it was going to be a good show.  The Colosseum's LED screen was used well.  The songs also tended to sound more rock than country.  This was part I of the show.

Part II is where the show started going downhill for me.  Twain is very good getting out among the audience, pressing the flesh, getting hugs, and participating in selfies.  Yes, Virginia, they do allow cameras if she's there and you pull yours out for a shot with her.  She waded into the audience twice, and I suppose if you're a fan, this would be the sine qua non for the super Twainer.  In between the two forays into the audience, she did a campfire number on the stage with audience members--some pre-selected--but all from the special Twain lovers seating area in the first few rows.  She talked briefly with each of the audience members and then had them sit behind this faux campfire which had been burning during her talk with the folks on stage.  She sang two songs and asked the audience to join in with the second song.  This whole campfire bit was a big fail for me.

We then moved to the last part.  As she was changing, a forest appeared on the LED screen with a black horse.  A fire was burning in the forest and it seemed like the horse would be trapped, but he managed to make it out.  The fire is now out and it begins to snow and the horse changes from black to white.  Then Miss Twain rides out on a white horse.  It looked like the horse was standing on a padded area and had padded hoof coverings and she removed his sparkly lead.  She then sang her iconic, ""You're Still the One.""  Score for me--I know this song.  However, the horse loves this song too, and he soon showed very visibly how much he cared for Miss Twain.  The people in my area were snickering through much of the song and continued as she led the horse off stage at the end of the song.

The band came out and it almost sounded like they were going to end the show with a rousing rock number.  Nope!  She came back out and the show ended with two country numbers.

A couple of things that struck me about the show.  I love animals and while hiking today, I saw four wild horses in Red Rock Canyon.  The last thing an animal lover would think of would be having a horse in a fire.  I thought it was an awful premise and I wondered who thought it up.  I also wondered if Elton John left a Candle in the Wind on the stage and it set Miss Twain's forest on fire.  Second, one confetti drop is enough.  This show has three although one is supposed to be part of the snowstorm that changes the black horse white.  Third, the folksy bit wore thin quickly with me.  She may be a very folksy person but it seemed contrived.  Last, her voice is good, but not that good.  There were quite a few seats in the first and second mezzanines empty last night.  Is the market voting on her show?  This wouldn't be a show I'd see again unlike the other performers at the Colosseum.",2014-01-24 02:09:12

Ive recommended this place to people without having even been here because I already knew it was good.

The patio is adorable! There aren't that many patio options uptown so I was pleasantly surprised. Despite being a patio, it's very well covered so even though it started raining a little bit during dinner, we stayed completely dry. They also have a fire pit and a bar area.

We came on a Friday evening at 5:30, so there were spots still available. It was also $5 Peller wine & Coronas on Fridays. There wasn't too much wine in the glass, so I'd stick to the Coronas next time.

I ordered the blackened bowties pasta which was surprisingly really delicious! I'm a little picky with how I like my pasta and I really liked this dish. It's also a pretty big portion, and both of us had to pack half of our pastas to go.

If I worked closer to this area I'd probably come regularly for patio season. The patios nice, the foods great, the price is right.

It was maybe 5 degrees too cold but I was comfortable. We were quickly brought menus and a drink menu. I ordered wine, husband ordered a beer. The waitress told us about a special clam appetizer so we ordered that as well. We received our drinks and appetizer pretty quickly. 

The clam appetizer was so not worth the $13 price. The dish consisted of 12 clams with chorizo, jalapeno, peppers, bacon, shallots, and a few other ingredients and 4 slices of toast to soak up the juices with. Unfortunately, the clams were extremely overwhelmed by the strong flavors of the sausage and peppers and the dish overall was way too salty. Clams are so delicate and slightly sweet, it was sad to not be able to taste them. The toast that came with it had an awful fuel torch taste to it. I think they were trying to imitate grill marks on the bread. It was very unpleasant. 

The waitress asked us what we wanted to order. My husband ordered the swordfish tacos (appetizer) and a side salad. I tried to order the braised short rib sandwich but the waitress informed me that there was a new chef tonight and he had taken a couple things off the menu. Ok, I understand. So instead, I ordered the filet sliders. They were $5.95 each so I ordered two with a side of french fries. If I remember correctly, the french fries cost extra. Why? I don't know. 

The food came out promtly and looked really good. I dug right into the filet sliders. Perfection! Extremely tender, perfectly cooked to medium like I asked, covered in caramelized onions and a delicious, aoli. The french fries were nice and crispy and sprinkled with sea salt and pepper. Two sliders was the perfect amount of food for me. I'm glad I didn't order 3.

My husband's fish tacos were awesome! He let me try a bite and the fish was perfectly cooked and juicy. There was maybe a bit too much pepper on them but overall, they were delightful! His side salad was good. Typical lettuce, cucumber, tomato, etc.

We got our bill and it was $50. A bit pricey but the food was excellent quality (minus the clams). My husband was a little annoyed because they took his beer away before he could finish it. There was probably 1/4 of it left in the bottle. Oh well. We had a nice meal and I think we would go back.

Finally i decided to season my soup with basil, lime, Siracha, Hoisson and Chili sauce.  Nothing like some spice to clear out the sinuses!

I was asked by some friends to join them on a Sunday morning for a glass ornament class.  The session was from 10-11am and was perfectly timed.   Our group of 4 had a great time.  Gerry (we are pretty sure was his name) was the best.  I would take any class with him.  We was patient with us...when one of us blew too hard and her ornament deflated...or when we didn't blow hard enough while giving us great instruction on how everything would work out.  He never made you feel rushed, he let you take your time, pick your colors, and explained each step.  I truly would take any class he was an instructor in.

I can't wait to take more classes!  I get my ornament thursday - here's to hoping it's all I want it to be! :)",2016-12-06 19:37:20

I found them in an alley way off Central & Camelback, and when I walked up it had a nice cozy feeling, couple of wooden tables, a fire pit and plenty of cool people.

I knew that this would a hot dog eating experience that I haven't had before; I ordered the Pippin Style Brat, came with grilled pears, prosciutto, watercress, goat cheese & topped with some honey & pepper severed on naan bread.  
Ok sounds interesting right? Let me tell you, it was amazing, who would have thought, everything blended so well together, what a great treat!

My friend and I had been lil standoffish about the Bear; I just couldn't get my head wrapped around it. Friend asked if I would be up to splitting one, that we came this far and to not try it would just be an epic failure on our behalf, so I said yes!

The Bear, it's interesting, has peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon & bbq sauce on a brat wrapped in naan bread. The peanut butter sort of melts and mixes with the bbq sauce and it kind of reminded me of Thai Peanut sauce, which I just love!

#1. Duplicate the menu board for outside the door. If you have never been here before your going to clog the line trying to decide.
#2. Teach staff to listen to orders and repeat as they enter to POS .
#3. Teach cooks to read and expiditers to check orders before they go out. I lacked 2.00 Avacado and 1.50 bacon on my 14.00 Waygu beef burger that was over cooked. And I never got the side mayo.
#4. Unless I'm in a 5 star restaurant I should not have to pay for water. We live in a desert, whatcha gonna do in the summer when folks are standing outside in 100+° weather. If you don't have room for ice machine and glasses. Give bottles of cold water, you charge enough to make it up.
#5. Fridge should be really cold. My expensive Root beer was warm. And the girl who cleared my table of condiment bottles removed it before I was through drinking it.
#6. I know your Ribs are par cooked(steamed) before being put onto a grill. You guys should work on that for the price. However in all fairness they had great flavor. The Waygu beef should have been juicy as that is the style of beef (fat content). It was not .
#7. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, on the way back I peered into the kitchen you are holding raw ground meat at room temp in a hotel pan on the counter with which to make pattys for burgers. You should have that pan on ice to keep the temp cool.

This location is not like any other location I have visited.  Before i start with the food, let's talk about the horrible service. We waited an hour for our food for a party of 5. The issue wasn't our party size because 3 tables that walked in after just as equal in size received there food before we did. The waitress wouldn't even come over to address the wait time.

We had to ask numerous times for water and soda refills.   I wanted the CBLT with a turkey patty instead of the chicken breast. Apparently this was the hardest dish in the world for the kitchen because that is not what I received. They sent me the regular turkey burger. My colleague ordered the Seafood Cobb and received Shrimp Tacos.  I  had to remove the bottom of my sandwhich bun because it was hard as a rock.

The manager gave a 40% discount after he informed me he didn't even understand my order. Really? How hard is it to switch a chicken breast out for a turkey patty?

Wish I could raise my star rating, but not today. As previously, the ordering process was fine. (Their menu boards have changed a bit but items all look the same.) Burger was decent--bun less stale, but meat was definitely overcooked and dry. They originally gave me plain fries instead of Cajun but we're quick to fix when pointed out. The real issue is the dirtiness of the dining area. All but two tables were dirty, including food crumbs, peanut shells, garbage and condiment bottles. There was a big spill of liquid by the ketchups and a peanut mess on the floor in front of one of the garbages. I would have just taken my food to go if it wasn't 105° outside, but since it was, I sat and ate at one of the two clean (enough) tables. The entire time I was there (12:30-1:15pm), there were only two or three other customers that came in to occupy the employees with orders, but still not one of the three behind the counter bothered to stop their conversation long enough to step out and clean up. As I was leaving, the one female employee was leaving--or taking a break--but still no signs that anyone cared or even noticed about the mess all around.

Long gone are the days of being treated as a loyal customer and receiving discounts and perks. Knowing they have no real competition because they've pretty much monopolized the market, they now treat their customers like cattle. All they care about now is how high they can make your bill, keeping you locked into an unrealistic and very expensive contract, and repeatedly telling you there's nothing else they can do for you. I want tv schedules like that of what Cox offers, with a remote control and the ability to channel surf many channels, so I know I don't want the headaches of satellite tv. But because Cox has monopolized the market/area I can't get its competitor, Century Link, which by the way is much cheaper. Mind you I haven't changed any of my services with Cox, but now my bill has gone from 80+ a month to 200 a month and it's financially killing me. Not to mention they don't offer any two package (tv and internet ONLY) deals, which forces you to have a home telephone you'll never ever use because you only use your cell phone.

They recently re-opened after suffering the down turn in the economy and we were very excited to have them back.  Have stayed at the resort five times in the past several years and they have been running some great specials and prices.

We decided to go there this year for Thanksgiving brunch buffet.  I had been on Thanksgiving, twice before.   

After making reservations we arrived at our specified time and were seated out on the outside, side patio.  Far from the crowd (okay with us) but it was a cloudy, cooler day.  We asked to be seated next to the outdoor fireplace (two tables were empty), because when we asked for a table side heater, we were told they only had one heater that worked and it was taken.  Our waitress asked us to wait and returned and told us we could move but another party was coming in an hour for that table.  We agreed.  We were not offered anything else or the option of moving inside.  The table by the fireplace was perfect!!  Not to mention warmer and protected as it did start to rain.  Hmmm, wonder if they would have let us get wet too! 

This year the food was set up in the far room which was different from the other times we were there.  It did provide more room.  The food.......well, it seemed much more sparse than previous Thanksgiving and just not as appealing or well presented.  The quality of the food we had was good, but there just seemed to be something lacking, which I can't figure out what that was.  Perhaps by the time we were there (1:30), things had been picked over??  But believe me, we did not leave hungry!!  It was so nice not to cook or have the clean-up mess to contend with.

Our waitress................hmm,  So bland and un-attentive, I can't even remember her name.  Had never seen her there before, although she mentioned she had been there for awhile.  Was very disinterested in our progress through dinner and we had to ask several times for refills for our mimosa's.  The bus staff did a good job of keeping up with removing empty dishes and keeping the table clean.
Overall, I got the impression the waitress might have been pissed off she had to work on the holiday, or perhaps she was just having a bad day.  If I was seated with her as my wait person again, I would ask to sit elsewhere.

We watched an exchange between her and two women who were seated even farther away from the crowd than us, and it got heated.  On their way out the women stopped at our table and told us they were upset about the gratuity fee being added to the bill for the buffet and the waitress was very rude to them about it and started yelling at them (this occurred inside and was reported to us by the women, so we did not witness).

Speaking of the gratuity being added................I agree with them.  This was a buffet and we served ourselves!!  If anything the bus boys did the hardest part and our waitress did not deserve the % that was charged.  Most of the time when this happens, it is usually 18% added and we usually tip 20% and they lose out.
Our total bill for our Thanksgiving dinner was $142 for both of us.  Kind of on the high side, but we enjoyed our day, meal and most of all the atmosphere and each others company!",2011-12-06 14:30:34

1. If you have any issues with being on your feet for extended time, DO NOT COME HERE. We stood for 4+ hours, making line outside for more than 1 just to get in. Just to find inside that there is No seating anywhere. 

2. If you require absolutely no personal space, you might be ok. We unfortunately did, and this place was packed to more than its capacity. We were sandwiched in there, and walking out we saw tons of people standing outside both the auditorium and the building itself. Way overcrowded.

3. If you value your ear drums, DO NOT COME HERE. I get it, I'm not that young, and concerts are meant to be loud, but when even my kids are uncomfortable with the volume, and when it's so loud that it distorts the performance, then I don't get the point.

I ended up here twice in on weekend because an old friend seemed to really like this place. We had the same server on both occasions, and our experiences were very different on those two occasions. The first time, she didn't seem to be very happy to be serving us. I know, waiting tables can be a grind. She seemed like an almost entirely different person the second time, and things went much better.

Food-wise, there are a lot of decent options here. Nothing is fantastic, but there are plenty of solid choices. What I do appreciate, having several people in my family affected by Celiac disease, is that they have gluten-free crust options. There are an increasing number of places that offer this, but it's still refreshing to see it. And it's even better when the crust actually tastes good, which it does at Old Chicago. The pizzas my nephews and brother ordered were all pretty tasty. They ranged from the cheese pizza to a custom-made pizza, with a meat lovers-type pizza in between.

I ordered the exact same thing both times I was here. I know, it isn't bar food, but I have a spinach salad with chicken on it. What I got both times was different. On the first occasion, I got this salad and started eating, thinking I was just missing the chicken in the salad. It turns out that there really was no chicken in the salad. I pointed this out to the server, and she did offer to remedy the issue, but that was all that was done. The second time, there was in fact chicken in the salad, and all was well.

the Pizzas at Pure are not only delicious, but even after you have devoured an entire pizza you won't get up from your chair feeling overly full or bloated or gross! it probably has to do with the fact that they use fresh / local / organic (when possible) ingredients, and they keep the pizzas simple - thin crusts, moderate toppings, but a good / creative variety to choose from. Yes, I do think the pizzas are a little pricey for what they are; but there's no harm in treating yourself to some delicious, non guilt inducing pizza once in a while! my favorite, is the simplest one on their menu - the margarita pizza with honey on the side.

Is it weird to be in love with pizza and is it considered cheating? 

There are so many things to love about your pizza let me count the ways. 

1. You can have up to eight different styles of pizza at a time.

2. The Cal Italia and the Diavola will have you at the first bite. 

3. Calamari is sooo good and they have a spicy Calamari option. Seriously why doesn't everyone do this?!

4. The service, music, and atmosphere are all great. 

5. Tony Gemigani has so many Pizza related accolades it's ridiculous but seriously he is the U.S ambassador of Neapolitan style Pizza and has won multiple contests and awards for his mad skills.

I loaded up on all the usual salad bar toppings -peppers, broccoli, carrots, cucumber, walnuts, feta, olives, etc - but I will say they were missing some protein (egg or chick peas, perhaps?) and something crunchy besides nuts (dangit, all I really wanted were some croutons!).

You fill your order out on a card and hand it over to the cashier, which then reads it back to you so I don't see how it really saves any time.

There are seemingly countless options, as they have 15 entrees, each one can come alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla, and you get two entrees in a combo platter. The platter also comes with your choice of 5 rices and 2 beans (don't bother with the pinto, go for the house-recipe Cuban beans). My wife and I agree that the Jade Red chicken is the best (and the menu proclaims it as the most popular). Their Jerk chicken is very spicy, but the jerk fried rice has just the right amount of heat.  All entrees come with fresh baked snickerdoodles (or on Saturdays, the option for a chocolate cookie). 

After ordering, you find a seat in the cafeteria-style dining room, or outdoors on a nice day (not July or August).

OK, rant over. This place only gets two stars because, after you get over the cool setup, it's just another fancy burger joint among fancy burger joints, and there are many better ones very close by. 

Food:
Too expensive for what you get. Those burgers look mighty lonely on those big plates if you don't feel like shelling out more money for what should already be included (fries, duh). 

I had the veggie burger, which tasted good but was so mushy that pieces were falling out every time I took a bite. I practically needed a spoon. 

Husband had the plain and simple. He was not wowed. 

We got an order of truffle fries, which were good, but really salty. Good portion size.

We also got an order of zucchini fries. Also good, nice and crispy. 

We thought about getting dessert shakes for about 0.2 seconds, but then decided our $6 (SIX? What, do you mix gold flakes in there??) were better spent down the way at Mojo. I might consider going there to get some pie when a craving strikes, but again, I expect a nirvana experience for those prices. 

Service: fine. Timely. No complaints.

Ambience: the place kind of smelled like bleach. Ick.

They give the best medical care for your animal. They have never tried to do anything that was not necessary. They always give you an estimate of how much it will cost up front. Their prices are reasonable and I am sure if it was an emergency they would work with you. They would never let an animal stay in pain.

Blue Cross also has a really cute Facebook page and you can check out what is going on at the clinic. They also send out newsletters with coupons for dental discounts and reminders for upcoming services needed.

They also have a website for customers that allows you to go on and make appointments, get medical records, etc. This is a great clinic and I would never go anywhere else.",2013-06-04 23:12:56

But that's what makes Moxie's its own. The United States has TGI Fridays, Applebee's or PF Chang's. We have Moxie's, Earls and Milestones. 

The food is standard and it is good. The desserts, in my opinion, are outstanding. One star off because Moxie's no longer has the warm sticky toffee putting cake with vanilla ice cream that used to melt in my mouth and caused me so much happiness and joy. I must say that the chocolate cake ($8) topped with vanilla and filled with chocolate syrup lava is a close second, but I'll miss the toffee cake for sure. 

Today the beef dip ($15.75) was satisfying with its pretzel bun over sliced beef, sautéed portobello mushroom, caramelized onion and Swiss cheese. The beef dip was the right consistency, salty and warm.  

Steak sandwich ($17.75) was also good, cooked to a proper medium and so were the mixed green salad's. The lettuce burger ($15.50) is a great option for those who are gluten-free or want to eat less wheat.

Great food, awesome booze selection. Did I forget to mention that parts of their establishment are dog-friendly, too?

The only thing that keeps me from coming here more often is that I would seriously blow up from eating those damn frites. And the pizza is exactly what I love in my 'zza: thin, crispy with fresh ingredients. My suggestion is to ask for pepperoni and mushroom. Holy hell... so stinkin' good. 

Today I had the Ohio beef burger, medium rare and it was all sorts of simple perfection. Nothing to overwhelm the rich taste of perfectly cooked red meat, complimented by caramelized onions and creamy, melted cheese. The bun was sort of ciabatta-ish, but I wish it was toasted a little more. I really think that's just a personal preference thing, though. 

Do yourself a favor and try their pickled vegetables, olives and meat/cheese boards too. I promise you won't be disappointed. 

One thing I haven't experienced here is the rudeness from servers that I see other folks have mentioned. I'm not saying they're wrong, but we just never have a negative experience here, ever.

The place was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.

I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.

There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalapeño, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.

The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.

I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.

Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.

Sassafras is one of the old establishment that's still surviving in the heart of Yorkville.

I am a long time customer of this place due to the location, and I can confidently say their food is just A Ok. Have too many up and down days. Seems like they are doing many changes to bring younger clientele and it definitely uped their food game but we will see whether it's going to last for long or not.

However, as a bar, they are pretty good. They have decent collection of wine and good cocktails. 

They also have the most classy chill vibe around the neighbourhood. Despite of the all the recent changes, clientele of the place is still more on mature side. So it's a perfect place to do wine with ladies or mom & aunts. 

Is this place worth making a trip? No.

The initial impression is place is clean and modern.  While browsing the menu and looking at other table's order.  I notice their rice dish looks delicious.  However, since I feel like having soup base item today I order bun Bo Hue and spring roll.  While spring roll is crisp, the wrap itself is too thick and lacks fluffy texture of Vietnamese ring roll that I like.  It tastes more like Chinese spring roll coming out of not so authentic Chinese restaurant, what a let down.  Bun Bo Hue itself tastes ok but lacks the kind of spicy kick compares to some of my favourite places.  Also tried their other signature dish, Ma Ma rice (Hainamese chicken rice) which is also recommended by a friend.  I've got to say, their Hainamese chicken rice is probably the best I've had in Canada.  The chicken meat is very tender and dipping sauce elevates the flavour of the chicken.  The rice itself is yummy which complements the chicken.  Although the meat portion tends to be on the lower end comparing with the rice, but quality is definitely there and I'd like to reorder it again in the future.

Also tried pho since my last two visits, the broth is clear and light.  Although not as flavourful as Ossington or College joints, but still better than those at Chinatown area.  Goi cuon uses fresh ingredient, shrimp size tends to be small but the sauce has elevated the flavour.  One thing they consistently do well is freshness of ingredients, which is a big plus but I find more and more Vietnamese joints simply neglect this single detail.

Overall the dining experience is quite pleasant.  The dining area and washroom are clean and service is friendly.  I'll definitely make this my lunch spot whenever I go shopping at Vaughan Mills.",2015-07-18 22:27:37

It was a Saturday night and even though there were not many people in line it took over an hour after we paid to be seated. That part totally sucked. Once we were seated we were all so hungry! 

We started by scoping out ALL the things! Wow! They seriously have it all! We started in the salad section and worked our way to the cheese and meat. They had some tasty Gouda cheese. Next we grabbed a bunch of all ready peeled shrimp. Good sized and yummy. The Prime Rib was probably my favorite part. It was so tender and juicy. Mmmmm I loved the sushi choices and the tempura veggies. The egg rolls were on point as well. I was thrilled to see they had my fav Kalbi ribs!! They had so many soups as well! They even had Pho!

You can also get unlimited Champagne, wine or beer. Sweet! 
Now the dessert bar! Normally I could care less about dessert, but they had Creme brûlée! My first time having it. I loved it!

I admit I have not been here since the remodel and takeover by the DTP.  So I of course was enthusiastic about going on this beautiful spring afternoon.  At first I was a little ify about being kid friendly but that was quickly put down when the security at the door said ""come on in, just stay away from the bar area"".  Cool No problem even though It would have been refreshing having a cold adult beverage on a great weather day like today.  

We quickly wandered into the back patio area and were pleasantly surprised to see tons of entertainment to be had by all ages with the many games available.  They have a huge Jenga game, ping pong, foosball, four square, hop scotch, giant chess board, beer pong and everyone's favorite corn hole. The back space also had great music playing and the property also had a really cool Airstream trailer and ""Tiny House"" available for use as a meeting space.  Free WiFi is available for everyone which is great during the day because many people use the ""Gold Spike as an office or meeting of the minds for lots of ""Brain Thinking"" stuff. 

Inside the Gold Spike is a bar and also a place for food called ""Grill"".  Service was not the greatest because they had one women  running the entire restaurant with two cooks.  Mind you that it was mid afternoon and they had no diners inside, but we ordered at the counter and asked to have food delivered outside which was no problem.  After all it was an amazing weather day so we had to enjoy.  The kids really enjoyed playing the games and the adults didn't seem to mind if they were tearing about.  

The food came out within a reasonably quick time.  At a glance, I could tell that they were using good quality ingredients.  This was not you typical bar food.  We ordered the loaded Nachos which was made with colored corn tortilla chips and had tons of melted cheese, salsa, guacamole and Jalapeno's.  I was expecting loaded to include beef, sour cream and maybe some beans but either way they were good and a large portion to share.
  Next we had the fried Zucchini which came with a side of marinara for dipping.  Very good sized lightly breaded sticks fried to perfection and sprinkled with shredded, melted cheese.  Yummy!  

I had the Turkey Club on Sourdough bread and again this was a  very good sandwich with lots of turkey and crisp bacon and the bread was very delicious.  Another large portion with a mound of fries perfect for sharing.  

My friend had they Ruben which looked delicious on grilled marble rye and by the looks of his plate being nearly licked clean my assumption is that It ""WAS"" delicious.

Overall good experience at the Gold Spike today.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  Not gourmet by any means but everything had good fresh ingredients and the portions were filling.  The atmosphere was fun and playful, and I look forward to coming back to this place for some adult fun one night.",2015-03-22 02:01:44

The food alone would be 4 stars if they were charging a bit less (Yes - I think value matters.  Almost anyone can serve you an above-average meal if price isn't an issue.)  The empanada was pretty good, but $3.50 for a tiny little beef empanada is ridiculous.  They're street food, for chrissake.  (The pickled onion condiment with them is really good, though.)  I had the tortilla de papa, which was pretty good, and my partner had a chicken dish (name escapes me) that was pretty good as well, and the salads were good.  

Back to the pricing thing: they do have Inca Kola, which I love, but they charge $2.50 for a can.  I only got one because my partner had never had one, but $2.50?  Really?  I know the profit's in the drinks for restaurants, but a 12-pack of it cost the same as a 12 of Coke the last time I saw it in a grocery store.

Service was good.  Very friendly.  4 stars.

Decor leaves much to be desired.  This is usually an area that doesn't bug me too much with restaurants, but this place looks ratty - worn carpet, cheap tile, faded pictures of someone's trip to Peru, furniture that looks like it belongs in a chain motel breakfast room.  The knickknacks for sale are nice, but they're not in a separate area, so it feels like you're eating in the middle of a gift shop.  Again, not awful if you're charging $5-7 or so per plate, but not when you've crossed the $10 threshold.  1 star.

I'm split between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm skewing low on this place.",2012-01-12 17:46:02
k5xiDQGDA6NNFs6TqivGMw,1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,hTdJAjSZtHWwqqh5cCeAfA,3,0,0,0,"I've only been to Red Lobster a total of two times since I immigrated to Canada 18 years ago. I've never been much of a seafood chain person, and usually if I end up eating seafood I would choose a local establishment over a chain place. However, the endless shrimp offer was quite enticing to my parents and I, so I decided to give Red Lobster another try.

There's surprisingly not a lot of Red Lobsters in the GTA. This branch serves most of Scarborough and virtually all of Markham, so it's not surprising that it was a 45 minute wait on a Saturday evening. Eventually my family got a table and we were given menus.

Our server took quite long to come, but eventually she did. We were quick to order endless shrimp for 3, choosing the habanero coconut bites, teriyaki grilled shrimp, shrimp linguini alfredo, and garlic shrimp. We also ordered a lobster bisque for starters.

The server initially gave us biscuits as an appetizer. My tip for people coming here is to have ONE only and pack the rest home. Those biscuits really fill you up, and if they do the endless shrimp deal won't be worth it for you. I'll give some credit and say the biscuits were very delicious...but very addictive.

The lobster bisque was quite good for a chain restaurant. It's obviously not west coast/east coast quality, but there were definitely actual lobster pieces inside, and the bisque was creamy as well.

As for the endless shrimp, we reordered the coconut bites and teriyaki grilled shrimp, as we found those two to be the best of the four (not fried, but both had their own unique sauce which was tasty). The shrimp linguini alfredo was too thick and filling, so if you want to maximize the endless offer I would skip that option (in addition to the breaded shrimp).

Service was hit and miss, especially in the first 10-15 minutes where we were left without a server. Eventually she apologized and did frequently return to refill our waters and asked if everything was alright.

Overall, this place was okay. It's not a place I will return immediately, but it does its job for a low-end price chain seafood restaurant.",2015-09-16 21:00:19

Since I am off work this week (which is rare), we were more than happy to come here and check out the restaurant in Scottsdale. 

Location: the restaurant is very well decorated both in the bar and dining area. You don't need to go inside the mall to get into the restaurant. It is clean, relaxing, with few TVs in the bar area if you want to go there and watch sports. 

Service: The service was excellent! The hostesses were nice and so was our waitress. She was super attentive and sweet the entire time. She kept coming back to check up on us to make sure we've got everything that we need. Not even once she gave us any attitude knowing that we were here from yelp. I cannot be happier and we made sure to tip her well. 

Food: We ordered a total of 3 appetizers: Sesame Ahi Tuna, Traditional Scotch Eggs and Shrimp Ceviche. They are all delicious. The Sesame Ahi Tuna is cooked on the outta layer only and fresh in the inside. The shrimp Ceviche has the right amount of shrimps and seasoning. As for the main entree, we both ordered the Fillet Mignon. It was cooked to my liking. However, it was a bit too salty. No worries - ill ask them to go easy on salt next time. 

As for dessert, we ordered a creme brulee and it was soooooooo delicious. It was sweet but not too overpowering. I cannot think of any better way to end our meals.

For Christmas, I'd like my own personal Fresh chef in my pocket.

Fresh has done an excellent job reaching out to the general carnivore with their mainstream vegetarian dishes. I have been to Fresh countless times and I am always recommending it to new friends.

The layout of this particular Fresh on Spadina is similar to that of Fresh on Bloor but I find it a little more spacious and the service may be just a tad better. They're pretty good at both locations, though. They're also a smart group of people, cutting down time wasted waiting for the server to pour some water and wander over - they've always got jars of water and cups ready to drop off at your table as soon as you arrive. Just watch out during lunch and dinner rush times and if you go with groups - it gets pretty crowded everyday. 

My most recent trip there I tried the Beach Bowl. It was abso-fricking-lootely amaaaaahhhhzing. I ordered it because the menu named off a whole slew of vegetables and sounded like the best of all worlds with grilled red peppers, zucchini, sweet potatoes (!!), alfalfa sprouts... and lets you choose between a marinated tofu steak and goat cheese! I went with the tofu steak - I think it was possibly the most flavourful, well marinated tofu I have ever tasted. All the veggies were served on a rice with olive oil drizzled all over, which made it so yummy. They really took home all the points on flavour with this bowl. I will say however, the sweet potatoes could have been a little softer, imo - but that's really my only criticism on the dish. Oh, and that they use way more oil (albeit olive) than I would ever use on a dish, but so does any other restaurant. 

The Beach Bowl is definitely a keeper. It is a must-try bowl!!!

Also, the Black Bean Burrito - one of my all time favourites. Just had to give a plug ;)

The only downside was when we got home and opened my bowl and did not find pork belly. The majority of it was kalua pig (which caught me by surprise because I ordered pork belly). My boyfriend called the restaurant again asking about the dish and as he was talking on the phone with one of the staff at the restaurant, I started finding small chunks of pork belly. It was more like 95% kalua pig and 5% pork belly. The lady on the phone said that the pork belly is mixed with kalua pig (but we didn't know that nor did it mention on the menu that it would be mixed in). Regardless of the confusion, the lady on the phone was extremely nice about it and said to keep our receipt and to come back next time to get a free pork belly bowl.

It's quintessentially ""Pittsburgh"" and apparently one of those things you love or you hate, you revere or revile.

Husband and I made three attempts to eat here.  The first two times, the line was out the door and down the block.  There's not a whole lot of food I'll stand on a long line for, and I definitely wasn't interested in squandering precious vacation time waiting to order a sandwich.  So we came back at 11 on a Sunday -- since this location is open 24 hours -- walked right in to an empty dining room, sat at the bar behind the flat top, and were eating within 10 minutes.

So?

I fall right in the middle of love/hate, revere/revile.  Most places give you fries and slaw on the side of your sandwich.  Primanti's puts them both *between* the bread, along with tomato and cheese.  This makes for a messy -- albeit convenient -- meal.  Husband and I split a tuna salad and the ""Colossal Fish,"" with a huge, deep-fried fish filet.  The sandwiches are incredibly filling, and they were good, but my mind wasn't blown.  It's deli meats and cheeses on bread they don't bake in-house.  Frankly, I think husband and I liked the mayo-less, sweet and sour slaw the best out of everything, even ordering an extra side of it to smother our sammies with.

I'm glad to have had the Primanti's experience.  But I couldn't eat one of those bad boys very often without a cardiologist on speed dial.

   I really liked this place before, the service used to be good, just chill natural treatment, the hidden/sneaky location, and let's not forget the vibe and the out of the ordinary sandwiches they offer, yet tasty. 
  However my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely.
 I do not plan on ever visiting this sandwich location again, maybe a different spot with a better care for customer satisfaction, but definitely not this location.
  On my visit here, it was about 10:30 a.m., with no traffic, at least not as busy as normal peak hours for breakfast/lunch. 
  Yet, they managed to take 15+ minutes to prepare a sandwich. I would like to add that by the looks as when I came into this establishment they had a full kitchen staff, as well as helping staff at the registers. Still they managed to take that long to make my sandwich, and I honestly think that they forgot my order, but they failed to recognize that, I asked the girl at the register, who by the way was insanely rude If she still had my order for, ""The Perfect Storm"" which was their special hot sandwich for the day, she said yes, but first asked me again for my name, as well as to remind her what I had ordered.
    I then figured that she had forgotten my order, and I believe they did because the people behind me and those behind them after my order were getting called for their sandwiches and I was still there waiting.
    I don't understand why they feel like they can take all the time they please to make a sandwich and then not even give a simple apology recognizing their mistake.  That apology would have made it much better, word of advice, just show a little more consideration next time please.
   I was in no big rush, yet I could be doing better things with my time other than checking back on my sandwich order to make sure they didn't forget it. Then after all that mess the sandwich was not what  I expected it to be, way too much cheese and oil. Sorry not my style nor taste. 
The board clearly advertised a Grilled Turkey, Melted Swiss Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms & Red Bell Pepper, Tomato, Romaine Lettuce, Honey Mustard, and On a Toasted Baguette. Sounds tasty and healthy right, not the case for this baguette.

I went with a Proseco and a Pinot Noir as well as...wait for it...scotch chocolate. Chocolate infused with scotch...so good. It's called the ""Highlander"", so make sure to ask for it if you enjoy scotch as much as I do. 

Great addition to the Selwyn Ave area. A definite stop if I'm getting some fresh fish or meat from the two markets near by in walking distance.

The appetizer crab cakes were horrible. We ordered them right off the menu without looking at other apps because we have had them many times before from the other location at Dixon but these cakes came deep fried on the outside and mushy on the inside. They were horrible and I sent them back. I had the rib eye steak topped with the lobster and a baked potato. Steak was cooked to my liking (medium) but I did not like the cheese sauce with lobster on top very much. The sever recommended it so I tried it. Not very good. The baked potato was just ok. A bit dry and not enough toppings. My friend had the prime rib with onion rings. He said both were great. We did not have dessert. Overall the food was ok. It is very similar to the Keg but more overpriced. Service was ok too. She was very knowledgeable and friendly although what she recommended wasn't so great. The manager did comp the crab cakes and our drinks since we didn't enjoy our meal as much as we hoped to. I think they are working out the  kinks and over time they should improve.

I'm sorry-but not sorry for the following statement, but when you eat at a place that serves ethnic food and you don't see any people of that ethnicity there you know it's not legit/that good. I was probably the only Vietnamese person there, besides the staff, oh well!

It was too hot and muggy for Pho, so I got their Pork Chop Broken Rice Plate (Com Tam Suon), Avocado Shake with Boba and a Vietnamese sandwich to- go for breakfast the following day. The rice plate was incredibly small in portion. It came with a cup of rice, a thin piece of pork chop, a super small egg meatloaf (single-bite size), a fish patty (two-bite) and dipping sauce. The pork chop was bland in flavor and was greasy. The plate didn't even come with a bowl of broth and I didn't even get a knife (though I didn't need one cause the pork chop was so thin). The rice wasn't even broken, it was regular white rice. I was also still hungry upon finishing my meal. What?

The Vietnamese Sandwich I ate later was lacking, but eatable. The only good thing out of this meal was the Avocado Shake. Subpar Viet food and expensive. If you want good broken rice plates go to Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa, at least the advertised rice plates are the real deal, the rice is actually broken rice and you actually get to leave not hungry.

The service is okay especially with only 1-2 servers for a huge restaurant, they did forget my knife and forgot about my to-go order. However, the location is pretty clean. The price does not reflect the quality and portion for what they serve. A plate of food ($8.99), smoothie($4.49) and sandwich($4.00) cost me about $19.

It was super easy to get an appointment. After my appointment, I found out some stuff that might have been nice to tell a first-timer at booking. Primarily, they book clients in 15 minute blocks. The upside of this: your wax will take 15 minutes or less! The downside: if you're late for your appointment, you've taken precious minutes out of your wax and thrown their whole schedule out of whack...so they won't take you at that time. I've heard that it's kinda tough to get an appointment after being late, so don't do it.

Anyway, the wax: Jessica was my aesthetician. Super friendly and set a relaxed mood. They have wipes in the rooms so you can freshen up before your wax, which I love. There is no double dipping here and everything feels very clean. I've been getting Brazilians for years, so I went in with previous pain tolerance. BUT, I hadn't been waxed in a while, so I was prepared for more pain than usual. In all honesty, there were only two strips that hurt for more than a second. The rest were about as close to painless as this gets. Obviously, huge plus.

First, the crowds. You don't have to wait three to four hours to get in (Maybe during the holidays, like thanksgiving or Christmas, the wait can be 1-2 hours. Just Call ahead and ask what the wait time is, so you're not surprised when you get there). I went on a Thursday night around dinner time (6:30), and my party of three just walked on in without a wait! Also at M, there ain't no pushy crowds there like at Bachanal. It's like the people at Bachanal haven't eaten for a few days (which may well be the case, but that's not the point), but none of the patrons there are friendly, or even passingly polite. No ""excuse me while I push in front of you to pile my plate full of crab legs"" kind of behavior (don't get me wrong, Bachanal is delicious, Just not worth it for a local to go to more than once or twice, considering the time and expense). While at M, that's the buffet where the locals go. It's calmer, more laid back, people are eating because they're legitimately hungry not trying to shove everything into their mouth to get their money's worth (ahem bachanal). 

Oops, went on a rant there. Onto the actual food review. 

The things that stood out to me at M are: 

The prime rib! That prime rib. Holy cow, thank you cow, that was good. Medium rare is the way to go. I didn't see the marbling but assume the fat was pretty even throughout bc it was so tender and juicy. 

Also unlimited beer, & wine! That was a pleasant surprise. Of course unlimited normal drinks too, like coffee, tea. Side note: their lattes aren't good. 

They had yummy & spicy Indian & Thai curries, some Filipino dinner items, your standard salad bar, American food (Mac n cheese, pizza, etc), soups. No Seafood other than oysters/clams for dinner bc it's $10 more and only on the weekends (I think). Wide assortment of desserts, gelato, etc. It was generally very good and I was pleasantly surprised! 

Also the lay out was easier to navigate, there was an open floor plan and you could easily scout out your next move. The back of the dining section also has windows, which is pleasant too. Overall, the dining experience at M was just that - a nice meal.",2015-08-13 07:51:29

I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.

I was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.

The omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said ""about 10.""  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.

We didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.

This all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!

Now that I got your attention, Mr Mama's sure got mine after having lunch there the other day. I was impressed in a lot of ways.

For starters, from the outside, the place looks like a nice little hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place. But when I opened the door and walked in, I had to do a double take. It's kind of like that one closet from that Narnia movie. Yeah, that closet. 

So I am directed by one of the many servers to any table that's available. The menu's are all ready to go on all the tables. What a concept. You come in, grab any available table, go over the menu, order, eat, and you're out. These guys definitely got a system down. I would say I was helped out by at least 3 different servers. That's why their service is very good. They are constantly running around. 

As for the food, I noticed a lot of good choices. But that day, I was really hungry and I was not gonna settle just for any burger. No sir. So I got their biggest burger called Mama's Burger. Damn. This was a case of my eyes being hungrier than my stomach. Two half pound patties, slices of avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and an onion ring. At first glance, I didn't know how to attack it. I kid you not, I was rotating my plate just looking for a chink in the armor. In the end, I ended up trying to smash it down with the palm of my hand in hopes of getting it down to the size of my mouth. Needless to say, I could only eat half of it. At that point I felt like running away crying to Mr. Mama himself (or is it herself? I don't wanna assume anything you know?). Ok, so I had dinner covered.

The only thing that might be a disappointment is their hours. 6 am to 3 pm. What if I wanna redeem myself for that burger and it just happens to be dinner time? *flashback to that lunch moment* Ok, I take it back, that's not really a disappointment.

So, umm, yeah go check this place out. Don't forget to redeem your free beverage when you check in.",2013-07-22 14:39:53

We stopped in on a Sunday after church around 1:15 or so, and there was a little bit of a wait, but it was a gorgeous day out so we didn't mind. We waited maybe 15 mins and were seated and greeted by our server quickly. 

They had a large menu with a pretty good variety, so it was a little hard to make a decision. I wanted to try either the coconut waffle, or the Georgia pecan waffle, but the omelets looked so good that we decided to go with that instead. I ordered the seafood omelet that had a crab & shrimp mixture and was topped with hollandaise and spinach. My husband ordered the cheese and chorizo omelet. They both came with pancakes, which were nice and fluffy, and a good size for a side. I liked that the omelets were french rolled. It was different, unique, and well cooked. 

Our server was very efficient and quick, we didn't have to wait long for our food, and the price was reasonable. (Just under $21 for two people.) Both of our meals were good- not great, but good. The atmosphere wasn't really my style. It was pretty loud, which is obviously because they were so busy, and the dining room just had tons of tables and chairs that were a little cramped together. I understand it helps them get more people in and out, but I personally don't like being so close to another table that we're practically touching. 

All in all it wasn't a bad experience. They certainly didn't do poorly either in service or food quality. It just wasn't so amazing that we are dying to go back any time soon. Not a bad place, just not our favorite.",2016-06-12 19:27:09

She told me about Jason's Deli and how good of deal their salad bar is.  You can literally stuff as much salad in a containter which both people can share.   We did just that while adding toppings.

Won't go into the details, but it was poorly handled on several levels.  Not a good start.  They just opened, so I'd give them a pass, if the food had made up for it.  But, sadly, it fell short.

My 2 carne asada tacos?  Meh.  Poor value - very small tacos, generic store-like tiny tortillas, very thin, that probably should have been doubled up.  Small-to-moderate quantity of meat, which wasn't so lean and seemed of lower quality.  Nice seasoning helped, but meat was still lacking.  Lousy value - the tacos were something like $2.79 each, vs $1.29 for street tacos at Los Taquitos, which are FAR superior.  This was more of a snack than a meal.

I really enjoyed them. If you have any problem with soggy, that could be an issue because they send the cakes out in a plate with a puddle of a light syrup in the bottom. It didn't really bother me though honestly. 

The Vegan thing isn't really for me as I eat a lot of protein. When they say vegan they mean vegan. Theres no hidden beef burger on the menu unfortunately. 

We sat in the greenhouse-like area outside of the main dining room. It was really nice ambiance with a cool fountain. Unique seating area. 

The problem with that was that we literally waited 15 minutes for service and the place wasn't very busy at all. After about 5 minutes we went inside to use the restroom and told the waiter we were outside and it still took 10 minutes or so for him to come out and grab our orders.

They have lots of choice on the menu, even for vegetarians or vegans which can be great.

In about a couple minutes, we were shown to the table in the back - great vantage point, if you ask me. I was digging the tunes - the beats of house and breaks. However, if that's not your bag, be prepared to swallow more than just the fish, for the music does tend to be on the loud side. 

In any case, we were seated quickly (good) and then left to fend for ourselves (bad). We read the happy hour menu (the only menu on the table at this point) probably 17 times before we were asked, ""Have you been helped?"" I wanted to snap back, ""Does it look like we have?"" Never get between me and sushi, dammit. Yet, I can respect a lesson in patience. We finally got water and menus. My date was a bit offended by the pictures. I was a bit confused on the organization of the sushi and the fact that we didn't have a sushi menu to write on. Well, okay... We selected three rolls, including the Elliot Roll that came sprinkled with macadamia nuts. Our beers arrived shortly before we placed our order (bad). My date said, ""I wouldn't mind waiting if I had a beer."" I second that. 

In fact, we almost bailed on this place. We just set our 3-minute timer to start when a young girl finally came over to assist us. It's true, she wasn't really working there. She had been recruited by her parents, the owners, and made sure to point out she wasn't familiar with the menu or the fundamentals of waiting tables. Case in point: She broke a couple glasses later on the night. Yet, it was cool that because we were ignored and neglected, she extended happy hour and gave us the discounted prices on our aps and beers. (It was the least she could do!)

Also, she was most willing to seek out the answers to our questions (good) and was friendly and tolerable. I can cut her some slack since she doesn't normally wait tables. I doubt I could have done any better, to be honest. 

We ordered two aps - the oysters and edamame. The latter was semi-cold and the portion was small. The oysters were large, yet, I was told, not chilled enough. My date would know; he's from Boston. In any case, I thought they were good!

Our sushi arrived pretty quickly. It was good. Not great and not awful. It was good, that's all I can say. I gobbled it up, yes, for I love sushi of all kinds. I just wasn't blown away or overly impressed. I definitely would not say this is the best sushi I've had - here in Phoenix or anywhere, for that matter. It's probably on the bottom tier, actually. 

However, what I was impressed with was the quail egg shooter. That little guy deserves 5 stars of his own. DELICIOUS! I could have slurped quail eggs all night. 

So, overall verdict? Well... I give Sushi Eye 3.5 stars, rounded down to an even 3 because of the extremely bad service that was my first (and lasting) impression.",2008-01-28 23:39:24

The food is clean and fresh -- you really feel like you're eating good, fresh, healthy food -- not a bunch of starchy food covered in cheese.  The rice and beans are very well-seasoned and not just throw away sides like they are at most Mexican restaurants.  The burrito was also very good!  The shrimp and chorizo were seasoned very well.

Seriously, bad service is the pits and too bad for this place that one waitress ruined the experience and possible further patronage for 3 separate couples. 

Okay so we get here and there is a wait. No problem.
We get seated on the back patio (outdoors), spectacular.
We get water from the bus boy. Grand.

Then it all goes downhill. The waitress forgot alcoholic drink orders ((hello!)) she brought the main dish for one of us while the rest of us were still nibbling on our salads. Then when the main meal came for the rest of us the appetizers followed. No refills, not a word about how our food was. It was an utter disaster.

We ended up asking the bus boy for refills, bread, the status of our food. It was foolish. I mean had I not been with a couple that really felt bad for suggesting the place I may have had a little meeting with someone in management. Really it was that bad. The shocking thing was, there was no management around that I could see anyway. 
Someone to make sure the clientele was pleased. I would think someone could be checking to make sure food was coming out on time or in an order that made some sense. WHAT A MESS!

So all that crapiness aside the food was alright. I liked the creativity of the dishes. Food was fine. We all liked what we had although none of us really enjoyed anything enough to erase the bad service.

The drinks we decent, the location is great. The patio is comfortable. The bread is good and the dishes are good portion. The prices are a little steep for my taste and considering the lack of attention it's COMPLETE BULL! But whatever.

Essentially Hakka Chinese food is a fusion of Chinese and Indian cooking so it is like spicy Cantonese cuisine.  There is a whole history of the tribes of Chinese who settled in India or vice versa...the details are not clear to me, but I will make a point of looking it up.  The truth is out there...somewhere.

The dishes ordered were:
- Chicken Lollipops (spicy) X
- Hakka Noodles
- Kung Pow Chicken (really spicy)
- Mixed Vegetables
- Shrimp in Lobster Sauce X
- Dry Fried Calamari (spicy) X
- Crispy Beef (spicy) X

Most of the dishes were really good they are the ones with the X next to them on my list.  Some of the group were more critical, but then again I do not have anything to compare with as a base line.

Nonetheless, the top dish for me was the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce (with rice).  It is really the closest to the real thing that I've ever had.  So good in fact that I ordered a take out order to bring home.

They weren't joking when they said LARGE fried chicken. The chicken was so fresh and hot when I got it! It was yummy, like a giant slab of Taiwanese friend chicken! Although it was yummy, it was also very HEAVY being the giant slab of friend chicken that it is. It is literally the length of your head. Eat it as a artery-clogging meal by itself, because it's too oily to eat in its entirety in addition to a meal. 

Ambiance 2/5 (10% of final grade)
Simple at best, and it was so cramped that I barely had any space to stand, let alone walk or sit down. I couldn't even evaluate the cleanliness of the general facilities, because it was so cramped.

Service 2/5 (10% of final grade)
Minimal service. They take your order and call you when it's ready. No smiles, nothing. All the  young people who work here obviously have better things to do. No passion. Zilch.

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Conflicted point. For a piece of chicken as big as that, I guess it was worth it. Then again...$12 for a (giant) piece of chicken... I ernno. 

Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade)
Had to wait 15 minutes for my chicken. No brownie points when I have to wait 15 minutes for my chicken at a fast-food establishment. 

Final Grade = 49/100 = 2 Stars

TLDR:  You order, and eat as you walk away with conflicted feelings of both FRIED CHICKEN and $12 piece of chicken.

Now the cakes are almost double the price, for something as simple as adding fondant (cheap) shapes cut out with a cookie cutter...like dots.

Now, if you're there for boba and want to slide, I'm sorry to tell but you're gonna have to get two drinks. If you'r there for food, well, you have no issues!

My review is strictly for their drinks -- boba or not. Now, I recently moved from California so their variety of flavors doesn't really do much for me. I've seen it plenty of times. Their regular sizes are about $3.22 and their larges are about $4 (?) I haven't ordered any larges so I'm unfamiliar with the price. 

+1 for them for having egg pudding as one of the choices. I love egg pudding in my milk tea and it was hard for me to find a place that had it as a choice in the Bay Area. It was probably more prominent in SoCal versus NorCal. It tasted like egg pudding too! (Trust me, I've tried egg pudding that wasn't egg pudding.)

Now comes the real deal. I've been to Fresh Cup three times and all three times, my Jasmine Milk Tea tasted different. 

Visit #1: Jasmine Milk Tea with egg pudding. My first visit was actually really good. I was surprised that the balance of jasmine tea, milk, and sugar was on point. I could clearly taste that it was jasmine and the milk/sugar combo did not kill the tea taste. Whoever mixed this drink for me has my thumbs up. 

Visit #2: Jasmine Milk Tea with egg pudding. Whoever mixed this clearly likes diabetes in a cup. There was NO jasmine tea flavor. The milk and sugar covered up any other flavors in this. It was like drinking water, milk, and sugar mixed in a cup. HORRIBLE. 

Also had a Mango Green Tea with boba. Yup. Definitely diabetes in a cup. The mango syrup killed everything. It was mango syrup water to me. 

Visit #3: Jasmine Milk Tea with less sugar. Nope. No jasmine flavor. No tea flavor. It was just milk with less overpowering sweetness. 


I'm not sure if I wanna go back for a #4 or #5 visit. Honestly, I do like their prices -- it's possibly the lowest in Las Vegas. I mean, tea station charges you almost $5 for a regular but then again ... quality. What I really want to do is find who mixed my drink on my first visit, take down their name, and always go back to them. Granted, I may just find another place instead. 

Oh and they do have a stamp system. However, the workers that work there never pointed that out to me or asked me if I had one. I didn't find out until on my third visit, my best friend took her stamp card out. Three separate visits and no mention of any stamp card. Great job.

For $11 (used to be $9) you get an entirely Vegan fast food meal experience. A Gardein patty on a pasty sesame seed bun, topped with American style ""cheese"". Be sure to ask for lettuce at no charge as it oddly doesn't come standard. If you're feeling frisky, you can top it with avocado for a reasonable (for Vegas) $1.50 more.

A side of tasty seasoned fries and a chocolate milkshake round out the meal. That coconut based choco-shake is a contender for the best Vegan chocolate shake in the world. Or maybe I was just craving something shake-like after being disappointed by Holstein's lack of a Vegan shake. Just be sure you know how to handle your chocolate before you down this bad boy. That sucker packs a wallop!

Is the Gardein patty cooked to perfection? No, not quite. It could use more flame broiling, less microwaving but it's still pretty good and the overall price is right. The pasty bun is pretty pasty tasting as well. However, for a ""cheap"" quick meal in The Wynn, get your ass to Zoozacrackers, conveniently located next to the sports book.

It must've been good enough that my sweetie risked filling herself up too much before our meal at Sinatra later that night by ordering another one after we finished the first one we shared for lunch.

My 3rd visit, excellent as usual, and I'll just ramble on about sushi again.  

Tonight, they had fuji apple sake aperitif, so I went with that as I've had the pineapple aperitif before.  Very subtle but flavorful.  As they have a liquor license now, I went ahead and ordered a carafe of sake called....now I can't remember, it was the 2nd one from the top and $13 for a carafe.  I was going to order it nurukan (slightly warmed), but the waitress said that it's got some body and fruitiness, and recommended it be served cold so I did.  this is pretty standard procedure where fruity sake, especially ginjyo or daigingyo are served chilled, although there are quite a few people who like them warm/hot as well.  Appetizer today was ika geso (squid leg/tentacle) wakame and cucumber salad.  This may have been my favorite appetizer so far.  

They had some stuff today I've never had before.  Ira (tusk fish) and umeiro (ume snapper) I've never even heard of.  They are apparently from kyushu (southern most big island) and usually consumed there, so they usually don't make it out to Tokyo area.  Isaki (striped pig) was very good, Kohada (shad) is a must have and it was braided today (see my photo), which completely changes the texture and I personally like it when the shad is on the big side.  We also had blue fin tuna, chu-toro, katsuo (bonito), Ikura (salmon roe), sakura masu (cherry salmon), ika (squid), and anago (salt water eel).  I also ordered ma-aji (jack mackerel), sayori (half beak), and zuke (soy marinated tuna).  

The best one today was ma-aji (jack mackerel).  itamaesan was especially proud of this fat, juicy mackerel as it's in season, and one nigiri piece was one half of this plump fish.  Very nice.  Aji is served raw as opposed to saba (japanese mackerel) which is usually salted/vinegared.  Aji is often served with a pinch of grated ginger as it may have a fishy taste/odor, but no need for that today as aji was very fresh.  

Miso soup today had nameko, which is this small slimy mushroom that I've never seen out here and it's always been one of my favorite things to put in miso soup.  

Hand roll today was negi-toro, which is one of my favorite things.  A lot of people mistaken that it's a toro, but traditionally, it's not necessarily toro, but scrapings from fatty part near the skin or between the ribs, that's why it's pasty as it was scraped off.  I always like that hot tamago to finish the dinner off :D

I was talking with itamae-san about what's coming in season in the next few months to come. Botan-ebi from Santa Barbara will be good until end of June.  Now, if they have it when you are there, you should definitely order it.  They call this sweet shrimp, but it's very different from those thin ""sweet shrimps"" you get at AYCE places, we call those little ones ama-ebi, which literally means sweet shrimp.  Botan means, peony, and it's called botan ebi because its bright red body resembles peony flower. These are big, fat, plump shrimp/prawn and for whatever reason, botan-ebi is only good when eaten fresh and raw.  This is in contrast to kuruma-ebi (usually translated black tiger prawn, but it's different) which doesn't taste good raw, thus served boiled.  

Others that will come into season will be tsubu-gai from Maine, which is this really tasty, chewy clam.  In the summer, shinko will be in season, which is baby kohada (gizzard shad), which is also called konoshiro when bigger.  We call these types of fish shusseuo, which are types of fish that change names as they get bigger and include fish like shinko/kohada as well as yellow tail and amber jack.  Anyway, shinko is tiny.  Perhaps as big as your thumb, and if you've had kohada, you know that a LOT of work goes into preparing it, filleting, deboning, salting, vinegaring, and as small as shinko is, it takes even more effort and amount/time of salt/vinegaring is adjusted by the size/thickness of shinko/kohada.  As shinkos are very small, you'd usually place several fillets on nigiri as opposed to one piece for kohada.  When shinko is in season, all of the sushi lovers in Japan rush to their favorite sushi-ya to savor the arrival of summer sushi season.  I can't wait :D  Then there is winter sushi...plump hirame, fatty tuna, gorgeous yellow tail from the sea of Japan....mmmm.",2012-05-10 07:48:43

However, I wouldn't recommend the house broth if you are not used to Asian hot pot because it has too much ""seeds"" (I forgot the name) in it. When you bite into it, it somewhat numbs your mouth and then there is a hint of a metal flavor. 

If you are a first timer I would recommend either the mushroom or tomato broth! Their presentation is beautiful especially with the combos. They have cute little baskets and use dry ice as decoration as well. 

We had the meat combo, scallops, 2 mushroom soup, pork dumplings, rice (you have to order), crab meat, and veggie noodles. It came out to about $50 enough for 2 people. Everything was very tasty however you have to watch the noodles carefully because they tend to get pretty mushy if you leave it in too long. 

I LOVE the sauce station ! They have a wide variety of sauces to choose from and to mix with. It was also a nice touch how they had sauce mixture recommendations. 

They also have a happy hour for everything on the conveyor belt buy one get one free SUN-THURS 9:30-12:30.

I ordered yellow tail, salmon, scallop(marinated with yum yum sauce only), and tuna. Salmon was the only one that was not dried.

There is a huge selection of appetizers which includes skewers. They were not really Japanese style but tasted pretty ok.

I don't usually eat rolls so I can't really comment too much on it, but there is a huge selection of rolls for you to choose from.

The service was pretty good. The gentleman asked us frequently if we needed refills or additional orders. However, it's the only sushi place I've been to that would bring your bills without being requested. Not a big deal to me but some people may care, especially when the place is almost empty.

When I asked what cheese they used, the server replied cheddar, Swiss or a mixed for the gratin on the French Onion   Soup. So I ordered the Croque Madame which absolutely did not disappoint. The ham was smoky and nicely cured. It tasted like country style ham nicely warmed. My fried egg was fried perfectly sunny side up. The baguette was toasty and had a great texture.

6tCyY28jMK7yl_wBg2grFg,wbvjiDpw0FoZDeqbzAIcDQ,yesClkCZlpLGTYZROkx4SA,5,0,1,0,"Confession - watching the episode of Diners Drive-Ins and Dives that features Krazy Fish has been on my to do list since our first visit. Also trying their tacos but I just haven't gotten around to either yet. 

Why do I love it here? 

First - it is so kitschy and I adore it. I naturally find my eyes wander to take everything in when we visit. I feel like every time there is a new surprise based on a different seat. Floating mermaid? Blowfish? Check. Of all the places I have visited in Charlotte I would safely say this has the most unique décor. 

Second - the service. We have always had the most friendly wait staff. Last time I was eagerly and hungrily watching as our waiter went by with everyone else's food. He eventually stopped off to let me know our food was next (in a joking good humored way) and took the opportunity to see if we wanted more drinks. Even though we don't go often since it is on the other side of town it just has this amazing neighborhood feel to it.

Third - maybe the most important. The food. Is. Amazing. Everything we have tried has been delicious. If you order one of their entrees it will quite possibly be more food than you can eat in one sitting. I can attest to never actually finishing a meal there, which means leftovers and I can enjoy it twice! Except the one time we were going out afterward and I had to leave behind such delicious food and my heart broke a little. 

Fourth - the price. It can be super affordable if you go for a roti with a side which comes to $8 on average. My favorite dish, the seafood diablo, is pricy at $17 BUT comes with more seafood than you would expect. Sure there is a good portion of generic white fish in it but it is also chock full of lobster and mini scallops. Oh and it comes with a ginormous salad to start. So as far as getting a bang for your buck I would say even the entrees are a good deal.

Honorable mentions - the Thai green curry mussels are a must try if that's your thing. Huge appetizer portion with tons of bread! The cheesy jalapeño girts - my boyfriend doesn't like grits but went with the waiter's recommendation to get them as a side. He now absolutely gushes about the grits there.",2017-01-17 19:51:08

I had the Udon Gratin and it was amazing. The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a nice bite to them, while the cheese sauce was extremely creamy; with every bite cheese strands would have to be cut from the piece you just ate to the rest of the udon. I enjoyed the slivers of onion throughout the dish, giving it a crunch and extra texture that made the dish that much better. The chicken in it was cooked to perfection and gave good protein to the udon. The beef udon on the other hand, which my friend got, was delicious in its own way. The beef broth was tasty on its own and very flavorful. The udon, once again, was cooked to perfection and absorbed some of the flavors of the broth. The thinly sliced beef that accompanied to dish was also very tender and absorbed the flavors of the broth. This was the perfect dish for the current weather outside (which was cold and very windy).

But why the four stars? I gave them one less star for their appetizer. My friend and I shared the pork lettuce wraps and though they were delicious with a hint of spiciness, the lettuce wraps came already assembled and the meat-to-lettuce ratio was a little lacking.

When Las Vegas' first stand-alone Dunkin Donuts opened up last year, you would have thought Jesus had returned to earth and bought a home in Silverado Ranch based on the media coverage.

The inside was clean and unlike many of the other Starbucks stores I've been to, this was extraordinarily spacious!
Wifi was strong and good and wasn't cutting out as I've experienced at other stores.

Why only 2 stars you are most likely wondering.  To start off to give you a little idea is that i was born and raised in the bay area for almost 22 years of my life on nothing but the most amazing Asian spots to eat at with the best flavor and all. 
     Luckily i did find a Thai spot out here in hot dry Arizona which does not happen to be Thai basil obviously.  Second off i happen to be a huge foodie and let flavors sit to get the full experience. Thai basil lacks A LOT of flavor because everything was so watered down. 
      I asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai.  i was expecting some sort of spiciness given the fact that i had asked for MILD and not  MEDIUM. I shouldn't have to order the hot to get more flavor out of it wouldn't you agree?? something in between spicy and no spice? it would make sense...but thai basil failed that miserably on the flavor aspect and spiciness lots of points missed there. 
     Now we had got there 5 min after the lunch hour meal deal had ended but we did not want huge dinner portions at the time so we had asked very politely if it was possible if we could order the lunch meal instead. The manager, I'm assuming agreed and brought us out some soup to start. The soup was not bad since we were starving at the moment and i love tofu so okay onward with my review.  Shortly after they had brought out my awaited panang curry which looked to be quite soupy and full of veggies which i do not mind. What matters the most is the consistency and flavor. Which you should have an idea of how the flavor turned out but it gets worse. As i poured some curry over my rice and go to eat a spoonful i am quite used to a spoonful of curry to cover the rice with enough flavor.  This was not the case here. i had to basically pour a whole bowl of curry onto a small tiny cup of rice to get any flavor of curry over my rice. :(
       Thai basil had screwed up my friends pad thai and brought out her piping hot plate a couple minutes later hers was not even tinted with any redness we should not need to add more hot sauce when  we asked for mild we expected mild. We were more than happy to get the lunch special than a huge dinner plate because of the fact  that we should not have to pay so much for HORRID(cleaned up word for what i would like to say) food. We were definitely complaining but don't you think  you would also if you were to see a rating of 4 stars out of five on a highly reviewed Thai place?  My other friends pad see ewe? was lacking of all flavor apparently in 85% of the dish and said the rest was bland.
        The employees were giving us the dirty eye the rest of the time when they realized how much we hated their food. When they brought us to go boxes we didn't need i just told my friends it was pointless to pack the nastiness up when we really wouldn't be eating it later. They agreed and asked for to go cups for our thai tea instead the employee came back and slammed the cups down and walked away continuing to give us dirty looks. TERRIFIC. So freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. and this was 3 reviews in one. 

        We did NOT leave a tip because the employees were not helpful or considerate since we did not enjoy their food in the slightest. it was not worth my 10 dollars because i ended up having the worst stomach pain for 12 hours straight and bubble guts for probably a good 7-8 hours in the beginning. gross, i know.  I would like to give them another chance but after my 12 hour long incident i really don't want to risk it. I will continue to go to my beloved thai rama when they are open that has to suffice until i go back to the real deal in San Francisco, Milpitas, San Jose or Tracy, CA.",2011-03-27 20:03:33

I happen to love soup, which, with me included with all my friends who love soup brings the total to 1. I don't care. I love soup. There, I said it. I also love ""Murder, She Wrote"" and playing Rummy. I'm a 75-year-old trapped in a thirtysomething body.

The ambiance makes it feel like you're in someone's kitchen. It's really nothing fancy... the most ornate thing is the front door, really. But the staff is friendly, and the menu is oft-changing, which is great. They post their specials on Facebook daily so you can take a look and see what you want before you go.

Although the soup left something to be desired (the chicken was bland and the noodles sparse), my main course was breakfast nachos and that was pretty good. A hot bed of tortilla chips, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, olives, tomatoes -- It was tasty, though it could have used a little more in the way of layering. By the time I was done, I had a pile of chips still left with no goodies to put on it.

The best part is that the whole lunch, with tip was about $15 for the soup, an entree, and a drink. Not a bad price for fresh-made food

It's a quaint little place, and I certainly wouldn't mind giving it another go.",2013-02-28 02:52:32

I stumbled across this swanky Italian joint as there was a huge, yellow banner advertising their $9.95 lunch specials. I made a sharp right and decided to give it a shot.

I had heard about this place and had basically wrote it off because I have heard how expensive their dinner menu is (that holds true and I still wouldn't ever be able to come for dinner) but that's why I was delighted when I saw a lunch banner. You can choose from 3 different pasta selections that rotate daily as well as your choice of a cup of soup or salad for $9.95. I'm in!

Now did the food hold up to this Italian girl's high standards?

The answer is yes, yes, yes. I was given a bread basket to start with rolls nestled warmly in a blanket accompanied by a stained glass-like painting of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. These scrumptious little pillows held my anxious stomach at bay until my main dish arrived. Fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken....ahhh. There were ribbons of scratch-made noodles arranged perfectly on the plate with creamy, silky smooth alfredo sauce that would make even my Nona blush, all topped off with a fresh grilled rosemary chicken breast...it was Italy...home away from home, and within that moment, they had a customer for life.",2013-05-20 20:36:05

Local Public Eatery is a place that made me think I may not be cool enough.  The decor could have come from Restoration Hardware (a store), except for the amazing board that displays beer specials.  When I took my second airplane flight as a kid, I remember flying through DFW airport and staring at the flight information board. It was a mechanical wonder that flipped tiles to show status.  LPE has one of those that shows 7+ special beers that they have on tap.  When a keg runs dry, they tap another and change the board.  It almost makes me want to come back sometime with a bunch of friends to see if we can drink a keg dry and watch what comes up next on the board.

Alas, we came here for lunch and did not imbibe of alcohol.  I am not sure what all of the 20-something or 30-year-old-wanna-bes do for a living, but I was amazed at how many people were drinking (alcohol) at lunch!  If I had a pint at lunch to go along with my AWESOME Deluxe Burger, I would have had to take an afternoon nap.

The menu is pretty standard pub fare.  The burger selection is highlighted in the middle of the menu, so we decided to try.  The burger was excellent - great bun, juicy meat, and fresh garden toppings.  My Deluxe burger also had house-smoked cheddar and crispy bacon (the american kind, not the canadian bacon like on a Egg McMuffin).  It came with fries, but for another $1 you can substitute yam fries.

I was surprised to be helped by Cheyenne and Megan who were more than willing to give me and my hubby samples of all kinds of flavors and toppings.
The prices are soooooo reasonable. For under 5$ you can get a HUGE ASS SNOW CONE with very very very fine shaved ice. Best ive had outside of Hawaii (and im from Hawaii). They also serve coffee and smoothies as well. The toppings and flavors for the shave ice have to be near 50 different ones with a whole bunch of sour options and also some options for calorie free toppings. 
We ended up getting a large upgrade on both our orders b/c we checked in on yelp
- Large Sour patch flavored shave ice with sour blue raspberry and sour patch sauce with sour crystals (can u tell i like sour things :P)
-Large Birthday cake (THEIR MOST POPULAR FLAVOR), Icing flavor with root beer, with ice cream on the bottom and condensed milk on top (my husband loves sweet)
TIPS:
-order down: A large was tooooooo big and can feed 2 people
-ask for samples: they are more than willing to give you samples
-they have a rewards card for every 10, you get 1 free. But at certain temperatures ( less than 40 degrees- 3X stamps,  less than 50 degrees- 2X stamps)
-They come out with new flavors all the time: while we were there they had Fiesta flavors such as: Chili mango, mango, passion fruit. With toppings like Chimoye and Piccadilli

They put a savoury sauce that offsets the blandness of the tofu. Not bad. The main courses I ordered a beef and beef tendon noodles in a fry bean sauce. This was so yummy! I like how the tendons melt in my mouth and the beef was braised for so long that it was soft and not chewy at all. Onto the final dish we chose: dumplings and beef tendon.

I'll start by saying what I love about this place is that you never have to wait to be seated as the place is almost always empty. On the weekend it gets busier but still they can easily accommodate a large crowd. Although the variety of items you can order pales in comparison to Hwaro, the meat is high quality and if you like kalbi like I do, it's worth it. The spicy octopus is fresh and packed with flavor. The japchae is delicious as well. What I don't like about this place is the service. The older lady always seems annoyed by our requests. They limit the number of items you can order at one rime, which is annoying when you have 9 people that want to order more than just 4 things. They also give you a HUGE potion of the cheaper meats like the brisket while skimp on the select cuts of meat like the short ribs. This annoyance makes the meal take longer because you can only order so much at a time. Also the service is similar to that of the DMV, mostly because even if you only have a party of two, they automatically add 18% tip to the bill. Yep the fine print on the sign at the table says parties of 5 or less there's a tip of 18% added. This is so annoying to me because the service sucks. Even if you're the only table in the place, you still have to hunt down your waitress at times. Will I be back?

Right now, it's the blazing summer season and we had expected water to be given to us shortly after being seated.  Our server had literally forgotten about us while she chatted with a regular patron seated behind me for most of our visit.  We had tried to get her attention and a couple of other employees as well to no avail.  During her initial visit to our table, she was nice and outgoing so attitude was never an issue.

My standard for tips start at 20%.  I have never felt the need to tip less than that before this visit.  There should never be a reason to ignore a table unless you don't want money.  For this visit, I tipped between 10 to 15%.  The thought of no tip did cross my mind but she did provide service, however minimal it was, and she wasn't rude.  It was a disappointing experience due to the lack of service but I would consider coming back because the food is good.",2016-08-08 19:20:46

This isn't the most authentic New York style pizza you've ever eaten, it's ""fusion."" They offer options that take combinations like pear, Gorgonzola, and candied walnuts and put them on pizza. That said, I didn't find their ready-to-order options that adventurous or novel, but they do have a ""make type own"" column that looked promising. 

I ordered the steak, Gorgonzola, peppers, and onions pizza and the sausage, peppers, onions, and chili flakes pizza. I was hungry and they were tasty, but more like flatbread than what I consider pizza. The steak version, especially tasted more like an open face steak sandwich. 

The one differentiating feature for Pizza Fusion is that they offer choices like organic, gluten free, vegan, and so on. So, if you're going with someone who's on a special diet, they may have options, but if you're not, it's good, but there are better pizzas to be had in Charlotte. 

Overall, if it was a little less pricey, I would throw it in my ""visiting the Metropolitan"" rotation, but at $18-29 for a large (which they call an xl), I could almost just go eat at one of the sit down restaurants around the corner. Maybe if I needed to feed 4 people, it would be more cost effective, but to me, that's just $15 of leftovers.",2014-03-19 12:38:36

It's a total rip off of Deer Garden which is also not that great to begin with. It's a build your own noodle soup bowl deal where you choose a broth, some toppings and type of noodle. You can also add on some side dishes such as beef tongue, pork cutlet, short ribs etc for a couple of bucks. There is a late night special (which we got) I guess, I dunno she just barked at us asking if we wanted the special. Which I think is $1 or $2 cheaper.

I got the original fish soup with beef brisket, fish tofu and with rice noodles. The broth was really salty but the portion was good. 

I switched my drink to a cold drink which on the order sheet said $1. Ordered a soda and Ribena which came in a pre-sealed bubble tea style cup with a sealed lid. You could tell it was pre made and sitting there for a long time because the lemon was completely soggy and wilted and it had that old lemon taste and zero fizz.

We got the bill and then were told if we wanted to pay the price of a special, it was cash only. Okay, but why didn't you tell us before when you asked if we wanted the special?

The place is a zoo. I'm not sure at this point if you'd want to do any actual grocery shopping. Everyone is just there to gawk and is so wide-eyed an bewildered that's its difficult to navigate the store. 

As others have said, there is a wall of cheese, huge bakery, tea emporium, blah blah blah etc. I'm over it. There isn't anything new here in terms of a grocery store, except that the concept is new in Toronto. You want sushi fresh made in store? Safeway has been doing it for years. You want a meal made in front of you? Almost everyone has been doing this for a long time, it's just that this store is so huge, they can have a bigger menu. 

Don't get me wrong, LCL did a great job here. It's just that all they've really done is dropped trow and shoved it in everybody's face that they're the biggest player in Canada. We get it, you have a 60% share of the market.

a) Full size LCBO
b) Full size Joe Fresh store
c) ACE bakery, which has artisan bread
d) A large hot food section that could be a food court (they even had fresh burgers!)
e) A good size deli
f) A large butcher area
g) A dedicated tea leaf shop
h) Large dessert section


In addition to all that, all the other grocery sections could be it's own store (e.g. Health & Beauty section could be its own store).  I was quite impressed.  Also, they had 17 cashiers and the longest lineup I could see was about 2-3 people.  While I hate the fact that Maple Leaf Gardens is a grocery store now, at least they put some Leaf murals and that the store isn't your ""plan old Loblaws"" because if it was, I'd be so upset.

This place surprises me.. so unassuming on the outside, you can literally drive past it a thousand times and not notice it's there.. inside it looks like old school, tacky vegas threw up in here.  Vintage plastic colorful booths, neon lights trace the ceilings, faux trees coming out of the booths... wow.  

There's also a fireside lounge which is all the rage, but I normally stumble into this joint on my very last hours of Vegas, tired, drained and out of cash, so I never have the time to check out the fireside lounge.

This place is known for their large 24 hour portions of breakfast.  They also serve lunch and dinner though.

There's an entire page of omelets.  Not a fan of the seafood omelet consisting mostly of fake seafood product and tasting slightly fishy.  I had better luck this time around w/the Maserati omelet filled w/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.  I can't imagine how many eggs it takes to make one order.  All come w/hashbrowns, and your choice of either toast, or english muffin, or bagel or fresh blue berry muffin.  That's a lot of freakin' food!!! 

You can also order some alcoholic bevs from the alcoholic waitress (heh) I had a mimosa given to me in a sangria glass.  Not very stiff, but still enjoyable w/my meal.

Honestly, I'm never really the biggest fan of diners.. so if it weren't for my bf's tradition of ending vegas trips here, I probably wouldn't have come back a second time.... but w/its unique environment, nostalgia, heaping portions of food, so so prices, i can see how it would be considered a good diner.",2010-05-25 02:33:39

Basil Thai-Fusion is a one off, located off of Ranch & Craig, in the dining area of Bailey's Restaurant and Bar.  Yes.  I was confused when I first found it.  The night we went?  It was karaoke night, and wow, were there a number of drunk folks ready to sing along to Lionel Richie's 'What a Feeling'.  Since we had our kid in tow, we opted to do take out from the kitchen.  Although in retrospect I would have loved to throw down a rendition of 'Maneater' by Hall & Oates and leave the crowd AMAZED.

One great thing about Basil Thai-Fusion is the prices.  Since the food is created in a little kitchen, savings on overhead can be had, and those savings get passed along to the customer!  Nearly every main item on the menu is priced between a healthy $6 - $9 (unless you get the NY Strip which will set you back $17).  Nice value!  I love savin' me some green for the slot machine!

Another plus?  The food!  Really, it is pretty good.  We shared:

-Thai Beef Salad - Beef marinated in thai spices, grilled, then placed over a bed of lettuce and veggies
-Pad Thai with chicken - Pan fried noodles in house-made basil tamarind sauce with egg, bean sprouts, green onions, and topped with peanuts
-Thai Mint with beef - Mint leaves cooked with thai spices and chiles

Thai food is so delicious!  Complex flavors of sweet, spicy, tangy, salty, when done right it can ooze UMAMI!  Basil Thai-Fusion knows how to do it right.  Even in take out boxes the food was still good.  My only concern?  Watch your spiciness level!  If you don't like hot spicy foods, stick to a 0 or 1.  Trust me!  A level 5 on the spice meter at this place might burn your mouth a bit.  And I like spicy food.  We went with a level 3 heat and that still was enough to make us sweat bullets.  But I just couldn't stop eating.  Love.  Hate.  Love.  Hate.  Love!

You gotta come to Basil Thai-Fusion to do their lunch special.  Cheap on the cheap!  The lunch special is served daily from 11 AM - 3 PM.  You can choose from 14 different entrees, and each come with your choice of fried rice or white rice, soup, and an eggroll.  All for less than $6!  Go for the Pepper Steak or the Panang Curry.  Sounds delicious.
  
Service was good, our lone girl waitress/hostess was very friendly and was apologetic when we said we would wait outside for our take out order because it was smoky inside.  When we come back again I think we will probably eat in the outdoor patio area of the restaurant, or just do take out again.

This yelp review is based off the Yelpy Hour that Cowfish so graciously hosted. Lemme tell ya, you need to call ahead for seats, at least on a Thursday night. This place was PACKED. 35 minutes for a table. Good thing us Yelpers had a reserved section. 

Plate after plate of different, yummy food was brought out, so I got to have the sushi, burger, and extras. 

Sushi: To DIE for. They had such interesting fusion! Normally I like to go traditional, but I'm glad I got to try these new favorites. I can't really identify any of the roles that I ate for free besides the obvious salmon or tuna laying across the top, but they were all great. We actually decided to stay for dinner after, it was so good. We ended up getting the Tuna Nachos, and the Motherload. 

Those tuna nachos... damn. They make my mouth water just thinking about them. Very large, flat nacho with rich, creamy crab rangoon dip spread over it, some greens and spices on top of that, and then tuna sashimi on top. So, so good. The only thing is that the seasoning on the Tuna (which almost tasted like ginger), while good on the tuna, seemed to clash with the rest of the crab rangoon/chip ensemble. That wasn't a problem for me, since I merely ate the sashimi first, then delved into the chip. 
The Motherload is a $23 sushi platter that has all the fish on the menu. When we ordered it, the waiter assured me that this was not for sushi beginners, and we might see some stuff we hadn't previously discovered. I love your deeper, untraditional Americanan sushi, and was excited. However upon receiving the order, it was pretty much all normal stuff on there. Delicious yes, but normal. Delicious rolls with white fish, tuna, salmon, and fillet, topped with flying fish roe. The sashimi consisted of a few slices of octopus, a very large sweet shrim (my favorite), and sliced scallop (second favorite). The scallop was topped with salmon roe. There was also a tempura-fried prawn in a spring roll with peanut dipping sauce, which I am glad to say, also came with the head on the plate (gotta love sucking out those prawn brains! ... I may have scarred my dinner partner for life in doing so, though.). All in all delicious, but I think pretty standard sushi fare.

Burgers:
I don't know what they were. Little sliders that were flavorful, covered in sauces and condiments, different veggies, and were very juicy. Delicious. 

Extras:
Fried pickles: they were there. They are what they are: good, but nothing to write home about.
Chicken skewers: platter of very flavorful and moist marinated chicken. Not a huge chicken onna stick person if there's sushi around to be had, but these were great little noms. 
Edamame: Lightly salted, gently steamed, and delicious

Drinks: 
My vodka collins was always refilled, and though not extremely flavorful, very strong. 
Got to try some 'carbonated' sake. Usually a stickler for traditional warmed plum, this was actually pretty good, very fruity. Glad I got to try it.

Many reviews complain about the service, but I have to say that in my many times dining there (15+), I have never had a negative experience with the service. The hostesses are incredibly nice, and often Elizabeth herself is there to greet you, usually with some kind of compliment! I've always found the waiters and bussers to be extremely helpful and friendly, whether I'm there with a huge table of 10 or just a table of 2.

The decor is amazing - a HUGE improvement from the former restaurant in this space (which I actually thought had excellent food, just no atmosphere). Honey Salt is casual chic and they went to great lengths to achieve that feel: eclectic mirrors on the walls, booth seating around the perimeter, and my absolute favorite part - all of the chairs are different!

The wine list is not huge, but the selections they have are great, and their specialty drinks are really really tasty. The food is the only reason I do not give this restaurant five stars. It is definitely tasty, but just not stand-out impeccable five-star quality. The curry chicken can be hit-or-miss, the steak is delicious but just not over-the-top special, and I would say the same for the appetizers. I will say that the food has been improving recently, and they have added several new items to their menu like a delicious ceviche (that is served in a really cute way, and I'm a sucker for that). My favorite thing on the menu is actually the burger, which comes with a fried egg on top!

We started with the stuffed chicken wings. I thought it was very dry. It only came with two of them and we discussed how many they normally come with at other Thai restaurants we've dined at. The cucumber salad that accompanied it was good. We ordered the salmon green curry and spicy mint tofu. WOW, we were very disappointed when it came out. No joke, the portions are tiny as hell!! Seriously.. these are entree portions?! I almost wanted to laugh when they brought it was but decided to refrain from that.

The salmon curry was yummy. I have never tried green curry with salmon and it was delicious although next time I'll stick with chicken or tofu. The spicy mint tofu was not as flavorful as I hoped but overall was fine. Just the portions really bugged the hell outta me! 

The workers were very nice and always made sure to fill our waters and too see if we wanted more beer or wine.

The only thing is it is too salty. As the drinks are definetely required becuase the seasoning is a bit too strong. The drinks that come in a combo. Such as blur curaco and passionfruit. The blue curaco is okay. It taste like the asian yogurt drinks. But the passionfruit is a little too sweet.  The portion is just right for lunch as you feel it is just enough.  If anyone is to eat here. I would suggest ask them to but less salt. As it is too strong. Overall it is good fried chickenm and worth a try. I would suggest go right at 11 in the morning at opening to avoid the lineups and treat it as brunch.,2015-11-07 18:21:58

Depending on how close you are to the stage while the band is playing, you either have to scream at the person standing next to you, or talk very loudly.  

Service at the bar has always been ok, if you can get close enough to the bar.  If it is too busy to get to the bar, you're not going to have much luck.  The waitress we had at a table one time was not the brightest crayon in the box either.

This is a place where a lot of d bags hang out.  If that doesn't bother you, then go.  If you're looking to actually have a conversation, go somewhere without extremely loud bands.",2013-02-25 22:45:53
IkFna7fNhqG3zmMinepGkg,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ,7mGZrCzGGjS95SdRtEaGcQ,5,7,2,6,"Like many other reviewers, I know Sweet Republic's owners (fellow Yelper, Helen Y. and Jan). Knowing them may have been what made my husband (Myles M) and me drive all the way up from South Phoenix to North Scottsdale, but knowing them would not make me give them an unwarranted 5-star rating. I have high standards for my food and drink, so I can guarantee you that my 5-star rating of Sweet Republic's is 100% genuine. 

Good cuisine always places a huge focus on two things: 1) using fresh, high-quality ingredients; and 2) combining these ingredients in a simple, thoughtful way that maximizes the individual flavors (think ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts""). Based on this definition, Sweet Republic makes great food that just happens to be ice cream. All of the ice creams, sorbets, and yogurts use ultra-fresh and natural ingredients (e.g., fresh mint, locally-roasted espresso, wild desert honey, handmade marshmallows) and the flavors thoughtfully combine ingredients that really go well together (e.g., pear and ginger, basil and lime, blue cheese and dates, blueberry and orange). 

Helen and Jan know what goes well together, too, and they will be happy to suggest flavor combinations of the different ice creams that work well together. When I started to order the Cheese Course flavor with Rocky Road, simply because those two flavors sounded the best to me, Jan suggested that I pair the Cheese Course with a fruit flavor. I took her advice, paired it with the Pear Ginger, and the cool, subtle sweetness of the pear and ginger flavors did wonders to cut the strong blue cheese flavor. I felt like I should have had a glass of wine to go with my cheese and fruit! My husband ended up ordering the Rocky Road with the Salted Caramel, which was by far my favorite flavor, and these two also paired wonderfully. We also had an opportunity to try the bacon ice cream, which was sweet and salty at the same time. If it sounds weird, just think of how great bacon tastes when it rubs up against your pancakes and gets maple syrup on it! 

I always value an establishment's food and drink more than decor, presentation, etc., but in the case of Sweet Republic, the same attention and care paid to the sweets is also paid to the establishment's look, branding, and messaging, which only adds to the business' appeal. The shop is decorated in a bright, modern decor that manages not to look cookie-cutter in a sea of Ikea-decorated shops, the bathrooms are designed beautifully and are super clean, the menu is attractive and easy to read, and the website is well-written and contains all the pertinent information. 

This is a great, local business whose owners care about making fresh, flavorful, and thoughtful ice creams and other desserts. I'm glad I met them and therefore had the incentive to go check it out. You should, too!",2008-09-13 20:43:50

Location:
It's located in the sunny suburbs of Aurora. On the corner of Wellington and Industrial. There's not a lot around. It's worth the drive.

Parking: 
Well...it's an industrial area in the suburbs so no parking stress. Go ahead and drive!

Decor:
On the outside its not much to look at. It's not exactly beckoning. It looks like it's a fast food place. It's not a fast food place though.

Inside you notice. No tables. There is a bar around the room with bar stools that you can sit at and eat. This is obviously a big take out place.

The room reminds me of Cora's with their farmy  city look.

Food:
Omg. Delicious. Portuguese chicken that's cooked on a grill to order. They actually suggested that the next time we come in we should order ahead so it'll be done when we get there. Honestly, we didn't even wait that long. Not longer than any other restaurant.

We got the chicken. You can two sides. I got the quarter chicken with chickpea salad and tasted vegetables. The  chicken was terrific. Moist and juicy. It was grilled. I have no idea how they did it. The chickpea salad was super. I would definitely recommend it. The vegetables too. They were roasted/ grilled with a bit of char. What a difference the char makes. 

My dining companion got the half chicken with rice and cucumber tomato salad. He really likes it too.

We were there in the middle of the afternoon and it was busy with people coming in and out for take out. It's a very popular place. 

Price:
Very good value for the amount of food you get!

Conclusion:
Yeah, I gave it 5 stars. I'm going to be back!",2016-05-10 23:27:25

The Richmond hill location is our regular haunt.

It is clean, beautifully decorated, nice music,and a pleasure to eat at.  Good for families, or for an intimate meal.  I take business associates here for meetings as well.

This location is by far my favourite.  I've been to most, if not all locations.

The staff is fantastic and goes out of their way to make sure I'm treated like family, and that I always have something that I am able to eat.

They have for many years provided some of the most diverse choices for an Italian restaurant for anyone who must eat gluten free.  They provide normal food as well that is extraordinary, but for me I will review this as someone who has to maintain a strict gluten free diet.

The pizzas are quite good, and the pasta selection is great.  They have gluten free crusts and pasta, but what sets them apart from most restaurants that serve gluten free is that they also have several appetizers, soup, and main courses that are not just pasta and/or pizza options

I typically get the veal and have a nice butternut or minestrone soup.

Today I am having a higher protein version of ""pasta.""  I have asked them to substitute vegetables for my pasta, and I am happy to pay extra to get a more low carb option.

They have been great in making substitutions for us as needed.   All three of us in our family must eat gluten free.

This place was pretty busy so I would recommend making reservations.  It serves higher end Indian food so the prices do reflect that, but the quality is worth it.

We had the chaat papri and the Chicken 65. Tthe chicken was nice and spicy and accompanied well with the chaat as this was cool and fresh.  The 2 apps balanced each other out nicely.

for mains we had the lamb and the curry fish.  The fish was nice and flaky and soft if a beautiful cream sauce.  The lamb..oh my...was a HUGE piece (think Fred Flintstone size).  It was tender, falling off the bone delicious.  It comes with basmati rice in a food container like jar (Indian people will know what I mean when they see the jars...lol).

The desserts we choose were the dark chocolate spicy ganache.  Definitely dark chocolate tasting - rich and smooth, but I couldn't really detect the spicy in here.  The other dessert we had was the mango pudding.  It tasted so fresh, so much like eating a ripe mango it was unbelievable.

Aria is one of the hotels situated at the ""City Center,"" aspiring to be at the epicenter of Vegas.  Its embrace of modernity is evident from the moment you pull within view.

Upon entering the futuristic, metallic lobby, you'll notice a pleasant perfumed air.  I couldn't put my finger on what it was, or where it came from, but it definitely beat the smell of cigarettes and old people.

A security guard is posted in front of the elevators, requiring you to flash your room key for admittance.

The hallways are labyrinth-like, and split into separate pathways one too many times.  They keys are magnetic, so you just wave your room key in front of the doorknob.

The room we got (pretty standard one) was very clean, and sleek.  The sheets were amazingly soft too.  The bathroom had a 2-person shower and tub, which is standard for the newer hotels -- nothing outstanding.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to check out the pool, or dine at any of the restaurants. 

As it is currently one of the newest hotels, it is a bustling and loud place.  There is also a casino downstairs, but I would recommend staying away from the blackjack tables around check-in times because you'll probably be surrounded by players just killing time while waiting for their friends (which means they'll take the dealer's bust card, and have you walking with a stink face).

We went for lunch and there was a 45 minute wait!  It's so close to South Park Mall I feel it's probably rare that they are not on a wait on a Saturday or Sunday.  The menu offers such a wide variety of things from sushi, bento box combos, to hamburgers and shakes.  I love a good sushi roll, so I generally don't stray from that side of the menu.  My fiance had the turkey burger.  Amazing.  It was a typical burger with a goat cheese and sun-dried tomato toppings with micro greens that really set it apart.  He chose the sweet and spicy cucumbers as his side and they did not disappoint either.  I went with the Doug's filet roll.  It is topped with a seared rare filet and stuffed with crab, avocado, and cream cheese.  It was just ok.  I was hoping for something a little more wow, but it was a good roll.  (Different than your typical sushi).  They have a lamb roll and a bbq roll that I am dying to try, so I will be returning for sure.  

The only con to this place is the crowds.  It is good and large, so the wait tends to move a little quicker, but the waiting area isn't conducive for large crowds (luckily the bar has lots of room).  I love the concept of this place and the menu for its sheer difference to the rest of the restaurants in South Park.

Pros:
- Excellent service!
- I wasn't very hungry so I split my meal with my brother; courteously, they still gave us a whopping amount of appetizers
- Inexpensive prices (comparable to DOWNTOWN Toronto prices; granted, korean food typically isn't as expensive, they've marked it up $1-2, but you're in the heart of Toronto... what do you expect?) 
- It's pretty big - if you come in a small party, you'll get a booth. If not, they have tables and chairs for big parties. 
- Plays a variety of music (english, chinese, korean...) 

Cons:
- You're at the mercy of downtown parking (but that's a given if you're in Toronto to begin with)

Given its location, Kimchi Korea House doesn't offer anything exceptional compared to its competitors (literally within 5 minutes walking radius, there are so many other korean restaurants). Nonetheless, thumbs up for amazing service!",2013-06-01 23:45:35

Every single day they have drinks special, and some day food special. Like today is Blue Moon Pint $2 C'mon!!! Its great.
Food is also excellent. Fresh, tasty and sizable. I favor their Special K sandwich - it really is very good. Ask for them to wrap it for you instead on the bun. Good stuff.
They have inside and outside areas. Inside has 2 pool tables, bar and bunch of TVs. Outside is a nicely sized patio with a TV or 2. They do not mind if you smoke outside. 
Just a note - parking lot is usually really full and it may take you a bit to find parking. 

All in all CK's is a great place for lunch, dinner, watch a game and/or have a few.

I sent an email and the response I go is that they are ready, however the DMV says the Accessor office has not updated their system to make the two work....

So why the 4 stars???  

The new system which allows you to check in online to get your place in line is AWESOME...

You go on your computer and check-in, the system sends you a text on your phone telling you how many people are in front of you and approximately how long it will take.  When I checked in, the system told me there were 189 people in front of me and it would be approximately 3 1/4 hours.

Since I live about 10 minutes away from the DMV, I left the house and went to a place near the DMV to have lunch and relax.  The system allows you to request status updates as often as you like so I kept a watchful eye on the system.  When the system said there were 30 people in front of me and about 30 minutes left until my turn I decided to head on over and find a parking space.

Once parked, I went in and the system sent me a text saying I had about 19 minutes and should head on over. I waited approximately 20 minutes and my number was called with a counter location.  It took less then 5 minutes to renew my registration and I was on my way home.  The entire time took about 2 1/2 hours from start to finish.

I HIGHLY recommend using this system as it will allow you to run errands, eat lunch, shop, whatever you need to do instead of sitting at the DMV and your phone will keep you up to date on you place in line.",2014-10-02 00:42:18

The place is narrow like most downtown ramen places and theres someone shouting a greeting in Japanese as you walk in. We both went with the ramen cambo (a bowl of ramen plus an app). I got the original pork ramen with thick noodles and a mini chicken don. The don was good, the chicken had a charred aftertaste. 

The ramen however, was definitely not good. The portions are quite large and the price is okay for 10.99. The egg was delicious, with a semi-melty yolk and a strong tea flavour in the egg whites. The broth was salty however and just didn't taste that appetizing. The noodles were nothing special, they clumped together a lot which made it harder to eat. The pork was probably the worst, it was thick, rubbery and had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of plastic. 

The service was alright, but the server who gave us the bill charged us extra and when we asked about it she said that they charge every item separately and ""that's just how the bill works"". Okay but if we ordered 2 12.99 dishes, how is the subtotal 27.88 instead of 25.98? Like what? We had to flag down another server who actually realized the mistake and fixed it.

After staying in 2 other hotels over three days, this was the one I was looking forward to the most. Check in on a Saturday morning was busy, yet it all went very smoothly. They had enough lines open and clerks working, which is always a good thing. 

I was totally wowed after entering room 31-131. The curtains open, the TV turns on to some music, and the lighting comes up. 

The room had a view of the back of the CityCenter campus and Vdara. For a standard room, it's VERY roomy. I believe it's around 520 square feet of goodness. The bathroom area was equally as rich, with a BIG shower and tub (they are not combined, but located behind the same door), his and her sinks, and separate toilet area.

I love technology, so Control 4 was definitely a treat. You can literally control everything - the TV, curtains, lighting, temperature, making service requests, and even the Do Not Disturb sign - from the television as well as a small tablet located on the bedside table. Loved the Wake Up scheme, which opens the curtains and turns on the TV at whatever time you set in the morning. I also enjoyed the turndown service at night, since that big bed has a lot of comfortable pillows!!

My offer came with a comped buffet, so I went there for Sunday Brunch. I enjoyed it a lot, and would certainly go back. 

Service around the resort was top-notch. Everyone was very attentive and friendly, from the housekeepers, valet people, bartenders, Front Desk staff. CityCenter is massive and it WILL take a while to get your bearings, but once you do, it'll be easy to get on and off the Strip.

Anyhow, I wasn't expecting a five star establishment and when I got there it is what I would expect a milk tea cafe to resemble in HK.  The decor is bare minimum if that, as I think about it, this must be what ordering HK milk tea in HK must be like.  There was a tvb show being played on the tv.

The ambiance is pretty casual nothing to crazy going on but I do enjoy that they play music and have a tv to watch when dining alone. 

I choose to do al a carte I didn't wanna over stuff myself with food since my self control is terrible lol. But honestly the All you can eat (a.y.c.e) will be the best bang for your buck here. I only ordered 3 things and my bill still came out more then what I would of paid for if I had just done the all you can eat. I wish this place had lunch specials that would of been perfect. Bottom line is that the prices of individual rolls are expensive! 

The food was ok . I had a poke salad it was average small portion and I paid like 10 bucks for it so it wasn't worth it. The salmon roll was good! The sushi chief made it in world record time by the way lol ,and last I had the yellowtail sashimi the lack of flavors came in to play here .

Instead of several discreet dining areas, it is now one HUGE room, with tables and chairs too close together. The noise level alone at peak dining times makes dinner conversation impossible.
The food is 2-3 star level pseudo-Italian and the prices much higher than Rigatonys and other local Italian restaurants. The service varies from OK to dreadful. I rarely eat here anymore even though it is close to my home.

I was and am not let down every time I make the trip to Avon.  Full of sports memorabilia and several screens to watch whatever sports event is going on, it is so worth it.  My mom and grandma love the St. Louis ribs and my boyfriend is working his was through all of them.  Me, I go for the mac and cheese.  THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE   I HAVE HAD SO FAR!  I love the fried chicken too.  You can only get half or whole, and I swear they are Dolly Parton chickens!   The breasts are that big.  The deserts are killer too.

Bubba himself works here and will seat, cook, greet, and bus tables , which to me says a lot to this place and that  is that he is not just a name on the door.

They also do catering.  If I ever need a caterer, I'm going with them.

2-20-11 Update:

Not too happy with the place as of the date listed above.  We went  on the 20th to celebrate the boyfriends b-day and it was NOT a 5 star experience!  It was more like a 3, which is NOT normal for the place.  They were out of St. Louis ribs (they were in the smoker), there were no cornbread mini muffins (which it is worth going just for those) and they were out of both Sierra Mist and lemonade, which I find a little hard to believe.  Service left a lot to be desired, and yes they were busy, but I have been there when it has been slammed and had better service.  My mom had the fried chicken and her thigh was under cooked.  My grilled breast was a little dry, but the boyfriend said that his sliders were really good and grandma said the baby backs were very meaty.

A sign was posted looking for experienced help, so that may have been part of the problem.

Will this keep me from going back, no.  Every one has an off day.  If it keeps happening, yes I will stop going.",2011-02-17 16:11:14

I enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad while she had one of the paninis of the day. I was a little disappointed that the best they could offer for little people is a grilled cheese sandwich. Not that I'm looking for a whole litany of options and I understand that the point of this little bistro is that it's supposed to be a bit upscale, but if you're open for lunch in Surprise, a family-centered community, adding some kid friendly options might not be soooo bad and could help put butts in the seats during the weekday. 

I found the service to be nice but they were a little snooty when we first arrived and eyeballed my son. I thought overall service was slow considering what we ordered and the grilled cheese came out cold. It was not busy at all so not sure about the delay. The salad was just ok. The panini was just ok. Having patio dining was nice though. The wait staff warmed up when they saw how well behaved my boy was but first impressions are hard to take back.

After reading such rave reviews on Yelp about this place, I honestly felt it fell short from a lunch perspective.

I managed to pick up stuff for the women on my Christmas list this year, plus eyed some prospectives for the guys.

The most crowded areas are the food section, which I think is due to the sampling that are being offered.

I would probably recommend that you go earlier rather than later, since there are some artisans that are not local, so if they run out of stock - you might be out of luck.

Chicken soulvaki.  Chicken skewers with a tzatziki sauce on side with a bed of pilaf rice.

Spanakopita spinach:  Nice flaky pastry filled spinach and a hint of butter or even cream. Definet Yes!

Moussaka - Casserole of Roasted Eggplants, Potatoes, and Ground Beef Baked with Greek Bechamel Sauce and Kefalotiri Cheese. Good stuff
Pasticcio - Traditional Greek Baked Pasta with Rich Meat Sauce and Greek Bechamel with Kefalotiri Cheese. Like a lasagna with a layer of cheese.
Gyro - Shaved lambs. Perfect as usual.
Dolmades - Grape Leaves Stuffed with Seasoned Ground Beef and Herbs.  Ehhh something about eating the grape leaves.  It's not bad, but i can do without.
Also come with roasted potatoes, pita breads, and soup or salad.

They tasted as though the grease hadn't been changed in months and so I couldn't taste any of the toppings because the burnt old grease overpowered. It also claimed they had bacon on them but in reality it was just 1 giant piece. My friend got the sliders and they were pretty lame coming with only cheese on top. It was trivia night which was fun but it took so long and there was such a long amount of time between rounds.

My fiancé and I remember Blue Ribbon when it was strictly a sushi restaurant. A few months ago when we were in Vegas we wanted to go there for sushi and realized it no longer existed. It ended up going through a restructuring of its menu and now it's serves American fare. When Adam saw that menu, he wanted to dine there the first night. Since I was really craving sushi, we decided on Zuma for the first night (review posted below.) The second night, I knew he had his heart on Blue Ribbon so we dined there. We went to at about 6 PM on a Sunday night and were able to be seated right away. It was not very busy at all since we showed up early so we didn't need a reservation. I would recommend making one if you're planning to eat later in the evening. We were approached right away by our server, Mark. He did a wonderful job in explaining the menu's most popular items, the size of the servings, and checked up on us  just the right amount. Not so much that it was annoying, but often enough that if we needed something he was right there. We decided to get all dressed up and treat ourselves to some fancy Las Vegas food. I love the atmosphere. As soon as you walk in, it looks like swanky and hip meets classy and sophisticated. It is apparent that they worked very hard to revamp this place. I always loved it when I was a sushi restaurant, too. The only thing that seems familiar about the venue is the bathroom. Once we sat down, took our photos, breathed in the ambience of the place, and studied the menu - we realized that we were both starving. A full day at the pool with very little to eat made us want to order almost everything on the menu. We decided to start out with the wedge salad. It was absolutely delicious. They also bring out bread with the most delicious tasting better. I highly recommend splurging on that. Adam ordered the PuPu platter which was a mix of wings, shrimp, ribs, and a few other delicious items. I got the salmon served with mashed potatoes, veggies, topped with potato crisps. All photographed below. Because we were starving, we shared everything and it was the perfect amount of food. We were full and knew we were not going to get dessert, but I asked for the menu anyway. We didn't order anything so I don't know how it tasted, but I wasn't really impressed with the dessert menu. Overall, this is a perfect Las Vegas dining experience. Complete with excellent service, a good variety of food items, and a great atmosphere. Enjoy!.",2017-07-31 20:30:43

Their chashu pork, although not very flavorful, is still pretty tasty. On my second visit, I got the idea to order the seared chashu and add it to my ramen. Yummy! They should totally have this option for toppings. The noodles were thinner in the tonkatsu but I didn't mind it. You probably can request the thicker noodles. A nice plus is that you can get a refill of noodles (kaedama) for only $1.50.

My friends and I went on a Friday and surprisingly the line was not too bad. We ordered the pierogies, kluski slaski, and salatka. They have a decent amount of seating, so don't be alarmed by the lime. The restaurant interior has a really nice hip vibe with lots of fresh flowers. 

The kluski slaski, which were the potato dumplings, were very good. The sauce they were in was very flavorful and made the dish. The potato dumplings alone were bland, but all the elements of the meaty mushrooms, cool dill sauce, and warm broth made an excellent bite. The pierogies were also delicious. Their dough was the perfect consistency. The salad was also an interesting mix as it had potatoes and fennel in it. 

Overall, each dish was satisfying and you could never once tell they were vegan. Beware though, if you do not like dill steer clear of Apteka. Every dish had dill in it. Their prices are also very reasonable. A good option for vegans and vegetarians! We need to see more restaurants like this in Pittsburgh.",2017-09-02 03:21:09

Zipps is a solid, down-to-earth place with many food, drink, and seating options, where you don't feel like you're being stared up and down.  Mad bonus points for allowing the option of half-and-half when you can't decide between fries and onion rings alongside your burger or sandwich.  

I must deduct one star for the pizza-by-the-slice, which reminded me of the frozen pizza you buy at Costco, on account of the completely flavorless dry-ish crust.  Plus, the toppings literally slid right off, as though the pizza had been baked and then the toppings were sprinkled on as an afterthought (guess that's how they get away with selling pizza by the slice with any combination of toppings you can think of).  All in all, I do like Zipps and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laid-back happy hour or night out.  Just stay away from the pizza.",2008-01-30 00:50:57

Igot house original broth both times I went, but this time the broth seemed more flavorful that I didnt even bother going to the sauce station. We got the beef and lamb combo. The meats were soft and tender as they should be.

From the dimly lit chandelier and old fashioned wallpaper to the scrolls rolled down to feature the specials, to the knives and cleavers hanging near the entrance, to the cleaver draft handles, down to the ladder behind the bar to access numerous bourbons and scotches ... the speakeasy-lodge atmosphere just works. Rustic, hip, trendy yet timeless all in one.
We sat at the bar on a Saturday night, and Allison was a terrific bartender. She was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and made our first experience here great! Every cocktail we tried was fresh, balanced, and creative yet classic. She offered us a list of the available bourbons also, which was nice to browse through. 
The food we tried was delicious. We decided to try some new things we've never had before, the main one being bone marrow! (Alison helped convince us to try it!) We both enjoyed it- buttery texture with the sea salt, on top of oxtail jam- very interesting yet yummy. I would get it again and look forward to trying bone marrow at other places now that I know I like it. We also got the pig candy. You must try this here! Sweet, salty, and lick-the-plate delicious. We also got the dry aged tartare plate - and were very pleased ... So many flavors combined together.

Mario's the type of person who can eat a moderate sized meal and be full for hours; I, however, am hungry within an hour of eating.

The food itself was good. We started with the Sweet Sriracha fries. They were pretty good and we devoured them before our burgers arrived. While many of the specialty burgers sounded great, we opted to build our own burgers. My bacon (of course) and jalapeno cheese burger, with dill pickles and spinach was perfectly cooked to medium. It wasn't greasy, which was pleasant.

Service was attentive without being suffocating. Yeah, it felt like we waited a while to get our food. But it was also incredibly fresh, so compromise.

YpOsD0KJmXe5ewphmH0VfA,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,yooVq4aUUthr7DOQiZ7yEA,4,7,4,5,"Jolly Beans is the coffee shop and cafe of Inspirada. It is in the center of the community's Solista Park, the wide strip of parkland bordering Via Firenze. As the sole business in the newly built Inspirada community, the coffee shop and cafe relies on the local community and word of mouth for business. The signage that coffee shops take for granted is nonexistent here. Jolly Beans has to abide by the strict development guidelines of Inspirada. With that said, if it weren't for Yelp I would be unaware that it exists and would not have been looking for it when I hiked the trails winding through Inspirada. As a matter of fact I would of mistaken it for a community office. 

  Always up for a quality cup of Joe, I took some time out from the chili December weather to relax in a community coffee shop and cafe. Where it looks small from the outside, it is a roomy business inside that includes two seating areas with the counter in the center. I walked into a Christmasy scene where a Christmas tree and decorations were an inviting welcoming. This is the smaller seating area with a couple of sofa seats and counter seats. As I progress further into the building leaving the small panhandle seating area, I was enveloped in an electic environment. There was a wooden floor (could be imitation) bordered by grey walls adorned with famous suspension bridges. The tables carried the wooden theme of the floors. On the tables were interesting knickknacks including an owl. The wall on the right featured a community board with all the events and happenings in Inspirada. There were complimentary board games to play and magazines to peruse. I'd make use of the complimentary WiFi.  The one thing missing inside were restrooms. The restrooms were in the connected building to the right near the outside patio that includes a mini Henderson public library in a box. 

   Jolly Beans offers a diverse menu. The offerings include coffee, smoothies, sandwich wraps, Chad latte, mocha tea latte, paninis, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and pastries. 

  Their offerings now include a $2.49 bowl of chicken noodle soup. Plus there is a 15% off Yelp check-in offer. It is interesting how a $2.49 came out to over $2.60 with a 15% Yelp check-in offer. Oh well!  It was a decent chicken noodle soup in a small to go cup. 

  The main thing that brought me in the doors was a small cup of coffee. I call it the mystery blend owing to the fact that I have seen zero reference to the brew they use. It is a delectable mystery blend. 

  Spending time here was enjoyable. I really felt like I was spending time in a small community in another valley far away from Las Vegas. When you look at the neo-traditional urban design of Inspirada where porches face Via Firenze with cars placed in garages off alleyways, Jolly Beans was time spent in a small community coffee shop. 

   I am rating Jolly Beans 4 stars for a few reasons. First, Jolly Beans provides a necessary service to Inspirada that is a third place coffee shop for locals to meet up. Second, without a  physical advertising presence it needs a justified good word of mouth. And third, Jolly Beans is a Jolly good coffee shop and cafe. .",2016-12-27 04:20:23

Day 001
I arrived a little early maybe 3 or 4. We got a meet up point and then started to explore. We ran into some food trucks and decided to taste some things. I got the lumpia from Oming's. They were tiny but good. Then headed over to main stage to check out X Ambassadors. They were so fun and even brought out Dan from Imagine Dragons. After that I was a little hot so got some water and even some ice from the bar. I laid down in the grass where Milagro was a rested a little. Meet up with some friends and checked out some art and even did a little swinging on the blue and yellow swings by the twisted lemonade stand. We eventually made our way over to Ambassador stage for Lindsey Stirling. Before she came on I grab some more food from Truck U BBQ. I had the pulled pork and fries burrito. It was really good but also really greasy. After I ran over to meet some friends at Place. One of the only places with real bathrooms, however when i went on Friday the smelled like poop. Maybe a backup? Not sure. We then found a cool spot in the grass by Ambassador stage near the water station to relax and get a little drink on. There was a yogurt/alcohol place which was very god but i totally forgot the name. There was also Gimme Some Sugar which had big birthday cake macaroons and sugar cookies. Just the sugar I needed to finish out my night. We finished out the night with Major Lazer and they were probably my favorite act the entire weekend. 

Day 002
I wanted to go early and see Alessia Cara at 3 but didn't our affairs in order in enough time. I dropped my friends off around 3:45 and went back to home base to take a nap. I was a little drained from Friday. After getting a little extra sleep and waiting for the sun to go away I made my way down to downtown. I started by heading over to the food! I was hungry. I decided to try Garden Grill which was my favorite food vendor. I had the cesar wrap and beer battered avocado tacos. The wrap was whatever but the tacos were the bomb.com!!!! I liked them on facebook and gonna keep on eye out for them. My first artist this day to watch was Chance The Rapper. His set was cool. Good way to start the night. I made my way over to Troubadour stage to check out Jauz and What So Not. Jauz had a really cool set with awesome shark and game animation. What So Not was cool too. Like everyone else i made my way over to Snoop Dogg and started watching his set. Near the middle I think I was getting a contact high from all the weed so I needed to step out. I went to the street to get some air then said fuck it and grabbed an iced lemonade from The Lab I believe. I was a little down when they didn't have any cotton candy left but I understand. Made my way to the end of Snoop and tried to make my way back to my friends and his set ended. I was stuck in a crowd and they wanted out. I had never felt so claustrophobic. I stood behind and pole and waited for it to be over. I made my way to Carnage to end day 2. #CHIPOTLEGANG 

Day 003
SO.. I'm not saying security sucks or anything but we made our way in with a bottle of Rum for the last day. Started the day by getting a bandanna from Toyota. They dipped in ice water which felt amazing on the hot day. We then checked out the Art Motel. What a wonder sight to see. Each room set up different and I even got a drone show to Mr. West. After we stopped by Twisted Lemonade to get some drinks to mix. Iordered the purple death. It a mix of all 3 flavors. So delicious. We then made our way to Walk The Moon. After this band we made our way back to Twisted to get more lemonade. There was a long line so I took the chance and ran to the bathroom at Place. It smelt a little better on the last day. I ran back and my friend had got me a refill, score. We walked and then seperated near the Wide Awake boat. I made my way to container Park to check out Kat Graham. I did not know before Vampire Diaries she was a back up dancer. She's got some moves. Also while there i found panties on the ground. It must have got wild. I made my way back to Ambassador for Run The Jewels and Kygo. My friend hooked it up with a VIP pass. I laid in the grass and enjoyed me some music. My brother also got to come and enoy the last day with us. He gave me his card and asked to grab some beers. You would think VIP would be on it but this was not the case. I waited in a line and when I got to the front the guy walked away.. No ill be back or just give me a moment. He just left. I was a little irritated but okay. He comes back and take some other guys order and is spilling booze and stumping around. WORST BARTENDER. He's lucky the guy who order he took instead of mine bought my drinks too. I was then going to head to Kendrick but my friends got sick so we left.

As other reviewers warned the menu is poorly placed to your back when ordering, there are no trays to carry your drinks to your table, which you have to do yourself, for water they give you a bathroom sized Dixie cup, you can buy water but it's Costco/Kroger bottled water, no fountain soda only skinny glass bottles of Coke and Sprite. 

Ordered the ribs ""sauce on the side"". And the kitchen thought that meant extra sauce on the side. They weren't bad ribs. Nice if you like something plain. 

We also got a cheeseburger, which came without French fries, and NO taste!  I was shocked that the title dish was so bad. The waitress was walking around and asked how my burger was. I said it had no taste and she said ""sorry to hear that"" and walked away.

G-Mart on Independence Blvd is much better in price and freshness, but this place is usually more accessible for me.  (This one is Vietnamese, G-mart is Korean, perhaps a showdown is in order)

It must have something to do with all the Midwest transplants who now call AZ their home (we must be doing something right out here!) So when I learned about Jimmy's, I was excited to try my next slice of Chicago-style eating. 

When I first walked in, it reminded me of a family style restaurant I would visit with my parents and friends on a Friday night. It was cozy, quaint and bustling with happy visitors and friendly staff. We sat in the bar area and I liked to see how locals of all kinds gather here. It's nice to see a local restaurant like this in Gilbert. The staff was friendly -- a little slow, but it was TGIF for me it didn't matter as much. 

We started with calamari which was just enough to get the metabolism going for a solid meal. The fat kid inside of me begged me to try the Chicago-style beef sandwich and I still wish I had. Next time, Jimmy. But instead, I ordered a personal pizza...which I guess isn't much healthier? Oh well. But, each meal came with a salad which made me feel ""healthier."" My pizza was good! It was a nice size for one or two and I shared because sharing is caring yelpers. The dough was fresh, the cheese oozed and the pepperoni was spot on. I caught a glimpse of the beef sandwich and like I said...it glared at me for not ordering it. 

The environment was charming as it was obvious everyone was having a good time. While the game played in the background, I could tell that this is a fun neighborhood restaurant to visit when in the area --- or if you feel like a little evening drive!

So in summary, Jimmy's is a family-fun environment, with a bar in case you left the kids at home and true to Chicago cuisine according to a Nor Cal girl, so take it with a grain of SF salt.

I have a big appetite, so my only complaint is that the portions are a bit small even after you upsize with the extra noodles.

I love asian food and was eager to try another noodle joint out! However, I can't say that this is my favorite noodle joint in Pittsburgh and this is why. 

While many items on the menu caught my eye (i.e. duck/pork belly sliders, pineapple fried rice and the thai basil chicken), I had to get the thai style flat noodle with shrimp. It's a noodle place and it only made sense to try something that resides in the name of the restaurant, right? Thai dishes are typically spicy on their own, but you can add some extra kick with their spice level of 1-5. I wanted to give mine a spice level of 2, but our waitress said she would just bring out extra sauce if it wasn't spicy enough for me. When my dish came out, I was very satisfied with the amount of noodles and the size of the shrimp, but once I took my first bite I became let down. The noodles were very doughy/overcooked and the dish was not spicy. Our waitress brought out a mixture of chili paste/sriracha to turn up the heat and it did help! I also ordered a mango smoothie bubble tea and this was probably the best bubble tea I have had in Pittsburgh.

For a basic facial $79, and they have really good promotions that put a $99 facial at $79 for me today. The only difference is the scalp massage which she didn't do, and feet/hands massage and two masks. 

The only problem I have is that when I say massage, for me, someone who can only feel something when the person digs into me, the pressure was way too light. I mentioned this to her, and she explained that they are not trained for deep tissue massage. I also felt maybe her hands were not strong enough. 

However, she did put a bit more pressure into it after I said something. It wasn't like the tickle feather massages that I've had before, although not ideal, still very good. 

I have to say that my skin is very clean, and I didn't get the pimples that pop up after the facial as usual. They were very through in the extractions, but it's worth it.

After looking for a place to grab a bite and some drinks and chill for a bit, my friends and I stumbled across this place on Ossington that luckily had a table available for us.

The space/decor is absolutely lovely- low lighting, gorgeous chandelier, that rustic but high class look. The kitchen is open so you can watch the hustle and bustle back there.

We ordered a few apps to share as we just wanted to nibble on a few things.

We had the fries, the mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts.

I didn't eat the brussel sprouts as they have pork in them and I don't eat pork - but my friends liked the dish.  The sweetness of the sprouts when cooked balanced out the pork (according to them).

The fries were...well fries.  Nothing particularly special.

Now the mac and cheese.  Ummm hello...why is this only an app and not a main dish?!!  This is not like your regular mac & cheese.  It's a lobster mac & cheese but without the noodles - they use orzo!  It's a light creamy dish with hints of this lovely citrus flavour coming through for that slight tang aftertaste.   It's comfort food without the heaviness. I embarrassingly licked that plate clean.  Loved it.  LOVED it.   

The dinner menu is short and sweet - just the way I like it.  About 7-9 choices if I remember correctly for mains.  I was tempted to try the braised beef cheeks but we were eating at around 9pm and I didn't want something heavy so late (yeah I'm old...lol)

Fruit flies were in season and they probably did what they could but they were everywhere. It would have been best for them not to sit anyone near the east wall. One decided to go swimming in a freshly served beer. Another ended dive bombing into a glass of water.

Nonetheless, we trudged on. We haven't been back since ... forever. Not sure why - it wasn't the fly last time - for sure.

OK to the food. We ordered the antipasti with crostini, a pizza, and something else (wasn't memorable I guess.)
The antipasti was a few slices of cold cuts and stale bread. No figs, no cheese, just a few olives. For what the price was, we could have bought the whole package of prosciutto.
The pizza was pretty good - a main stay for them.
The manager realized that we are not doing well and did his best but when it comes down to it, it is the food and atmosphere and not the conversation that makes the restaurant. If I want to chat, I'd go to confession.
BTW - I don't believe that the fly was doing a backstroke!

This happened at the end of July but I thought it was worth posting.",2015-10-19 23:56:52

I was a little discouraged at first, because of seating, but there were plenty of booths, tables and the bar to sit. We ordered some wings and a burger. The waitress was very attentive, the wings came out fast. The wings were very good. I recommend the strawberry hot wings. And if you just want to try a few wings, they sell them individually! The burger was also cooked perfectly. My hubby and I split the burger and a dozen wings. They even split the burger and divided it on two plates.

The Butcher Block offers some damn good BBQ burgers. The patties weigh in at 1/2 pound each, which is great. One patty is good enough to fill a person [which is great for me, because it's less grilling that I have to do =p]. Put some cheese, bacon, and crispy onions - and you have one hell of a burger. The price is a bit high for my liking at 4.99/lb, but it's just too good not to buy. 

My first trip there, I ordered about a pound of the hot carne asada. It had the perfect amount of heat, at least for me anyway. I'm one of those people who LOVE LOVE LOVE spicy food, but am too wimp to handle it. So, this carne asada was perfect for me. Wasn't too spicy in the beginning, but slowly builds up to a tolerable heat as you keep eating. Any food that does, is a winner to me. To you lucky ones who can handle the spicy foods, it may not be hot enough for you. 

What I think I love most about the butcher block is not only do they offer your traditional meats [pork,chicken,beef], they also offer a selection of not so traditional stuff. Elk, wild boar, gator, buffalo, & more. So all the things that you've always wanted to try [or that I've at least wanted to try !] are available. 

And if that isn't enough - they also offer Boar's Head products, a variety of cheese, and you can even order sub sandwiches from them. I also noticed they have an offering of side dishes if you so choose to get those along with your meat. The only things I can remember off the top of my head were the potato salad & stuffed mushrooms... although there was more of a selection. I think I remember seeing asparagus, but don't quote me on that. 

All in all - a great place to go for some fresh meat or [and I can't stress this enough] some amazing BBQ burgers. The owner seems friendly enough, just as other people say in their reviews - but I personally haven't had a chance to talk with him. But, I'm sure I'll have the opportunity.

I don't think this bakery has very good attention to detail.  They spelled my child's name wrong and I was glad I caught it upon pickup but removing the extra letter resulted in some damage to the cake and the name ended up off center.  The 2D Elmo I asked them to create was very simple, however, what they created looked creepy with red rings about the upper edge of the eyes, so it looked like Elmo had a rough night.  They left a lot of weird looking white powder on the gum paste bow that I asked them to clean off during pickup and I was told they couldn't clean it all off.  They also left some running dye trails on the back of the cake that I asked them to wipe when I picked up, but one still managed to be missed and made it to the party.  Finishing touches like that really make or break a cake for me so I do not recommend them for custom cakes.

I have to say, though, the red velvet cake was delicious - very moist and the cream cheese frosting was divine.  Somehow even the fondant even tasted good.

John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated ""this is competition meat"".

So I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!

Opened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.

Anyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.

It's true.  Yes I have managed to review over 400 places before ever trying Thai food.  Weird, right?  Anyway, my New Year's Resolution this year was to be more adventurous when it came to dining, and I am determined to embrace that resolution.  I'm doing really well so far, I mean, I ate Thai food!

As we were walking in, I started freaking out a little bit, because when I get scared of food, I order something really lame, and then I get really grumpy.  I kept telling myself that this was just a different version of Chinese food, which I love.  Once we got inside, I had to stifle the laughter upon seeing the epic tables.  Each one could literally seat 10 people.  They don't have anything smaller.  Seriously.  Anyway, we sat down and were kind of ignored for a while, got menus, got ignored, got drinks, ordered, got ignored, got food, ignored again, paid, then left.  You get the idea here?  The service is pretty horrendous.  

I didn't know what to order, and I found myself gravitating towards familiar things.  I told myself that ordering familiar would be pointless, so I went with Beef Pad See Yew.  I was definitely avoiding the spicy after seeing the table next to us sweating and crying after eating some soup that was a level 3.  Sheesh!  Once my dish (beef, broccoli, fat rice noodles, and bean sprouts) came out, I pretty much devoured what I could.  the portions were huge, and I ate about half.  It was really good!  I still don't know what I think of Thai food, but I did eat the leftovers the next day and still enjoyed them.

I noticed the sauces on the table which I would learn I would need to use in order to give this chicken any taste.

Our food arrived in about ten minutes and was delivered by one of the staff who was very nice. I was excited to try my sandwich and decided to try the honey chipotle sauce. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. There was really no flavor to the chicken even with their ""special sauce"" and the honey chipotle. The bun was soft and the veggies were fresh but I have had better chicken sandwiches elsewhere! There was a generous serving of shoestring fries which were hot and crispy. The meal also came with cole slaw which had a weird vinegar taste....(not my style).

I would like to thank the young man who came by a couple of times to check on us and to see if we needed anything. He also promptly cleared our table when we were done. He was the highlight of our visit and deserves to be commended for providing great service.

Perhaps I picked an off day as I had planned on this meal being delicious, but instead I will stick with Popeyes or Canes for good chicken at a decent price!",2015-09-03 00:07:20

When this place opened, it took me a long time to try it. Not sure why. Maybe the location and parking? Maybe because it's in what appears to be an old single family home converted to a restaurant? Who knows. All I do know is, I should have just gone because when I finally did, I was so impressed. 

First visit we sat at the bar for dinner. Our bartender was great. Chatty and attentive but not in your face. We both ordered ramen, different kinds. SO. GOOD. I am pretty picky with ramen. Texture of eggs, ingredients thrown in, the flavoring - it was all perfect. I was really happy with my selection. 

My second visit was for brunch. I wasn't sure what the menu would have for brunch as I typically only associate ramen and the like with dinner. We had bacon dumplings, the omurice (rice omelette) and the biscuits and tonkotsu gravy. Everything was really good! 

I definitely recommend Umami!",2017-10-13 16:32:32

Everything I've ever tried here has been just great, to the point where I've picked up takeout for the family on my way home several times. Their food is always fresh. They cook to order so if you just stroll in, you will have to wait a short bit. Worth it, though. My only gripe- they will charge you for chili, chili oil, extra soy, etc... To the point where the all-business cashier (a short Asian lady with bangs and a bob) will not budge and WILL run your card for 25 cents if you don't have any cash on ya.

The buildout of the space is gorgeous. The staff friendly and attractive. The food though, is dismal.

I had hoped for a more high-end fine dining Mexican food experience. Unfortunately, this food doesn't even rise to the level of the fast food Mexican joint in the food court of the same hotel.

The trio of guacamoles is interesting and probably the best thing here, but none is exceptional. Our enchiladas were overcooked to the point they were just mush. My wife had the fish tacos which were unexceptional. 

The steak tacos deserve a special mention. If you ever find yourself in need of material to repair your shoe, I would recommend the meat from these tacos since it would take a chainsaw to permeate it. I called the server over and demonstrated how you could stretch the meat to 3x its size and it would snap back into its original shape. The server asked the chef who told her he only uses whatever cut he uses. My guess is that it was the lowest grade approved for human consumption. This is odd since the best beef to be found in the city is less than 1,000 feet southeast of this restaurant. If we had paid, we would have asked not to - something that has happened maybe once in 3 years.

This is too bad. They have everything they need here to make a landmark restaurant... Location, staff, buildout... (That's why it gets two stars instead of one), but the food sucks. It doesn't even rise to ""taco truck"" level. I feel nothing but sorrow and despair for those that have given this restaurant 4 and 5 star reviews - it is baffling. I've been here twice.

I have a very serious allergy to fish. I know as such that it is a risk to go to any ""ethnic"" place. However, its always worked out that if I tell them in advance that ""hey, if you serve me fish I am going to die"" that 99% of places step up. While I loathe our ultra litigious society (and thus I am a self loathing lawyer) when it comes to this sort of thing, my ilk has got it right. If they try to kill you, sue the hell out of them.

Tonight we were at a loss what to get for dinner. But wait, Thai E-San has done us right in the past, the food isn't greasy, and its pretty good though not authentic in any shape or form to Isan food.

We called in our to go order, and not once, not twice, but three times we told the woman on the phone to make sure that the spring rolls were vegetarian. Get it home, open it up, and low and behold its shrimp egg rolls. 

I've learned over the years that if the food in the bag has fish on it, all of the food has fish on it. I can't afford to be down 5 days right now because someone can't get the order right over the phone.

What it really came down to was that at the same time someone phoned in a $150 order when we ordered our food. They made a conscious choice to go with the bigger order and to mess up an order of a regular. 

Well, that's pretty simple for me. Won't ever going back in there. Ended up wasting $40 on dinner that I can't eat or smell. Awesome. I'd tell anyone who asks if you're looking for Thai in Phoenix, go anywhere else.",2011-08-05 03:37:25

He then reaches into a bag o' buns and pulls it out with his bare hands, stabs it with burger and cheese identifying toothpicks, and tosses them on a flat grill surface to toast. Then he grabs his spatula and continues to flip.

The burgers move around the heat according to their done-ness, and the chicken goes where the burger was, the pineapple goes where the chicken was....get my point? If it wasn't cooked, maybe some would be worried about cross-contamination.

Anyway, the burger was AWESOME. I thought it was juicy and had good flavor. It looked like he sprinkled season salt on it--I could be wrong. I love a ton of condiments, so I really appreciated having a bar of them to myself. The lettuce was lacking--just a hacked up iceberg with some not so yummy parts, but everything else was what I wanted and more.

I was hoping for a more modern peek into the gangster lifestyle. Luckily, there was a decent display on my era's gangster - John Gotti. They had his jacket and info on his life and death. A cool section was right at the end also where a giant lounge was created to watch clips of the great mafia movies of all time. I also liked the part where normal guys talked about accidently running into mob figures. Also, worth seeing in my mind was the ""Mob's Greatest Hits"" section which contained graphic photos of all the ways these guys bit the dust and stories of things I grew up with like ""where is Hoffa"" and all the rackets these mafiosa's were corrupting. 
    The entire top floor can basically be skipped unless you want a history of the building of the Hoover dam and how Las Vegas was settled.

Make sure you get a photo of you in the lineup or at the machine gun. Interactive exhibits needed some work. 
   It's worth the $10 locals price and does give you some insight into the mob activities, but the fact that Gotti and others besides Siegel and Lansky are touched upon, makes the difference.

But regional proximity to Island Foods gave me a chance to stop in for the first time in years. This time, instead of takeout I even ate in the restaurant.
The place hasn't changed from what I remember. Not that that is a bad thing, as consistency in the restaurant game is actually a good thing, especially when you are coming back somewhere for the first time in a while... 
Basically the east side of the building has the counter you walk up and order from, and then wait for your food at. There are a handful of tables filling up that area otherwise, and then the entire west side of the building is more seating as well. It's a no frills looking place which is further enforced with the use of the styrofoam plates you're served with even if dining in (although they did at least provide metal cutlery, which promptly cut right through said styrofoam).

I had the boneless chicken curry roti, with spinach added. It was pretty darn good, especially good with the hot sauce served on the side (seriously, that hot sauce is great). I'll admit their rotis aren't the biggest and the wrap itself isn't the best versus other competitors, but it is a solid meal and quite delicious, and they might just have some the best pricing out of the bunch. 1 curry chicken roti w/ added spinach and a bottle of Heineken comes in just over $15 after tax, which is a pretty good deal. 

I'm still going to stick to my usual roti place, but it was nice to switch it up, and will say its the best of the ""east of Dufferin"" roti shops I know. And they get the bonus points of actually having parking behind the building.",2016-04-26 13:49:25

The owner was a delight and his kindness and enthusiasm is what set this dining experience so far apart from the rest. There's an abundance of pride and attention to detail here that is evident from the minute you walk in.

They offer cream soda (free with check-in), tasty desserts, table games, a plethora of condiments, classic commercials on the tube, and a lovely antique mall next door to aid in the burning of those buns afterwards. Just a few of my favorite things, which kinda makes me feel like this place was created just for me.

I'm shocked that Willy's has existed for four years without my knowing. It truly is a gem and offers a nostalgic dose of deliciousness that I'm so thankful to Yelp to have found. I will most certainly be back!",2013-02-08 04:42:18

The Good: 

1. Service- Every time we went there it was busy and we received very good service and our servers were knowledgeable about the beer.  Speaking of beer: 
2. Beer- Hands down best beer selection in Old Town! They also make a killer Moscow Mule =) 
3. Belgiun Fries- Come on, trice fried fries... how can you go wrong! I also love all their sauce options.  
4. The atmosphere- Perfect spot in Old Town, especially now that it is cooling down.  I also love the graffiti mural on the wall, the owner said they will be randomly having local artist paint the wall. Great idea! 

The forgettable: 

1. Pretzel - its okay, nothing special, I was expecting it to knock my socks off... they stayed on! 
2. Vegan- While I am very grateful of them having a vegan option, it was tasty but very hard to eat because it kept falling apart... they need to work on making a vegan brat!

I scheduled 2 appointments and on the second appointment (which I brought my family) I was given a new consultant. She was very sweet and I did end up saying ""yes to the dress"". I received a call a few weeks earlier than expected that my dress was in- I was ecstatic! I went in to get my dress and it was in horrible condition!! The jewels were falling off the threads, there were BLUE stains under the armpits and it looked dirty...it honestly looked like it had been worn. I asked if the dresses came in new and they reassured me they are all brand new and come from their warehouse in Washington DC. I was so disappointed in the dress that I did not take it and requested a new one to be shipped out. A couple weeks later, I get a call saying it was in and I could pick it up. This time, I took my mom and sister with me to pick up the dress. It looked great! 

Alterations- the main lady is really rude just FYI!! For my first fitting, my mom, sister and I went and while she was pinning and tucking away- she literally told us to be quiet! Are you kidding me?! We weren't being that loud- just enjoying our time together. Second time around she wasn't there and dealt with someone else. Alterations were good- just really expensive. They also do a complimentary steam- which we waited about a week before the wedding to do. All in all, they have beautiful dresses here for good prices so it's worth a look.

     The restaurant has a wonderful storied past that goes back to 1918 when Guarino's started out as a bar and pool hall. Vincenzo Guarino met Mary Lomparo and eventually married and together transformed the bar into a full service Sicilian restaurant replete with trumpet vines in the rear patio garden. Their son Sam and his wife Marilyn were responsible for decorating the restaurant in the Victorian style later on in 1963 that characterizes the restaurant today. Family friend Nancy Phillips owns and operates the restaurant today with her children Scott and Rachel.
      The calamari is the star appetizer on the menu which comes with their sweet red marinara sauce, a must have staple item to try. Many of the dishes are old world inspired such as the lasagna and penne. They feature special items daily like the Chicken Pacifico  which was superb. The list of wines is not extensive but the prices are very reasonable. The tiramisu is old world inspired as emphasized by the cake and not the creme or espresso. They also feature their signature wedding soup which was very fresh and delicious. 
     We actually had an awkward experience recently there. Most recently around New Years Day 2016, their we asked their night bartender if he could make a Gypsy kiss. He had never heard of it and didn't have all the ingredients but created an improvised version of it and renamed it the New Orleans kiss, with B and B in it. Not bad. He then made sizeable batches of it and began sharing it with the guests that very evening. So that was a bit odd. :/
     On Saturdays, there is a piano player and vocalist that does forties era jazz vocal standards. 
     Parking is free! Guarino's is a must stop in Little Italy.",2014-11-03 13:51:08

JABURRITOS hit the spot for me and the fiancé tonight.  Craved sushi but didn't want to go to a busy sushi restaurant.  I've seen places like this in Cali so I'm happy to see they've finally brought it to Vegas.   

All the guys working there are super friendly and they will help you out if you have any questions about the menu.   

The ordering is similar to chipotle/subway where they make it in front of you.  
The fish is fresh and they are generous with the condiments.  You can choose to customize it if you'd like or opt for a salad instead of a burrito.  If you want to ""make it a combo"" it includes a drink and you add a side salad, chips or, mochi.  The side salad was seaweed and I was craving cucumber salad, which they didn't have but the chef gave me some sauces to make it ... awesome !

The middle was cold, and the cheese was hardly melted.  The waffles were tasty and abundant, and the veggie frittata was my favorite - eggs fluffy,with a great, fresh vegetable mix, and the crust was moist and flaky (in the good way).  The portions are large and in charge.  I also had to get the macadamia nut latte again.  I really wish it came in larger sizes - it's really my new favorite latte.

oebf669s7F6l9lIe0eObVA,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,Eg_M8eeu9SDEdbP7iUmVbQ,5,22,14,13,"Dateline 1995: I am a student with no girlfriend at the University of Pittsburgh. All that stands across from Hillman Library is a hot dog cart, a Chinese food truck, and a shaved ice vendor. 

Dateline 2012: I'm a warehouse laborer with a girlfriend who works for a mortgage lender. She picks me up on Friday evening, and without a plan in mind, I direct her towards The Porch. I am shocked at how built-up Schenley Drive now is. I am particularly mesmerized at this strange, new, Modernist/Art Deco restaurant we are about to enter, even more so over the fact that it is owned by Eat 'n Park, that ubiquitous local chain eatery staple we either adore or despise.

The Porch's bill of fare is somewhat small, but each item is intriguing enough to make deciding on what to order difficult.

Kay wanted the Farm Bread as an appetizer. I volleyed between Pork Belly and Shrimp & Grits before landing on the latter. Kay still wanted the inexpensive Farm Bread, so we ordered both and did not regret doing so. 

The grits were closer to a buttery polenta, a golden pool of richness that the sublimely sauteed shrimp floated atop of. Kale finished off the plate, and I finished it all off in minutes, rationing chunks of the meaty shrimp, dragging them through the polenta and from there, mouth-ward, savoring the creamy, the juicy, the oceanborne, the elegantly Southern. 

Onto something straight from the early morning hours: Farm Bread. According to our bubbly, youthful student server whose name I cannot recall, everything is housemade, including the large sheets of white bread, and the honey butter, apple butter, and jam that come with it in small, metallic ramekins. The bread had a chewy, flour-dusted hide as well as plush innards that seemed to nearly evaporate. This is not bread one wolfs down with eggs, however. Instead, you break off pieces from the massive cuts, slather them with each of the three amazing condiments: one sweet, one sweet and lardy, and one tart enough to enliven the dead before slowly partaking. 

Successfully resisting the allure of the fiery oven which promised choice pizza, or the fact that their burgers are freshly ground on the premises, I went with the Duck Legs. Oily, briny, skin crisping, meat melting, they sat on a bed of two potato galettes, each imbibed with the essence of the humbly mystical parsnip, flanked by a gaggle of flowery chanterelles, and lying in a potent puddle of Sherry reduction. 

As I ate...slowly, relishing what was before me, I had to keep telling myself  that the same company responsible for the Superburger was also behind one of the most ornately gourmet entrees I have ever had. 

And if that didn't suffice, clots of foie gras, something I'd never had before until Friday night, were strewn across the entirety of the dish.Their angelic, salty, smooth decadence left me wanting so much more. This wasn't just a dinner; this was a gift to those who love food. 

Kay's Chicken Roti defeated her. The rotiserrie chicken came with a cube of Hazlenut dressing, fennel sausage, apple chunks, and a demi-glace of roasted shallots. The dressing, called a ""bread pudding,"" was ethereal. The chicken breast I finished for Kay was unbelievably moist and supple. Traditionalists, take heed. This is your dish at Porch. 

Our duo of desserts were exemplary but hard to finish. My brick-sized Chocolate Bread Pudding had only a hint of chocolate, the better to focus on the heavenly heft of the sweet stuffing itself. A compelling case for the reuse of stale bread had been made and was topped with a colossal scoop of SCRATCH whipped cream that almost had the consistency of gelato. Raisins garnished the plate beautifully and palatably. 

Kay's Chocolate Apricot torte was also covered in the whipped cream. I had a taste and found its light flavor refreshing, the apricots getting on well with the cocoa. 

The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and competent. It is also worth mentioning that with all of the racial discrimination lawsuits against restaurants making the news lately, it was very encouraging to see that The Porch employs a good number of African-American servers. In fact, around half of the waiters and waitresses were black, and everyone we saw appeared to be enthusiastic about working for such a brilliant new restaurant. I hope that The Porch achieves national recognition for their food, environment, and progressive hiring practices.",2012-02-05 23:19:35

I was looking forward to my visit here as I was very impressed by their beer list online (Belgian beers rock). We arrived here before the mad rush of after office hours and grabbed a spot on the patio. Nice cozy place with a huge umbrella providing cover from the sun. 
After going through the menu Marcedsous Triple in a bottle caught my eye as it is hard to find.  My friend ordered the same thing. Just to munch on something we ordered some Belgian Fries as well. I decided to check out the interior seating as well and it is nicely done. 
The beer arrived promptly and were served in the proper glass. The fries took their time. Fries are average and nothing special. Hey its a beer spot so as long as they have a decent beer list I can live with that.
For the next round I went for a La Trappe Quad and my friend tried Delirium Tremens on my recommendation. Both were on draft which is very kewl IMO.

The three of us dug into omelettes, hash browns and pancakes. It was a massive amount of food for just $30 with drinks.
I had a ham and cheese omelette and it was delicious. It was exactly what I was wanting and cooked perfectly. The hash browns weren't as amazing but the omelette was so big I didn't have room for them anyways. Our son had the silver dollar pancakes and my husband had the country omelette.

You can't help but feel just a little bit cooler for having eaten at STK.  From the moment you walk in, the hostesses, the managers, bartenders, servers, and diners are all outgoing, excited, high energy, beautiful, and cool people.  In fact, I was probably the most uncool person in the place - haha.  Top it off with some delicious food and some great beats coming out the speakers and a night out at STK is better than a great night in the casinos.  OK - not really, but it is a whole lot better way to spend your money than a bad night at the tables!

Since STK is in the Cosmopolitan, you would expect it to be a little on the hipster side - and that is not meant in a bad way - and it does not disappoint.  The Chandelier may be the coolest bar on the Strip and STK complements it well.  As I mentioned, the atmosphere is on the loud side with mostly old skool hip hop playing - probably not the best place if you are looking for a quiet romantic or business dinner.

Our service team was very attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  

I had the petite filet, which was done perfectly.  The table had all kinds of sides, but I particularly enjoyed the truffle fries, mushrooms, and creamed corn.

For dessert, the server whipped up a little sampler plate for the table, which was excellent.  

One downside is that they only have single bathrooms so the line was a little long - although I imagine you could find one just outside the restaurant.  

Be sure to make reservations because the room is a little on the small side and be sure to bring the credit card because the bill will be a little on the big side.

If you are in Vegas to celebrate something special or you just want to live like one of the beautiful people for the night - get dressed up and head over to STK.",2015-02-18 07:09:47

The donut dough itself is denser than most - must be because of the large size of the donut. But the donuts overall aren't too sweet so I think it was just the right level.

It was bustling, especially for a Tues night, so we had to wait 15 min for a table.  It was a good time to do some people watching and peruse the environment.  The decor is polished and hip - could fall on either side of the casual / fine dining line.  There is a huge fish tank, good lighting, and interesting - sometimes comic - art on the walls.  The crowd was young, lots of 20 somethings versus the business dinner crowd.

As for the food...  There is a huge menu and it is slightly overwhelming.  Their sushi rolls are giant, eclectic, and are pretty good.  I shared some sushi with my dining mates and then opted for the bento box - which basically allows you to sample the highlights of their menu.  It included a little burger (tasty), sweet potato fries (very good), sushi (delicious), a spicy cucumber salad (rockin), and some edamame.  Great meal!

Plan on spending approximately $25 per person with food and a modest beer.  Not too bad for good atmosphere and fun food.

Our waitress was friendly and helpful in navigating us through the menu.  There was an error in one of our sides and a little delay in it coming out - though no complaints from us - so the manager stopped by to apologize and comped the bill.  Outstanding customer service!",2011-02-24 11:38:00

I got there at 1pm on a Saturday, hoping to avoid the lunch rush. Nope. It was still hyped. 

I went alone so I got seated in around 10 minutes at the bar, which was a lot shorter than in Japan. (Everyone else who was in line before me was glaring at me.) I ordered the shio ramen and the karaage. The noodles came fast and it smelled so damn good. I drank the soup first and it was just as delicious as the one in shibuya. I could see the little squirt of truffle on the chashu so I mixed it in the soup and drank it. Even better. 

The noodles were tender and the portion was generous. The meat was super tender and there's three pieces (compared to two at kinton). The karaage was small and not worth it. But it was all about the SOUP. It was the best ramen soup I've ever had, clam based and warm. It filled me up completely. I drank the entire bowl.

At Sunrise Coffee, they make delicious, organic drinks that are very reasonable in price. What I especially like about this coffee shop is the care and love they take in making each drink. The little details, like the latte art on each cappuccino, are much appreciated. They also have special deals, usually in the form of free drinks, found on their Yelp page. 

After looking over the drink menu board, I settled on a large Iced Peach Tea. The worker suggested adding a pump of peach syrup to give my tea a stronger peach flavor and a little sweetness, to which I obliged. Thank goodness I took her advice because my tea was delicious. Refreshing, slightly sweet and peachy without being too peachy. It was perfect. 

This coffee shop gets another star for free wifi, friendly service and knowledgeable staff. They also have puzzles and books available for customers to pass the time with while sipping on their drinks.

My friends and I have a million jokes after dining here one night. Being concerned for a group for 6-9, I went ahead and made a reservation a few days beforehand, which the number ended up changing the night of [they weren't upset]. We all arrived about the same time and there was a nice Reserved sign on the table and water + glasses all set. It wasn't terribly busy [maybe since it was a weeknight?] so had I not made it, probably could've dined without a reservation. Since the restaurant was fairly dead we had great service. Our waitress was quite helpful with selecting dinner, water refills, questions, bill splitting, etc etc. Our group found it hilarious we ate on a few glass patio tables.

I would kind of lump the menu at Beaver Choice as ""eastern European"" rather than just Polish and German. The Thursday special is unlimited perogies + soup + salad for $12. About half of the group went with that. It is self-serve at a buffet warmer with 5 different perogy flavors, all which those friends ended up loving! The other half of us went with various schnitzels. Forewarning, if you order regular schnitzel, the porcini mushroom sauce is more thick gravy than what I expected. So much food though for that option I picked! Schnitzel + mashed potatoes, salad, salad, and sauerkraut. The salads weren't terribly good [not a fan of putting a cold side with warm food]. The dill mashed potatoes were fairly plain so I ate them with the mushroom sauce. The schnitzel did not need the sauce, it was fabulous on it's own. Saurkraut? Meh, I don't really like it in general but it was pretty good. 

They do have a great beer menu [great mix of domestics and international] so I went with a pint of the Leibinger Hefe... BIIIIG beer [but you pay $7 for it] and worth the cost. 

I'll definitely have to come back for more Beaver!",2016-12-27 19:42:56

They definitely have the strip vibe on their prices with pizzas going for over $20 on average.  I tried the Detroit and one of the large, $35 variety pizzas.  The variety was a delicious, thin crust that reminded me of an Italian flat bread appetizer (but remember - $35!). And the Detroit was similar to a deep dish, yet very basic with just bread, cheese, and a huge helping of red sauce.  I saw their by-the slice venue inside and the pepperoni pizza looked like a decent piece and well-sized, for $4, but don't expect to get your NY style fix here either.

Overall I was a little disappointed.  I think the place is known more as a late night or night on the town type of venue. They have a notable Happy Hour, which I believe runs 4-6pm and 10pm-late. I might be back to try the very reasonable priced 3-5-7 Happy Hour menu, but the prices scare me away from making this even close to my go-to Pizza spot.",2016-03-23 06:54:04

It's by far our favorite food truck in Charlotte (and the favorite truck we've eaten at anywhere, really!), and you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The quality of the ingredients that they use, combined with creative combinations, and the buttery crisp perfection of the bread makes their grilled cheese the best EVER!  I know, I know; pretty big statement, right? Well, if you're questioning my authenticity, just try it for yourself and you'll be saying the same thing.

They have a general rotation of gourmet favorites including the Pig Mac and the go-to Four Cheese, but I highly recommend branching out and sampling the Green Meunster (spinach + wasabi + avocado + Meunster) or the Leek & Mushroom (this is waaaay better than the way the ingredients sound, trust me).  If you ever see the Lobstah Mac on the menu, you MUST order it! You can thank me later.

Don't forget to get yourself a nice cold Pellegrino and an order of truffle kettle chips while you wait, it rounds out the meal. Also, don't delude yourself into thinking that you'll only eat ONE grilled cheese --- save time and go ahead and order two. That way you won't have to get back in line later (or share with anyone else).

The staff and chef of this truck are so charming and talented, and you can tell that they are genuinely passionate about their customers and their food.  I can't sing their praises enough, but the best compliment in the food industry is a referral and recommendation, so go check them out!

As a family girl, we can sit anywhere and feel comfortable with our toddler. There's plenty of space for us to pull him out of his high chair and not hit the table next to us, inside or out. Nobody gives us a look when he fusses and the servers are always really nice and helpful. The patio is comfortable, but if you'd rather sit inside, they have HUGE windows that go to the ceiling that the staff will open up on a beautiful day. The managers come by and say hello and won't shy from making sure you're having a pleasant meal.

Happy hour is pretty good too. Split the shrimp dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps with a friend for about $5 apiece. Not bad. 3 bucks for a beer or 5 bucks for a glass of wine and I'm set.

I don't know if they still have them, but don't get their dessert shots. Hopefully they got rid of them way back when I tasted one. Gag. Aside from that, nice work, PFC.",2014-10-14 15:22:16

First let me tell you, the people are the real jewels of this place. I have never encountered so many incredibly welcome and friendly people. They are just beyond nice about everything! Everything! I love that!

By the way, the best part about this salon is they NEVER speak in another language, ever. It's English the whole time. I cannot begin to tell you how refreshing it is to get your nails done without the paranoia that comes with that BS. 

The service here is so top notch. I went in and had to have something special done to my nails and they did it so well that I couldn't believe it was a fill! They looked brand new! David, who of course is all mine, is a magician! 

I normally like the same person to do both my hands and feet, because if they do hands well it stands to reason...but, David had another appointment and they asked Christina to do my nails.

I'm trying to review for the meat market located in the back. 

Alllllllrightyyyy Theeeen

Finally I have found what I've been looking for. A selection of different kind of meats. No no noooo not the regular chicken, beef, turkey, duck. They have a pretty nice assortment of different meats. Clean and void of foul smells. Looked pretty fresh (all yelp reviews aren't complete without ""Freshest"" in it). Now I met my ""Fresh"" quota I can proceed. 

A few guys in the back chopping & packin. I don't wanna repeat what others may have already wrote. However, I ran with Aligator (1LB = 16.99) & Turtle (1LB = 6.99) yeah yeah yeah ohh not turtle. Yes!! Lol

Unfortunately it is still over priced. I also was NOT impressed with the owner. I have been having issues with the business placing their outdoor furniture in the way of a clear path. I use a power wheelchair sometimes and getting through to pass the store has been challenging in the past. I did make a complaint and I noticed they had rearranged the seating. I decided to go in and thank them and get something to eat. I asked for the owner and an employee pointed him out. I explained to him the situation and happily thanked him. He never once said hello or came to introduce himself. Instead he stood a good distance from me and when I addressed him he looked pissed off. As I spoke to him one of his employees came and talked to me instead. He never fully acknowledged me aside from a few nods and grunts and I found that to be so rude. I will not be giving my business to this place at all after this disgusting interaction. He in no way was pleasant or welcoming. He actually acted like he was too good. I even struggled leaving the business because my hands were full and I had to operate my chair and open the door for myself as they all watched. I am very independent but it would have be nice to have a little assistance at that moment. I only gave the one star because I have to but if it were my choice a no star rating would have been better. Very bad service and run by a horrible owner/manager. I highly recommend not coming here.

You walk up a flight of stairs and then just somewhat awkwardly wait at the top of the steps for someone to seat you. It was a very busy Sunday in Pittsburgh (Pride/Arts Festival) so they were busy and somewhat understaffed so I noticed people somewhat confused and possibly frustrated waiting to be seated. I met my party there so I did not personally experience this, just observed it! As for the food, definitely an A rating. Yum! I ordered the chicken fajita ($15.50) and it was purely perfection! Drenched in oil- the chicken, peppers and onions complemented one another beautifully and it totally satiated me, not to mention it is healthy and gluten free (as long as you don't eat the tortillas). If you are somewhat concerned about healthy choices when you go out, I think it is important to note that the tortillas, rice, refried beans, pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese is served on a separate plate. You can always just ask for your pico and guac on the side without all those naughty extras! Up to you, just something to note. I think $15.50 is a little steep considering that their lunch pricing (available M-F) is $10 but who am I kidding?! I would still order it again at that price point! The food is fresh and good quality. Las Velas salsa was nothing to write home about but you could tell the ingredients were fresh! Also, if you go on the website, the food and drinks pretty much look exactly the same in person! The atmosphere is simple yet fun and the restaurant does overlook Market Square, which is an added bonus. There is free parking after 6pm, 2 hour limited pay parking before 6pm or valet. This information can be found on their website. I would recommend Las Velas if you are in the mood for fresh, Mexican food in a nice location.",2016-06-15 03:20:33

Our electric bill today is about the same as when we moved into this Tempe home in 1987. Why? Armed with information from SRP, we added sun screens to the windows, have more energy efficient appliances, and our 1987 air conditioner was 8SEER and our current ac is 16SEER.

The servers seemed well polished and the cocktails we tried were tasty and strong.

We shared a small plate of House Smoked Trout with Pea Cakes and Tomato Jam. I thought this dish was put together well and was my favorite of the plates I tried. The Trout was smoked nicely and wasn't too much smoke. The Pea Cakes reminded me of Falafels but green with fresh peas bursting out and the Tomato Jam wasn't just sweet Tomatoes it had a little Kick to it. They all harmonized nicely together.

The starter plate of Cauliflower Casserole was for my taste (maybe not yours) was overly generous with cheese and seemed to lack the onion cream that was in the description. For me this plate was too heavy and I think someone just slipped with the cheese that wasn't in the description of this dish. Possibly an opening hiccup.

 I need to reveal a full disclosure that I am sensitive about smoked foods and only care for a mild smoke taste that might differ from you.

I tried the Chicken and Biscuit Dumplings. I received a bowl of many nicely made cheesy dumplings in a very smoky dark sauce with 2-maybe 3 ounces of nicely prepared dark meat chicken a few very thin shaves of Local McClendon Carrots, Chunks of Mushrooms and some fresh pea tendrils. I was slightly disappointed for a few reasons. As good as the Biscuit Dumplings were and they were. This dish for me was too much Dumplings and should have been called Biscuit Dumplings with Chicken. I could only eat maybe one and a half and had I think three maybe three more dumplings. In the description of the dish was the mention of McClendon Carrots. I was expecting carrots to have a co-staring role and not to be  just a few shaves for color.  For my taste the sauce was WAY too smoky but might be great to other people who like smoky food. 

My husband tried the Smoked Chicken and Andouile Sausage Gumbo. He said it was good. He eats Authentic Gumbo whenever he is in New Orleans and said the one at Southern Rail was good but thinner than other Gumbos he tried and also more smoky than others he tried but still good to him.

Last tip? 

It's interesting to just sit and watch people come in and out of the cafe. I was sitting there sipping my coffee when I saw a family come in and sat down. Mom goes in to the bathroom first and then it wasn't long before the mom came out, the family sits for two minutes before the family walks out!

I have never tasted a good vermicelli before from other restaurants so for that it'll be my go-to place.

I went to Nakama for the first time this past Friday in 2-3 years. This place has sadly declined. It is definitely not as good as it used to be & the hibachi just isn't the same. Had the management changed over the past few years? A group of 6 of us went for Hibachi before a night out. The service was good, but a little slow. The hibachi chief was not very impressive & my tuna steak was flavorless. Additionally, the vegetables served with our hibachi were still hard when they placed on our plates. The portions were huge, but nothing great. I will say the cherry blossom roll that we had as an appetizer was really good, but pricy. I am surprised Nakama is always busy still.

At $10 for locals this is a worth while museum to visit. We spend 2 and a half hours but I would recommend at least 3 hours maybe even more. 

You start on the third floor in a historic newly renovated post office. You get to experience being in a police line-up and the best part is that they take your picture using your cell phone so you don't have to spend a ton on a souvenir photo. you go through almost a timeline from where the mafia beginnings, the impact prohibition had on organized crime, the history of how Las Vegas came to be and the FBI's efforts on the war against the Mafia.

As much as I enjoy reading I loved the interactive exhibits. I had goose bumps listening to actual police recordings of detrimental wire taps that were used to take down the Mob. You are able to shoot a gun in a police simulation. Sit in a electric chair. One section they had actual pictures of murder scene. This exhibit is not for the faint of heart. But it was true to the Mob lifestyle. 

This museum has an amazing collection and it's put together well using a lot of new technology like touch screens. They even had a hologram presentation of one of the court proceedings for one of the mob cases. 

So the real question is who's side are you on? The Mob or Law Enforcement. Frankly The Mob seems like a more glamorous lifestyle.",2012-05-04 03:22:25

Anything on the menu is good. I'm not a vegetarian, but I love how everything has tasted. On rotation: the breathless smoothie (strawberry, banana, mango); the soup, salad and cornbread combo is great value; the baby buddha rice bowl (OMG YUM); the big salad.

Parking is pretty limited, I got a spot on the side of the building but there wasn't a whole lot of other places to park other than the street.

It wasn't very busy during the lunch rush but I still waited about 20 minutes to get my food. I only ordered the caprese sandwich and a fruit cup so I was surprised it took as long as it did since they aren't actually cooking anything I ordered, just putting it together. Then, when I saw the size of my fruit cup, my jaw dropped open. It was literally the size of a cup you put ketchup or another condiment inside. I think total there were two pieces of strawberry and a few grapes. Sorry but if I didn't have a Groupon, I would have went up to the counter and asked for my money back on that alone! Then, when I tasted the sandwich, it really wasn't anything special.

Surprisingly, there are not many places in town that fit that bill.  Many places (understandably) will not consider a wait list for breakfast or brunch unless you go to their establishment. And we just didn't want to wait in a long line. 

SHORT VERSION: food = 5 stars; service = 3/4 stars; ambiance = 5 stars

FOOD: Come on, it's the Wynn, so quality is on the menu. And the options include simple American fare: steak sandwiches, seafood soup, basic breakfasts, and a few (but not a wealth of) respectful vegetarian and vegan options added balance to what seemed like a fairly basic breakfast menu.  And everything we ate (see above) was delicious. The bread basket was outstanding and the homemade jams and ketchup were stand outs. 

Side note: I think they have the best fries in town. I haven't collected any data or done any local fry comparison, but those fries were perfect. I said it--perfect. 

DECOR: I loved the indoor design and color scheme. I admit to finding other parts of the Wynn a little ornate for my taste, but the light colors and romantic shapes coupled with the with the mixed motifs on the upholstery leads to a modern/light/elegant feel to the space. Outside the landscaping and arrangement does all of the ambiance work. As it should. The pool area isn't ""pretty"", but the strategic use of foliage and color and shape make it feel special. I don't know that any casino in town has provided as much outdoor restaurant space as the Wynn has. 

SERVICE: Surprisingly, the service left me wavering between 3 and 4 stars for the experience. Our glasses were left empty for so long that we finally had to flag down a different waiter to request service. While not our waiter, the man who helped us was incredibly accommodating and responsive.  But the lapse of service outside was not limited to our table. And that was a disappointment.  Does it even need to be said that part of the experience in a place like Tableau is the service? 

IS IT ""DRIVE TO THE STRIP WORTHY""? No. 

OVERALL:  I enjoyed the meal (particularly the fries) and would return with guests. But I didn't love it because of the lapse in service and the simplicity of the dishes.  If I want brunch on the strip with a nice outdoor view and I don't need to make reservations, there are  options where service is always spot on and I enjoy a slightly more creative menu.  The spotty service was a surprise as a Wynn property, but more disappointing was the feeling that this level of service was not unusual for the outdoor seating area.

The sushi is ok... it isn't fabulous.  The burgers... they're ok...not even great.  The service... hit or miss though we did charm some smiles from our server at this last visit but ??? What am I missing here (besides better food and experience?  

I tried the bento box and the mini burger (it doesn't qualify as a slider) was very dry; the philly roll was also dry and the only thing I really tasted was the cream cheese in it.  The sweet potato fries were good and I had a few bites of the cucumber salad.  I wasn't paying attention that it has edamame.  I can't eat that, but again...underwhelmed.  My sweetie got the turkey burger which he said was meh.  

Now the decor - I'd give that 4 stars with the cool graphic re-imaginings of more famous paintings; the fish tank - those are always nice.

I went with the Fun-ghi burger with roasted portobello, gruyere, and truffle oil. Each bite had the perfect amount of flavor without one ingredient overwhelming the next. I tried a bite of my friend's Rising Sun, which had tempura avocado, crispy yam, nori, spicy mayo and a patty with a teriyaki glaze. It was even more amazing.

I have to admit, I wasn't impressed with BRFC the first two times that I dined here.  I wasn't originally a fan of their chicken, the shoestring fries, and the sticker shock.

And since then, I have tried almost everything on their menu, including their sides and the monthly chicken sandwiches.  Either BRFC stepped up their game or I came to appreciate what they had to offer.  The fried chicken is very tender, fully seasoned (BRFC doesn't miss a spot), and juicy.  The quality of their chicken is a huge plus for me.  I know I'm getting at least 6 oz. of chicken meat when I have one of their chicken sandwiches.  My favorites include February's Love Bird, May's Chicken de Mayo, the Natural (grilled chicken sandwich), some parts of the Beak-to-Butt, and Da Whole Bird.  The service is always great too.

Then there is a Starbucks and a full service deli that makes pretty tasty sandwiches and a fair price.  Additionally, I love how the employees just make the sandwiches as they see fit, none of this nickel and diming stuff like you see at fast food places where they count how many tomatoes or weigh the meat.  Here they just pile on ingredients and if you ask for more, they'll happily oblige.  That bumps them up to 3 stars.

I bought my car here 2 years ago and had great service.  But the service department needs some serious work! 

On Tuesday I wasted over an hour on the phone with them trying to get an appoinment for Friday.  I do not like my time wasted....I mean who likes to have their time wasted? U know? 

So I get here at 11:47AM for a noon appoinment.   There was 1 car in the no appoinment line and after I drove up to the appoinment only line 2 more cars drove up to the NO appoinment line.  

One guy that worked there asked me what I was there for.  I told him....I have an appoinment for an oil change.  He said he would go and get someone to help me.  So I wait....and wait....and wait...

Finally 20 minutes later of me sitting in my car and watching one car that arrived after me get taken before me....someone finally comes and asks...have u been helped?  I'm like....really?  Wth? Would I really be sitting in my car waiting if I had been helped?!?!

Then the guy Kyle proceeds to tell me that the lady that I have been waiting 20 minutes for is helping the car that came after me in the NO appoinment line!!!!! I'm like WTH!!!! Seriously?  U are helping someone that didn't have an appoinment before u help a person that had an appoinment??? Really????

Come on...ppl make appoinments so that they do not have to waste time BUT apparently here they prefer to waste your time and give preferential treatment to guest who do not make an appoinment.  

This was my third visit to the service department and it will be my last visit.  There are too many places that I can goto to get my car checked. 

So if u are planning on coming here...DO NOT MAKE AN APPOINMENT.  If u do they will take the customers with no appoinment before u and waste your time.  What a way to run a business!",2015-05-29 19:16:20

Per the suggestions of others my bf and I went for a late lunch during the week to try to avoid a crowd. We got there around 1:45pm and there were a couple tables open - no one is kidding when they say this place is tiny. But, that wasn't necessarily a shot against it - our waiter could see us from essentially anywhere in the restaurant so when we were ready to order it was super easy to flag him down. Speaking of which, the service in general was pretty good. My water was always filled and they checked up on us a couple times to make sure the food was satisfactory.

We ended up going with a few rolls and several pieces of nigiri. The fish itself tasted very fresh, I would almost just get nigiri next time, and I enjoyed the rolls but I have definitely had better. The prices are pretty much unbeatable and the list of options is fairly extensive. It seemed like many of the rolls had a lot of the same ingredients though so if you're looking for variety (and sans cream cheese) you might be looking for a little while. 

All in all, if I was in the area already I would definitely stop in for a late lunch again. But it's a little too out of the way (35min drive) and didn't knock my socks off enough for me to justify going regularly.",2017-02-21 12:58:59

Got there around 2PM solo and sat in the bar to watch football. I ordered the Grilled Tenderloin Salad:

Grilled and sliced beef tenderloin over a bed of mixed greens tossed with bleu cheese crumbles, diced tomatoes and a tangy balsamic vinaigrette with a glass of Simi chardonnay. I also opted for some bread since I was going to do without dessert. 

Can I just tell you how freaking much I loved this salad! And their dressing was so yummy, I was think of do shots with it! 

The meat was cooked to my perfection (med/rare) and Simi wine was de-lish. Oh and their freshly baked bread should be banned! I could have eaten several of them, but I was good since I dieting.

For whatever reason, it took over 10 minutes for someone to come over to us after we sat. Two waitresses were walking around serving the other tables just next to us but didn't even take our drink order.

My wife doesn't eat seafood so she went with fettuccine alfredo with chicken ($14) and I got the shrimp and grits. The fettuccine was really tasty, a lot more flavor than most pasta-focused places and the chicken was delicious. It was slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside. Her plate was a pretty large portion but the shrimp and grits seemed really small for $17. Either way, it was killer! The Ghouda grits are some of the best grits I've ever had...really creamy and taste amazing with the spiciness from the rest of the plate. There are 5 decent size shrimp on top which were plump and juicy. We also went with the bananas foster for dessert which was good but a little pricey at $8.

Heading to the food line, I was surprised to see how much food there was. The food line was very long and offered everything such as American, Italian, Greek/Mediterranean, Italian, Meats, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, etc. Most of the food I tried was excellent. Some of it was okay, but that's understandable since it would be hard to have every item out of so many to taste great. I particularly liked the several fishes I tried and also the baked salmon at the cutting station. The sashimi and salads were also great.

They do have happy hour every day. 3pm-6pm for food & for drinks it starts 11am-6pm. On Sundays kids eat free if you buy something for $10. They also have a patio to sit outside. They also have tvs. 

So we started with appetizers the fried mozzarella (like cheese sticks) it had no seasoning or taste to it. It definitely needed salt though. Maybe u will taste some thing from the after taste but definitely wasn't impressed. I had better mozzarella sticks else where. 
We also got the chicken drumettes (basically Buffalo wings) definitely wasn't impressed taste nothing as well. No spice or sauce on them. I could have gone to Little Ceasers & got basically the same wings but with better sauce on them and for cheaper. 
Lastly we got the pizzas I got sausage on mine. I had no idea it's $3 to add a topping! My sister & brother got pepperoni. First bite I took reminded me of peter piper pizza. Not a fan.

Come see Karla. She's a sweetheart and doesn't talk down to you. Actually no one I encountered there seemed to want to mansplain anything to me. Long story short, my car was stolen then recovered. I had to tow my car to Honda West to get new keys made (they needed to program a chip, that's why I had to have the car there). They explained to me that the labor fee would be the same as having one key cut or two, so since I had zero keys, better make two just in case. One of my tires was unexplainably damaged, like it had been skidded out, but just ONE tire. So I asked if I could pay the tow guys to put on my spare, and Karla said, NO I'll have my boys put it on, no charge.

While we were waiting for my car, she came and told me I had failed to take care of the Takata recall so they legally needed to change them out before they could let me take my car. She said we could wait, or they would call when it was done. I had an event to go to that night so I told her I'd pick up the car in the morning. She told me she would not tell the guys I was coming tomorrow so they would not slack on my order, and it was still ready that night, so the next morning bright and early I was able to pickup my car.

I'd heard of the place, but didn't go out of my way to visit it, as there are many near my home that so very good. (I live in Bloor West Village) With my 3-year old son in tow, I planned to make a quick stop for a coffee and maybe a treat. (Is anything not quick when you have kids with you?)

It was just after 9am on a Friday morning. As we walked south along Royal York Road from where I parked my car, there was a nice elderly gentleman who was sitting on the patio enjoying his morning coffee and newspaper. To me, small patios in front of food establishments that are clean and filled with people are always a good sign. (Kind of a Euro-thing I wish Toronto had way more of, I think.) He smiled at my boy and said ""Good morning"" and then even gave my son a few breadcrumbs to fee the little birds that were on the street. Cute. It was like this man knew it was our first time at SanRemo and he went out of his way to welcome us.

When we entered, the first thing that caught my eye was the line for the ""Coffee & Gelato."" Another good sign. It told me that the coffee was probably good and that folks were willing to wait in a long line to get their morning cup. I also noticed the sparkling and fancy cappuccino maker they had too. The baristas were hard at work. We walked past the cheeses, deli meats, hot table (is 9am too early for a veal sandwich?), and stopped at the fresh bread and buns that were being unloaded from a cart and onto the shelves for picking. What's better than fresh bread? I picked up a few buns and dreamed of the sandwich I was going to make with it at lunchtime.

They had a a row of about 6 or 7 racks of fresh pastries: croissants, scones, pies, breads, danishes...this was too much. I wanted one of each. I filled a paper bag of a few samples and headed to the nearby glass case of other goodies...but not before I quickly picked up a package of butter tarts first. (Hey, it's research!)
I had to run after my son, who I'd lost to the glass counter with cupcakes, cakes, cookies and doughnuts. I knew I was in trouble. Did they have shopping carts in there? (No) It was then I decided that I'd have to come back when my kids weren't with me. Mama needs more time to really appreciate this store. I got my little guy a sprinkled cupcake and for me, a sugar twist doughnut...but wait, what was that lady bringing out on a tray from the back? Fresh from the oven cinnamon buns. I picked one up for the husband, as he likes them more than I do.

Ty and I sat down for our treats. The sugar twist was very good. But let me just take a peek at this cinnamon bun, as I overheard about 5 people ordering them after I bought mine. I looked in the paper bag and took a nice whiff. Hmmm. Not bad. One little nibble couldn't hurt, Jeremy shares everything with me.

And that was the end of the cinnamon bun. Sweet Heavens, that was good. Do they fry them or something?????

Some of it seemed overcooked and tough to chew (maybe that's how it's supposed to be?). It wasn't bad, but I personally didn't care for it. Still, the place was PACKED. So it must be good.

There's something for everyone; so if you get the opportunity, give it a try! Staff was very friendly. We had made reservations and had to wait for maybe five minutes, so not bad at all.",2018-02-27 00:08:13

They were patient and took time to explain menu items and come check in on many occasions. The venue is definitely more upscale and posh (Yorkville). I would classify it more as a Japanese dining lounge than a Japanese restaurant. 

I've seen a number of these venues in Chicago (Tundra, Roka Akor) during my time there, but I still find it hard to describe/classify the type of restaurant.

The Eats:
- Smoked Salmon (smoked cream cheese, salmon caviar & yuzu butter)
- Rock Shrimp Tempura
- Kamameshi (wild mushrooms, burdock root, yam cake & truffle soy butter)
- Shishito Peppers
- Whole Grilled Sea Bass
- O-Toro and Uni sushi

We were seated in the back room where you take off your shoes and sit at tables where you can either cross your legs or place your legs under the table where there's a lower compartment so you can just sit normally.

We ordered: 
Saikora steak - yum! but you gotta eat it warm
Takoyaki - was too mushy
Salmon tataki - ponzu sauce could use some work , it was too bland
Bibimbap with kimchi and pork - yum! and a very large portion compared to Guu
Kinmon (sp?) sake - mild warm sake that was recommended by the waitress that was perfect for our taste
Skewers $2 each!!! - scallop, whole fish (no idea what it's called), pork belly (yum!), kushi chicken, chicken skin, shrimp, asparagus with bacon. You can get these with either teriyaki sauce or sea salt. I recommend the sea salt as it really brings out the flavour of the skewer compared to the teriyaki sauce which overpowered it. Also, order the skewers as you want to eat them as they get cold quickly.
Salmon tempura salad - on the house! Such a nice surprise! You know everything tastes better when its free hahahaha... but really, this was good as well. Not outstanding but a delicious surprise that we finished even though we were stuffed. 

The service here was awesome! Our waitress, Mau, was very cheerful and accomodating. When I asked her if the sake was warm since she brought it out in the bottle, she quickly brought me a bucket of warm water to keep it in. And when we left the hostess came out of the restaurant to bow to us! My boyfriend thought she was chasing us down but was surprised when she came out into the cold, bowed 90 degrees and cheerfully said ""thank you for coming!"".

Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).

I have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.

I think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!

Located on Glen Watford Drive in the heart of Scarborough, this location has been the home of many restaurants for the past 30 years.  After many owner changes, the place is now called Fisherman Villa and on this particular evening, we were invited to join them on a 10 course meal. 
The first thing to arrive was the assorted meat platter.  I have to admit I was impressed with the amount of food that was on the plate as well as the colorfulness of it all.  There were certainly more than 2 pieces of meat per item per person on the plate.  The quality of the food was pretty good as the pork, the sausages and the squid were all very tender and fresh.
 
The crabmeat balls looked nice and big as they sat at the table. It appeared that the chef also added some small dried fish on the outside of the crab meat ball to give it some extra flavor.  The outer shell was nice and crispy and many and the inside was burning hot.  Unlike some places, the claw was taken out and only the crab ball remained.  

The popular scallops with assorted vegetables dish arrived next and looked just as colorful and artistic on presentation.  Although this is a simple dish to stir fry and make, the chef certainly gave it some extra effort to make it more presentable.  The scallops were again fresh and tender and all the vegetables blended well with the seafood.  The entire dish was too salty and actually provided some of that pureness of what great Chinese food was all about.

No ten course traditional Chinese meal could be complete without its shark fin soup and in this case it sure did not disappoint.  There was plenty of shark fin inside the soup and the broth tasted very, very good. Again, the amount of saltiness was just perfect although one could simply add some red vinegar to further enhance the taste.  I did not hear a single complain from any of my fellow peers who were enjoying this meal with us.
The steamed chicken tasted just as good.  This golden color chicken was steamed to perfection with no traces of rawness in it.  There was also three bowls of ginger onion sauce to go with the chicken.  It tasted great with each piece having plenty of skin, just the right proportion of fat to meat. 

The ten course meal really covers all its bases and for those who don't like meat or seafood then the next dish is for you.  The mushroom and vegetables plate looked juicy and tasty.  With two types of mushrooms and plenty of vegetables immersed in a nicely made broth, this dish was great to have to absorb all the fat that one had been eating up until this point.  The mushrooms were all nice and soft and had absorbed much of the broth which made them even more tastier.  A good dish to have as it was a good alternative to all the meat and seafood that had been served.

Two pieces of steamed tilapia were next to hit the table.  Again, the chef steamed it to perfection with the meat sliding off the bone and not a trace of rawness was in the fish. There was plenty of soya sauce to go with the fish.  Again, another great dish to have that was made to near perfection. 

One of the last things to arrive was the stir fried lobster and this was made like most typical stir fried lobsters. With some ginger and green onions mixed with the lobster, the lobster tasted pretty much like any lobster at any Chinese restaurant.  The only problem I had was that it was pretty much the last major dish to be served for the evening and by the time that it got to there, most people were pretty much done.  The food for dishes 1-7 had done its job as everyone was pretty much waving the white flag by the time the lobster had arrived.  I had a piece of the tail and a piece of the claw and they were fantastic.

Despite all the changes in ownership, this place can still rock out a good meal.  It was pretty quiet even though it was a weekend evening however much of it could be the fact that many have passed through those doors before and many feel that once the past is gone, the past is gone.  I have to admit that the meal was pretty decent and everyone left pretty happily.  There was also the traditional rice and noodles and red bean dessert which most people just nibbled on as everyone was pretty full.",2016-11-25 05:44:41

On a week night I went down to the Cosmo with a friend for a concert and to redeem free drinks at Comme Ca. They run contests on their Twitter to win two free drinks off of their 18a cocktail menus. Very cool of them.

Comme Ca is tucked into the corner of the restaurant level of The Cosmo. I really liked the bar area with the plethora of seating. The ambiance is very conducive to just coming here and having a few drinks with friends. Also, I believe it would be a very nice atmosphere for a date. 

I had the Rumble. A drink they make with season fruit (mine had raspberries), The fruit is ""muddled"" aka smashed down in the bottom of the glass, and alcohol is added and topped with crushed ice. The presentation was nothing short of spectacular. All cocktails are $12.

We had cocktails while reviewing the menu. We all ordered salad to start: House of Tricks Caesar Salad, Mixed Spring Greens, and Grilled Eggplant and Fresh Tomato Salad. The entrees were the Blackened Ahi Tuna and the Seared Scallop BLT. Though, the Scallop dish was an appetizer (2 scallops), I was asked by our server if I wanted to add an extra to make it a dinner, and I said ""yes"".

All the food was delicious, cooked to order. Keep in mind House of Tricks menu is a little eclectic, combining different ingredients and spices that come together. My only comment: I was a little thrown off on was we got the bill I noted to add an extra one Scallop on my already $19 dollar appetizer, I was charged $9. $28 dollars for 3 Scallops. My bad for not asking what the up-charge was. So keep that in mind.. it was still delicious!

Li Wah offers the classic dim sum served with carts around lunch time on the weekends, which is a happy site!  The dim sum itself is standard fare, with the classic shumai, chicken feet, turnip cakes, etc. being served.  After bringing various friends to dim sum, I did notice that it is not particularly vegetarian friendly, and many of their dishes are fried, so these might be important things to keep in mind.  Although definitely not the best dim sum I've had, the food is still tasty and the prices aren't bad.

I don't come here often enough for them to know me, but I am always greeted right when I walk in, in a familiar and warm manner as if they do recognize me. The place has been quite busy when I've been here recently, but I've never had a wait for a table and both the server and kitchen have always been speedy and the server always pleasant. 

My favourite app at the moment is the Chicken Sambusek. It is folded into a pita that is warm and a bit crunchy. The flavor of the curry chicken inside is wonderful. If you are on the hungry side, one person could eat this on their own; alternatively it does cut nicely down the center into two wedges. 

Lately I've been trying different menu items and I have loved each one that I have tried. The portions are large! Jasmine's dishes are quite a unique flavor owing to the cooked beans, but I liked it nonetheless. 

If you have never been here before or just can't decide what to get go for the Flavor Saver - it's a little bit of everything I love and will definitely fill you up! The beef kafta remains a fav and I sometimes get a plate of just that.

For the most part, I just buy stuff here 'cause I know how much they retail for and it's a GOOD DEAL.  

Note:  Prices are inconsistent here from other locations and even on the same product within the store.  However, it benefits the customers, so it's all good!  Shhh...

-  a candle that was $9.99 in the actual candle section was near the cash for $7.99
-  a Stila waterproof eye liner that I just bought at NOTL for $9.99 was $12.99 here

So keep this in mind when picking things up!

I think I'd rather shop here than Winners Heartland.  That location is waaay too packed, especially during the Holiday season.  And as per my last review, there are actual designer stuff here, no random no-name brand/cheap qualities items.

Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. 
I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. 

Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety. 

The entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.  Otherwise there isn't much to stick around for unless you have deep pockets or want creative ideas.",2010-03-28 00:53:38

For those of you who visited Mez, SMG has a similar set up. One of the changes is the addition of a swing out table at each seat.  Think of it as a cooler version of those classroom flip tables - only it's attached to a plush movie recliner rather than a hard plastic seat that's too small for your bottom. The reason for the swing out table?  Well, you get to eat at your seat... but don't worry about balancing a meal while trying to find a seat, you can order at your seat too.

Not a place to linger over a meal, but a quick filling bite before you run off to your busy day. This place specializes in the different variations of noodles with shrimp wontons or beef brisket. Nothing fancy but it's cheap and cheerful and really really fast. Came on a Saturday for an early lunch, and was able to grab a table right away. Tea comes in a Styrofoam cup and there is a self serve station in the corner for refills. You place your order with the waitress and she literally turns around in 2 minutes with your order piping hot and ready to eat. 

I had the 'water dumplings' with noodles in soup. The noodles were good, crisp and without the dreaded vinegar water taste. Thumbs up for the noodles. The water dumplings were HUGE.  The three of them lined up in my bowl could pretty much cover all the noodles underneath them. I've never see them that big before. The shrimp inside had that fresh texture which testifies to the quality of their ingredients. The dumplings were very delicious but I could taste the MSG the moment I bite into them. They were like little MSG bombs and I needed to drink alot of water afterwards. Great immediate taste, but with lingering consequences afterwards.... like most delicious chinese food unfortunately. Until I find a better wonton noodle soup, this will probably be my go-to place for now when the craving hits.",2016-04-25 03:08:42

So I decided to drive out of my normal Tempe hood and check this place out. I am the takeout queen... having an active 2 year old makes it hard for me to actually sit down in a restaurant and enjoy my meal, so I opt for takeout 99% of the time. I ordered the Bun with chicken, and a side of spring rolls. The customer service was awesome, the ladies were super nice. While waiting my son enjoyed watching the little koi pond they have. Back to the food.. It was very good! The bun was perfect temperature, the fish sauce was the perfect balance of salty and sweet, and when I asked for extra sauce they gave me a ton without flinching.  The spring roll were amazing, probably some of the best I have had in the valley.

There was some kind of building scaffolding on the sidewalk outside of the entrance which made it even harder to find.  Thank goodness for the silver mailbox with their street number emblazoned on it or we might still be wandering around looking for the place.  The doorway is sort of set back from the street in case you have trouble too.

We had no idea how cute the interior would be that greeted us.  The chandelier above the bar is really beautiful and the color palette they used is calming and earthy.  It's perfect for a ramen place. The hostess seated us quickly and the waitress took our orders within a few minutes.  

We shared a pot of hot jasmine green tea that was very flavorful and the perfect temperature.  Sometimes tea in those pots is just lukewarm and sort of bath tub temp range.  Yuck.  This was nice and hot. 

The Ramen bowls were filled with flavor and different textures and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  The 30 minute egg was packed with delicious flavors and was a brownish color, presumably from soaking in that amazing bath of broth.  The pork belly and mushrooms just took the whole Shio Paitan Ramen over the top.  Really tremendous bowl of ramen.  My friend has the spicy Rayu Paitan which was similar to the Shio Paitan but carried a nice kick to it.

However, the last two times, service has been much better, with staff coming over to wipe down our table as soon as we selected it.

Food: Sandwiches are tasty (I particularly like the pork and arugula), although the bread is cut really thick and is rather hard to chew through.  Pizzas are quite tasty (definitely of the thin-crust variety, so stay away Chicagoans!) as are the salads.  Also, rocket=arugula (it's a British thing; not sure if they're trying to be posh or what).

Beware the cilantro water!  They often have 2 jugs of tab water, one plain and one with lemons and other fruit, and a heaping bunch of cilantro.  I love cilantro, but this was undrinkable.  Go for the plain.

Unfortunatley, Yum Cha is not worth the time or money on this journey. 

The Dim Sum, though freshly steamed, for the most part lacks flavor and distinct spices that make for an epicurrian delight. If you have eaten Dim Sum at The Orchid Garden, Yum Cha will be a major disappointment. 

Not able to find satisfaction with the Dim Sum, we ordered the ""old standard"" of Kung Pao Chicken. Though the pieces of chicken were of decent size and quality, the over meal had a sweet taste to it, and seriously lacked peppers and onions that give it a crunchy and distinctive flavor.

Good Chinese food in Las Vegas is very difficult to find. We owed it to our Yelp friends to try something new and hopefully found a tasty discovery to share with all.  Our disappointment is your gain. Strongly suggest you don't waste your time or dinning money on this place.

Description of Work Done:  I purchased my fiancé's engagement ring here.  I later purchased some diamond earrings for her birthday and Christmas too.  Just recently, I bought my wedding band and her wedding band from here too.

Quality of Work Completed:  They take a lot of pride in their work.  Even when I thought the rings were perfect, they weren't please.  Let's say they have real divine discontent with ""acceptable"" and only allow for perfection when it comes to their work.  10 out of 10.

Value:  Price wise, they can't be beat.  The lower prices are not a function of poor quality or things of that sort; it is a reflection of doing business with a family and locally owned business.  You would be surprised on the types of markups that places like Tiffany, Cartier, and Shane Co put on their diamonds.  My last name isn't Vanderbilt or Carnegie, and thus I couldn't afford a super expensive jeweler and Burland was the perfect place to go for us normal folks. 10 out of 10.

Customer Service:  Even if Burland's did mediocre work and only had a mediocre price, I would come back for the service. Everyone is there is great and not pushy at all.  Go to any of their competitors and the push you to make a decision on the spot and pick a huge, expensive, crappy diamond.  Burlands is the complete opposite.  10 out of 10.

They served drinks to you IN THE POOL, and you could pay there or charge them to the room. Great souvenir cups/sports bottles as well. They also have a cafe by the pool for breakfast/lunch, or you can get a menu and have the food/drinks delivered to your chair. Paris is located RIGHT on the strip. You can walk to a few nearby hotels such as Planet Hollywood, the Miracle Mile shops, and the Bellagio. The monorail stop is in Ballys and you can walk through Ballys right into Paris. Along the way, you will see some live music in Ballys, as well as the dueling pianos at Napoleans. Its free to get in, but get there early for a seat as well. Nice but not as crazy fun as pianos at Harrahs. Well worth the trip over there. Boulangerie had great French bread, sandwiches, and gelato. (coffee gelato was the BEST!) The Paris buffet was not good at all. Went there last year and waited way too long and paid waay too much and there wasnt anything good in there to eat. Skip that and go across the way to Le Creperie. Get an awesome crepe for $8 and it will fill you.Loved that place.",2009-08-12 21:17:33

Not impressed. Should have known better based on the reviews on here but I was desperate and hungry on my way to work this morning. I got the bacon, ham, egg and cheese on a baguette and a raisin croissant. The sandwich took a few minutes and I was so ready to tear into it when they handed it to me. I was on my way to work so I took it to my car to eat on my drive. Unfortunately I quickly found out that my sandwich was cold. Not warm, cold. I can't remember ever, EVER, getting a breakfast sandwich cold. It didn't even feel like it had ever really been hot. The ham for sure had not been heated up at all. It was fresh out the cooler. Oddly, the sandwich was still decent tasting (maybe I was just that hungry). The baguette was good and had a nice crunch to it. If this sandwich was served hot as it should be this might be a completely different review.
Note to self: stick to McDonalds breakfast.

From the amazing staff and service to the delicious and beautiful food, I can see why it's the only 5-diamond rated restaurant in Arizona.  Don't get me wrong, you pay for the experience, but I believe it's worth the price (this coming from a very frugal person who tries to find discounts wherever she can).  

My husband brought me here for my birthday and from the moment we sat down, we were treated wonderfully.  We ordered the suckling pig torta as an appetizer (portions aren't huge, but extremely flavorful and definitely enough to satisfy).  The appetizer was great, as a matter of fact...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  As entrees we ordered the lobster, scallop, and shrimp over squid ink pasta with gruyere cheese on top, and the buffalo tenderloin with mushrooms.  Both were amazing.  The lobster was no doubt the best dish I've ever had.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and deliciously rich but not heavy.  The buffalo was surprisingly not gamey and had a great fresh taste without being dry for such a lean cut of meat.  

We want to go back and try one of the tastings, but for 200 per person, we may need to wait for a bigger celebration to go.  But I'm already plotting the next time I'll be back for another mind blowing experience.",2011-12-08 18:49:44

LGO (as I learned it's called in PHX) is just about one of the cutest spots I've ever been on my various trips to Phoenix. Coming from Seattle I'm very familiar with businesses that focus heavily on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, and a strong general focus on being eco friendly while not losing their edge or charm. LGO is like a breath of the Pacific Northwest for me!

It's a local business that's your one stop before you head home. Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. 

Racks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!

There's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family. Nothing you buy here is going to waste!

For sushi novices looking for a cheap place for your basic sushi this is definitely your place, but if you are a sushi connoisseur looking for fresh, well prepared authentic Japanese cuisine than this place will disappoint.

The first sign that I was going to have a bad meal was their odd pricing on the menu. The entire sushi/sashimi menu had two price categories with some kinds of fish priced the same as some veggie sushi and cheaper kinds of fish priced the same as pricier seafood. So I question the freshness and source of the seafood.

The sushi rice wasn't properly seasoned and lacked any taste and didn't have that nice faint sweet and slightly vinegary scent to it, which I think is a major fail for any decent sushi restaurant.  For a restaurant that's run by Chinese rather than Japanese I wasn't very surprised.

Here are some of the items I had:

Amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) - when this was ordered the staff wasn't too sure if they had it or not, when it was served it was definitely not Amaebi. The shrimp was tiny, I mean very tiny, as in salad shrimp. It was thinner than the chopsticks I was eating it with and it wasn't really raw as it should be. It seems to be flash blanched for some reason. A proper Amaebi should be a plump extra large shrimp served raw with the head on and it should melt in your mouth. This shrimp was lacked any taste and was a joke given it was tiny and not even the right kind of shrimp.

Sushi Inn Roll - being their signature roll this was also bland and forgetful. It was supposed to be eel, avocado, salmon skin, cucumber and tobiko. I could see a tiny sliver of eel and maybe bits of salmon skin but it had no taste and the salmon skin had no crispness to it. Some pieces had cucumber, some didn't. It was very disappointing and could be confused with a California roll.

Uni - I was surprised to see this on their menu as many sushi don't have this regularly on their menu, and at $5.25 for a two piece sushi it seemed like a deal. It didn't taste that fresh which I think was probably made from frozen and lacked the explosion of briny sea flavours which I was expecting from a fresh sea urchin.

Hamachi maki - this was improperly prepared and the cuts of fish was minuscule. It was missing the finely chopped scallions that brings out the flavour.

Spicy Tuna maki - it wasn't spicy at all and each piece had a big dollop of mayo on it which did nothing but drown out the flavours.

Futo Maki - again tasteless. The pickled vegetables should have that nice sweet and sour flavour which this didn't have and there wasn't much texture to it. There should be a pleasant mix of crunch and softness, but it was bland and monotonous all the way through.

Saba sashimi - this seems to be only decent order I had, but there is really no much to it as it was just slices of mackerel. I'm glad this was reasonably fresh and the cut was decent.

California Roll - this was very mediocre, just like the ones you get from your supermarket.

I had a bunch or other rolls and sushi, but they were all too mediocre and unmemorable to describe.
Yes this place is cheap, but I would rather be eating somewhere else which had properly prepared fresh food that taste good. If you want good sushi, stay away from this place. I will definitely not come back.",2014-01-03 04:36:10

I ordered the halibut, which was served with charred bok choy, forbidden rice, shiitake mushrooms and a delicious coconut curry sauce. Every part of my dinner was divine.

My husband had the Pacific Coast Sole, which was served with lemon sauce and capers, fresh vegetables and petite potatoes. It was absolutely delicious, as well.

The room is open, comfortable and not pretentious.
The managers were working the room and ensuring all the guests were pleased with their meals. 

The prices are very fair considering the high quality of the food.

I got the lamb gyro combo, and the dolmades. I love that they don't drown the gyro in dzadziki sauce. The meat is spiced properly, and there is a freaking ton of it.

Instead, they use steam cooking (蒸氣火鍋) in order to ensure that all of their seafood and meats are served fresh with the original tastes and flavours intact.  In other words, it is ""an innovative way of serving hot pot, keeping the food as fresh as possible with no extra additives"".  Their intention is also for you to enjoy food the way it is meant to be served -- natural and without seasoning.  In our busy world, it is so easy to get caught up eating processed and over-seasoned food that our taste buds become over sensitized.  At Day & Night Angus Beef Hot Pot, you can re-introduce your taste buds to enjoy food in its natural state again!

I was next also very impressed with the Grilled Spain Iberico Pork Kebab.  Iberico Pork Kebabs are not cheap and this pork meat was definitely high-quality.  I loved how it was slightly seasoned with some salt and white sesame seeds but otherwise maintained its true taste (just like the beef kebab).  I could already tell that I was in for an amazing rest of the night because the ingredients used were just so premium and delicious!

The Vancouver Clams were the first seafood to go inside of the steamer.  These Vancouver clams were steamed for two minutes.  After the two minutes were up, the steamer beeped to let you know that they were done.  I loved this technology!  I also really delighted in watching each of the clams open up as they were being steamed.  I took many videos throughout the night to capture this experience too -- a photo or two wouldn't do it enough justice.

The taste of the steamed lobster was definitely fresh.  It's important to have fresh seafood when you are steaming the food like this otherwise it's very easy to tell when something is not fresh.  The taste of the steamed lobster was so fresh that it actually reminded me of the seafood that I have had in Hong Kong before.  Hong Kong has some of the best tasting and freshest seafood in the world because they are a fishing city and have access to live seafood all the time.  I was impressed to be tasting such similarly fresh-tasting seafood here right in the GTA!  (And that is rare!)",2016-11-13 02:44:41

The tables consists of a white plastic table cover  which (after the meal and they've taken the plates) they remove. Aesthetically it may not look great but it does save time rather than cleaning/scrubbing an actual table cover. This is an establishment that is also very clean!

Food: I've mainly gone here for dimsum. From har gow to friend tentacles and delicious chicken feet. I really do enjoy eating dim sum here. Rather than them moving from table to table with a cart of dim sum, you are given a paper menu listing what they have and you order from there. The food arrives hot and delicious!

Price: Rol San is on the pricier side. I think I'v spent more money there compared to other dim sum places but then again as I stated above, thee food is delicious and the place is clean!

Since relocating to the southeast Henderson part of the valley 5 years ago, this has become my favorite location. It is a pretty good sign when the faces of the staff never change. They are well appreciated with good tips by regulars like myself and don't leave. 

It is like my ""Cheers"" because I can go there alone and sit at the counter, or bring in a group and I am known. I always get quality service. I know that I am recognized as a regular, but I observe a consistency for everyone.

The food servings are always ample and quite reasonably priced. I love bringing guests with kids here because of the Balloon Lady making the rounds with entertaining balloon creations. A young man serves as doorman and greeter while selling the Sunday paper. 

The staff is always friendly, courteous and accommodating even when they get slammed on Sunday mornings. Make sure to arrive before 8:30AM on Sundays if you don't want to wait for a table. 

I enjoy the Omelet House and am so at home that I don't see any flaws. It was recently pointed out to me by a guest that the restaurant's carpeted floor is not a hygienic choice. I have to agree.

The deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national TV that it's one of the best places to eat in the Burgh.  She was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.

There was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.

When you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.

After looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.

The service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.

Everything in here is interesting to look at.  While we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  Each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  Even the bathrooms were nifty.

I, however, cannot speak of the brews.  As I was driving, but I'm sure I will be back to partake in one or more.",2013-08-17 00:35:48

Our waiter was more than helpful. For whatever reason, we were given one waiter for our large group, so he was constantly getting this and checking on this.

It is an upscale fine dining restaurant that features Spanish tapas (or sharing plates). Simone and I arrived in our finest t-shirts, shorts and sneakers. Although not exactly dressed for a formal dinner, I let the hostess know I had made a reservation and we were quickly escorted past the rich and almost famous to the corner table at the far end of the dining room. Reservations are an absolute necessity if you plan to get a table at this restaurant (especially when dressed like a tourist from Maine).After being seated, our very formal waiter quickly offered us a very expensive wine menu and so we decided to get a diet soda and water ( from the tap). We looked over the menu and decided that we wanted to try the Paella as our entree that we would share. The Paella takes at least 35 minutes to prepare so we placed our order before deciding on our smaller tapas plates. First up we decided on a plate of marinated olives. When they arrived we realized that they were not pitted, so we had fun seeing who could make the biggest mess while trying to get the pits out. The waiter seemed amused by this. The olives were very good and were marinated in roasted garlic and baby onions. For our second tapas we decided to get more adventurous and ordered the Albondigas, which were mini Meatballs cooked in a Tomato and Sherry Sauce. They were some of the most tender meatballs I have ever eaten and they just melted in the mouth. The sauce was mild and light with a nice hint of sherry and also included some roasted baby potatoes.  Our last tapas choice was the new age Egg Potato & Morcilla dish. The dish was a combination of sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Blood Sausage with a soft poached egg, atop a pool of Potato Foam topped with Manchego Cheese Air. This dish was truly memorable and one of the most unique things I have ever eaten. The richness of the sausage and egg combined magicaly with the smokey earthiness of the mushrooms and the potato foam and Manchego air melted away to create a creamy sauce for it all. This dish was a real culinary adventure.  Our Valencia Paella was ready and came to the table piping hot and served in the cast iron pan it was cooked in. It was a delicious combination of baked Saffron laced Spanish rice with house made Chorizo sausage, sauteed Rabbit and tender grilled Chicken topped of with roasted Haricot Verde Green Beans.  We managed to finish off the rather large Paella meal, and then wrapped things up with a dessert tapas of Almond Sponge Cake with Homemade Almond Ice Cream. It was super dense, super moist and super good.  Our entire meal and experience at Julian Serrano was one that I will not soon forget. It was creative, unique and prepared perfectly.

Based on the quality, I presume CBW is a craft brew pub. There is an interesting selection of rotating beers. I will definitely attempt to acquire more CBW beer in the future; unfortunately, I don't think it will be at this venue.

To start, it took about 10 minutes to get the attention of one of the bartenders. That's just too long especially when everyone is ordering just beer. Also, the bartender brought us the wrong beers. We ordered the belgian tripels, and he be brought us american barleywines. I should have noticed from the color and said something immediately, but I decided to give it a shot with the likely chance that I was wrong. Upon tasting, my suspicion was confirmed; however, I really enjoyed the style, so I didn't ask the bartender to correct it. I'm glad I tried something new, yet it shouldn't have happened this way.

The atmosphere is very similar to Hofbrauhaus'. It's very loud with a eclectic clientele; similar to Hofbrauhaus, there are many family casually dining. one big difference is that no one is dancing on their seat.

It's down off of Fremont St. near the Mob Museum. No street parking so you'll have to park elsewhere and walk there, which isn't too bad. 

The inside is obviously completely remodeled. They have a bar area, a ""living room"" area to hang out in, and the backyard area.

The living room area is interesting. There's tables, a giant cornhole game in the middle, fooseball, pool table, and a Games area that has lots of board games under lock and key. You can rent them for free if you give them your ID, but NOBODY is ever there. I always end up grabbing random staff because no one will help you if you don't force them to. There's a trippy little room next to it that's some kind of ""art gallery"" but it's very tiny and pretty much all glow in the dark/techno light ambiance.

Classic. Without a doubt I would definitely recommend this joint and can't wait to venture out to this location again!",2012-08-20 00:31:53

You can't help but stumble upon item after item of unique and delightful items to try.

They have a fine offering of beverages from non-alcoholic to great wines at super reasonable prices. We have been satisfied with every thing that we have purchased here.

This store in particular is located by a couple of our regular restaurant stops and my favorite. Well Suited.

Forewarning - you're going to see heavy usage of the word intense 

Veggie Tasting Menu w/ the ""Premium"" Wine Paring 

* 3 Melon salad - huge shavings of Honeydew, Cantaloupe, & teeny little balls of cucumber w/ slivers of Jalapeno & drizzled in Olive Oil 

* Asparagus Soup w/ Tomato Dumplings & Mushrooms - those dumplings were OMG gasp-provoking - intensely flavored w/ tomato & when paired w/ the equally intense flavor of the asparagus - wow!  Also had little mushrooms & roasted tomatoes in the middle of the soup so lots of yummy flavors to mix & match. This was 1 of my favs 

* Artichoke Souffle w/ Parmesan sauce - so smooth, rich & intense w/ artichoke flavor; not eggy at all & cooked just perfectly. This was 1 of my favs 

* Ricotta Truffle Fettuccine - teeny tiny carrots, green beans, and these absolutely incredibly tasty large brown beans (don't know what they were) are nestled in long-as-your-arm, hand-rolled fettuccine noodles. Huge flavors of truffle!! 

* Cherry Semolina Cake w/ Sherry-infused Ice Cream - moist semolina cake w/ marinated cherries and an intensely-flavored Sherry Ice Cream. Light dessert which topped off the meal just perfectly 

* Amuse Bouche was Goat Cheese Panna Cotta w/ Tomato Gelee. We didn't get to try this dish b/c Panna Cotta is usually made from gelatin & those of us in the veggie world know gelatin is a no-no. Our waiter was so kind & apologetic & he had the chef make us a special Amuse Bouche of Melon & Tomatoes which was so nice! 

But he then came over later to tell us upon further research, he uncovered the gelatin they use for the Panna Cotta was actually made out of Agar so it was completely Veggie-friendly!  He said they make it a special point to design all their Amuses so that everyone can enjoy.....they take care to incorporate the Veggie and Allergy people - so no animal, shellfish or nuts go into the Amuses 

HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! 

Service was incredible & everyone was so friendly - immediately asked if we were on a timetable (which we were!) so they could get us out & on our way - explained each dish as it was delivered & how it was made; asked if we liked it; The Sommelier explained each wine, where it came from & the vintage & came back to ask if we liked it.....it was true 5-star treatment

The vibe and decor are pretty cool. We came here to meet some friends for beer specials (which are apparently very reasonable on Fridays) and shared a plate of nachos. Decently sized, but we had to put a lot of cholula and their habanero sauce on the chicken to give it some sort of taste.

The Curve is an old school greasy spoon diner  with absolutely amazing breakfast food, for low prices.  It has a down-home feel and quick friendly service.

The typical breakfast fare such as a plate of bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast is great, but some of their special's are just out of this world.  One morning they fixed me Potatoes Luigi, and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  It was a massive plate of potatoes, scrambled eggs, Italian sausage, chopped onions and green peppers all mixed together in one glorious combination.  

While not on the menu, they're famous for ""the homewrecker sandwich"" which you can request at any time.  This sandwich is a heaping helping of breakfast ham, topped with fried eggs and melted American cheese between two thick cut pieces of toast.

They have a huge menu. They have one menu for food and one menu for desserts. They also serve alcoholic drinks. I'm surprised by how large of a selection of desserts they have. The prices of the desserts though... seem to be a little too high.... I mean the desserts are wayyyy overpriced. 

Some of the cakes cost ($14.95)... this is for a single slice of cake... ummmkayy...  they also have Mille crepe cakes. These were prices at $12.99. This is like $5 more expensive than Millie's creperie. The portion is probably not that big either. You're probably better off getting a crepe cake else where, or maybe two.. Another thing that seems pretty overpriced is the molten tarts. These tarts are priced at $11.99 for two and they are not that big either... ummmm not worth. But pretty much most of their desserts are overpriced. But they have a nice variety. 

Food wise, the price seems more reasonably priced. Some things are better priced than others. 

I ordered the beef sukiyaki hot pot, peach green tea and the chocolate mochi waffle. 

Taiwanese beef sukiyaki hot pot ($17.95) - the broth was on the sweeter side, it doesn't taste that heavy. The portion of the meat was really little. Probably about 5 pieces. The meat was decent. The udon was good. The udon didn't taste plain. It was chewy and flavourful. The hot pot also came with a few other items like imitated crab meat, pork balls, fish tofu, tofu and mushrooms. It also came with an egg on the side. Make sure you cook the egg in the beginning otherwise it will not cook later. The taste was ok but not really filling. The presentation was nice. It came in a nice pot on top of a fire.  

Peach green tea ($4.99) - this was just a plain peach green tea with no tapioca or anything for $4.99. Kinda not worth it. It was pretty small. You're better off getting a large drink from chatime or gong cha instead for the same price. Flavour wise, it has a odd peach flavour. I prefer Chatime a peach green tea better. 

Chocolate mochi waffle ($10.99) - pictures are deceiving. I was expecting my chocolate mochi waffle to be actually chocolate flavour mochi. But it was just the regular plain flavours mochi. The texture of the mochi was chewy as it's rice cake. But I expecting the crust of the waffle to be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside but it wasn't. It was all chewy. Besides that, in the picture the chocolate mochi waffle was supposed to come with chocolate ice cream. But in my order it was vanilla instead. Besides Besides that, there was bananas on my waffle. This was something that I was totally not expecting because it wasn't in the descriptions. Besides besides besides that, there was chocolate and caramel sauce on my waffle. The menu never showed two different sauces in the waffle. It only showed chocolate sauce. Both theses sauces combined made the dessert extremely sweet. It was pretty disappointing. 

As for service. Service is extremely slow. The waiters most of the time would ignore you. It's so hard to get a hold of the waiters here. 

Design wise. The place looks pretty nice and cozy. The lighting is kinda dim. It was a nice looking place. 

Overall, food is okay, food price is ok. Dessert is meh. Dessert price is overpriced. Not worth",2017-03-28 14:18:08

A)  The Girls bathroom.  God bless it, there are at least 10 stalls, each with seperate full length doors, and a bathroom attendant in the main part.  A giant full length mirror, plenty of sinks and enough hair spray to get you through the night and all of the next day too.  The line?  It moves fast and you can watch the boys while you wait.  

B)  I have never ever been sober here.  Drinks are average for Scottsdale but for some reason they just TASTE better at Devils. Especially during HH on Thursdays or before 10 (I THINK) on Fridays where its two-for-one.  If you leave here sober, its your own fault.  

C)  The crowd.  Yes, its crowded...with people I LOVE.  Devil's goers arent pretentious like the ones you'd find scoffing at everyone at Six or Dirty Pretty, they are all there for the same thing--to get bombed and make out with someone.  And theres nothing wrong with that.  Girls (and some bonehead guys from out of town) dance on a handful of platforms on the dance floor, but there are also two other rooms to flirt your way through.  The ceiling opens up when its not a billion degrees out and its fairly easy to reserve a table and get bottle service for those nights youre feeling VIP.  

D) The music doesnt suck.

E)  Girls dont pay cover, and guys dont pay before 10.  If you cant afford ten freaking dollars to get into a bar, guys, you shouldnt be in Scottsdale.  Its as simple as that.  Even the hell hole that is Mickey's Hangover charges $5 to get in...girls included.  WTF?  

F)  No matter how drunk you get and how stupid you act, there is someone whos more drunk and more stupid.  And no one cares because everyones a drunken idiot and we've all been there.

- Lobster Mac & Cheese
I personally quite liked this dish, and it was a fairly decent sized appetizer, especially when shared with 2 people. I think the breading was subtle but added the texture that the dish needed. Perhaps, the cheese could've been even cheesier, as the pasta seemed to overpower it a bit.

- Gold Standard
The aged beef was easily cut with my knife. That's how I usually determine whether they cook medium rare the way I like it. However, the bun was a bit tough to slice through, and that's what ultimately made my meal messy. I do believe that the size of the aged beef was overwhelming in comparison to the condiments. For example, the cheese barely covered the bread.

- A-Chocolypse Now
I have an extreme obsession with chocolate and I can tell you right now that this drink was soooo good. I loved the addition of the little brownie. The server recommended that we try the shakes alcohol free, as it doesn't really do anything to change the drink's taste rather than serve as a novelty experience. My only problem with the drink was that it was so sweet, I got sick of it midway. My partner also got tired of his drink halfway so it was a waste of money. Consider sharing it with somebody. 

Food alone, I would rate this burger joint in comparison to other burger places at a solid 4.

Service added, it means more towards 4 1/2 due to the fact that our waiter helped us with all our choices on the menu from the moment we sat down. We appreciated his honest, personal opinions about each item we thought about ordering. Another waiter also took our pictures for us, and man... He definitely took it facing my good angle.

We herd this was a great place to try but to bring our own alcohol because of the liquor license not being valid yet. So we brought 3 bottles of nice Reisling and they had no problems popping them for us.

We ordered around 12 items from the menu. One of the unanimous winners was their Pork Belly. It was so delicious, and perfectly prepared. We also enjoyed the Beef Jerky, Wild Mushroom App, and their Lettuce Wraps with Coconut, and Ginger.
 
The worst of them all, by far, was the Strip steak which was extremely overcooked! So overcooked, we literally couldn't swallow it. Even the accompanied sauce was atrocious. The other dish which none of us cared for was their Wings which were dry and unappetizing. But overall the meal was good.

After maneuvering through the crowded parking lot and putting our names on the wait list, it became obvious that this all-you-can-eat spot is not just THEIR favorite but a fave among many. And for good reason... 

I love AYCE sushi restaurants because you can try a lot of new items. Sushi Kaya has a huge menu, from regular nigiri sushi to special rolls, tempura, and even Korean dishes like bulgogi and kimchi fried rice. We each basically stuck with sushi and rolls, although we shared some garlic edamame and seaweed salad. (The menu says ""no sharing,"" but that didn't seem to be a problem -- and why should it be?)

As usual, my husband and I ordered lots of eel and hamachi, with a variety of rolls. The black dragon roll (California roll with eel and avocado) was my favorite, but everything was good, and it was nice that you could order half rolls as well. I'd also never had mochi ice cream before, and on my friends' recommendation, I tried it for dessert. LOVED it! (My husband did not agree.) Reminded me of a small scoop of ice cream wrapped in Botan rice candy.

Service was quick and efficient, although one of my friends' orders was never delivered. But as it's AYCE, I say just order it again! (And if you come with a large party, you know someone will eat it!) Unfortunately, you don't want to eat garlic edamame while everyone else is eating mochi...

Sushi Kaya is right in the middle of Chinatown and, as I said, the (small) parking lot is a nightmare. But you can park right next door at Chinatown Plaza and walk over (which I suggest you do). And if the restaurant is too crowded, there are plenty of other choices nearby where you can dine. But I suggest that you wait and try Sushi Kaya. Good food, large menu, and -- although it's new to my palate -- MOCHI!",2014-08-13 04:43:18

I've been here numerous times over the past few years and have always walked away full and satisfied.  I've been with both larger and smaller groups and the staff is always accommodating and attentive.  If you plan on going on a weekend night, I would definitely recommend making a reservation to avoid a wait.  They have a decent beer selection and they make a good moscow mule ($11) too.  On the weekends this place can get a little loud with the music (sometimes they have live music too) and is loud just with the sheer amount of customers coming through so just be aware of that.      
 
Top Favorite Dishes:
-The New Yorker ($25) - 16"" crust, your basic pepperoni and sausage pizza amped up, comes with three different types of cheeses, the ricotta cheese adds a sweetness to the pizza that surprisingly works well with the other ingredients, I get filled up on 1-2 slices so I usually share this with one other person
-Classic Meatballs (6 for $9) - covered with marinara sauce in a balsamic vinegar reduction, great starter to kick off the meal
 
I've also had the Americano Pizza ($21) which was decent but too much toppings for me personally.  The La Regina ($32) is also really good but I don't usually get it because it is quite large and feeds 3-5 people alone.  Overall, I really like Pizza Rock and will continue to come back!",2016-08-14 10:37:04

It's probably our favorite Vegas Cirque show, followed by Michael Jackson One.  We also liked Zumanity and Zarkana, but fell asleep at ""O"" and didn't care for Beatles' Love.

KA has a pretty good storyline and some really cool acrobatics, martial arts, and some real creative puppetry.  Costumes were pretty cool - seems somewhat inspired by China or perhaps Korea during imperial times.  The moving stage really offers unique possibilities you typically don't see at other shows.  The soundtrack is also one of my favorites - I bought the CD many years ago and its definitely worth a download from itunes!

Why just 4 stars and not 5?  Somehow the wow factor this time just wasn't there.  Perhaps we're just getting older but somehow some of the fight scenes on the wall seemed slower, less intense, yet dragged on a bit.  I believe they may have altered the scenes slightly after the unfortunate accident they had a few years ago?

These bartenders seemingly give a damn about the quality of the drink they present you, so you can expect a great cocktail to meet your high standards on any given Sunday, or your low standards any given night. Not to mention, the times I've been there, the bartenders have been cool and that kind of attitude makes you want to come back.

I love Whole Foods in general, they always have the best selection of cheeses, wine, seafood..... This location does, but, it's so small!!! All departments are just squished and therefore lacking in the variety department.

I've never come to a WF and not found what I was looking for...... weird.

Besides that, their hot food bar is.....how to describe? lacking?? not fresh?? boring?? yes, those descriptions suffice. Even the salad bar is a little on the boring side for what you expect from a Whole Foods....they don't seem to change the offerings very often either... 

When I want to got to WF, I drive the few extra miles to the location on Ray and the 101 (just east of 101). It's big and beautiful with huge aisles, guaranteeing no cart bumps with other customers.

It took me a couple of weeks to actually make it over there, but once I did I was hooked! I have been there 3x so far. It can get really crowded for dine in, so be sure to expect a wait.. a wait well worth it. Carry-out is also an option I have done a few times.

The sashimi bento box was delicious. The fish is very fresh and they roll the sushi right in front of you. They have $1 nigiri which is phenomenal and very high quality.

We were a party of five, and ordered the following to share (as a side note, I did appreciate that we were given a sheet of paper to note down the menu numbers to avoid ordering confusion and to improve efficiencies):

Lamb Skewers:
This came in a set of four skewers - the tiny, gamey morsels of lamb were generously coated with a mixture of spices (cumin, pepper, chillies, etc.) and grilled/fried. It was addicting and delicious, but made my breath smell garlicky and cumin-y for a good couple hours after! My sister consumed a whole skewer and a half by herself. Our must-order every time we come!

Grilled Bean Curd Sheets:
First time ordering these, and they were oh so crispy! The bean curd sheets are coated in a similar mixture as the lamb skewers, and the crisp ends of the rolled sheets offer a nice crackle when you bite into them.

Scallion Pancake:
Didn't try this dish, so unfortunately can't really speak to it!

Fuqi Feipian:
Our classic must-order every time we go to a Northern Chinese place. The thin slices of beef come with cross sections of tendons; only complaint is that it was mostly beef flank and very little everything else. Perfect size for a small appetizer!

Braised Beef Noodles:
There is nothing more soothing and comforting than a good bowl of braised beef noodles. We got the ramen (hand-pulled kind, not the knife-cut ones), and I loved the pickled vegetables that came with the soup (there were three thin slices of pickled radish)! I was also delighted to find a slice of shiitake mushrooms, along with some pieces of beef tendon. The beef was braised quite tenderly - not bad.

Stir-fried Lamb Noodles:
We ordered this dish solely because we were captivated by a table that had made this order on our previous visit. Overall, it was eh. The gamey taste of the lamb didn't really come through, and so any other meat/protein could have been a substitute. Due to the overwhelming amount of Chinese celery, the dish had a strong celery flavour. There were also generous portions of tomatoes, and some fatty stringy lamb bits.

We showed up on a Tuesday when trying to find some place that would have Thai or Vietnamese food around 8pm. Easier said than done in the west valley this time during the week. It turned out to be a good thing.

Tapas Tuesday was an enjoyable experience. Wife wanted the bacon wrapped lychee. The lychee had a nice texture and... well... bacon. I wanted the Korean short ribs and was not disappointed at all.  I could totally see going back on a Tuesday and ordering 3 orders of that for dinner with a couple of friends :p

Portions vs prices were a bit off unless you came in for a special. The food is great but unless you are sticking with daily specials, it can get spendy. Also entrees do not come with any form of starch. No rice, noodles, etc.

That said the food was great and 3 tapas and 1 entree was plenty filling for 2 people.

As for the drinks. I ordered 1 martini. If you are a James Bond fan (aka vodka martini) you'll be fine. If I want a traditional one, I prefer gin. So I ordered something sweet (I think Blue Winter?). It was interesting, different from anything I've tried before, and not overpowering. That said I'm a big guy and 1 of them did give me a bit of some tipsy for a little bit. When the menu says that the drinks are strong, they are not kidding. Which is strange because it did not have any of that vodka bite to it. Martinis are $10 or $11 but one of the daily specials has them $3 off and we didn't look at the happy hour specials (we were on the restaurant side).

Overall, I'd definitely go back. Tuesday seems like a great day because the tapas were enjoyable and that's a good way to get some variety. If I want more of a main dish style or a big bowl of pho, though, I'd go somewhere else. Hangout, drinks, or tapas seem to be their speciality!",2013-07-18 19:54:32

First off, I waited around 5 or more minutes to be acknowledged and seated. There was a woman waiting ahead of me who seemed to be getting impatient for the wait as well, and when the hostess finally acknowledged her the lady stated she simply just wanted a coffee. I should have just left at that point since The Normal can't even host/acknowledge guests appropriately. 

I had not even sat down yet when the server asked me what I wanted to eat. I don't know??? I've never been there before and hadn't even looked at the menu yet. I decided to order The Fit which sounded really simple,  just egg whites, tomatoes, avocado and sausage. I also ordered a side of the hash browns. $13. (Pictured) 

The egg whites/avocado/tomato were fine. The sausage was inedible and tasted awful. It tasted like the frozen sausage patties that they would serve in public schools for breakfast, but worse. They were dry.  The hash browns were hard and cold by the time they got to my table. Would have tasted better if they were warmer or not dried out. Oh well ‍. I wasn't surprised with the food at that point.  

I still had 70% of the food on my plate when the server asked me ""are you done?"" I was kind of taken back when she asked me that because I still had quite of bit of food on my plate, so I told her no,  but would like the check. 

After waiting for a long time and then being rushed through my meal, I will not be coming back here. I can liv with the food being mediocre but the service was disappointing.

I had a falafel salad that was just covered in the most rank and odiferous onions known to mankind. My second visit, I wised up and got the falafel sandwich-no-onions, which was wrapped in a half-reheated and totally dried out pita and covered in said devil onions. Now, mind you, lunch and a pop there will easily put you out $10. That's too much money to leave unsatisfied, with roaring heartburn and breath that would singe Satan's chest hair off.

Plus, the people taking orders are impatient and a little snotty. Sorry if you've run out of patience trying to explain falafel to Middle America. Please don't take it out on everyone else.

Three times may be a charm, but I don't think I'll be back to this location...",2010-01-22 04:40:58

We started with crispy rolls, dumplings, and soups. They have both great egg drop and hot n sour. I was in one of those moods where I wanted everything on the menu. Our server suggested a beef dish and to add some veggies. He nailed it. Delicious. Our table also ordered chicken pho, one of the vermicelli bowls, and General Tso's chicken. It was all great. Also, kudos to our server. Not only was he great, he was also very honest and hysterical. Note: On Sundays, they offer a buffet.

One of my favorite things about this place is the fish tank behind the register. It is filled with monster goldfish and I get lost staring into it every time. I need this in my house.",2018-05-01 02:21:39

My most notable experience was when I came here for thanksgiving dinner. This was the first time having dinner out on thanksgiving.  I  usually do the cooking but felt like trying something different.  The menu was extremely limited and over priced.  Despite having reservations we still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated.  The turkey was dry and lukewarm.  The rest of the meal was inedible.  For the 300 we spent to feed 6 of us I would have much rather gone to Denny's and paid a fraction for better service and food. I brought up the issues to management and corporate but I was ignored. To me it feels like they simply don't care.

Despite that massive let down, I opted to try them again figuring a holiday probably isn't the best time for them. In this occasion I ordered a salmon dish and what I got was bland and over cooked. The service was also lacking.  I love salmon and was quite let down.

This next, and most recent occasion was this past Friday.  My family was treated out for a celebration of a special event for my wife. We had a reservation and this time we were seated promptly. The food was better, but not worth what they charge. My wife had their ultimate fish and chips. While the fried fish and shrimp were good, the tilapia was lacking in seasoning. The fries aren't anything to speak of either. 
I had the widow maker burger figuring how could they screw up something so simple and I was also excited about a burger with onion rings, avocado, and bacon topping it. Unfortunately they must have run out of avocado because of the 4 people in our party who ordered this burger, mine was the only one to be missing the avocado. It's a giant burger but I just felt really let down by them again. Since it was late and we all wanted to leave as well as the fact that it was close to closing I just kept my disappointment to myself. By the time I would have been provided with avocado, everyone would have been ready to go and I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it anyway. 

I really try hard to like this place. I keep wanting to give them opportunities to make up for issues in the past but time after time I am met with dissatisfaction and disappointment.",2015-05-03 07:14:16

I went to ASU and I lived in the East Valley forever so I've tried all the great pho places there.  I also worked in Phoenix, so I've tried all of the Vietnamese places there also.  
However, this hidden gem right off of downtown Glendale takes the cake!
The food is great and the ambience/atmosphere can't be beat!  
This place makes all the other places look like dumps!  We usually let them get away with that because the food is so good, but this place doesn't let only their food speak for themselves!  It is a small house converted into a restaurant, so they have little rooms all over, giving you a nice cozy feeling.  They also have a huge fish tank with huuuuuuge goldfish and koi.  The little ones were all over the tank.

Now to the food!
I went with a girl and her almost  2 yr. old baby, and we ordered the gamut of typical Vietnamese fare ordered at an establishment. 
Pho with combination of meats, Egg Rolls, Spring Rolls, and the Pork chop with rice entreé with fried egg.  Everything was delicious.  If I wanted to nitpick, the peanut sauce wasn't very good and the egg rolls very pretty petite.  The spring rolls ended up being dipped rest of the way in the sweet fish sauce and the obviously homemade egg rolls made up in flavor what they lacked in size.  Even the very picky baby gobbled them up!  She usually never eats anything but she was pigging out here!

It was pretty chilly at night so we had the hot tea and the jasmine tea was very good as well.  

The pho was HUUUUGE.  You usually have to order the large to get that size at other restaurants but this was their standard size.  The broth was very good and not overpowering.  The meat balls were very good, different from what all the other places seem to use.  Maybe they make their own???
They were missing the brisket, which usually is my favorite, because it has the flavorful chewy fat along the meat; and it seemed to be replaced with leaner but better quality slices.  
One nitpick I have with the pho was that since the broth was so hot, it completely cooked the raw meats and I like my meat pretty rare.  

Now that I think about it, I didn't really even look at the prices, I was too craving the pho and distracted with the baby. But with a thai boba iced tea, all of that came out a little for 40 dollars, so I would have to say it is a little more pricey than other Vietnamese restaurants, where I usually feel as if I've robbed them, eating so well for so little.  

Until this last paragraph, I had this place at 5 stars... The price knocks of a star for a solid four.  

A great place to take a date but just to get your pho-fix, its a little pricey!

The mahi mahi leftovers I took home were still good the next day and didn't have that offensive fish odor, so I could tell the fish they use is very high quality. It also came with a soy wasabi sauce that gave the fish that extra kick. The kalbi had the most delicious char which I even enjoyed, and I'm not a bit steak-eater at all.

We aren't the type of people to eat at Jack in the Box, Chili's or Burger King, although that made for funny jokes on the way there. While I was driving, my dinner companion pulled out her iPhone and found this little place, so we decided to give it a shot.

It's certainly not a fancy place. English isn't too common here.

We both ordered different variations of the ""Bun"". Apparently pronounced ""Boon"". Essentially, this is Pho without the broth. Perfect for Arizona weather. At least....spring/summer weather.

The meat was a tad overcooked, but overall tasty. My friend ordered a side of broth with hers. It was a bit greasy. 

My one criticism with my Bun, was the egg roll. A spring roll would've been a better choice, but that's the health nut in me.

We started with the venison tartar, you shouldn't miss it! Delicious! Then, came the main dish: the three-way musk ox - now, this is THE THING, YOU WANT THAT. It's a musk-ox sausage, musk-ox tenderloin and musk-ox ragu served with magic sauce and everything delicious. The tenderloin is SOOO TENDER you can't believe it's not butter (ha).  It's one of those things you have to try before you die. I'm glad I did.

I've been to other franchises of the chain and have always marveled at the sheer scale of this retail operation. Probably ranks up there as best place to hide out and loot during an impending worldwide zombie attack.

I was drawn here by their advertised sale on polo shirts, which were a great value at around $13 a pop. Of course, these were the lowest quality of all of the polo shirt selection on hand, so I just bought one, but I threw down a little extra cash for some other better-quality shirts. I liked the color palette they offered, unlike my experience at other retail clothing outlets where the color schemes are tailored to the youngest generation of hip-hop wannabes who apparently can't work enough lime green or pink into their wardrobe.

I even bought a ""performance fabric"" T-shirt for working out in. It was so light and breathable, it felt like wearing an air drape. I'm afraid I can no longer hang with a ratty old cotton T-shirt for my gym togs. It winds up a soggy mess in the bottom of my gym bag anyhow. Now I have wicking technology, antimicrobial, bitchin' synthetic fibers righteously keeping me cool. And the prices were quite reasonable if you avoid some of the overpriced items.

Came here on a weekday with 2 of my bros and this place is relatively small for Markham standards.  It only has around 6 tables and a TINY parking lot, but the good news is, that parking lot is only for that restaurant so parking shouldn't be an issue.

I ordered the Fully Loaded Shio Ramen, The Fully Loaded option comes with double of every toppings so it was a great size for me.  I wish they would also offer double noodle option but they don't have it.  Ramen itself is very good; noodles have great texture and chewy, the pork bellies were very tender and tasted great!  Only negatives I have about the ramen is the soup base is a little salty compare to other ramen places, but the server already warned me the Shio is a little saltier.  But for my standard, it is still acceptable.

We also ordered wings which was very good!  $6 for 3 chicken wings with an interesting chashu sauce and they were great size and tasted great!  Overall, great experience at Kyouka, fully deserves the 4 stars.

Now that I have my subscription, I can't imagine how much money I'll save this year on shows I'd have gone to anyway, let alone all the great events and shows I'll now try that before I wouldn't have bothered with. This is a MUST for Las Vegas locals!",2013-05-30 15:51:23

There were a lot of people there; there's a big picture menu on the wall, and various hibachi and noodle choices.  The food wasn't in steam trays in the counter like at a megamall food court; you order at the counter, and they bring it out to your table.

I got noodles (""yakisoba"") with chicken (choice of hibachi or teriyaki, I got teriyaki).  It tasted pretty boring, like bland American-""Chinese"" noodles in brown sauce.  Including a Coke, it came out to $8.  I'll have to go back and try something different next time.",2012-11-18 19:25:32

The lineups are always long.  I see them all the time when I'm driving by.  If you don't want to line up, start lining up at 11:15am. I did that on a Sat morning and we were about 15 ppl deep in line and one of the first group seated.

Their clam soup is what they are famous for.  It's a nice clean soup but unfortunately I'm just not a fan of it.  Also tried the Tonkotsu black and that soup was very rich and flavourful.  Its one of the better Tonkotsu Ramens in town for sure.

Service was nice, typical Japanese style politeness. But that's why I was surprised the bill seemed rushed.  Although they did not ask us to speed up, showing up with the bill and payment machine in hand while we are still eating does seem a little intrusive and ruins the experience.

It's possible I just don't know how to appreciate their signature soup base but I'm not entirely sure I was blown away by it when I walked in with Michelin star recommendation expectations.

We had the pleasure of stopping in just in time for a tour of the brewery. Matt and Todd are super cool guys. They teach you so much about what you're drinking. Definitely worth the time if you have it. 

They do it right here. Everything is done with an explanation. Ask Todd or one of the brewers. They'll give you the whole story and more if you let them. 

When you sit at the bar, ask for a flight. They'll let you sample everything they've tapped in the back. Great way to find what your range of hops is. My wife really appreciate this. When it comes to a new brewery in town, it's good to see what their range is. Very generous. 

This place rolls out a litany of beers every month. The best I've had so far are Midnight Madness, Hop, Drop & Roll, CoCo Loco and any of the NoDaryzed series. 

Stop in for a few pints and definitely stick around and enjoy the atmosphere. Grab a growler on your way out. Pretty sure refills are anywhere from $12-$13. Great deal.

Best Buy had been advertising a 50"" TV for $199 online and in print for weeks leading up to Black Friday. I showed up with my friend to wait in line 5 hours before the doors open. We were number 10 in line. After waiting FIVE hours employees came out and started handing out entry tickets. We asked several if we would get one of the TVs and they all said ""yes"" because we were so close to the front door.

By the time opening time came at 5pm the line was around the entire building. We start filing in like cattle and would you believe they only had 3 TV sets!!!! The line of people almost rioted and people started throwing things at the store. Not to mention that approximately 100 drove up and cut in line in front of everyone.

Apparently Best Buy thinks it's funny to con their customers into waiting for 5 hours in line for advertised products that they don't even have in stock.

I ended up buying three TVs at Walmart for $30 more each. So Walmart got my business. I will NEVER step foot in Best Buy again.

We live super close to the water park & just never really got around to visiting.  The swim event provided us w/ the perfect opportunity to check out the entire park for free & we absolutely loved it!  We met up w/ family & friends, total of 6 adults & 6 kids and we all had such an awesome day.  The free swim event allowed for one parent per child for free entry.  Since we only have one child and both my husband & I wanted to go we purchased a single Adult Daily Pass at Nellis Airforce Base for $25 (Hubby is a veteran).  Parking was free for the event but normally $7.  I used to LOVE the old Wet-n-Wild as a kid way back in the day & was so happy they decided to open up a new one, close to home.  The new park is a lot smaller or maybe just felt that way as an adult now but still tons of fun!  They have an awesome toddler & kid's area w/ lots of smaller slides & splash zones geared for children ages 3 & up.  My fav was the lazy river, I'm such a chicken w/ rides, lol.  They have life jacket type floaties for the lil ones to use so no need to bring your own unless thats your thing.  They also have plenty of canopy & umbrella shaded areas w/ chairs & loungers so no need to rent a cabana unless your foo foo & need a butler to serve your ass, lol.  We brought in water & snacks (they permit bottled water as long as they are sealed & snacks no larger than 3.5oz). We bought lunch at the park, we ordered the chicken sandwich w/ fries entree & the chicken wrap w/ fruit entree (drinks sold separately).  Reasonably priced & pretty yummy for park food, our total was less than $20.  I did splurge on a regular sized Icee which was around $5 but so worth it for such a hot day under the sun.  The fam & I had such a great time, we're probably gonna grab ourselves season passes next time.  Such an excellent place to spend the day w/ the fam.  

July 14, 2016

So we ended up purchasing 3 season tickets for $185 at the base and literally the next day Wet-n-Wild has a new promo going: buy a daily pass for $39.99 & get the rest of the season free.  Bum deal for us, could've saved a bit had we known about the promo.  I had to knock off a couple stars cause the last two times we went in, the bag checker had beef w/ us bringing in snacks for my toddler son.  Per Wet-n-Wild's website:  Coolers may contain:

Baby-friendly snacks in 3.5 oz individual serving sizes (cracker packs, teething cookies, fruit snacks, etc)
Baby food in plastic containers
Factory-sealed water bottles

We get to the gate the other day & the bag checker has issues w/ us bringing in a 1.1/8oz snack size bag of chips.  The bag checker, Remy gave us a scolding, not sure why cause it meets their crappy cooler policy, but said he would allow it this one time.  So today we get there and there were two bag checkers, possibly one in training & wouldn't allow us to bring in a 1.9oz snack size pack of cookies and made us throw them out!  This was so freaking annoying cause all the snacks we have brought meet their policy.  So this time we ask to talk w/ a supervisor regarding their B.S. Cooler Policy.  We ended up speaking w/ Dominic, one of the supervisors and he apologized & admitted Wet-n-Wild was in the wrong for not allowing us to bring in the snacks.  He comped us 3 free meal vouchers and said he would inform his staff about following the correct policy.  I think its pretty crappy how strict their cooler policy is, they already make money off the tickets.  They are nickel & diming every consumer, not everyone wants to eat their park food, especially when the lines are ridiculously long & its not the healthiest food choices.  For many season ticket holders, going for just a few hours and bringing a little snack for our little ones really shouldn't be a problem.  Get it together Wet-n-Wild!!!",2016-07-16 22:44:06
l8WuDdf6lPWc0fXTTfHRNw,h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,2,2,1,1,"Full disclosure:  thanks to my adoration of the Cirque BEATLES LOVE show, I have an absolute AFFECTION for the Mirage Hotel.  I've stayed there maybe 8 times now and it's love at every sight.  This means I really wanted to LOVE Kokomos, okay?

Bias disclosed, I must admit I've only eaten at less than half of the restaurants in the Mirage.  I like BLT and the JAPONAIS, but I've always been intimidated by Kokomo's as being too too ritzy.  It also doesn't help that all over the internet (as here at Yelp) it's love it review, hate it review, love it review, hate it review.

Well my parents came to Vegas and were weary from flying -- and since they and my partner in crime love Steak and Fish houses like HOUSTONS (or any restaurant from the Hillstone Group), we figured Kokomos was just downstairs and wouldn't be awful.

It wasn't.  It was nice, but as the two stars indicate, I've experienced better.

Kokomos is the last restaurant from the original Mirage and feels as much somehow.  It's not vibrant, but a TIRED restaurant.  

Not the furnishings or decor, mind you.  I actually really like the idea of this place, a little 'cove' by fauna and water, hidden right in the middle of everything.  It is chill city if you're in the mood and the ambient casino people noise is really very pleasant.

By tired I don't mean the service was weak.  Everyone and their brother complains about the service here.   They're all nuts.  The only people who should complain are people in a hurry, and -- HELLO -- hit BLT if you want fast food.  The service was extremely friendly, attentive -- it was the best part of the meal.

So what was tired?  You guessed it:  the food.  Now by tired I don't mean lame.  It's just old school food with old school enthusiasm.  There was no mis-step on the table, but none of it was OMG we've got to come back.  The entire meal was 'nice'.... and 'nice' can be a bad thing in situations like this.  Why?  The menu prices were top dollar, the food wasn't.  And it's as simple as that.

The fix is stupid easy:  have the Hillstone Restaurant group absorb Kokomos and take over.  The menu would change a little, the quality would shoot through the roof.  The service would be fantastic, and in time you'd need to add an additional dining room.  Anyone who knows a good HOUSTONS knows exactly what I mean.

I love this type of old school menu and service.  Kokomos isn't a disaster, but doesn't deliver.

To end on a positive note, they recently added a vegetarian plate.  Not some lame pile of sides, but a collection of dishes prepared for the vegetarian.  The idea behind it was kind and my veggie partner appreciated it and enjoyed it, but she wasn't eager to have it ever again.  This consistent MEH response will kill any restaurant.

And, yes, Houston's has a veggie plate to die for.  Not to mention a homemade veggie burger which kills.",2012-03-08 21:48:55

I walked up to the dealership ready to test drive a new Passat. Cory came out and greeted me, asked me what I was looking for, features, etc. I told him my list of needs and he asked me if I had considered a Jetta. I told him no that they were too small. I wouldn't say he was pushy, but the next thing you know I'm sitting in the backseat of a Jetta impressed with how much room there is. 

Of course I had to take it for a drive and that's where I decided that Cory knew what I wanted even though I thought I wanted something else! 

I wasn't really ready to buy a car that day so I figured I would tell them I only wanted a certain color with specific options that I didn't see on the lot. To my surprise, Cory made a call and found THE EXACT VEHICLE I was asking for at their overflow lot. 

Again, I wasn't really ready to buy that day so I made sure I picked one of the most expensive Jettas they had and demanded a very unrealistic payment. 

This is where they lost 1 star. The first offer they came back with was $11k higher than what I asked for. I told them we were WAY too far off and I wasn't going to budge on my price. They held me keys captive and begged me to let them work the numbers a bit.  This process tool about an hour and a half. Way longer than I wanted to wait. Somehow though in that timeframe, they met my demands!!! Somehow they figured out a way to close that gap and get me into the car for the price I wanted!!! I'm still not really sure how I got that deal, even Cory seemed impressed. 

After that things went quickly. Finance was a breeze and didn't try pushing products I had no interest in. 

Overall, I'll buy my next VW from Cory at Camelback VW!!",2014-07-15 21:07:07

We had friends visiting from out of town so wanted to take the somewhere on the Ossington strip for good food and drinks after. If you've read some of my other reviews, I'm all about the total experience. Of course the food has to be good, but so should everything else in my humble opinion. Since we were a large party I booked in advance via email. I dealt with Lauren (one of the owners) and she was super communicative, friendly, and accommodating as I had to refine my reservation a few times. The decor is nice and warm and was perfect for our group. Cocktails were good and the food, served family style for sharing was very tasty and came in good portion sizes. We were totally stuffed by the end of our meal and had leftovers for home. 

If you're booking for a larger group they have very reasonable priced tasting menu style set menus. I def recommend going for it as it will save you the work of picking and choosing, yet you'll be able to sample the majority of items on their menu. 

The added charm of this place is that it's a family owned and operated resto and everyone seemed to pitch in at some point to interact with us, whether running food, filling water glasses or taking another drink order. All in all an extremely positive experience from start to finish. I even got a nice follow-up note from Lauren thanking us for coming in and inviting us to dine again.

Unfortunately it just didn't hit the spot for me.  The food they offer is a bit basic, which I suppose is acceptable since the restaurant is attached to the Graduate hotel and maybe they want to keep things simple for traveling guests who don't want anything too frivolous.  But I was hoping to find more options and a bit more flavor.
I ordered the Denver omelette.  This wasn't cooked like a traditional omelette where the toppings are incorporated into the eggs.  This was basically cooked like a quesadilla.  Where the eggs is folded over like a tortilla and it's just filled with the toppings in the middle with some cheese.  I wouldn't have normally minded this, but my egg ended up folding and flopping open and the toppings spilled out from the middle.  So I was stuck trying to scoop them all back inside.  Eventually I gave up and just had to spoon all the ingredients into my mouth at the same time so that I didn't feel like I was eating it all separate.  
Our server was very nice but also very forgetful.  We were a table of 5 and only have 4 sets of utensils. Prior to our food coming out, we were prepping the table and asked the server for an extra set of utensils.  She forget.  When the food finally came out we asked our server AND the food runner for the utensils again.  Again forgotten.  I think they got distracted with another table.  So instead my friend ended up grabbing one off a nearby table.  The server never came back with those utensils.
She also never came back to check on us once our food was delivered.
Then at the end of the meal when she was asking us for our checks, I asked her if I could have a cup of ice so that I may take my orange juice to go.  She left our table to gather our checks and returned to deliver them (in a cute novel might i add!).  No cup of ice in hand.  When we all handed her back the checks with our forms of payment I asked her again for a cup of ice. She then returned with our copies of the check and no cup of ice.  Come on!!
I ended up giving up because I didn't want to have to keep asking.

I love the endless selection of beers and the ""brew niversity"" gimmick that encourages you to try different beers for fun incentives like t-shirts, mugs, etc. The atmosphere is really cool. Big open space, lots of tvs with every major sporting event represented. Waitstaff is hit or miss. I've had some amazing servers/bartenders and some pretty bad ones too. Just depends on the night I guess. 

a lot of people seem to dislike the food, but I think it's alright. I like the chicken nachos and the wings and the cheesesteak is pretty good too. But I'm rating it as bar food and not on the same scale as a fancy restaurant. To me, the draw here is the beer. Not every bar has the goal of having an endless selection of beer, and it does its job.

Look no further than T. Cook's for the best place in Phoenix for a romantic dinner with your sweetie.  This place is tops in terms of atmosphere.  The grounds of the Royal Palms Resort are impeccable and the whole place has the vibe of a genteel estate you wish was handed down from generation to generation in your own family.  This place oozes Old World/Spanish Colonial charm in a good way.

Arrive a few minutes early and stroll the grounds before your dinner.  Check out the courtyard and the reflecting pool.  It's amazing to think that before this place underwent a multi-million dollar renovation, there was a pink heart-shaped pool on the grounds.  The kitsch is gone and this grand dame has been returned to her 1920s grace.  

Given the spectacular setting, T. Cook's doesn't have to be as good as it is.  The BF and I have enjoyed several fine meals at this restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is lovely, of course.  Check out the palm tree that grows up through the roof.  The room features colonial Spanish architecture, a vaulted ceiling and ubiquitous Old World elegance.  The service is also graceful and relaxed.   

As for the food, the real surprise is the seafood is at T. Cook's.  In fact, the very best seafood I have eaten in Phoenix has been at T. Cook's.  I am always a sucker for lobster bisque and the version at T. Cook's is top notch.  It's lush and silky and every bit as indulgent as lobster bisque should be.  The scallops are also outstanding and perfectly prepared.  I'm not one to order fish as my entree very often, but the BF and I have done that at T. Cook's with wonderful results.  Try the seafood here, it's truly spectacular.

T. Cook's is very proud of its fire-roasted specialties and the fireplace is gorgeous and really adds to the atmosphere.  One time our waiter suggested we try the Mediterranean paella with the optional  lobster tail and claw.  This was the one main dish we would not order again.  The paella tasted like it sat around partially cooked and then they just warmed it over the fire when we ordered it.  I'd never order this dish again, but I would not let this stand in my way of coming back to T. Cook's, either.

One time we tried the Cream Cheese Brulee because it's T. Cook's signature dessert.  It's a caramel cheesecake and vanilla creme brulee served with fresh berries and guava sauce.  Unfortunately, it was sickly, sickly sweet.  I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee in general and this one didn't alter my opinion.  However, other desserts were much better.

Stop by the Lounge at T. Cook's for an after-dinner aperitif.  The atmosphere is very cozy and this place is hopping many nights.

T. Cook's also has the Delos Room for private dining.  This would be a fabulous place for an intimate dinner with up to 12 friends.  What a great place for a milestone birthday or anniversary celebration.",2008-05-28 20:42:31

If you would like to dine, then I recommend a reservation.

For appetizer, I had the Lobster Bisque soup by recommendation of the bartender Michael. He was spot on with his recommendation. The soup was excellent. I cleaned the bowl with the warm bread we were given.

With his credibility established, we ordered a few other of Michael's recommendations: the Sirloin, the Porterhouse, and the Lobster Mac'n'Cheese. The steaks were the portions which they were advertised to be. Furthermore, they were both cooked to medium-rare as we requested; however, the outside of the steak was a bit too charred in some portions which led a few bites to be a little too ashy for the cost of the steaks.

The Lobster Mac'n'Cheese was surprisingly good. It was topped off with a crunchy ingredient to complement the lobster and macaroni which gave the dish an interesting texture.

All of Michael's recommendations were spot on, and he was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. Michael's co-bartender, Seth was also very friendly. The two also knew many of the patrons by name further demonstrating how friendly they were. The two were also quite knowledgeable of all of the drinks which were available.

Probably the most fresh mango & limes I have found in the area... plus, I had never tried cactus & they had a nice big bin of pads to choose from! 

Their fresh tortillas are amazing- I ended up going back to buy another package. But really loved the dairy & meat departments. Absolutely everything you need is conveniently stocked, including specialty items you cannot find elsewhere.

The only reason for 4 stars, is because the store is VERY cluttered. I really can't stand trying to get to an item on the shelf or maneuvering through an isle only to be blocked by an obnoxious display sitting there directly in the way. The same goes for the check out isle area... it is hard to get anywhere when you have bins & displays sitting all over the place & directly in a traffic area. Prices are also a bit steep, compared to the same, general (not specialty) goods at other stores.

You can walk straight into the bar during games for free, without a ticket, and find yourself a seat either at the bar itself or at one of the high tables. The tables closest to the field are, of course, reserved for ticket-holders only. But the further tables, if you can nab one, still have direct views of home plate. I love coming here with friends, especially when it's a mixed crowd of males/females, under my generalization that many of my female friends aren't big enough baseball fans to sit down and stare at the field in regular seats for 3 hours. If we come to Fridays instead, the focus isn't the field but simply the atmosphere and your company. You sit in a fun environment, order drinks and food from the menu, and just have a good time with friends. The game is viewable at every angle on tv's located throughout the bar. And every time something exciting happens, the crowd at the stadium gets loud and you can switch over to looking at the field to see what's happening. When a Dback hits a homerun, the bar lights up with excitement along with the rest of the stadium. It's a lot of fun. 

Four stars and not five because I think the management can do better in terms of service. 

With all that out of the way, let me tell you the story of what happened when I had lunch here for the very first time, when there wasn't a game going on.

My friend J and I walked into the lobby area of the stadium to take the elevator up to the restaurant. As we walked toward the elevator, a Mexican man (his nationality becomes relevant later, trust me) was discretely standing by it and he got into it with us. We rode up the elevator, got out at the restaurant, and told the host we were a party of two. However, as he walked us toward our table, unbeknownst to us the Mexican gentleman was walking right behind us. When we got to our booth, J had a seat, then I slid in behind him. And it was then that I saw the Mexican gentleman slide in behind ME. 

As J and I sat there soaking this incomprehensible scenario in for about 5 seconds, the host looked at me with an equally confused look on his face and asked, ""Uh, you only want two menus, right?"" I looked at the host. I looked at the Mexican, who was sitting right next to me in the booth looking straight ahead. I looked back at the host, and said, ""Um. He's not with us."" The host looked back at me with a mix of--if you can imagine it--confusion and suspicion. I looked at the Mexican. J looked at me and the Mexican in total bewilderment. The Mexican finally turned to me and said something in Spanish. Conveniently, I speak 3 different languages. Unfortunately none of them happens to be the most prevalent second language in the state in which I've grown up. So I told him, ""No hablo espanol!""

At that point the Mexican said something to the host (who was Hispanic American) in Spanish, and he slowly got out of the booth and the two walked away. Our waitress came to us about a minute later and not having seen what just transpired, asked us, ""Is it just the two of you today?"" We burst out laughing.

The host later told us that as he had walked the Mexican out of the restaurant, he told him that we had supposedly invited him to have lunch with us. Neither me, J, the waitress, nor the host could figure out the mysterious tactic this person was trying to apparently use to get a free lunch out of us. 

So that's the story. I think it's safe to assume that this will not happen to you if you decide to eat here. But it is pretty damn funny so I had to include it in the review.",2006-10-08 02:16:53

Time after time it seemed like the servers just take their time and not care if you have your drinks filled or if you need anything. We have had to go to the kitchen door where they walk in to ask where our waitress was!!

We are still got the Hershey chocolate shakes which was really yummy! at first I didn't think it was too good but then I realized I was using the regular soda straw to drink from it not recommended...

When I realize what I should have been using which is a big round red straw oh my god that shake was delicious and you could taste the Hershey chunks that come up from the bottom which was just as Ono!

Reason for the three stars was that it was really expensive ...our bill was 87 dollars for four burgers 2 malt shakes and 2 sodas. They do have TVs there where you can watch whatever sports is on so that was cool..

As for the seats they're really close together so the person that was sitting behind me kept bumping his chair into my chair which was a little annoying....

Yes, I said it - Stunning. We went back for the 3rd time in 2 weeks to enjoy Fukuda, and were again extraordinarily pleased. The service was excellent - the nice young lady who seated us was friendly, conversant, and honestly fun to talk to... all the while without being overbearing or intrusive. We sat at the sushi bar this time, and I must say, it's my favorite place to sit here. (Reminds me of when we sat at 12 bis at Taiilevent!)

From start to finish, our experience last Friday was fantastic. (Except for the sushi rice, but more on that later...) We love the changing menu, and this time we focused on the izakaya feel to this restaurant, focusing on the appetizers rather than the sushi (even though the fish quality is astounding). 

We heartily enjoyed the oysters with ponzu, pork belly, yakitori, grilled shiitakes, tofu, and takoyakis. The sushi we had was great - although we noticed that the rice appeared to be long-grain rice and was a bit undercooked. While many would condemn this, I am willing to forego extreme criticism because this group appears to be trying very hard to elevate and develop their cuisine, and I honestly believe they are destined for great success.

We are true believers, and rest assured, we shall be back again, and again, and again... Arigato gozaimasu!",2013-02-01 02:15:59

Venue - I saw the establishment first from inside the plaza like indoors - and thought it looked a bit.. old.  But yesterday, I had came in from the front and was relieved and surprised to see such a nice set up.  Okay, the roosters on the left side of the wall is a bit much.  I will not let that deter me from what else is to come. 

Service - Good.  I had a waitress who took care of my friends and I. 

Food - As others have mentioned, not ground breaking.  I was anxious about what I should order. The obvious being, chicken!  But I just did not feel for chicken last night. So I had help from Yelp's tips and reviews and I have ordered:

- Mac n' Cheese: Good, hot and piping good.  Cheesy and delicious.

What I ordered on my own
- Fried Oyster: It was okay.  I asked for an honest opinion that it is to die for, but.. it was mediocre.
- Lobster Bisque: It was good. Not bad

Price - It was a little pricey, hence I avoided the Scallop entrée (which I normally ALWAYS get). I just cannot bring myself to pay $19 + sides.. just.. not worth it to me. And the Yelpers helped steered me away from it. 

I left feeling content.  Would I come back, meh.  If my friends wanted me to come meet them up, I would.",2013-05-13 22:41:22

I came here with a friend on the first day it opened and from outside it looked like there weren't that many people but then when we opened the door, there was a queue of people right there. Someone came by us and wrote our names down, along with how many people. There was approximately 20 people infront of us and we waited for an hour. It was fine for me because I was talking to my friend. The dining area was really small and they really tried to maximize occupancy. Depending on where you are sitting, service would be a hassle. Besides that, I got the spicy red tonkotsu ramen and oh my goodness....I've never had something like that before. With the egg add-on, it was 100% worth it. I enjoyed every single spoonful and that I can say it left me with a really memorable taste. In the left side of the store, they also have a cafe, which I find a genius idea as people eating ramen who are not full to enjoy Japanese desserts right after.

First time there and the place was pretty busy.  They have an upstairs and a downstairs bar and some tables on both levels too.  The hostess suggested we try upstairs as it wasn't as busy.  And it wasn't so we easily got a seat.  

The place is nice, I can't complain about the décor.  They also had many beers on draft including crafts, and like a broken record I ordered me a Southern Tier IPA... It was glorious.  We looked over the menu for a while and I decided on a Ball Park Burger, cooked pink added jalapenos to it, and the vegetable of the day for the side.  The H got a flat bread they made special as a BBQ chicken one.  The bartender seemed really nice, and pretty attentive.  

As we waited for our food to come the upstairs started to get busier and busier, which also includes louder and drunker.  I can't exactly blame the bar for this but I absolutely can't stand someone putting their hand on the back of my chair, putting their foot on the foot rest and squeezing in every five minutes to order 5 crazy shots for him and his drunk friends!  So there was that.  How fun is it to eat with a stranger leaning on you????  Yea it ain't.  

So some more time passes and someone from the kitchen comes out to tell me they don't have any more vegetables.  Ok so I got the slaw, no biggy, so about 5 minutes later our food comes out.  The burger tasted good but alas they forgot the bacon on the burger! I am now kind of fighting to get the bartenders attention due to the spike in the rowdy, young, drunk crowd.  I asked nicely, ""Isn't this supposed to have bacon on it?""  She rolled her eyes and said ""yea let me guess they forgot?""  ding, ding, ding, and the winner goes to... Yea so anyhow she brings the bacon and I only ate  1/2 because I am trying to eat smaller portions, you know swimsuit season is right around the corner...  Well it was a good thing I only ate  1/2 cause my H was still really hungry.  The flatbread was small not a great size, and I usually get flatbread envy when he orders them, but not this time.  We were getting ready to leave and got our check.  I was a little upset they charged $.75 for me to add jalapenos when they almost stiffed me on bacon, and didn't have the side I ordered and didn't know it until 15 minutes after I ordered.  We scooped ourselves up and left.

What is not to love about this new Cityscape lunch spot?  One evening last week I saw that this place had just opened- seemingly out of nowhere.  The next day some coworkers and I went here and were impressed.  

It's all very straightforward, you can build your own for a certain (very reasonable) price and get unlimited toppings, or you can choose from one of their pre-made pizzas.  Several others made their own 'masterpieces', but I wanted to only get my feet wet so I had the Starving Artist Marghareta.  Mine came out really good (have posted a picture of it), but I wish I had just built my own and loaded on the toppings.  One of my colleagues said he felt guilty by the amount of meats he loaded his pizza with.  Another boldly claimed that this was his new favorite lunch spot.  We took a menu and shared it with some others in the office, and I expect that we will return often.

Well, I was wrong! It turns out I've been to Gold Spike during a Superhero Pub Crawl a couple years ago. The only thing recognizable now was the bar! What used to be a casino is now comfortable Love Sacs, modern furniture and decor, a bed, and various games. It's quite the transformation.

After admiring the area, Ruben and I settled down for a few games of Tic Tac Toe with a large version set on one of the tables. As we continued to venture, we discovered shuffleboard (deck version), cornhole, billiards, life-size connect four, and more. We also played a game of connect four, which we really enjoyed!

Another neat feature is an art installation by Miguel Rodriguez. You peer through curtained slots while sitting at a ""bar"" and it's neon paint and objects against a black backdrop. You may also be able to go inside?

The best part of this newly renovated Gold Spike is definitely the ""Backyard"" as they've coined it. Complete with synthetic grass, patio furniture, fire pits, additional cornhole games, life-size jenga, life-size beer pong, bullet trailer, and ""Cold Spike,"" their ice skating rink. Admission is $10 and skate rentals are $5, but I read that this is an all-day price like The Cosmopolitan. The rink looked nice and it's large compared to the others in town, however, I heard that it's not really ice! Which makes sense why they haven't shut it down yet and have no plans on closing it for the season until they figure out their next move (the attendant shared that it's possibly being converted into a roller rink). The furniture was rather dirty, so I didn't take the chance of sitting down, but we really enjoyed a game of life-size jenga! Make sure you wear shoes or run quickly when it falls! 

Overall, really cool place to chill with friends and grab a couple drinks. The only mood killer was the smell!! It reeks of bad bathroom freshener that was trying really hard to mask (rather than eliminate) odors, but failed miserably. It was hard to stay inside for a long period of time and you could still smell it while in the Backyard as well, though not as bad.",2014-01-19 20:34:09

Being a first timer, I was very overwhelmed by the options on the menu. The list was so extensive, I had no idea what was good and what wasn't, so it was one of those moments where I literally went with my server's recommendation. Gilbert, by the way, was fantastic, having a vast amount of knowledge on hot pot, and helped make my experience less intimidating. 

I ordered a variety of meats on their list in the end, not really knowing what to try. In the end, I think I can safely say that the Beef&Lamb combo was the winner for me. All the meat was such great quality, sometimes it felt like a shame for me to put it into a boiling pot instead of grilling it. Haha. 

On the other hand, this may just be silly old me, but I assumed that you don't really drink the broth because they gave us straining ladles, and there was no other utensil in sight for us to put the soup into our bowls. So yes, silly me, but also silly them for not giving us the right ladle (it was on my second visit where I learned you drink the broth too). It would've been helpful to know the first time before we spent a whopping $70+ on our meal, trying to get full but still left unsatisfied. 

On our second visit, we brought family, a party of 7 seated in a booth for 6. There was only one pot to share among 7 people, which we all felt was very inconvenient and uncomfortable. We had the right ladles, at the very least. Perhaps consider adding a 2nd hot pot for tables accommodating to larger parties so they don't all have to huddle around one small pot.

This restaurant is located very conveniently in the NYNY hotel and casino, right next to the main registration area.  It can be difficult in this hotel to find a decent, convenient place  for  breakfast.  The choices are not great - upscale places that are not open for breakfast or village eatery areas that are not the most comfortable for seating and also tend to be noisy. So, America was the choice for two breakfasts at NYNY.

Yes, prices tend to be high for what you get, but that's the situation with all strip locations.  My first breakfast was avocado/bacon omelette  served with sourdough toast.  It was okay - nothing to write home about, but not bad either.  The toast was buttered and rather good.  I had expected the avocado to be inside the omelette but it was served on top.  Again, nothing amazing, but it did the job. A-OK.  

Some people on Yelp have complained about the waiting time and service. I didn't experience any problems at all with service.  This is a BUSY place, being  centrally located, with  few other  very great alternatives for a basic good breakfast  at NYNY, so you can imagine that the staff is kept super super busy.  Me and my guest didn't have a long wait for our food.  About normal, I would say, for the amount of people there in the morning.  So, no complaints about service.  The servers were all very nice, courteous and helpful. 

We loved looking at the huge map of the U.S. suspended across the ceiling.  So fun, and great to take a photo  for your fam back home.

For the second breakfast, me and my guest searched  for a different place to eat, but gave up and came back to good ole America. We saw that they had donuts and pastries in the window out front, but didn't see anything there offhand that appealed.  So, we went in and were seated.  We both ordered their ""croissant donut""...and OMG.  Of everything we had for three days in Vegas, those croissant donuts were the BEST THING WE HAD. That's the truth, seriously.  They  are in several flavors - cinnamon sugar, honey drizzle, chocolate or  butterfinger.  We had the cinnamon sugar and it was TO DIE FOR.  They look like big double decker type donuts, but they are light as a feather inside because they are actually croissant-type dough. If you've ever had a ""cronut"", these are similar, but way better in my opinion.  Totally addictive.  Before I left for home, I bought two more to take with me, the honey and the chocolate.  The cinnamon is my fave of all the flavors.

So, I would definitely return to America if I go back to NYNY, if only for their donuts!",2018-05-20 16:11:28

The burger was large and tasty. The chicken breast sandwich was very large, juicy and flavorful. I liked the veggie cart to put my own toppings on it. It was clean and everything looked fresh.  Tons of options for non alcoholic fountain drinks including 3 different iced teas which always makes me happy. My only disappointment was I ordered the chicken and salad special but they must not have heard me because I received fries instead of salad.

We stopped into Turnhouse Grille around 5pm on a Sunday. The place was pretty quiet but we were welcomed in with open arms! Sat at the bar and proceeded to get the low down from the bar tender.

Turnhouse is not officially opened yet and is just doing a soft opening. They haven't advertised a ton just yet either. We absolutely loved the bartender, who was so enthusiastic and excited about her job. She showed us her different thoughts on future cocktails and her change-ups on some of the classics. She even keeps a running notebook of different funny names that come up around the city as an inspiration for future cocktail names. Halfway through our drinks, an owner (there are two, both were there) came in and shook our hands and introduced himself. It was cool getting this inside peak of the runnings of this place. 

The ambiance is fairly relaxed with a nice size bar, 2 tvs, and ample seating. Small mason jar candle lights at a nice touch. 

For this occasion, we stuck with just drinks (though the food menu looked amazing and we will definitely be back). I got the Booty Loop and my husband got a mixed drink that had whiskey (or bourbon...dont remember) in it and wine (odd I know!). Wish I would have remembered the name cause it was absolutely delish! The Booty Loop was super refreshing and the perfect balance of tart and sweet. I thought the cocktail prices were extremely well priced. 

I am so excited to have stumbled upon this place and can't wait to see the amazing things that come out of it. Go check it out! Great job guys!",2016-10-05 16:57:54

The food was outstanding and inventive.  Their Foie gras terraine was out of this world.  Our server set down each order and then brought out a huge slab of fresh hoeycomb and dramatically served each order a nice portion of the delicious honey. great balance of savory and sweet.  The grilled beef tartare was  another dish that was perfectly executed.  The yolk giving the overall dish a nice balanced richness too.  The homemade charcruterie platter was equally delicious as well as pleasing to the eyes.  

For our mains we ordered: Gaspesie arctic char filet: cauliflower puree, salt roasted celeriac, sea lettuce, sunflower seeds and oil; Duck magret: squash puree, roasted red kuri squash, mushrooms, morel sauce and immature juniper berries; Scallops: sunchoke, chinese artichoke, parsley roots, romanesco cabbage and preserved lemon; Bee wax poached veal sweetbreads: roasted onions, girolles, beets, raw honey gel and pollen.
Sweetbreads poached in beeswax, the delicate flavor of the sweetbread was not hindered by over cooking in one bit. The Duck Marget was outstanding and the the artic char was fresh in taste and accompanied well with the celeriac and cauliflower.  The scallops were cooked to a medium rare and it was the ideal cooking temp to have them done in.

Luna's is located in an upscale shopping center adjacent to an Anthropologie, and their menu features a wide range of smoothies (from green to berry to cacao), to juices, salads, raw dishes (e.g., manicotti), breads, and desserts.  

I tried the raw taco salad, which was excellent. The ""meat"" is made of walnuts, and the salsa is terrific.  Fresh avocado, black sesame seeds, crisp romaine lettuce, and gluten-free (I believe) taco shell round out the experience.  The salsa's raw onions are a little heavy if you're considering this and on a date night, however.  ;)

I loved the popeye smoothie, which is infused with hemp protein and spinach, so very good for your vegan muscles.  The apple juice and banana make it sweet and eminently palatable.

It was lunch and when we arrived the dining room was full. A small tight bar table or bar counter was offered, so we opted for the high top table across from the bar.

Prices seemed a little high so assuming large portions we ordered The $12 Artichoke Bottoms appetizer and a $15 meat pizza. Both were tasty, but we were served with a thimble size portion of regular Parmesan cheese to go with. A request for more was quickly delivered.

2 choices for Ice Tea offered, and my black tea was just fine and refilled several times. Our table was set with 1 roll up and food was delivered without fixing that. we grabbed one off the bar because it was in arms reach, and our server was pretty busy.

2.  Wolfberry and spicy yam ""floss"" dumplings was an experience where I wanted to close my eyes and say more - oh my ...

PROs:
- One of my friends was visiting from Italy and tells me that the pizza at The Porch is the closest he's had to northern Italian pizza EVER in the US.   I guess that's a good thing if you're looking for authentic Italian pizza.   I enjoyed the pizza; thin, crispy crust and NOT overloaded with toppings.  
- The sandwich and salad I had was fresh and crisp.
- The service was okay; friendly and prompt but the server did disappear and not check back after we had our entrees.

CONs:
- Out of several menu items on both visits, but that could be cost of serving fresh food.

It was my ""Happy Birthday to me"" celebration with family and a few friends and we had just come upstairs from happy hour at Winebar Kensington. I'm writing this review a little backwards, so let's start with the service...

Our server, Monroe, was amazing. So attentive to our little group all evening. He had excellent suggestions and made sure we were well cared for. When my dessert came out, there was even a little birthday candle on the board holding my Earl Grey crème brûlée.

Yes, you heard me right. I said Earl Grey crème brûlée. This is the very item that tipped the scales during my research for our little soirée. It was exactly as I had imagined. Not ice cold (thank goodness) with a firm crackle of sugar on top. The crème itself was already so lovely, and then the shortbread on the side... All I could say that night about the shortbread was ""it tastes like Christmas!""

From the steak, to the ravioli, everyone seemed to get healthy portions and great flavour. I ordered the cassoulet with duck and pork. Personally, had there been a magically self-refilling dish I never would have gotten to dessert! The pork and duck meat added great texture to the dish, which is primarily white beans. Seriously, this was the perfect meal on a day of crazy thunderstorms. 

The appetizers were also really lovely. Steak tartare, poutine with foie gras, more foie gras...did I mention the foie gras? The poutine showcased it perfectly as the warmth from the fries and duck gravy had the foie gras melting in your mouth. How can you go wrong here??!!

I was so incredibly happy with the evening that I will definitely be back again.",2016-08-10 02:09:52

They stand for local sourcing of organic and natural foods, artisan breads and friendly-outgoing customer service. Their slogan SEASONAL. FRESH. FLAVORFUL is true to it's words! 

The 2 of us took a romantic walk over the Scottsdale canal (hipsters may call it the Scottsdale Waterfront but I believe in calling it what it is) last night to FOODBAR. We have been hearing somethings about fresh, organic local and decided to check it out. There was a wonderful person there named Ruth who greeted us with a cheery smile and a sweet and helpful nature. 

The concept is simple.. a horseshoe shaped bar that you walk through and place your order. Well the problem is that there are several different menus including specials, sandwiches and hot foods. So you really have to think about things before you order. I didnt even know about the hot foods until I saw the chef plating up one of the juiciest looking chickens. I had already ordered or I would have been all over that! I think once the chef and manager figure out how to simplify the people will stop scratching their heads and eat. I have some suggestions for simplification even anyone from FOODBAR is reading!

We ordered a bacon and goat cheese flat bread.. a Cuban sandwich.. bbq sandwich and a white bean salad which was large enough to share. All the food was fantastic! The star was the white bean salad and the Cuban sandwich! The sandwich must have been close to a lb.. we could have easily shared that the flat bread and the salad and not had been as stuffed as we got! Oh, they also now serve wine and beer! The food we ate SCREAMED for wine! 

FOODBAR is very casual, comfortable and stands for many great things.. it's not pricey, we spent 35 bucks for the 2 of last night and I would say we over ordered. This will be a very cool place to order a few things and share some wine and conversation with. It's certainly going into regular rotation.",2007-07-26 13:48:36

Upon arrival, the restaurant has been truly renovated since the La Paz ownership & is beautiful. We sat outside and enjoyed the bread and sun dried tomato dipping sauce with proseco, which was very good. We decided to start with the octopus appetizer, which was undercooked, chewy and overall not something I would enjoy again. We explained the issue to the waiter and shortly after our waiter and the manager approached the table to apologize. The chef tasted it & realized it was very undercooked and threw that batch away. A few minutes later they brought a complimentary calamari, very nice, but that was just as undercooked as the octopus. 
On to the entrees...we ordered the chicken piccata & the gnocchi. The chicken was ok, however, the entire plate was oil, and I mean dripping! As for the gnocchi, another uncooked meal. They were doughy and mush.

I have eaten here several times and every single time my order was wrong.  Today I ordered 3 items and all of the 3 items were wrong.  I asked their employee several times to line a napkin in the Togo boxes for both the egg rolls and mozzarella triangles.  The wax paper they put down in their Togo boxes make fried items super soggy.  I received my order and of course they forgot to put the napkin in the box so the mozzarella triangles and egg rolls were both soggy.  The egg rolls were also room temperature by the time I received my order.  They also forgot BOTH of the sauces for my egg rolls and the mozzarella triangles.  When I ordered the brisket sandwich I asked them to cut the sandwich in half so I could share it.  Of course when I received my sandwich it wasn't cut in half.  How is it possible to get all 3 items wrong?!!!  If I hadn't double checked my order I would have had to drive all the way back to get my sauces and wouldn't have been able to share the sandwich.

Regular price is $14, but they have a military discount of $2 off.  So it was a great deal coming here. They also offer a planetarium and an IMAX film at an additional cost.

They have four floors of exhibits to explore, to get your hands on stuff, and to learn at your own pace.

The first floor has the WONDER Center or the Walton Optimal Neurological Discovery Education and Research Center. Here, anything and everything you wanted to know about the human brain can be found here. They have several videos. On the other end of the floor is an exhibit all about the human body. My favorite portion here is an actual video showing an open heart surgery. Also, you can get on a wheel chair and burn some calories.

On the second floor, there's an exhibit related to electricity and magnets. Most of the stuff here are have some sort of personal interaction so you can actually see the electricity as how you produced. My favorite here is the bed of nails. You get to actually lie on a bed of nails.

My favorite of the whole museum itself is on the third floor with the Forces of Nature exhibit. They have a simulator right in the middle where you can get to experience a tornado, hurricane, rain, volcanos and other natural disasters in 4D. Yes, you'll get wet. They also have a globe where it shows the most recent weather patterns, earthquakes, active volcanos and fault lines. So you're seeing real data as it happens for people to see and interact.

Finally on the fourth floor, is the ""Solarville"" exhibit. Basically it has everything to do with energy, sources of energy, alternative energy and conservation. Again, you can touch, play, and learn things and how a typical person can save on electricity.

Overall, this was an awesome experience. The staff were super friendly and were willing to actually give you some personal attention. They demonstrated all of their gadgets and gizmos. Again super friendly. So even though this museum is designed for kids, everyone learns and has a good time learning too.",2011-11-08 19:28:55

I brought some visiting family members to Il Fornello for dinner on their last night in the city.  They were craving pasta and we happened to be walking by Il Fornello, so...

We stepped into the restaurant and the first thing we noticed was the almost overwhelming stench...it literally smelled like a cattle stall.  We commented on the smell and the hostess explained that we were in an old building and they've kept the original wood flooring, and the flooring was responsible for the smell.  We debated leaving because of the smell, but decided to stay regardless. 

We ordered chicken parmesan (huge portion), spaghetti with bolognese (sauce was delicious) and a vegetable penne dish (quite tasty).  All the meals tasted great and the portion sizes were more than ample.  However, I was somewhat envious after having received my meal, as a server walked by with one of their wood oven fired pizzas!  Should have had that instead.  
Along with our meal, we had ordered some cocktails and beer.  The prices for the drinks were advertised on the menu card they handed us at $5/each, which is why we ordered them - more on that later.

The service was great, however, our table was next to the servers' station, so we had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to the staff complain about their jobs to one another as well as discuss which other establishments were hiring and where they had dropped off their resumes...while I understand that not everybody likes their job, it's probably a good idea to edit your conversation if you happen to be standing RIGHT NEXT TO A CLIENT'S TABLE. Just sayin'.

When we received our bills, we noticed that the $5 drinks were actually $7 and $8 dollars instead of the price listed on the menu card.  When we asked about that, the server indicated that the $5 drink promotion was only valid if you ordered off that particular menu card. 

So, one star for food, one star for service
stars lost for stench, annoying gnattering of the wait staff, and $5 drink technicality...in my opinion, that price difference should have been pointed out when we ordered the drinks, since we made a comment to our server about the $5 price when we ordered...mind you we didn't ask the specific question ""are these drinks $5?"", we were looking at that menu card, made a comment then ordered them.  At the very least, the restaurant should have given us the drinks at the $5 price...hmph!!!",2014-08-29 17:28:02

It also came with extra blue cheese.  Not wanting to spoil my appetite for the main event, I regulated myself to eating half.  The server boxed up the rest for me.  
The Fettucine Alfredo itself was ok.  It lacked richness as if it was made with milk instead of with cream.  Also, a hint of nutmeg would have been nice.

The football looking fried crystal dumplings 鹹水角 was good. I wanted more stuffing but still good.

The thing is, my husband is a loyal Blue Ocean breakfast eater (the restaurant a few doors down).  His absolute fave is the satay beef in instant noodles.  So we went to New City b/c I knew we could order the same thing and also the french toast which is exactly what we did. 

We both ordered the satay beef with instant noodles.  In comparison to Blue Ocean, there is more beef at the one in New City.  The beef is tender and the satay sauce is good.  The noodles are instant noodles, not much comparison there.  However, Blue Ocean gives you a fried egg in the noodles and probably a spoonful of frozen vegetables.  On top of that, Blue Ocean's noodles come with a thick piece of toast, buttered and drenched in sweetened condensed milk.   New City doesn't include these things but their price is about 80 cents cheaper.  

Both restaurants include a drink with your meal.  The HK style milk tea at New City I would have to say is better - the one at Blue Ocean often has a slight sour aftertaste.  

I did order the deep fried french toast with peanut butter.  It comes with a large slab of butter on top and also syrup.  The toast is good but not great.  It felt heavy.  

Overall, I would come back to New City for their HK style milk tea and probably to try their lunch.  But if I had to choose in terms of breakfast (at least for the satay beef and instant noodles), I'd have to go to Blue Ocean - better bang for your buck.",2015-03-08 23:19:19

It is a bit of a wait, since they are making the ice cream to order. But I really like the idea that is it made to order. I ordered the I'm Not Matcha ice cream. It is honey, yogurt, and Japanese barley powder. My boyfriend ordered The Nutty Canadian which has maple syrup and walnuts. I think the ice cream is to my taste as I don't like overly sweet deserts.

Of course I've only heard that Wildfire had good burgers so I may have been going on bad info for all I know. Anyhow, so I go in here and make my way to the back cafe.

Good...
Friendly service! I have to actually give the server props. I was in a FOUL mood and not being very friendly. Not outright mean or anything, but I was super stressed. She was so nice and even hurried my food since she could tell that I was waiting to get somewhere. I tipped 30% to try to thank her for that!

Cheap...Seriously, a burger and fries for $6. That's pretty cheap especially since you aren't at a fast food place. Definitely worth going back to try other things and see if I just ordered the wrong thing.

Smoke free....or at least I didn't smell any smoke and I am SENSITIVE. Usually you go in casinos and they reek of cigarettes, but this place didn't seem to have  a problem. I don't even remember seeing anyone smoke but I'm sure they do. Ick.

Bad...
Bad seating for singles...I really hate sitting at a table by myself. That's why I usually go to bars. There is a bar in the cafe but there are no chairs around it and it isn't stocked. The servers go to the casino bar to get drinks. I'm sure they just didn't have a call for it, but it still sucks. Here I was sitting in a big booth that could have fit four plus purses. 

Mediocre food...The burger was just ok. Pretty sure the meat was from frozen and the fries were DEFINITELY frozen. I guess I'm spoiled from being in Denver where the restaurants practically compete to have the ""Most Awesome Anything."" The corporate mindset of Las Vegas definitely leaves something to be desired.

Lots of old people...this place seems like it must be the local eatery for all the old people in the area. Everyone seem pretty dated. It makes someone like me who is only in their 30's think that I don't really want to go back again. 

All in all this place was ok and I may try it again one day. I have hope that there might be some better things on their menu if they are taking time to brew beer.

My friends invited me here, so I somewhat woefully detoured from my intended dessert. I'd been meaning to start trying the teas instead of the smoothies at the boba shops of Las Vegas, and I figured this would be as good a place as any.

Fresh Cup is a standalone structure in front of 168 Market and across the street from China Mama. They have decent seating, and it wasn't too crowded at our off-peak visit in spite of the summer heat. They also play a lot of Korean pop music and have posters of various girl groups all over the walls.

Other than the non-Asian smoothies and the specialty smoothies, the drinks (flavored teas, milk teas, jelly juices, smoothies) are cheap. The medium is currently $2.77 and the large is $3.15. Apparently, these drinks are all cold/iced since ""hot"" is a 50 cent extra, as are boba and many other add-ons. Puddings and some other toppings are 70 cents.

I had passion fruit green tea. I also unwittingly sampled my friend's taro milk tea, which was strongly (but not cloyingly) sweet, making it a candidate for future ordering but with the ""less sugar"" option. They have a ""no sugar"" option too (ugh, why?) and also less ice (ooh) or no ice, but I'm not sure if the cup will look as full without the ice.

So the sweet taro ended up throwing off my palate for the rest of my passion fruit green tea experience. Meh. From my first sip of my own drink, it seemed balanced with a little sweetness and non-overpowering green tea. The boba didn't seem quite as tasty as I've had before, but the chewiness was fine. Not the best rendition of this drink ever, but it'll work if I somehow don't find a better spot.

They have the typical buy 10 get 1 free stamp card. When I asked, an employee responded to me that they don't use all fresh fruit in their smoothies, so I'll probably stick to No. 1 Boba Tea if I'm in that kind of mood. However, I wouldn't mind giving them a few more visits when convenient.",2014-07-18 03:26:07

While I was ordering, it felt like the cashier was trying to pressure me into ordering more food than I needed. I might everything and often, but I know that a gyro is more than enough. Luckily I stuck to that mindset because the gyro was gigantic. The gentleman working the grill was generous with the amount of meat he shaved off. The sliced meat is then thrown into a frying pan. I was unable to identify if it was oil or a broth to finish the cooking process. I have a feeling that it was the first because the meat came out darker and a bit crisp. After it was finished it was thrown on top a pita with a liberal amount of tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of onions.

The place has been upgraded as evidenced by the fancy emblazoned OTG black shirts on the owners.

         I did love the Dos Gringos burrito and this OTG version is similar, but just a bit less exciting mainly due to the unusual rice (sort of a white/yellow variety). They forget to put my chips in the bag, but overall the burrito was on point with solid white chicken and the usual stuff in the burrito including salsa fresca.

I came here many times a week, and although I usually ended up using the computers to read and write email, I also checked out quite a few books from here.

What everyone is saying about the building is true.  Although it's not my cup of tea architecturally, it's impressive in the way it was meant to be impressive when it was built.  And it's pretty fun to be able to walk up the marble stairs and feel like you're in a museum when you really just walked in off the street.

The reason it doesn't get five stars, though, is because its selection, while large, isn't quite what it could be.  I guess I'm spoiled by San Francisco's Public Library.  That said, I really do love the CPL, and I encourage everyone to check it out.",2008-06-11 14:21:24

I can tell you that young teenagers and college/university students will love this festival and were the majority in attendance. Adults who expect better quality for a higher price will be sorely disappointed. 
The problems: they must have seriously oversold VIP. VIP was an absolute joke. There were no VIP bathrooms to see and the VIP section for the concerts was absolutely nothing to be impressed with. We could not get in to see Snoop Dog as there was a bottleneck at VIP due to too many people trying to get in!!! It was just as good as general admission!!! 
This festival is good for those who love any kind of music and who do not mind extremely hot weather and who know how to get the ticket very cheap or for free. Some recommend only getting one day rather than all three days which is not a bad idea.

I was reading up on other peoples review for this place and the reason why my mom and I go shopping here every week is the variety and freshness of meats & fish they have here. GS reminds me of the Korean markets in LA and in Korea. They have a plethora of different types of rice cakes, fish cakes, meats, ramen, sauces, banchan, dry goods, snacks, etc. and this is the only Korean market where they actually pay attention to the expiration dates of the products! The meats are good quality and you will not regret purchasing any marinated meat and the pork belly. My favorite 'togo' meal they have is near the banchan isle and its an assortment of fish eggs bibimbap style. It has chunks of sashimi with lettuce, daikon, carrots, and hot pepper paste. Mmmm yummy! Before you enter the market they have a list of specials that you should take advantage of, especially the dumplings and cold buckwheat noodle soups. 

Last but not least, the GS foodcourt. My mom and I usually stop by Baek-ni-Han (corner store towards your right). The owner is a man with glasses and he makes everything from scratch. If you like soups and noodles, try getting the half seafood soup with cha-chang myeun. The bowl actually has a divider so you can have a bit of each. Spiciness of the seafood soup compliments so well with the soy-sauce/ heartiness of the black bean noodles.

Like seriously, I'm surprised that the fire marshall didn't come shut the place down. On the plus side, at least you don't have to worry about moving your feet when you dance because there is NO room to move your feet. It was also incredibly hot inside and IMO the only place where you should see people sweating is at the gym. Combine all this with people drinking, smoking and wearing cheap Forever 21 nylon on the dance floor and it's a disaster just waiting to happen.

Seems like more people are finding out about this amazing place, I had to wait in line 30 mins for my drink. 

The garden milk tea is made with assam black tea, with milk, tapioca is included and topped with oreo crumbs. The best part is they pulled a leaf off their live plant and placed it in the the oreo crumbs so it looks like a garden. So jokes. Love the drink, it tastes slightly creamy and goes well with oreo crumbs. This place handcrafts their tapioca, which I personally think is amazing. The tapioca are slightly smaller than other places, but the texture is softer and just as chewy. Their bubble tea is slightly more expensive than other places but they use better tea leaves and with handmade toppings, its well worth it.

The royal 9 milk tea is good too. The tea is brewed with blueberries so it has a slight blueberry taste added to the milk tea which is nice.

XbJVRFvnPIepXZuFHWEiyQ,nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,DwS5_jKur2mfxvqDp_gptg,3,1,0,0,"This Casino/restaurant has really fluctuated over time. Unfortunately it appears to have started another downward turn.

They are owned by the Station Casinos under the Wildfire brand name they use for all their smaller properties. If your a gambler, their exactly what you'd expect by a place the Stations owns. Their payouts aren't great (better than the strip, but that's about it) and their players club is very stingy with everything but two for one dining vouchers. If you like to play machines, you can probably fine somewhere better to play at. Just and FYI, they don't have a pit (almost none of the smaller casinos do anymore)

The biggest gambling attraction here is by far their abnormally large Sports Book for a Casino of their size. They have TVs everywhere tuned to sports and this is a great place if you like the Sports Book atmosphere but you don't want to deal with a bigger Casino. They are also pretty generous with their free drink tickets for sports betting.

They are also a brewery, and if you follow my reviews at all, you know I love craft beer. One of the few good things they have done recently is greatly expand their beer menu, which formerly was very limited. They finally added an IPA and a few other staples. Their beers, for the most part, are decent. They make a pretty good red and Hefeweizen, and their new Mexican style pepper beer is very good if you like that type of beer. On the other side, their brown ale shouldn't be called a brown. I actually thought they poured me a stout instead, but it ends up that's what they call a brown... The beer prices are pretty decent too, and during happy hour they are very well priced. There are far better breweries in town though, and any of the other ones in Henderson are superior if your looking for a good beer.

The main reason they have gone downhill though is their new menu. Their prices have sky rocketed and most of their meals are now $14, which is far too high for normal casino diner food. They also have some pub fare, like pizza and appetizers. They tried to upscale the menu a bit and I heard multiple complaints from regulars while I was there (one regular even said he was never eating there again). Their prices were just too high for what they were offering and no one had any good comments on it.

For our first experience with the new menu, we tried the fried green beans, the gyro and the new sriacha bacon peanut burger. The order of green beans was good, but ridiculously small for $8. The gyro wasn't very good and the pita bread it was on had been cooked so long it was crunchy. There was absolutely nothing special about the burger and as much as I love Sriracha, it didn't work here and overpowered any other flavors there. They took their old potato wedges off, which everyone loved, and their new fries are good, but not great. Also they were out of half the side dishes offered on the menu, so my wife got fries instead of the onion rings she wanted.

I thought about saying something about the gyro, but we were already using a two for one and one of the downsides here is the service is always slow. They understaff this place horribly and during sports the cocktail servers handle the food too if your sitting outside the restaurant. The servers are always very nice but there is only so much you can do when one server has a small casino floor and multiple tables to take care of.

If you come here for the food, you will probably be disappointed (two stars for food, one star for the new prices). I also wouldn't come here to gamble, with the exception of the Sports Betting. Really the sports and beer are the only reason to come here anymore, though I would try the food again with a coupon and hope it gets better.",2017-06-10 05:23:37

The toppings that came with the Spicy Red Miso ramen were sad. There were two pieces of thinly sliced pork (aka ""pork belly cha shu"") that were very reminiscent of PC bacon rounds and then the other toppings were just bits and pieces that mixed in the with the noodles, which I wasn't a fan of.

Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go all-out and try a ton of menu items. We made a reservation for Saturday night and were greeted by Lola, herself, at the door. The place is tiny, cozy, and adorable; a true hole in the wall. Here is the low-down on the meal:

Crab cake - I am VERY picky about my crab cakes and these were delicious! Lots of crab and not a lot of filler. A beautiful sear on both sides and the lemon aioli was fantastic. The crab cakes were second only to my own.

Craw-puppies - hush-puppies with Crawfish mixed in the batter, very inventive! These were crispy and delicious, but maybe a touch too soft/undercooked in the middle.

Gumbo - The gumbo looked good and started off great on my palate, but lacked seasoning, mainly salt, and spice.

Catfish and grits - OMG the cheesy grits were unbelievable, I literally did not want to eat the last bite. The catfish was cooked perfectly, but not exactly what I expected. They even gave me some crispy bread to soak everything up. 

My dining companions had Po-boys and raved about the bread. I was able to steal some french fries and was so glad I did, they were fantastic. My husband had the trout, it wasn't bad but it was a little on the fishy side for me. 

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - I wish there was more sweet potato and less pecan, but paired with the chantilly cream it was delicious and I found myself constantly going back for just one more bite.

Lola's Famous Bread Pudding - I am not a fan of bread pudding, but my friends forced me to take a bite and it really wasn't bad.

Banana's Foster - The highlight of dessert, we were literally watching each spoonful and silently hating each other for having good taste! It was the best banana's foster I have ever had. A delicious sweet brown sugar coating with the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream...yes please!

Overall, Lola's is a great Cajun alternative to the real deal. There were definitely some high points to the meal, but there were a few mediocre points as well. I wish they had live jazz, that would really create some true NOLA ambiance.

We decided on Indian, and since many of the resto on Gerrard are closed for lunch or offer buffet.  My designated Friday lunch gal from time to time decided the sit down lunch in Leaside/Davisville Village look good.  

No disappointing lunch offered.  The place was very sparse on patrons but the service was excellent.  It is white table cloth service for lunch and the menu offers $10-$12 portions of chef made indian.

The order:

Chicken Vindaloo $10.95
Aloo Gobi $10.95
Chicken Tikka Masala $10.95
3 orders of Tandori Naan (charged $2.25  xtra for one order)
Raita  $2.25
champange cocktail $10
one domestic beer $6

$73 (included tax and tip)

The vindaloo  was spicy like it should be but not over the top,  chunks of chicken w/basmati and a wonderful mango chutney & a veggie samosa.  The rice and chutney accompany all lunch specials.  Plus an order of naan.

The aloo gobi was not greasy sometimes you get that sitting in a bed of oil.  The Tikka was dry to the chicken but not dry in flavour.

The raita was a bit runny, but did the trick for the bite of Vindaloo.  

Perfect Indian lunch, we had a little more then we should but it was a girlfriend friday lunch with cocktail.  Quick lunch for 2 could easily be $15 each.

Only complaint, the server suggested that we didn't get the lunch aloo gobi because it included rice and such.  but we ordered more naan and if we got the lunch one that would have been included so we paid $2.25 more than we needed.

I sure do love rodizzio style. there is quite the selection of meats being continually brought out. This is awesome b/c you are continually being served hot meats (no homo lol).

They also have some various steak cuts, chicken, ham, etc. The one complaint we would have is all their meats are consistently 
salty. It could just be us though b/c we tend to eat low sodium meals.

My tips would be these....
1) Don't waste your $ on the seafood upgrade. For what they offer it's definitely not worth the money. i will admit the ahi was good but that's it. The one item they offered that we were looking the most forward to were the shrimp and they came out dry as eff. Complete and utter let down.

I checked out the menu online to make sure it wasn't a carbon copy of Panda Express - which, thankfully for my starving-Chinese-food-loving-belly, it was not.

I went for the Beef Chow Fun and Singapore Chicken - one dish that's very standard, and one mystery dish (because I had no idea what would be inside it other than chicken.)

The Chow Fun was PERFECT. My face lit up upon the scent of the dish alone - I lit up even more once I took a bite. I saw golden noodles dancing in front of me. Could it really be this good? In Arizona? I felt like I had traveled instantaneously to a small mom-and-pop noodle shop in the 626. 

The Singapore Chicken had mushrooms, which are not my fave, but the dish itself was so delicious, I couldn't have cared less. The sauce was the key flavor to making this dish fantastic. A little sweet, sour, tangy and spicy. The chicken was perfectly cooked. I could have eaten two of these. Even the side of rice was good.

They are fast, friendly, and make great dishes. This restaurant has something for everyone (even that guy who thinks Panda Express is ""traditional"" Chinese food.)

The dish prices are fair, and the portions are generous. The restaurant itself was clean and I definitely felt comfortable inside. 

I will certainly come back even if it is a bit of a drive from where I'm normally at. This has definitely made its way into my top 5 Chinese nom nom spots in the Valley. Definitely worth every penny and gallon of gas.

They all wanted to go since it opened, hearing all the  hype about Strongsville's newest fancy restaurant.  The place was bustling with lots of customers, eager to visit the new eatery.  I was disappointed on many levels.  First, our table offered us a beautiful view of the back parking lot - not much they could do with this, I suppose.  Second, I ordered a side dish that the waitress told me she sent back because it didn't look good-I did get it after my meal was finished(not good to have a side after eating). I was not charged for this item, but how hard is it to get a side dish right.  Lastly, I let myself be talked into the filet-a mistake I have only made once before-I never get steak anywhere but two steakhouses, one in MEDINA and one in Akron-they specialize in steak and they always get it perfect.  Not only was this filet just average, but I choked on the price-$60.00!!  I recently bought four Black Angus filets(10oz. Each) at Market District for $47.00!! I advise you not to get the $60.00 filet-the hype about this place just did not produce the promised results!  I will stay with the great place across the street.",2017-05-31 19:36:30

The service is average.  You can usually get your drinks, order in, and food out pretty fast, it just is from grumpy servers.  I have been several times and each time no one ever seems happy. Everything else goes pretty smoothly though in the service department. 

The menu is your usual casino cafe menu with a 24 breakfast menu, common sandwiches, dinner entrees, and even a Hawaiian food section.  Everything I have tried has been pretty good.  The Reuben and the French Dip both seem to be really tasty.  The prices are reasonable and you will be full when you are done.  We almost always have leftovers.

We stuck our heads in once and the Blue Jays color commentary was so loud, we swiveled on out without even having a look around. We finally got a true taste of Bronco's when we went to one of the puzzle-rooms nearby with a pretty big birthday group. Bronco's was the closest place for a drink afterward, and easy to accommodate 11 people.

First off, the service was terrific for 11 people -- fun, friendly, and patient, with lots of helpful info and recommendations (about sliders), asking each person what their order was, and their name for ease of delivery later. 

I was surprised that decent tap and can craft beers were so reasonably priced - undercutting most of the bars around here by a dollar or two. And they have a lot of kinds. Was happy to find Great Lakes on the rotating tap. Cost on these is a serious reward for heading a few blocks away from Queen and Ossington. Beers were nice and cold, in chilled glasses.

We tried a couple of sliders -- these are pretty tasty. I wish they were a touch cheaper, because 2 doesn't seem enough for a meal if you're hungry, and I don't think $15 is the right price for 3 of these. But they are good for a snack.

2.  Hamburger Steak - for the savory gravy lover

The chicken was superbly tender, masala was delicious and spicy enough, just how I ordered. Rice was cooked perfectly and Samosas are crispy on the outside and soft inside, perfect! 

Excellent service! They make you feel welcomed. I picked up food from this place several time and always had great experience. It is bit dangerous that they are walking distance from my place as I can't never get enough of Indian food :-)

Now, I do have one complaint: the crust was a little soggy/oily.  BUT, I did take it out and wander around for about 45 minutes.  Either way, I stuffed that piece of pie into my face really quickly and totally enjoyed it.

I placed a to-go order for what the website stated was a Southwest Tapas platter, and the person over the phone did not correct me. I was just handed a box containing falafel, tzatziki and something else mediterranean with very (and I mean VERY) stale pita. I like falafal, but I didn't think I was ordering it. And I didn't like this falafel.

But, I will with my Yelp friends. During a morning of discovering new businesses, I decided to drive up to Cave Creek and work from a coffee shop in the area. I turned to my trustee Yelp app and noticed the Grotto's listing. Just then, I saw the sign and it looked like it was right up my alley so I decided to check it out!

This little coffee shops is filled with unique character. It's nestled off Cave Creek Road and trees hide it from plain site, but locals know just where to go! Inside, the walls are lined with different pictures and antiques and various tables and chairs fill the rooms. There's plenty of seating. My favorite area was the patio that felt like a little secret garden with several patio tables and chairs. 

When I first walked in, I looked around and could tell that this is a local hot spot and it was obvious that I was not a regular patron. The staff is friendly and seemed to know all the regular's orders. I decided to order the egg sandwich on a bagel along with an iced mocha. I then headed outside to the patio and set up my computer for a morning of work. Did I mention I love the patio? It's filled with character from both the atmosphere and the regulars who hang out there. In the midst of working, I look over and a huge great dane is staring at me face to face! Yes, this patio is also dog-friendly! 

While I enjoyed my delicious egg bagel sandwich and iced coffee, I worked using the free wi fi that the shop offers. It was a delightful morning and I will definitely be back to work from this adorable coffee shop in Cave Creek again in the future!",2013-05-18 19:38:12

The decor reminded me of Melting Pot.  I did enjoy the privacy and the ambiance.  However, the chairs were uncomfortably hard and too large for my 5'1"" girlfriend.  She could not sit with her back to the chair without lifting her feet up off the ground.  And the menus are printed on really bulky and obtrusive wooden surfboards.

The food:
- They gave us two pieces of bread - the croissant-like bun was stale and hard; the other was burnt but tasted sort of like Asian bao bread, so it was okay.
- The calamari was sliced way too thin, and I could only taste the breading.  It was seasoned with their version of Chinese five spice, which had a flavor profile that is best described as off-putting.
- The chicken trio: The chicken cheesecake looked and tasted like a cheeseburger (it was okay). The middle chicken slices were overcooked and dry.  The chicken drumstick was good but the mashed potatoes that it was embedded in were not.
- The duck was also seasoned with the five spice, but I managed to bear some of it because they also added a bit of sugar.  It came with sweet potato mash that wasn't sweet and tasted kind of disgusting.

Our waitress seemed hesitant and sort of uncomfortable talking to us.  Maybe she wasn't used to having actual Asian people eat here.

After typing that out, I'm thinking she was stress eating after a night of gambling. Lol. 

Anyway, considering we've come in during the time of week and night where normal people would be asleep because they work in the morning...it's fairly slow. Some nights if we get there earlier like at 918pm, there's certainly a mild amount of customers in there. Either way, we've always experienced great customer service. 

The food...3.5 stars. Just regular pub/ihop type eatery and pricing. I will openly admit this place popped my croissant french toast cherry. So naturally, I was excited to eat it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Of all the dishes we have had together there.. there wasn't any fancy shmancy garnishment for aesthetics...I kind of wish they'd throw something on there for embellishment because the dishes always looked sad.  Hahhaa.

Their menu isn't very extensive so don't expect it. I kind of prefer non-extensive menus because I can get so dang indecisive. If none of the restaurants within the casino as well as their food court tickles your senses...Farm isn't that bad of a place to settle for as your last resort. We always tend to take home the leftovers because they do serve a good portion, in my opinion. I also appreciate their support for locally grown fresh food.

Nothing to shoot across town for. You aren't missing out on anything spectaular. But will recommend them as an.option while in the vicinity.

The restaurant itself is definitely kid and stroller friendly. Also, you don't have to navigate too into the casino incase you loathe bringing your kids in because of the smell. Do not enter through any of the entrances  if you're facing the front of the casino. Rather, use the side entrance right before the ramp into the parking garage as that will lead you quicker to the restaurant. I suck at directions, but you definitely won't get lost.

In short, definitely NOT going here again.  Although it is still better than the crap they server at Remily's or Jesse Jr.  The food is overpriced for what you get.

We had the fried chicken which it was known for.  It wasn't too meaty and really needed the banana sauce to mask the fact that it wasn't too good.  Popeye's tasted better.

Their bangus was not much better than what you'd get at Marcy's where it  is much cheaper too.  It was pretty tough, I personally like my bangus to be as tender as the inihaw na bangus, but still have the tart from the daing na bangus.

The bicol express was their own style and that was probably the best thing I had over there.

Their Halo-Halo looked nice, but it was just a marginal improvement over Remily's

There are a few drawbacks though, price is one. Pretty expensive, but its what you expect for being in one of the upper class casinos. My GF got the Ahi tuna sliders and they were a JOKE, not good and cost something like $15.

It was really hard for me to find on the GPS and it was hidden way back behind the complex, I also don't believe that you could see the sign very well either, other than that downfall.. it is really a hidden gem. This place is right next to a new Pho restaurant that just opened up! If that helps anyone! 

When I walked in with my friend, it was a cute little shop. It felt cozy and welcoming. The different tables and chairs made me at home. The people there are friendly and give you when you walk in and if you have any questions about the menu, they will gladly answer it! After looking this place up and reading some other yelp reviews, I decided on the honey toast and the crepe cake. I honestly couldn't decide between the two, so I got both! Haha. We ordered the food and decided to sit outside. They have two tables in the corner overlooking some apartment complexes, the view was okay. Nothing special, we just enjoyed the weather! 

They brought the desserts outside to us and they were presented so sweetly! They looked so appealing on the plate, you didn't want to touch the work of art! The crepe cake came with some raspberry sauce and orange slices, I like the fact that you can pour as little or as much raspberry sauce on your crepe cake. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was almost melt in your mouth. It was good! My friend ordered the green tea crepe, and he enjoyed it just as much as well. The honey toast came out a little later than the crepe cakes, but that was okay because when it came out it was warm and smelled heavenly. It was worth the wait. I love how sweet it was, it was the perfect combination of toast and honey. I added strawberries to mine, so the strawberries balanced the sweetness of the honey. I didn't add any ice cream because I thought it would be a little too much. So getting the honey toast with the strawberries was perfect for me! Writing this is making my mouth water!

The bread for the sandwiches is baked fresh and tastes amazing.  Lastly their portion sizes are extremely generous so come ready to eat.  

I would recommend coming here over a chain like Panera any day. You'll pay pretty much the same price.

This is an update to my last review, which I guess I hadn't posted! 

We came to Gigi's this past Saturday night (June 8) with a friend from South Beach. I sent the menu and website over in advance because she has some odd dietary habits. She was super excited! 

We got there late (for Cleveland standards) and sat at the bar. Everyone was super accommodating- but were out of most things she would eat (fish is ok, no dairy, no eggs...) but that's our fault. The specials go quick! 

The staff accommodated our bruschetta board with both vegetarian options- cheese removed- and made some extra things for me (I'm a goat and love all of the things there!) 

A bit later, she fell trying to get my glasses that had fallen on the floor. The owner was so extraordinarily nice and wonderful and purchased a round of drinks for us (I should have stuck with my hot water) and called and paid for our Uber. 

I will never stop going here- they care about their food, staff and customers. Thank you.",2018-06-12 21:11:44

To get the minor details out of the way.  I was reminded why I prefer tables to booths.  The seating was uncomfortable.  The only  other item was my chopsticks were so warped they were useless and I should have asked for another pair but instead gave up and used my fork.

We chose 3 entrees and all were good.  The serving size was appropriate for the target clientele.  If our group was 20 years younger we would have gone away hungry, as it was we ate about 90% of the food served.

Their fried rice is really good, as is the chashu don.  These are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  Maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two... I say that because they're really good and you should really try them.

Sandwiches are always a popular choice, but we have tried so many sandwich places, we weren't sure where to go. 

We didn't really even need to consult Yelp this time, as there are so many different eateries on every corner in Scottsdale, all we had to do was drive around until we found one that sparked our interests. On this day, it was Jason's Deli.

When we walked in, we were surprised at how big this place was. I mean, the counter alone was about as long as one of the meat counters you'd find at a supermarket deli counter. Very impressive. Under the glass, you'll find all of the available meats and vegetables, as well as the wide array of fruits they offer.

The menu is pretty typical of what you'd find at your typical deli. Different styles of sandwiches and wraps, offered with different meats and veggies, as well as fruits, salads, and drinks. But for us, what caught our eye was the ""Local Favorites"" section. If you're new to this place (like we were), and you're not one to stand in line forever and try to figure out what you want, this might be a great place for you start your search. If you don't see exactly what you want on this list, it will at least give you a nice jumping off point for something that sounds good to you.

On this day, we saw the turkey wrap on the Local Favorites board. We both agreed that it sounded delicious, and we were definitely right. For both wraps, we paid $18. The wraps came with a refillable fountain drink, fresh fruit, and a delicious yogurt dip for said fruit.

We wanted to sit on the patio, but being that it was completely shaded at mid day, there was no seating to be had. So, we ended up sitting at one of at least three dozen available seats inside. Sitting inside wasn't bad, though. There are several televisions in the background, and you're only a few steps away from the salad bar. Oh yeah...did I mention that they have a salad bar?

H2O Sushi & Izakaya is a brand-new Vegas outpost of a SoCal chain, and it's located next to Bandito in that new glassy building on Flamingo and Hughes Center (near Paradise). I learned of their opening buy one, get one free promo via social media and managed to convince some friends to join me for the last day. This means that the $26.95 weekend/dinner price ($19.95 weekday lunch) for all you can eat sushi was essentially halved, which is also a reason that I can be more lenient.

First and foremost, the food. By and large, it's delicious. The highlight of the menu is AYCE carpaccio, which is  a modernized, lightly dressed and spiced sashimi with five not-too-thin pieces per order. That's a strange number for sharing, but anything is good as long as they don't impose a limit on orders. The AYCE menu's carpaccio options are salmon, seared garlic tuna, albacore, or cajun albacore. Salmon is the best here and was the best nigiri as well (with the typical oversized fish-to-rice ratio). The other carpaccio were also good, although the albacore tasted a little mushy.

Other nigiri also made me quite happy:

- Saba (mackerel) is one of the best that I've had in town, with some sweetness to offset the typical brine-heavy flavor.
- Ebi (shrimp) is never something that I've enjoyed, but I did here. They don't use the awful, thin cut which most restaurants offer, AYCE and otherwise alike. This one feels and eats like a real shrimp. Ikura (salmon roe) is delicious, with salty pops filling your mouth.
- Tako (octopus) comes in a generous size and has the right chewiness for me.  The other fish egg nigiri aren't bad either.
- Hamachi (yellowtail) isn't necessary the best here, but it's good enough for me.

I would caution against these nigiri:

- Krab. We didn't even order it because it's obviously surimi, or fish protein masquerading as crab.
- Ika (squid) was oddly mushy.
- Tuna wasn't too bad, but it wasn't a standout. Yuzu and garlic tuna were fine though.

I wasn't able to try the unagi (freshwater eel) because they had run out. Also, the nigiri menu lacks such classics as scallop, super white tuna, uni, and amaebi. The lack of the latter two is especially puzzling because the menu is almost a carbon copy of H2O Sushi's San Diego store and because uni and amaebi are also very common items at Vegas AYCE joints. On a side note, those Cali locations have AYCD hot sake and Sapporo, which would also fit nicely in this city.

Appetizers. We didn't get to try the salmon collar, furikake fries, or udon because they had run out. Gyoza and cheese pork cutlet are my re-order candidates. Shrimp tempura didn't have a crispy batter, but the conjoined veggie tempura were fine. Takoyaki, mussels, and spicy tuna crispy rice were good but not the best around (takoyaki questers can skip). Also missing were most of the skewers, i.e. pork belly, chicken, and kurobuta. The shiitake skewer seemed severely undercooked, but nobody else commented on it so I just chalked it up to personal preference.

Worst part about the food: dessert isn't included. I regularly knock places which offer 1 dessert per person, so zero per person? Well, I guess the Dynamite California Roll is sweet enough. Oh, almost forgot: we had rolls, and all were decent enough if you somehow don't enjoy the fish-focused nigiri, but get the Albacore Lovers roll for the fried onion.

Final food-related note: the ordering system is based on the paper system that is commonplace in California and almost nonexistent in Vegas. They provide a preprinted sheet with the entire AYCE menu, and you have to write down what you want rather than simply calling out your order to a server. It's annoying that they lost our first order due to disorganization, but we didn't run into issues with the 3 round limit and found it easier to strategize our meal on paper.

ATMOSPHERE: interior reminded some of us of Gen Korean BBQ, and I just learned that H2O Sushi and Gen are both owned by Octopus Restaurant Group. There was a Gen-esque trendy aesthetic, and the booth felt familiar aside from the lack of a grill.

SERVICE: Wait time was quoted at 45 minutes but ended up being 35 minutes. However, the actual meal took closer to 3 hours. No, we aren't nightmare customers. We ate the food promptly as it arrived (give or take a small window of time for photos) and could've easily finished within an hour and a half tops at a standard AYCE sushi restaurant. The pace did seem reasonable at first but slowed down considerably. They lost our order halfway through round 1 and took a long time to fulfill the remainder of round 1 and whatever we did for round 2.

But again, this BOGO was $17-18 a head w/ tax and tip, and I'd have considerably higher expectations for their regular price service, so we'll see how they fare in the future.

For now, H2O gets a thumbs up. Check it out!",2017-10-16 04:48:02

Another star for their service. I had my two kids and they brought out everything to me and even asked me if I wanted ranch. Another star for the food being just ok. The tenders were not tasty at all without the sauces and even then it was a bit bland. The tenders were seasoned unevenly and my tot wouldn't even eat it. However, the fries were good.

Someone told me that Church Brew Works is one of those places you must take out of town visitors. It took me two and a half years to see the place for myself, but I have to agree. It's beautiful with its stained glass windows and high ceilings, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.

I enjoyed the two brews we tried, the Celestial Gold and the Pious Monk. The traditional pierogies we had as an appetizer were also great. The service was friendly and prompt, and our waiter saved our party of two from making a huge mistake and ordering a pizza AND another entree. Don't do this. One pizza for two people is plenty. It could probably feed three people just fine.

Unfortunately, this place slips into 3-star territory with its pizza. We split the Southwestern, which had a chipotle-tomato sauce, corn, cheese, and red onion. Interesting flavor combo, but the pie should have been cooked longer. The center of the pie was also too thin, which meant that the tip of each slice always fell apart when I tried to pick the slice up and eat it.

I have called 2 weeks ahead to reserve a table.  They don't normally accept reservations but only for big groups. I arrived early to drop off the cake and was told my reservation wasn't there.  I was a little stunned, but they were really accommodating to fit our party. 

I sure missed those motorcycle bike seats at the oyster bar when it was Cuttlefish. They took them out and replaced with a DIY Bloody Mary bar.  At $7, you get to customize however you like it.  I guess the V8 juice wasn't bad either for the non-drinkers.  Who doesn't like Slim Jims? The Slim Jims added the special kick in the drink plus made a great snack while waiting for our entrees. 

Herb Chicken and Waffles were popular among our table. I tried something different and went with the Herb Chicken Egg Benedict. My herb chicken was amazingly good. JL had the same chicken but hers wasn't that great. They must have made a different batch. We probably ordered all their herb chickens for that day.  As for the Egg Benedict, nothing too special. The hollandaise sauce might need a little work. It was really bland.  

For the coffee fans, must try the French Press. One of the better quality coffee blends a brunch place. It was so rich and smooth. I think I probably drank 1/2 of the pot. So good! 
 
The staff provided exceptional level of service. They kept our water and coffee filled at all times. When it was time for the cake, I believe it was the owner that went around the table and handed us with a new plate. He even brought and lighted the many candles on the cake.  

Another scrumptious brunch place big enough space to have a large group. They even have a live DJ by the bar area. I believe it ends at 1PM. I don't know if this location was cursed or what, but hopefully, this place can hold on and stick around a little longer.",2015-10-30 06:15:59

We sat in the back dining area, and my only complaint is that it was super dark. It was hard to read the menu, and we had no luck at all reading the beer list that was sitting on the table. Good thing Miller Lite is a staple at most bars (like it was here), so we didn't have to ask for a rundown of our choices. (I opted for iced tea, but my husband had a couple of drafts.)

My husband had the fish sandwich, which was really good. Lightly battered cod served with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I liked my sandwich even better. The corned beef and sub slaw is like a lighter version of a reuben. Although I didn't think I'd like this on a sub roll, the bread was great (nice and chewy), and the corned beef was about the best I've ever had. We both got fries, which were fine, and I had a nice crisp pickle, although they left that off my husband's plate.

Service was good, and the prices were fair. And it looks like they have half-price beers and apps for happy hour, which is a bonus.

However, it was not until last night before heading to a late movie at the SilverCity on Dundas, that I could bring myself to up this place into the 4 star threshold.

For the most part this restaurant is a 3.5*....the downtown location on Queen is now a 4* in my books. I am always a fan of the Dolsot Chicken Bibim Bop with its huge portion including soup and salad, and great assortment of marinated chicken, cooked veggie and topped with a fried egg. The beef Bulgogi is another yummi choice, and if your hungry, you can go wrong with the Bento box choices. Though admittedly the teriyaki sauce is a tad sweet and thick to be SUPER authentic it is really effin tasty.

The main difference btwn this location is the little korean appetizers they provide before the meal. A small plate of edamame, a couple scoops of soy beans, and some kimchi, and spicy potatoes. 

What launched this location to the next level however, was its delivery of SUPER fresh and delicious tasting Sashimi and maki last night. It was among the best I had ever had.

The Chirachi is a STEAL for $9.95 (1pc octopus, 2pc sweet shrimp, 3pc imitation crab, 2pc tuna, 2pc salmon, 2pc butterfish)...but for the quality served up last night it was a bit of a trip.

I just wanted to stay here and talk and snack a little.  That's kind of hard to achieve in a strip mall restaurant yet, this did not feel like that.

For how simple a BLT is, it is difficult to make a memorable one, but CM does it. Try the BLT deluxe for a bit more substance.

What does it matter unless you are properly trained? People ought to judge food based on taste and not on who/what race is the person makes it. Food for thought.

LOCATION: Tucked away in the corner of the plaza near the bottom-floor garage, I feel like it often gets overlooked. Definitely not as packed as Ichiza, which also serves japanese dishes, it's a nice change. Food came out relatively quick.

PRICE: Relatively low-priced around $7-$8, the dishes left us pretty full. My friends ended up having to roll me through the door because I decided not to waste any food.

FOOD: My friends and I ordered the omusoba and yakisoba. My yakisoba arrived greasy, crackling, and heaping. The omusoba is the exact same thing, but with over-egg encasing the top of the noodles. Topped with pickled ginger and japanese mayonnaise, it was the perfect food soaker for the late-night drinking crowd. How can you go wrong with uber-greasy noodles, lettuce, beef, and sliced carrots?! It was filling and tasty.

As far as their sushi and ramen go DON'T. I've been here enough times through the years to order the food they're good at making. The problem with shuseki is, it has this massive menu but they don't have specialty in making any one dish. They aren't really known for spectacularly done items. I believe they try to tackle too much. 

This might explain why this place is always dead. Everytime I come here, it's pretty empty. Even on the weekends, I hardly see it filled up or too busy. Great place to meet up with a whole group of people.

Our server was attentive, and went to check on us often to refill our waters.

It's a decent place to pop in for something simple, but not somewhere to impress out-of-towners. I would just suggest Shuseki to make cut their huge menu down and focus on improving on the dishes they do well/improve the ones they do not. Worth a visit.",2014-03-04 05:33:57

I had both the Hawaiian and the Lemon Pepper options and they were both seriously so good. The Hawaiian was a sweet and sour sauce that was of notable quality, while the lemon pepper was a dry rub over butter and it tasted amazing in a whole different kind of way. I seriously got away with 10 wings for $6. Can't beat that.

New (and delicious) Vietnamese joints popping up all over the place! In short, Nem Nuong Bistro is the business. Possibly, the only truly Cali-style Vietnamese in Vegas. I've heard Brodard it their Golden State counterpart? ...still to be confirmed.

Always start a meal off with the combination Nem Nuong Rolls. I've almost completely sworn off Cha Gio (Fried ""Egg Roll"")! 2 Nem Nuong Viet Sausage + 2 Shrimp Paste/Cake ($10.50 for 4) filled with crisp lettuce, and crispy fried egg roll wrapper bits wrapped in pleasantly chewy rice paper--slightly drier than spring roll paper. It comes with the most amazing sauce. I have no idea what's in it. It's sweet, salty, and savory. I asked once and the waitress said she has no idea what's in it either--just that it has peanuts for allergy reasons. -___-"" le sigh. 

Vermicelli Noodle Bowls: I go with #16-BBQ Pork, Nem Nuong, and Cha Gio. It's your standard noodle bowl. The pork is less fatty, somewhat thinly sliced in comparison to other places, and not heavily sauced or salted. It's different but I really enjoy it! It comes w/ your usual Nuoc Mam fish sauce but I scrape the last bits of my Nem Nuong Roll sauce and use a combination of the two. HEAVEN.

Pho: Their broth is HEAVY on the cloves. It's not my favorite pho in Vegas but it is quite tasty. I think District One, Pho So 1, and Pho Annie are still my pho-vrites. For you non-meat eaters, Nemz has a 100% veggie pho w/ lightly fried tofu cubes in place of beef. If you're a meat eater but cutting back on your meat consumption, Chef suggests veggie pho w/ chicken broth. Much improved taste. (Happy Hour 4-6pm $5.95/bowl)

Bun Bo Hue: I'm not an expert on Bun Bo Hue. I've only had it at a couple different places and they were both extremely fishy and had lots of offal like random parts in it. Don't get me wrong, I love my blood cake and intestine on occasion. But there's a line to be drawn when an intestine tastes like an intestine. Moving forward before I spoil your appetite... Nemz BBH is nothing like this! It's heavy on the lemongrass, slightly spicy, and a relatively clear broth. I recall beef and Viet meatloaf. 

Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef): The beef is amazing. Tender and flavorful. Just as it should be. The tomato rice is a little flavorless. It's rice. Served with a side salad. Get this. Definitely one of the richer things on the menu if you're not feeling noodles or soup.

If you have a ride and some time, I would recommend the short drive. On weekends they offer some seafood options in their buffet. Apparently on this particular weekend that we went, there was a special deal for lunch time: $16 per person (regular price is about $30ish). Score!

Don't be fooled by thinking that just because the M Resort is located away from all the strip action that people aren't going to flock to this buffet. I highly advise you to come early or at least be ready to wait. Don't say you weren't warned. We got there around 1 pm and had to wait about a full hour before we got seated. By then, we were all starving and ready to eat everything in sight. 

I kid you not, there's tons of food here. As I stared at all the selecitons, I couldn't stop thinking about Mike Rowe and that one episode on Dirty Jobs where all the Vegas buffet leftovers are trucked out to the pig farm. 

The food is fresh, clean, and your options is practically endless. There's everything from some sushi, to random Asian selections, to Mediterranean, as well as steam crab legs and boiled shrimp. They of course have prime rib as well as tri tip and ribs available. There's just too much to list. Not everything is a winner but overall you should find a good number of dishes that will entice your taste buds.

Leave room for some dessert. There is an awesome gelato bar accompanied with many other sweet tooth selections.

For you big drinkers, there's a hidden open bar with unlimited wine and beer. It is located directly to your left as you enter the buffet. Don't miss out on it if you love to booze. They purposely keep it concealed for a reason.

We all literally rolled out of Studio B quite impressed, retardedly full, and ready to blow some gaskets.

The 6 different sauces they have are 6 different sauces..  I kind of like the curry ketchup ok but the others is just not that good to me.  The sauerkraut is a lil bland.  The garlic fries were limp and not very garlicky.

The pretzel was really good!  The beer cheese was a bit.. lumpy?  Grainy?  Not cheesy enough for my taste I suppose, and slightly on the stingy side - I mean they charge like 3 bucks for it separately, can I at least get a full 1/2 cup??

Which brings me to the final bit - prices are a little high when you don't go for specials or during happy hour.  Still a bit high then..",2013-09-15 14:54:06

There is so many rounders and racks of clothes and I just don't have the personality or patience to search for things like that.  I was in the store this past weekend because I received $6 free and I had a %15 off coupon.  I remember when the coupons used to be $10.  When I receive these I usually just head to the home section for a candle or picture frame.  On this day I just bought a shirt.  I think the regular price on the shirt was $34 on sale for $19 and with my discount I paid about $13.  And that's where I have a problem with Kohls.  No way should the shirt I bought have ever been $34 in the first place.  Kohl's is not worth shopping unless you have a coupon or coupons to stack.  I will admit I have found items online, namely small electronics, previous model, for example, that when stacked with coupons are a great deal.

Besides being light in colour, they are also pretty light in flavour, to the point where it was kind of hard to even tell what some of them were (is this earl grey, chocolate caramel, or salted caramel?)

As a serious runner, I appreciate the time the RFYL staff takes to ask about your running habits and frequency.

My only disappointment was that they didn't have the new Saucony Zealot ISO 3.

They have a fitting process similar to other specialty stores with a treadmill in-house to analyze gait and foot pronation. The first time I came in to get fitted they filmed me running outside and then found shoes tailored to my running style and foot-strike. 

As far as price goes, with a specialty store you should know you're going to spend over $100 on a pair of running shoes. For beginners, I'm sure RFYL takes the time to educate you on how many miles per shoe and how often you should be running.

I contacted Texas Roadhouse the following day per the response that I got from them.  The lady on the phone was friendly enough and asked a few questions about my experience there to confirm what happened.  She mentioned she was surprised that the lady that was doing the seating didn't stop us to get a manager.  On a side note, I just had this happen to me again at a Denny's with the same reaction from the guy who seated us.  I don't think these guys take their job seriously.  Anyways, the lady I spoke to with Texas Roadhouse apologized and asked me for my address and said she contact the restaurant to follow up and send some gift cards.  I thanked her and we hung up.  Didn't hear back from her again or get anything.  I don't even know if they followed up with the restaurant.  

Around August I sent a message to Diania, the Texas Roadhouse representative who wrote the response to my Yelp review:  ""Hi, I wrote the review on 7/18 for the Texas Roadhouse in Gilbert. I called the 800-TEX-ROAD number the next day and spoke with a lady who took my information down.  She seemed concerned that the girl that seated us did not attempt to stop us and get a manager when we informed her about our lack of service while leaving.  The lady on the phone asked for my number and address and said she'd send some gift cards to us. I thanked her for the gesture and felt it was a great effort by the company to apologize for the incident.  We haven't heard anything back since.  The gift cards are not that important to me, but integrity is and if there was really no intention of follow through, it should have never been mentioned. I hope the person who took my info actually spoke with that manager of the Gilbert location.  I suspect the manager may not have ever been made aware of the situation that day by the employee, which, if it were the case, would be a shame.  I do enjoy Texas Roadhouse restaurants very much, and have been a fan of the establishments since the late nineties, when I visited my first one in Colorado Springs. So I have no intention of boycotting the restaurants, but I'm sure I'll avoid the Gilbert location.  Sincerely, Tom H""

She gave a great response:  ""Tom, I apologize for the delay in responding to your email.  I have been out of town but will look into this immediately.  Follow through on any promise made by Texas Roadhouse is mandatory and not an option.  We pride ourselves on our integrity and always doing right by our guests.

That was how my dad described my facial expression as I took a bite out of their garlic chicken. I spent the past two years thinking Island Grill (Eastern & Serene) made the best garlic chicken in town. I was proven wrong when I visited 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate this past weekend. 

We got there around 6pm on a Friday and were the only customer there. High ceiling, spacious, clean. From the place you order, you can see the kitchen which I thought was interesting. 

After looking through the pictures on yelp, I knew I had to try their garlic chicken. I believe there are two sizes, mini and original. You can choose either the tossed green salad or macaroni salad. Our food came out within 10 minutes! For $8-$9 a plate, the portion was huge. It came with 7-10 pieces of garlic chicken, two scoops of rice and the tossed green salad (Original size). 

Garlic chicken is very different from the one served at Island Grill. First of all, it comes with miso mayo. It was very subtle in flavor but very creamy. Second of all, garlic chicken itself is flavorful, tender and juicy unlike the garlic chicken at island grill which are crispy but can be dry at times. This amazing miso mayo, combined with juicy chicken=ONOLICIOUS!

Needless to say, I am coming back again very soon. Mahalo, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate.",2015-02-08 20:59:03

Not s are why the hate for this place...I had a pretty decent experience here. The decor is very much like a bar, the inside is dark but we sat on the patio that day since it was a nice day out. I wanted to try the corn for sure from all the instagram pictures I've seen. I was kinda shocked at the price for a single taco..starting at $6-$10 for one taco. I don't usually buy tacos so I'm not sure if this is average price or not.. but for $6 I was hoping to get more than one. 

I ordered the corn to share, then one cod taco and the cauliflower (vegetarian) taco to try. Hands down the corn was the best part for me. It is extremely messy so it is not a first date appetizer but if you like corn and spicy then you got to get it! The cod taco was my favourite out of the two, the beets on top added a sweetness and the fish was fried perfectly. The vegetarian taco however fell short for me. There wasn't much flavour a little too much of the bean paste, I guess since I ate this after the fish one it was lacked taste. The fish one had so much more taste than this one. 

When we got the bill the waiter brought over a digital print for each of us to take home which I've never experience and thought it was unique.

It is a typical buffet style serving, with a variety to choose from. We noticed that most of the patrons were of Indian descent, which is a good sign since they would most likely know quality Indian food over someone born in the US (just saying). Like most Indian places, there is no description of the items in the buffet (like if it contained yogurt or curry, etc), just a sign of what was there. The buffet seemed a little awkwardly laid out, with desserts in the beginning as well as the end. Tandoori chicken was a little touch and disappointing, but the chicken masala was very good by contrast. Prices are cheap. I would come back.

I guess I'll start with the happy hour skinny margarita I ordered.. $5 happy hour price for a watered down, overly iced concoction.. Not worth it and would certainly not worth the non happy hour price. 

The chile con queso was tasty but we were kind of surprised that it came out somewhat lukewarm. We came in a little before 4 pm so not busy at all.. You think it'd came out piping hot. 

My fiancé ordered the chicken enchiladas. We're both not picky but we both agreed they tasted like rubber.. Like the taste of what a garage smells like. It was so odd! 

I ordered the appetizer quesadilla as my entree and it was okay. Nothing crazy.

I love their slogan which stated ""desserts make you happy"".  They sure make me happy all the time.  The relaxing jazz music with the pastel colour background really makes this place a great place to hang out.  The cake display case was also really clean and simple, not too much selection, but every slice of cakes look immaculate and done with a lot of care.  

The staff was also extremely friendly and gave us a lot of pointers on which cakes is popular and which one is her favorite.

The earl grey vanilla sponge cake sitting on top of the lemon feuilletine topped with bergamot cremeux and milk chocolate earl grey mousse was dancing on my tongue.

We ordered the special salad, okonomiyaki and karage don to share and I had the Tsukemen.  The dressing for the salad was very refreshing.  If you don't like veggies, you'll still like this salad.  The okonomiyaki was also well done.  The karage don was ordered as an add-on to the noodles meal for just $3.90.  The Tsukemen is a dipping noodle which was really really good.  The noodles were perfect texture and portion size came with 2 pieces of meat, egg, seaweed and veggies.  Broth was accompanied in a hot stone bowl that stayed hot until I finished.  If you were still not full after 1 portion, you have the option to add another huge plate of noodles for just $2.80.  Great value, you will for sure leave satisfied and full.  My friends also had the black sesame tan tan noodles.  They were very impressed with it.  I can't wait to come back to try more noodles.

That dessert was very disappointing, just buy frozen wonton skins from the store and wrap it in your own cookie dough throw it in the freezer and then fry it. No special sauce, dusting of goodness, or anything.

One other one that I have tried is the chicken and queso wrap - I think it is called this?  You are better off just getting the chicken with rice and queso, it is the same stuff stuffed in a wrap and it is huge - too much to hold in you hand and it falls apart.

The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of ""Irashaimase!"" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the ""Sahara Cooler"" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit purée, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the ""Wafu Carbonara"" which was simply described as ""slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg"".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.",2014-08-27 22:11:20

We waited a little for the hype to die down, but totally understand it now... We have been here TWICE in a week now! And it won't be the last time! You really get your bang for your buck -- the food is well portioned, filling AND satisfying!

The menu has a wide variety of hawaiian x filipino fusion food -- from appetizers, burritos, salads, tacos, entrees, and rice bowls. We both opted for the ISLAND RICE BOWLS:
- Choose your size (KIDS $5.99: 1 serving of protein, 1 scoop of rice, 1 side) (REGULAR $7.99: 1 servings of protein, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides)
 (MIXED $9.99: 2 servings of protein, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides)
- Choose your protein (teriyaki chicken, Notorious R.I.B. boneless shortribs, kalbi short ribs, sesame chicken, chicken katsu, kalua pork sisig, crispy pork belly sisig, honey sesame tofu, teriyaki veggies)
- Choose your sides (macaroni salad, green salad, grilled pineapple, stir fry vegetables, edamame)

I ordered (large island rice bowl):
- NOTORIOUS RIB
- SESAME CHICKEN
- MACARONI SALAD
- GRILLED PINEAPPLE
- WHITE RICE 
...and I will continue to get this same order forever! The Notorious RIBs are perfectly marinated & cooked tender boneless short ribs, topped with a tasty slaw -- and the sesame chicken is so crispy & cunchy with a delicious flavorful side sauce that I just want to smother on EVERYTHING! The mac salad is a common necessary side staple, and the grilled pineapple is such a yummy sweet mix to add to the dish! We just barely finish our plate (even on our hungriest days) and just can't get over how satisfying, fresh and filling the food is! (He ordered the notorious rib, chicken katsu, mac salad and mixed veggies... but uses my sesame chicken sauce, haha.)

Will we be back? Without question! (We even had to vow to wait at least a week in between our next visit since we've been here so frequent!) Especially with this gem just around the corner from our house, located on Buffalo x Warm Springs next to the PT's Ranch. I love my order, but vow to definitely try other items on the menu (I have been eyeing the different kinds of elote like MISO-CORNY, or the KALUA PORK NACHOS and NOTORIOUS RIB BURRITO)! =)",2018-03-20 19:13:12

Don't let this deceive you; a hidden treasure full of culinary bliss awaits! 

I've been here several times and the food quality is extremely consistent. The chef prepares fresh foods cooked to order with wonderful organic ingredients. 

I've have the crab cake for lunch, served on a brioche bun that tastes of butter and melts in your mouth like a puffy cloud. The cake itself had chunks of crab and was nicely held together without being bready itself. It was accompanied by fresh cut fries that were savory and well seasoned. Amazing! 

Breakfast is fabulous as well. There were several of us waiting before 9, which is when they open. As soon as the doors swung open you were taken to Paris with the smell of fresh croissant baking and coffee perking. 
The croissant sell out! Once you taste one you'll know why. Buttery, flaky, fresh baked bliss. The French press coffee was great. Enter our breakfasts... The best French toast my mom has ever tasted ( she's 60 so this means something), the organic buckwheat crepes were light, fresh and the fillings so savory and well seasoned, the omelette fluffy and buttery, and the croissant breakfast sandwich amazing. 

This place has the best desserts in the area hands down ( I'm a baker, this chef knows what he is doing, it's all made from scratch and fresh because it sells so fast). 

The atmosphere is so cute and has a hint on luxury with crystal chandeliers and cute glass dinner wear. 

Ahhhhh and you can enjoy the patio on a warm day!

- no cover! at least i don't remember there being cover

cons:
- almost put glass in my eye. no, seriously. i was waiting for a drink at the bar, and one of the bartenders was way too rough with the dirty glasses, a glass exploded and shards of glass flew out. a few pieces flew towards my friend and i, and one hit very very close to my eye. the further disappointment? the manager (it seemed like he was the manager) was right there when it happened. he asked me if i was okay, and that was it. he didn't really check further than that, and he made no offer to compensate OR APOLOGIZE. the bartender who actually broke the glass DID step up to the plate and did try to make us our drinks ASAP, but that was it. is this the type of service i should expect from any bar??? i don't care, i've been to some hole in the wall dive bars, but this was beyond ridiculous.

As far as Service they are also better than ""131 Main""!  Servers here are more friendly and much more attentive than ""Bricktops""!  Firebirds Servers know their Menu better than both the others!  Don't you hate going to eat at a place where you know the Menu better than the Servers?!?

On Food Quality Firebirds is Very Good, very similar to the competition!

On Food Flavor, FireBirds competition wins on almost EVERYTHING, yet Firebirds (at least this location) continues to improve!  I have eaten here more than other Firebirds locations (I have eaten at the Stonecrest Location three times, North Lake Mall two times and Winston Salem once)...

Baby Back Ribs Quality 5 stars... The Flavor is Very Good, though the Sauce is not good enough for these Ribs!  ""Brick Tops"" wins first place and ""131 Main"" gets a close 2nd place, Firebirds loses on flavor, still they are very good, close to 4 stars... These would be 5 star Ribs if the Sauce were better...

BBQ Sauce (Java) sounds like it could beat almost anyone, it does not!... 3.4 stars

Slaw (Tricolor Tortilla, Purple Cabbage, with Roasted Pumpkin Seeds wins over ""Brick Tops"" and ""131 Main""... Slaw is not that important to me!

Baked Potatos are much better here than ""Bricktops"" (Bricktops has been known to not serve Baked Potatoes at Lunch and run out of them at Dinner, when they do have them they are not that good... One of the Bricktops Managers said Baked Potatoes are not that popular with their customers AND that Baked Potatoes are Labor Intensive, they really only want to serve Fries!

Firebirds Steak Fries 3 stars

Firebirds Sweet Potato Waffle Fries 3 stars

In the War of the Fries (their is one in the World of Rod0) Bricktops beats almost everyone (not counting those who use Goat Fat, Coconut Oil or Lard) 131 Main has Very Good Fries too, though I would not go just for those!

Onion Rings 3 stars - ""CowFish"" and ""Red Rocks"" win the Fried Onion Awards, Roosters could compete well here too!

Key Lime Pie - Bricktops beats everyone in this category - NOTE to The Owners of Firebirds, start with a new Crust, best thing to do is go to Bricktops and get inspired!  I would rather be eating here than either of the competitors and that is why I keep coming back here... My friends and Family want to go to Bricktops because the food is better... Do NOT be afraid of your competition, you have them beat in Service by a LONG shot!!!  Go in their and get a piece of Pie... OR you could have a Public ""Stand-off"", don't do that you are not ready for it!

2nd Note to the Owners tweak your BBQ sauce or CHANGE IT COMPLETELY!  Bricktops is Beating you here and I'll tell you a Secret and it is NOT a Bricktops Secret it is and ""OUTLAW"" Secret : : Peppercorn Blend!!!  Your Ribs are HIGH Quality and Deserve e a better Sauce!!!  You can do this...if so many people like your BBQ sauce keep it and make an improved one and see what happens!

3rd Note to the Owners - This one IS Personal!  I WANT YOU to WIN!!!",2013-01-29 19:23:20

They were pretty packed for a Sunday night but the wait for a table of two (10-15 minutes) was not too bad. We ordered the wasabi takoyaki, chicken karage, unagi rice and a pork ramen. We had the option to add $2 for a drink so we got the ice Japanese Genmaicha green tea and the rose calpis - both very refreshing and went well with our meal.

I really enjoyed the karage chicken and the pork from the ramen - the ramen itself was so-so. The unagi rice came with a miso soup (a bit too salty for my liking) and it was a very generous portion. The wasabi takoyaki wasn't anything special.

I would definitely come back for more chicken karage and try their desserts in the future!",2017-01-31 16:20:53

This restaurant fulfills that requirement in a great way.  There are so many to choose from.  We had trouble deciding what to get but here are the ones we chose and if we liked them or not.  (note: their menu changes from time to time)  
Coca Foie Gras - LOVED this dish.  ""coca"" is a flat Spanish bread that is delicious, it is crunchy and softens with the sauce on top.  This bread was topped with beets and foie gras.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavors melded together like a perfect bite.

Spanish Tortilla - Think of this like a frittata with potatoes in it.  This was delicious and it was the first thing to disappear off of our table.  This is worthy of ordering as a side dish to your other tapas.

Serrano Tender - Prime tenderloin on top of the coca bread and then topped with foie gras.  This missed the mark for us.  The meat wasn't that tender and there was not a lot of flavor to it.  I would pass on this next time.

Octopus a la Gallega - These were coin sized pieces of tender octopus served on top of a half dollar sized formed potato, the sauce is heavy on the Spanish paprika and I found it a little bitter at the end.  Not one of our favorites, would probably not order this again.

Brava Potatoes - spicy potatoes - this is one of my go to tapas whenever I visit a Spanish restaurant.  I can usually gauge the level of excellence by this simple dish.  These were some of the best I have ever had.  The potatoes were perfectly prepared and the sauce was divine.  This is a must have.  Even if you are just sitting at the bar for some Sangria, you have to order this.  

Mixed Paella - NOTE, if you want Paella or any of the larger entrees you MUST order them immediately.  They can take up to one hour to be ready.  So do not delay.  Having said that, the wait is worth it.  This Paella was delicious, with smoky undertones and the best rice I've had in a restaurant.  By the way, I am not a fan of rice, that's my husband's go to dish and yet I ate this too, it was that good.

This restaurant is in the main lobby of the Aria, it is loud, there is a lot of activity around you and it's worth coming in for a bite.  The staff went above and beyond and the drinks were good.  You can eat as little or as much as you want here, but this is not a quick place to eat.  Make sure you have time and sit down and RELAX.",2015-10-10 00:47:08

The next time I came was for a happy hour and I have to say this is one of the prettier bars in Las Vegas definitely worth the trip . Then I started coming here before and after Smith Center event with a dear friend of mine and it seems we made acquaintances with the executive chef.  This is a wonderful place and if you haven't been in the dining room it's in the Plaza Hotel where the pool used to be years and years and years ago. So an interesting location which had a great view prior to the slotzilla being built.  Shall we talk about the food? Yes lets! First of all I went to a wonderful birthday dinner tonight and let me tell you about the barbecue shrimp and crab cakes . Just eat them. They're amazing . The crabcake is exactly what you would want crab a little veg and no filler.  The barbecue shrimp is beyond words. I've had most of the salads the Caesar salad wedge salad and the chopped salad. The chopped salad is my favorite but they're all good.  My friends and I have ordered the Tomahawk twice and it is buttery salty and delicious.

/Atmosphere & Crowd
I go here for the metalhead kind of concerts, so the crowd is what it is. The male to female ratio is sad and discouraging, but then again keep focus on why you are here.. it aint no nightclub brother. The crowd is nice, but atmosphere is stand-off-ish. 

/Bar & Sound
The bar is the bare minimum, and that is enough. Prices could be cheaper, but they rake in money here I am sure. The sound isn't the best, but when I read a lot of complaints regarding the sound - I must state that I have been to way worse venues with way shittier sound. This isn't bad.. 

/Bands & Price
For the price that you pay for the ticket, you can see some pretty cool bands. The one thing I think is a complete rip-off is the 'service fee' of $7 per ticket. That's just a racket and is shameful. Just add that to the ticket price, because that's what it is. We all know it. 

Overall value:
I go here. I won't polish this turd, but then again if you go see the bands I go see.. this venue fits its purpose and fills its expectations. I have gone here several times, and I will keep going as long as they book bands that play my music. (And yes, they still have $7 parking - which is excessive.)

There are so many fun things here- Life sized Connect Four, huge beanbag toss, shuffleboard on the inside. Lots of beanbag chairs and seating areas are pretty plentiful. There's no waitress service, but there is a big bar and a few mini-bars around. The main bar is pretty busy, but the bartenders move quickly, so there wasn't too much of a wait.

The best thing about this place is outside! I think that it is called ""The Backyard."" I really wish that it hadn't been so chilly, because I would have loved to explore it more. I saw life-sized Jenga, more beanbag throws, beer pong, playhouses, a skating rink and a guy singing with a guitar! They had space heaters around, but it just wasn't enough to combat the chill for me. There were lots of people out there, but I am a punk when it comes to the cold!

There was also a DJ spinning some pretty fun songs. I love to dance, but I didn't see many people doing it. Maybe later in the night, there's more dancing? It would be great if so!

With $20 for an AYCE, dont expect anything mind blowing. While the sushi seemed fresh, especially the ""carpaccio"" style, here are the cons:

- Picture vs. Reality - I did not get a chance to take a picture because I was starving. But to not get what was pictured on the menu was disappointing. I know all about trying to stretch the product. But just like Zero Degrees, what they present on the pictured menu was not what I got. The pictures salmon carpaccio you can tell was cut at an angle, giving the illusion of larger portions. The cut that I actually got showed the chef was not totally caring at all about presentation. Imagine /    / that was on the picture menu. Instead, I received straight cuts which made the salmon look measly on the plate.

 - Service - I get that I came at the shift change from lunch to dinner, but you are still on the clock. Dont sit me at the bar where i requested and then sit at the end of the bar counting the money while forgetting about servicing your guests. If a guest has to ask for something, it means you as a server are not paying attention to me. And you expect me to tip over 20% for service? No thank you.

- I can see why they are giving the macaroon ice cream sandwiches for free... I checked in (and found out that there's a Yelp! Check In promotion and was not informed by the staff). The ice cream sandwich itself was about 3"" in diameter and a good 2"" thick of ice cream. It's only good as a picture, but the matcha ice cream has no taste whatsoever. It was mostly color with no matcha flavor to save its namesake.

- Sushi Chefs hardly conversed with you compared to other local sushi restaurants. That's the point guests want to sit at the bar, to interact with the chef and for guests to see their meal prepared. At least put on an act of wanting to talk with your guest, not having your face down avoiding any kind of guest interaction.

Overall, I would have rated this place 2/5, but the draw of $20 AYCE is enough to get me to come back. Hey. Cheap eats is cheap eats.",2018-06-21 03:30:42

THIS is good pizza. I wish I could use swear words in this review because I REALLY want to get my point across: THIS IS AMAZING PIZZA!!!

My friends and I came here after hitting the Brew fest all day to sop up the alcohol with PIZZA and CARBS. Yum. 

It was my first time here. It was about 9:00 on a Saturday night. We didn't have to wait. AWESOME. The patio looked (and sounded) intriguing because there were a lot of people out there and it seemed like there was an awesome party going on. But, we had been outside in the cold all day so we opted to sit inside. 

We ordered the 15th Street BLT salad to share and we stared at the pizza options for a good 15 minutes before we finally decided to settle on the DI FARA SPECIAL.

BLT salad came out really quickly and it had an entire avocado on top of it. I love avocado. Very fresh and simple but with great flavors: the bacon really complimented the cheese flavor of the dressing. 

The DI FARA turned out to be an amazing decision. When we ordered it, the waitress asked if we wanted the smaller version. We said no and upon eating my first bite, I was very happy we got so much of it because I was already excited to eat it cold! 

The pizza was deep dish (I'm not sure if you can get NY style if you ask for it?). The crust was flaky and soft but crunchy and almost had a buttery flavor to it. It was heavenly. The sauce is on-another-planet-good and the pepperoni reminded me of Grimaldi's pepperoni (but smaller). Very authentic and meaty. The cheese was wonderful and balanced the flavors of the sauce and crust perfectly. I don't think I could have imagined a better deep dish pizza, honestly. 

Some might say $26 is a lot for pizza, but I don't. This pizza was huge. I only ate 2 pieces and probably should have stopped after 1.5 but literally ate past ""full"" because of how good it was. The 3 of us ate about half of the pizza and I was MORE THAN HAPPY to take it home and have another 2-3 days of left over pizza! :) 

Oh, and our server was wonderful and friendly and kept our drinks full all night! 

I can't wait to come back and try their other pizzas!!!",2012-11-12 06:14:30

Used to be a nice, cozy place where you could get a bite to eat, and gamble. A locals place where everyone knew you. The fountains outside were a nice place for the kids to play in the summer. 

Unfortunately like everything else Barley's has changed, and not for the better. In this review I'll deal with my interactions with this business over the last 8 months. 

After not going into Barley's for a few years I went in about 8 months ago. The employees were very friendly, I got everyone's business card, was told to call them if I needed ANYTHING, that they would leave the casino to get me what I needed (BS, they love this line, but it's BS). I really didn't need anything, I'm sort of a non needy type player. I like to be left alone, get a diet coke every now and then and if I win a hand pay I like it paid promptly. That's not really a problem here, since the machines rarely if ever hit. If they do no one is automatically called, you need to flag down an employee. Sort of low class. And there aren't many employees here. You have your Manager on Duty, the pay out girl, a cocktail waitress (sometimes), someone in the change booth, security guy walking around and a janitor. That's it. The only time I did need anything, was at the end of the day of being there. I needed some change. There was no one around. I didn't want to leave my machine. Security walked by and I asked him about it and he told me to go to the change booth. Great. BUT REMEMBER! ''They'll get you ANYTHING here! If you need ANYTHING just let them know! blah blah blah blah blahhhhhhhhhh.'' I asked two other people walking by and was told to go to the change booth. So I left. 

Took me 8 more months to come back in, I thought it might be better this time. It wasn't. When I walked in I got a very tired non-authentic ''If you need something let me know.'' from a male employee who looked half asleep.  The machines were still horrible, you still had to flag someone down for any assistance. Again I was told repeatedly that if I needed anything to just ask. I wanted a cup of coffee. They brought me THE oldest cup of coffee known to man. I almost gagged when I tasted it. I complained and the woman who brought it to me said loudly ''Well I don't drink coffee how was I to know?'' Your nose doesn't work? The cocktail waitresses are either around every 5 minutes, or gone for hours. On this morning all the employees were very busy mopping the floor. Everyone was very concerned about this floor. They had everyone with mops and rags. Never mind the customers WE HAVE A DIRTY FLOOR! 

On this occasion I asked for a ham sandwich from the coffee shop. They have no ham. I said that was fine I didn't want anything. So the girl comes up to me 20 minutes later and tells me the security guard will run to Smith's to buy me ham. Really? Then just go do it. 20 minutes ago. Don't come up and ask me first. You may as well have said ''It's a huge inconvenience and that's why I'm asking first so do you still want it???'' Forget it. They acted like I ordered a Baked Alaska or something. It's a HAM sandwich! 

Against my better judgment I ended up there a third time, about a week later. Same horrible machines gobbling up your money like it was tic-tacs, same ''If you need ANYTHING just ask!'' Same cocktail waitress up my butt every five minutes.... until I wanted something. I thought I would get something to go and look at a menu so I turned my light on my machine on. No one came, nothing happened, zilch. Twenty minutes later, as I was getting ready to leave the girl asked what I wanted and I said ''What are you talking about?'' I had even forgot I had put my light on. Again, there are NO employees at this business and the ones there are lazy. She said she was on break and had asked the security guard to watch out for me and call her if my light went on. He didn't. He was too busy hacking up his lungs and touching everything in the place. He coughed and coughed and coughed, rarely bothering to cover his mouth. And then went around touching things in the casino. I don't know if he was sick, or it was a smoker's cough but it was nasty and this employee had no business being at work. They don't need a security guard anyhow. They do nothing. They walk back and forth through the casino. Even when asked to do something, as in this example, they can't handle it. So I got to drive thru Wendy's for lunch. 

They don't care about customers. Customers are treated like shit. They pay a good lip service, but when you hold their feet to the fire you're the one who gets burned. Barley's is a sad example of a ''Stations Casino'' and needs a major overhaul. Learn how to treat your customers correctly. I know I won't go back there. But I have a feeling I'll be driving by before too long and see it completely out of business.",2016-08-15 21:07:46

The salsa bar is located in the indoor space which can get crowded easily.  When you approach the counter, there are several individuals taking orders.

They seemed a bit overwhelmed by the menu and the gentleman who was taking their order seemed frustrated that they didn't know what they wanted.  He gave them a big ""eye roll"" while they were looking up at the menu so the guests did not even notice this but I did.  I thought to myself, how rude.  In retrospect, I should have walked out and not given them my business but I stayed and placed my order.

So another gentleman came up to us to take our order and we were ready and clear when we placed our order. I ordered tacos de barbacoa and tripas, while my boyfriend ordered the mixed plate that should have included beans and they got his order wrong.

With the right tortillas it could really elevate the flavors of the meat but realized I've had better.

Got a half dozen oysters. They were the Sea Level house oysters but I noticed they had lots of different types from various places. They came out on the half shell on ice with sauces. Delicious. Well sized. Exactly what oysters should be. Since my hubby doesn't eat oysters, I convinced him to order the clam chowder. Really I just wanted to try the clam chowder.

I'm so glad that I did as I met a few great neighbors and felt super at home.

8 brews on draft- all from the West Side of the country.  A few Four Peaks, and then a house beer- The Main Ale (Yes, TMI!).  I had the Main Ale, Four Peaks Hefe and the Blonde Ale tonight- all good.  I will probably stick to the TMI ale and Four Peaks in the future.  In addition, they have the core boozy bases- I ended up with some obscure AZ brewed Wildberry vodka press that made me happy that I believe in night caps.  

I ordered the mac and cheese for dinner.  This apparently is a side dish that Matt's sister makes for all of their families big holiday gatherings, that they turned into a whole dish with green chiles.  Cheesy and spicy?  It is like Matt knew me before he knew me to make this awesome dish.  SOLD.

Another cool note:  Matt's mom has recently went Vegan so he is a bit more aware of the world and people who eat a bit differently.  That being said, he has a veggie panini on the menu that can be made vegan- I will try it within a week but I'm just glad he has made it an option.

They had a D.J. and a room specifically for hookah which unfortunately was packed so we ended up with a table in the dining area.  Because it was dark and late it ended up being OK (and you can still hear the music). It took about 35 minutes for the Hookah to come to the table, so we had some drinks to wait. 

When the Hookah did arrive, it didn't work.  It took another 10 minutes to flag down a server to have her fix it, and then another 10 minutes for a new one to come.  Overall it took about an hour to get our Hookah.  I assumed this was an OFF night and they were understaffed but after reading other reviews it looks as if service is a common issue here. The flavors they offered were similar to other Hookah lounges, we had the ""Skittles"" flavor.  

I think the waitress felt bad for the lack of service and a table opened up in the big room (where the DJ is) and asked us if we wanted to move.

This joint is really close to my house and I frequent Lee Lee market plus meet buds for coffee at the Micky D's which is practically next door. We got there a little after 1 on a Friday. We were the only ones there. Now, when you talk about Chinese or Asian restaurants in general, one of the ""I'm freakin out"" moments is when you walk in and you're the only one(s) there. Immediately I confer with my comrades and we decide to hang out. ""What's the worse thing that could happen"", T says. ""You've had food poisoning before, it didn't kill ya"". Geeez.
The 3 of us grabbed a booth and checked out the menu. Pretty straight forward. The cool thing is you see some of the standard Chinese fare but you get to choose the type of noodle that's in it.  There are 5 different sizes of noodles which are all hand pulled by the noodle maker right behind the glass window. So, if you have kids, bring them here. They can watch the guy making the noodles they're about to eat while you explain that REAL food doesn't come out of a box. But I digress. My one disappointment at this point is that there was no Rice Noodle. My favorite. 
T ordered the Pan Fried Dumplings (8) $6.35. You can also get them steamed. Whoa. This is a meal in itself. The dough wrapper, lightly fried around the beef filling was yummy. We each had 2 and were already getting full. 
I ordered the Spring Rolls (2) for $3.25. These were ok. Nothing special. I would have preferred a lot more vegetable stuffing. I would not recommend these.
Because T, S & I were yapping away and not paying attention to anything but the noodle maker, we didn't realize that we pretty much ordered the same thing. I ordered the Beef With Stir-Fried Narrow Flat Noodles ($8.65). T ordered the Beef With Stir-Fried Shave Noodles In Xo Spicy Sauce ($8.65). So aside from the XO spicy sauce and the size of the noodle, we basically got the same dish. Oooops. With so many yummy things on the menu, this was a major goof on our part. S didn't order anything else which is a good thing because the portion size is plentiful. 
Both dishes had plenty of sliced beef, the sauces were quite good and of course the noodles were amazing. S & I devoured the non spicy dish. Be prepared, the narrow flat noodles are VERY long. Which is a good thing because that represents long life and all, but it does make it hard to move from the serving plate to your plate. Plus, the noodles stuck together which made them more of a clump then individual strands. I also helped T with the XO spicy one. This dish was not as spicy as I thought it would be. T was sweating pretty good though and for someone who's family is from Myanmar plus he eats spicy food all the time, I chuckled just a little. This dish was made with shave noodles. These were much easier to move from the serving plate to my plate so yippee there and it was really tasty. Winner winner hand made noodle dinner.
I would say that for an empty restaurant, the service was slow. Plus, the waiter brought out my entree first and after a very long pause the two apps, and then finally the other entree. Strange way for the kitchen to put out the dishes. I'll chalk it up to a cook that was maybe woken up from a nap when we walked in. Sorry. The other thing I didn't really like was that the noodles were piled on top of the veggies and sauce. This made it hard to really get the full flavor and texture with each bite until we ate enough of the noodles so we could actually get to some of the veggies. Strange way to present the food.

Waiter came back with drinks and took lunch orders. I got the Expresso Burrito from the lunch menu and my friend ordered the Chicken Chimichanga. The food took less than five minutes and arrived on very hot plates. I found mine delicious though light on the promised pork verde. The Chicken Chimi was chock full of chicken. Both were delicious.

By this time, the lunch rush had cleared out, so we stayed another hour talking and were not pressured by the staff to move on. Our drinks were refilled a few times too.

Overall impression: excellent surroundings and a great (if rushed) atmosphere. Good food. Very low price. I'll come back for sure!",2009-06-10 22:24:01

You had me fooled lol. It was super juicy, and I could taste the freshness of every ingredient with each bite. The pretzel bun was also perfectly toasted. Been awhile since I enjoyed a burger like that! Got a side of their parmesan Yucca fries to go along with the burger, and it was bomb! Nice and crisp on the outside. It tasted like these Korean onion ring chips I used to eat when I was young. 

I also got their infused water drinks with cucumber, and it was so refreshing! They put guarana in it, which is a plant imported from Brazil, and it's supposed to keep you super wired due to its high caffeine content. 

I don't think I'll ever become a vegan tbh (I love my meats), but eating this food was a nice change of pace. Will definitely be back to try some of their other items!",2018-05-10 22:12:59

Step right up!

Free EYE CANDY today ladies and the few gentlemen that like to ogle our men in uniform. 

Today at noon 5 Guys Burgers and Fries Losee/Craig location had a line out the door, 1/3 of which, due to the windy day and lack of flying,  were young uniformed eye candy straight from Nellis Air Force Base.

Don't get me wrong I came here for the food.  The eye candy was just a very very nice unexpected bonus...eh...distraction from the horrible parking lot, mundane food and below average service that 5 Guys Burgers and Fries offers.

Menu wise there was a positive. You look at the menu and build your own burger. If you don't ask for it, you don't get it. What I found interesting was that they offer mushrooms as one of the toppings but no option to change up the cheese from cheddar to swiss. There is no ranch dressing in the building. You can choose between raw onion, grilled onion or both. They also have green peppers and a choice between regular and cajun fries. 

After I had ordered and was waiting for my to go bag one of the Men of Nellis offered me a chair and some of his cajun fries. The cajun fries had a kick. They tasted like straight season salt and I polished off half of my drink after only tasting one. 

Unfortunately the food comes no where near being as good as the walk in scenery of men in uniform. After a 20 minute line wait and slight shock over the prices the burger ($6 for only the burger, $5 for large fries), left nothing much to write about. The best way to describe my burger is okay. Just okay. Either they give you a double for the regular burgers or they messed up and gave me an extra patty. Either way It was not hot or well done as it had  a lot of pink in the middle and was tasteless.  Even with bacon and extra cheese on it it had no flavor. My regular fries turned out to be over salted and very greasy. 


Along with noticing the Nellis eye candy I noticed a few people returning food. They had been given the wrong bags of food or the wrong burgers, One person brought a bag back and said that he had been handed the wrong food.  At that point the man hollering out the numbers hollers out the number on the returned bag.  No checking the bag or remaking the order. That really screams of public health and safety.  There were about 10 people behind the counter cooking and bagging the orders. They holler out your number and you grab your greasy bag and either go or stay. If you stay, free refills on your soda and more time to ogle the Men of Nellis. If you go, when you get home you will have an extremely greasy bag with fries almost falling out of it because it is soaked through.

2 Stars. One star for the Men of Nellis and the other star for...luring in the Men of Nellis. My recommendation would be if your craving a burger go across the street to In and Out with your $6. When you are done the Men of Nellis will still be in line at 5 Guys and you can ogle away from the parking lot.",2011-04-29 20:38:25

The outside of the building looks very plain & ""warehouse-ish"". Their sign/logo is very simple & plain. But when you walk inside, it's a very earthy/chill looking coffee shop.

They have a lot of options to choose from, so I asked the barista what their bestsellers are for someone who likes sweet drinks. She recommended 3 Lattes: Nutella, Creme Brûlée, and Butterbeer. I chose Butterbeer.

Having a super sweet tooth, this wasn't too sweet for me.. and I wish I asked for an extra pump of sweetness or something. Caramel/butterscotch was good, Cinnamon was very pungent, which could be a pro or con. 
Overall, my beverage was good. Now I'm keen to try their Creme Brûlée & Nutella.

I came here during lunch time, so majority of the tables were taken by people on their laptops/studying. They have a cute little seating area outside, but that's where all the smokers sit.

I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in the area to try their other lattes, and their infamous Alien Burrito.",2016-06-14 01:16:04

I unwrapped my pita and was greeted by a large falafel ball. I dove in. My first bit was decent the falafel was moist and slightly crisp, The Peta was fresh and the cabbage was nice, however it was dry with out the tahini.

Sean is SUCH an amazing server and always makes us feel completely at home.   He remembers where we like to sit, what we like to drink, and basically remembers what we order.   I have observed him with other customers and he is as equally pleasant to them as he is to us.    We have had other servers through the years and all have been pleasant and efficient. 

The atmosphere is a typical IHOP/chain/non-descript eating establishment.  What you see is what you get.  Nothing fancy or trendy.   They did update this location in the last year or so, but one thing that bothers me is that they seemed to stop part-way through- and it looks unfinished.   Whatever, it's an IHOP, for the love of Pete.... who cares?

I have been ordering the Chicken Florentine crepes for my breakfast - without the hollandaise, because I think hollandaise is gross, not because theirs is bad.  It's just gross in general.  

The others in my group get eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, blah, blah, blah, and it's always cooked to order and there has NEVER been a complaint - EVER.  This is surprising because we're a tough group to please. 

I've been to this location a few times on the weekends and it's always packed, but they turn over the tables pretty easily and the food is pretty consistent. 

So, if you're in the area and want a trustworthy straightforward breakfast, this is a clean location and friendly servers.   Stop in and tell Sean that Laura said 'hi'.",2014-07-01 00:20:50

I don't think that their quality is even close to be able to charge $9 for their burritos. What really disappointed me too, was the fact that neither of their salsas had any heat to them. I wouldn't praise this place for their cleanliness either. I have to say, I was actually let down after my experience here. I just believe the competition is fierce in their niche, and I can't with confidence say that they are quite up to par. 

I don't believe I will ever return, just wasn't good enough. The one thing that I did like was the use of fresh jalapenos and not pickled ones from the jar. Their eggs were dry, the meat tasted not just old, but of low-quality. I might as well eat something cheaper; at least I wouldn't be upset with spending so much money.

1. We never got a refill on our drinks.

2. Our waiter never came to check on us (that could have remedied #1).

3. Our food came out COLD - not a little warm, not cool, COLD. All of us (five adults, two kids) ordered dishes with meat and not a single one was hot. Not being completely ridiculous we decided not to eat the potential parasite-feast that was presented to us.

4. Upon voicing our unhappiness with the temperature of our food and lack of anything to drink our waiter, quite rudely I might add, said we'd be taken care of.

5. ""Taken care of"" means 10% a bill where 3 appetizers, 5 entrees, a kid's meal, and 5 drinks were ordered of which, conservatively, 9% of the food was consumed.

I can't imagine the problem was a busy staff since there was one other table of patrons while we were eating. Even IF they were slammed how can you serve COLD meat? On top of that you think 10% off will make up for five plates of food poisoning?

I used to love Big Dog's food as I have visited on and off over the last 5 years. 

Tonight was a total let down. I have not been in several months and tonight, I bragged to my friend who had never been on how good their food was and that was our decision for dinner tonight! BAD MISTAKE! 

First off I did not even look at the menu, I already knew what I wanted, the same thing I always order, my BBQ pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. 

When I informed the server of what I wanted she replies "" well actually we have changed the menu a bit, the pulled pork sandwich is now made into sliders"" Yikes, that is never a good sign when the menu has been changed. 

So I had the hankering for sweet BBQ pulled pork so I went with the sliders and and sweet potato fries. 

When I got my plate, the sweet potato fries were no longer ""fries"" instead a thin criss cut type of fry similar to Carl's Jr. however thin and dry. 

Wow, I see why they changed the menu, for my particular once fantastic BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which used to be on a delicious sandwich roll bread filled with a generous portion of meat. Also the sauce used to be made from scratch, now is nothing more than Bullseye BBQ sauce from the store. 
My once perfect sandwich is now three sliders, with a spoonful of meat slapped on with tasteless bottled BBQ sauce and store bought slider buns. 

The cost of cutting back shows in this dish. 

The sweet potato fries used to be so delicious and yummy when in the form of ""fries"". The change to a thin dry wafer like criss cut type of chip is not tasty and makes no sense to change something perfectly wonderful the way it was. 

My friend ordered the pot roast burrito and regular french fries. nothing spectacular, was flavorless, thank goodness for salt as she sprinkled before each freaking bite. 

I am so disappointed, I will not return, this last visit has really turned me off. 

If it ain't broke don't fix it! 

The changes are evident of cut backs. I am all for running your business cost efficient however don't start off with something so perfect and butcher it just to save a few pennies!

I decided to buy a Groupon, MISTAKE. Why would they sell them if they are just going to treat the people like absolute crap?

I go in to get my roots bleached and ask the stylist BEFORE to check my scalp to make sure it is healthy enough to bleach. She insists it is (the bleach is very damaging so sometimes I have to wait a little longer between visits for it to heal) and starts bleaching. I know the usual tingle but I started experiencing a chemical burn on my skull. My hair is not all the way bleached and comes out an exotic color of orange. I am charged an extra $25 for toner, which she put on even though my scalp was BLISTERING, it put me in tears. 

She tells me that I can come back at another time to get toned. So now I have yellow hair. This all could have been prevented had she been honest with me, I would have come back in a few weeks. Instead I was lied to. What a waste of $$!

I called and complained to the manager, who said I could come in and get a scalp treatment for free and still the free tone. 

Work came up the day of my scalp treatment, I called to change the day and they said I only had 7 days from date of dye to do it so tough luck.

The crepes were super thick, almost pancake-like. They ran out of tomato juice, no bloody mary,  so my friend and I decided on sangria. The 1st one was good but 2nd was tooooo sweet.

I was with my friend who craves going to Chinese restaurants. I am one of the few folks who will go with her.

We saw Yong Kang Street at Paris Las Vegas and decided to do an early dinner there before catching a show. We went with dim sum. We sat outside the restaurant that was sort of a patio, but fenced in. It made you feel like you were indeed having street food.

Since this area was rather narrow, we didn't have too many carts with dim sum goodies being rolled to us. Rather, we marked what we wanted on a itemized menu with a pencil and the food came to us. We liked this method, as it allowed us to figure out what we wanted.

The dim sum quality was amazing. It tasted authentic. My friend doesn't eat pork, so I went crazy with pork-filled dumplings and other pork items. Naturally, we shared seafood, beef, and chicken dishes.

The most notable dim sum item that we loved the best was the crab claw. It was a generously sized crab claw with the perfect crunch. It was by far the yummiest crab claw that I have ever had in my life. It should be. It ran $8 for a single jumbo crab claw!

We ordered a lot of items. The prices at this restaurant are steep. You have been warned! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, including how much we paid for our food.

If you feel like treating yourself or have won a large sum of money at the craps table, this place is for you. If you are on a budget, I would recommend going someplace else.

Prices for dinner are ridiculous and the food quality is terrible. They get away with it because they are located in the N.Y. N.Y. Hotel and can charge high prices for low end food.  My friend and I had dinner there recently, I had the flat iron steak and my friend had the shrimp scampi dinner. It wasn't that impressive looking at it in the dish but we thought it tasted OK not great but OK.  Service was terrible, our waitress took the order and then never checked back to see if the food was to our liking. We had to call the manager for a minor problem. We saw the waitress when it was check time.  I tasted his food and he had some of mine and we agreed it wasn't worth the price.  When we left the restaurant we both got such tummy aches we had to literally RUN TO THE NEAREST RESTROOM, and everything we just ate immediately left our body. (need I say more). Apparently the food wasn't handled properly.  After we came back from the restroom we both felt fine.  I called the restaurant and complained and also filled out a report (why) I didn't say I had food poisoning, but this was their  practice, to cover themselves just in case.  I emailed the corporate office about our experience and received a phone call from their VP whose name was Paul and he told me ""it was baloney"" I couldn't possibly have gotten sick that quickly from their food.  His manners on the phone were horrible, very loud and didn't listen to what I was telling him.  Basically he said I couldn't have gotten sick from their food and I told him unless he ate the food out of my dish he shouldn't say that.  He wasn't there watching it being prepared nor did he eat it.  Since  we both had stomach aches and rushed to the restroom after leaving the America Restaurant  it was because of the improper handling of the food.  I expected an apology but what I got was a yapping Vice President who of course believes that the America restaurant is perfect.  Nothing is perfect and if a customer complains about a problem I would think good customer service would be to apologize for a terrible dining experience.  Not so here.

There were so may options for the grilled cheese, that it was almost overwhelming, but I was able to pick through and come up with a top choice.  What was had at my table was- the big che-bowski, the mac attack, the poppin' my collar, and the smack yo mamma.  I personally ordered the smack yo momma.  The flavors were all there and a great combo, but unfortunately, the chicken seemed a little on the dry side.  Luckily, the bbq sauce covered it up, for the most part.  My friend who ordered the mac attack, was disappointed in the small showing of Bacon Lardons in her sandwich - she was able to confidently identify two small pieces of bacon.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their sandwiches.  We all stuck with the homemade chips, which were what you can expect from homemade chips - better than from a bag. 
The restaurant itself had very trendy decor - Edison bulbs, exposed wood plank walls and ceiling structure in a dark gray/black color with a chalkboard special menu.  I was surprised by the amount of space and number of tables considering it's on the second floor of the building.  
One of the oddest things about the restaurant is the location of the bathrooms.  You have to walk past the kitchen and dodge servers with food to be taken out to get to them.  It was a little awkward and uncomfortable.

Like any place, there are pros and cons; it all depends on what you're going for.

I enjoy the variety of drinks they have available - teas, smoothies, and the multitude of flavorings, bubbles, and jellies you can mix together to make your own unique creation. 

I get mine light on the ice so I don't have to go boba hunting when I'm finished with my drink.

As someone with a number of food allergies to watch out for, I also appreciate that their drink base is non-dairy, and they also have almond milk available as an option.

The staff are always very friendly, and if you have any special requests (or are very indecisive) they're happy to help you come to a delicious decision. Plus, free wi-fi!

The things that could use improvement? I wish they had more locations around town -- having to drive to the other side of town to get my boba fix makes me sad. I wish Madison could support another bubble tea place or two -- one on each side of town. But that's just a wish on my part; overall, they're centrally located, which is great.

Also, their location is fairly open floor plan -- tall ceilings, and not a lot on the walls. This isn't a problem when it's not busy, but this place is ALWAYS BUSY. (Mostly a good thing!) But busy means noisy, and without anything on the walls or floor to deaden the sound, it really hinders my desire to hang out do a bit of work on their free wifi, and drink my bubble tea!

Overall, I still highly recommend stopping by to at least try it out. And if it's loud in there, I guess you could always ask people to use their inside voices. =)",2014-10-30 21:27:41

Ordered kanel snegl - lovely cinnamon roll with chocolate - a little bit flaky and nice touch of sweetness. My favourite bite was the last bite (centre of the danish) so good!
The layers had a crunchy and nice crispy exterior.

This place has all the feel of being..Native American? Well it is on a Indian Reserve....but it's like really fancy Native American decor...they have different paintings for each menu...and the waiter told us that it changes every time so even when you go back you'll see a different painting on the menu. The menu is also cleverly named too...instead of appetizer, small bites, and entree...they replaced it with ""the birth"", ""the beginning"" and ""the journey"" each corresponding to the amount of food each one serves. I'm giving it 4 stars for the atmosphere alone. =)  

My bf made reservations at this place for 5:45pm but we were stuck in traffic for a while and my bf gave them a call telling them we would be a little late..this place is located in a far off resort and spa of Wild Horse Pass..not that easy to find but it's really nice and quiet around this area in Chandler.

When we arrived the hostess referred to us as Mr. and Mrs. Li....I was about to correct her but my bf thought it would be funny just to say yes..haha so the whole night they just referred to us as Mr. Li or Mrs. Li..  Oi one thing I notice throughout the whole night is that -- there are NO YOUNG people here....my bf and I were the youngest couple here....other people were at least 40 and above. This is a pricey restaurant.....but why no young people here on Friday night? I guess they rather spend $$$$ at clubs or something..hehe maybe not just saying.

Well let's get on with the food review, shall we? They served us three selections of some pretty good breads and olive oil to start off with..then they gave us each a tablespoon of chef's special dumplings with toasted parsley and after that we got Guava sherbet with Pomegranate Reduction....DELISH! After all the little complimentary foods, we finally got to order...

 They do have a tasting menu but that's not what we tried this time...instead we started off with a Lobster, Pumpkin & Mesquite Grilled Squash Bisque...it was not only yummy but so cool! they bring out a plate with lobster, avocado and pepita seeds arranged below a swirl of meringue..then they set it on fire with a small torch to toast the meringue then putting off the fire by pouring in the bisque! haha that's was really cool. 

For entree, I had the juicy, tender and super flavorful Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage infused Gnocchi....usually not a fan of gnocchi but they made it really tasty! My bf had their most famous dish...Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo...I really love the Sweet Corn Puree on this dish...the buffalo meat was also very tender and flavorful...both meats were pretty much melt in your mouth goodness.

Then for dessert we had the interesting Creme Brulee Cones....there were three Saguaro Seed Cones filled with different flavors of brulee in each...sweet corn, sweet vanilla and winter squash pudding. Topped with strawberry cotton candy that was sprinkled with chili. Very interesting....but I was not very fond of the sweet corn one...the others were really good.

The service was pretty good too, although what impressed me was at the end when my bf and I were walking out the hostess greeted us goodnight and said the waiter would like to further thank you for dining with us tonight...and handed us a card and little nicely wrapped bag of truffle and chocolate strawberry. I was like wow...that's really nice of them to actually write a thank you card! haha 

This place is definitely great for special occasions or when you feel like really splurging! but like I said we were the youngest couple this night...and I honestly don't think they see too many people in their 20's here.....

Those experiences let me know that Wong's was still an excellent restaurant. Finally, this weekend, I had an opportunity to enjoy another sit down meal at my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley!

This was not a special occasion. It was just an opportunity to enjoy lunch with my girlfriend, some family and a friend. Wong's made our lunch feel like a special occasion! The greeting at the lobby and the super friendly disposition of our servers was remarkable.

I was introduced to Wong's about 20 years ago by a good friend. It hasn't changed much (although I noticed a new menu which highlighted several new dishes). The dining room has a timeless, classiness about it. Everything is incredibly clean and very well maintained. Consider this, how many times have you been seated and felt the urge to remark about how clean and shiny the silverware is? What does that say about the places you typically dine at?

Our group was very hungry and concerned that the lunch menu we were given would skimp on the portions. For starters, we ordered (and enjoyed) the crab puffs, pot stickers and an order of Yu Shan Fried Rice (actually an entree). The appetizers were all excellent. It's hard to screw up crab puffs, but even harder to make them this good! The pot stickers filling was a little bland but the dipping sauce helped. Also, they had a slightly crispier texture than your standard rubbery pot stickers. Everyone noticed the Yu Shan rice on the new menu, so I'm glad we ordered it for everyone to sample. It was hands down the best fried rice I've enjoyed. It features the usual assortment of veggies and egg, plus chunks of pork and small shrimp. There is a reason it's on the entree list. This would've been a great meal by itself.

My usual Mongolian Beef was excellent. The beef was seasoned well and nice and tender, but not as spicy as I recalled. And it featured a generous amount of onion, green onion and rice noodles. And those who were worried about skimpy portions began to regret all the appetizers. Each lunch entree came with egg drop soup, brown rice, a few crab puffs and a spring roll. Lunch was a great value and we took a lot of leftovers home.

As we left, one person in our group said ""Even if the food here was just okay, I'd come back for the service alone!"" Thank you Wong's for being the consistently excellent restaurant you've always been!",2016-10-17 07:59:23

The crispy chikn sandwich will make you forget about Chick-Fil-A; get buffalo if you like it spicy. If you want to try a special that they post on special media, arrive early. They will sell out and you will be disappointed. It took me two attempts to score a California burrito. It's huge, packed full of asada, pinto beans, Mexican rice, fries, guacamole and more, and definitely worth $12. They even make a huge bacon burger with doughnut buns using Ronald's doughnuts. What the...

I'll be patiently waiting until they return and I can enjoy my next crispy avocado BLT wrap. Come back soon!",2016-02-26 23:35:04

My girlfriend and I head in and sit down with a group of friends already there. We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.

I am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.

At this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.

Oh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks.

Famously known as the lone occupant of Mandalay Bay's 63rd Floor, a Restaurant-slash-Nightclub that remains one of Sin City's lone proponents of a dress-code demanding Business Casual or better, it is within the hotel lobby that guests will find elevators behind a velvet rope, the ascent fairly quick to a space designed to impress and staff clearly hired as much for their looks as abilities to seat and serve.

One of eight such venues across America, the recent hiring of Chef Corey Miller from Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM promising upcoming menu changes per a middle-aged male waiter, it is after passing by statues of Buddha and other Deities that guests are seated in a room of polished wood with a balcony offering a panoramic view of Las Vegas Boulevard, a ""guest-list"" and/or cover charge apparently the only way to assure admission after dark on busier nights.

Priced significantly higher than House of Blues Restaurant or recently introduced B-Side, Happy Hour in the spacious Bar offering some good deals Sunday through Thursday while the current Restaurant Week three-course offers over 25% off a collection of longtime signatures, it was with Strip-priced Cocktails deferred that a Bread Basket appeared featuring five options alongside three Dips or Spreads, the fact that some were still warm a nice touch though only the Ciabatta lightly speckled with Olives and Crisps spread with Red Pepper Hummus proved worth more than a single taste.

Playing mid-tempo Pop overhead, the lack of Blues or even Rock telling as much about Foundation Room's target audience as a menu loosely rooted in the South but otherwise nondescript American 'Steakhouse,' it was with ""Salmon and a Salad with Dressing on the side"" tourists seated on both sides that Foundation Room's ""Jumbo"" Lump Crabcakes were presented, the adjective in reference not to portion but the chunks of sweet Crustacean that showed well without much binder beneath a fairly basic Apple and Fennel Salad.  

Decidedly curious about $40 Shrimp and Grits, ""My Cousin Vinny"" quotes about *Magic* Grits seemingly the only explanation for such a price, it was perhaps predictable that neither portion nor presentation outperformed what one gets at Yardbird for $28 or down South for $15, the fact that Shrimp were well cooked but largely overwhelmed by spices and salinity also worth noting.

Excellent in terms of service, both the Waiter and Runners present without being obtrusive and always quick to clear plates or refill Water, it was after Chef Miller toured the room checking in on guests that Dessert was presented, a small ramekin with bubbling Berries at the base and Custard-soaked Cubes of Bread beneath melting Peanut Butter Ice Cream definitely the night's highlight while ""fresh baked"" Cookies that arrived no more than five minutes after ordering were probably better described as ""warmed-to-order,"" the flavors just fine but texture medium-crisp from edge to center and none as noteworthy as the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream that is sweet yet subtle and one of the better scoops in Sin City.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Undeniably a concept more about the scene than its cuisine The House of Blues Foundation Room offers an experience well-suited to tourists and something 'fancy' but accessible, though with so many great Restaurants at Mandalay Bay and Rivea offering a better view at a similar pricepoint there seems little reason to book a table rather than just stopping in for Ice Cream or a Drink at the Bar.",2018-06-27 10:30:32

And ever since, none of the crepe cakes ive had live up to that standard. But i was impressed with this!! The rose flavour was just right and not too sweet. Cake was fluffly enough. The charcoal taro was was good too. Im just not a big fan of that fake taro flavour. But my friends liked it. Definitely recommend!

Regardless of if you prefer it spicy Korean style or just crunchy double-fried, this bird annihilates the Colonel and beats Popeyes and Rally's too. Right up there with Stockyards for me. 

I love it's simplicity, with a tiny bit of heat in it's plain iteration, and spicy sloppy deliciousness in the saucy Korean style.  Since I like it both ways, I order mine ""Half & Half"" which is exactly as it sounds. I also really like the smaller pieces, with a whole chicken being about a dozen individual pieces, since that raises the crunchy batter-to-chicken ration, which is all good by me!

This place can get busy, and chicken can take 15 - 25 minutes since it is cooked to order, so feel free to call ahead for pickup and then either take it out, or eat-in at one of the tables in house. They also have a hot table selection of decent Korean food which is available for you to build your own container and pay by the pound.

The supermarket is also excellent, if s bit on the pricy-side, but with correspondingly upscale quality. 

Oh, and the cubes of sweet pickled diced daikon is the most perfect accompanyment to the chicken, cutting through both the fried richness and the sticky sweet sauce, and comes free with your order, as do 3 cans of pop on Friday as part of the Friday Special.

Those were my first words when our food came out. This is a restaurant specializing in mariscos, which is something that you're probably not overly familiar with. Too many people think of Mexican food as just tacos and burritos, but you truly owe it to yourself to experience the amazing meals that you can have at a restaurant like this. 

We ordered three things- Molcajete Barbaroja, Fried whole fish, and Oysters on the half shell. Also a glass of horchata, and some water. So there ya go.

The Molcajete was amazing. I had NO idea how much I had been craving a dish like this, but now I have a new favorite. The octopus was grilled PERFECTLY, with just a hint of char and an amazingly soft-yet-chewy texture. It's one of those things that you just can't really describe- you just have to have it and fall in love with it. A piece of skirt steak was also in the mix, and it was just incredible. You pull it apart with your fingers, sop it with a tortilla, hit it with a squeeze of lime and hot sauce, then you're all set. 

The fried fish was fried perfectly, which isn't as easy as it sounds. It's common with these sorts of dishes to overcook them, even with good intentions. This fish was perfectly juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The meat was delicious, and the beans and rice which came with it were amazing. It's remarkable how good beans and rice can actually be, but it also sort of sucks because you know that once you have the really good stuff, you won't be able to go back to the bootleg shit that you grew up eating.

And now, a word about the oysters on the half-shell. This is another case in which Mexican cuisine FAR outstrips what we poor gringos are used to (see Shrimp Cocktail as well). Their version of oysters on the half shell involves slices of raw shrimp, scallops, red onions, and fresh avocados. It's basically a mini-ceviche on an oyster shell, and once you've had it you won't be able to go back to oysters with watery cocktail sauce and horseradish.

In short, this place is a jewel. The menu is all in Spanish with a little bit of English, but there are more than enough pictures to give you an idea of what you might like to order. People have remarked about this being in a 'sketchy' area, but that's just the price that you pay for authentic food. I wouldn't recommend walking five blocks south, but unless you're up to no good you wouldn't have any reason to do that anyways. :)",2014-04-27 19:21:28

First of all, I LOVE this space. Beautiful wine racks greet you when you arrive. Across the room at the bar, there's red brick wall, tall ceilings. It's a wonderful space to have. Surprisingly though, there weren't many people in here on a Saturday night around dinner. Hmmm...anyway..

We sat at the bar. I opened up the menu to find my favorite cocktail of all time- the Moscow Mule. It was a done deal. Wine can wait! Sadly though, this wasn't the Mule I was hoping to receive (the classic one in the copper cup). It was flat, and more like a martini. Epic fail. 

Food items ordered were the Pan-Seared Trout with a side of vegetables, Scallops, and Chef's Mac and Cheese. 

Like another yelper mentioned, the food came out way too fast. It was unbelievably speedy. Reheated much? I cannot prove this, and the kitchen is pretty closed off. 

Anyway, the trout was ok. The veggies alongside were ok. It was supposed to come with a tartar sauce but it didn't. The scallops came with some sort of brown tangy (from lime juice) sauce over raw/half cooked spinach. Kind of odd and I didn't love the sauce. And the mac and cheese was also just ok. It was more like a creamy pasta and came with wayyy too much of that cream sauce. I was expecting some sort of Michael Symon variation of mac and cheese, but this wasn't even close. But still, it was edible. Nothing to rave about. It was just all edible. 

On the plus side, we did find a new wine we liked and made note of it. I think it's worth a trip if you're in the mood to wine, not necessarily to dine. I would love to go back and check out the stellar patio that they have.",2012-10-21 21:49:10

This is my third trip to this establishment, and I have to say this is fast becoming my go to place for a killer New York style pizza.   Bistro is located off the 215 freeway on Gibson in a quiet strip mall that has a some pretty neat neighbor of a cup cake bakery, and a few other businesses around them. 

I was very fortunate to save a Yelp deal for this place on my phone, and even thought it was a very old deal that I forgot to redeem, the owner was super cool and gladly took the 1/2 off any pizza,   So I made my order for Large Pepperoni, homemade sausage, Mushroom, and black olives, and sat down at a table near the front door to wait for my take out order.   While siting there, i notice they had a library of books next to the other table, and started glancing through a book called the ""Everyone loves Pizza"".    There was the authors best pizza joints picks around the United States, and including a few Las Vegas parlors mention in the book too; but what got me, Bistro has a better pie than those other places mention for our city..  

The owner is very proud of his classic New York style crust, and it shows when you bite into a slice.  It's has a slight crunch but yet nicely chewy, and unlike Secret Pizza...this crust isn't oily and soggy in the middle.     The sauce is slightly sweeter, but has a lot of bite from garlic and oregano, and I should have asked for a little in a small cup for the end crust....it was good.    Bistro is very generous with the toppings, and the picture shows it.

BTW, if you ask them to make a Magoo's Pizza style Hot Ham and Mushroom sandwich, they will make it.   I""m pretty sure those of you from Hawaii know what that sandwich is like. 

Am I pleased with this pizza?   HELL YEAH, and so should you.    Check out their Yelp deal, and keep it handy.    Bistro...you are my pizza joint in Henderson.",2012-09-16 01:04:20

Our food choices landed on the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Bucking Bull Fries.  We've previously had the pizza before and wanted to see if it was still to our liking.   Since the last visit, they changed it a little bit by sprinkling the blue cheese crumbles on top instead of the blue cheese sauce.  It wasn't as good as before but still ok.

The real highlight is the noodles and how fresh it is. Not frozen. The sauces and ""toppings"" are all pretty standard.

The Peking Zha Jiang Mian was delicious. Absolutely my favorite. I got the thick cut noodles. Carbs overload but so worth it. The black bean sauce and the bean sprouts, cucumbers, carrots, beans... all just came together so well. 

The Spicy Wontons were a miss for me. Soggy and too oily.

Good lookin' out!  I was leaving the Cosmopolitan after the Black Keys show, hungry and bitter that both Jaleo and China Poblano had stopped serving food.  Suddenly, a friend texted me from HSB saying they had vegan options!

I traversed the mob of drunken concert-goers and arrived poste haste, just in time to put in the last to-go order of the night!

The main vegan options are the Urth burger sliders (2 for $8, comes with delicious homemade-tasting potato chips) or the proper full-sized Urth burger ($13, comes with a side of fries).  I went for the sliders, since I  have not had a slider since I was knee-high to a grasshopper back in TN eating at Krystal's.  

Verdict - Fries were awesome, chips were awesome, Urth burger was so-so.  It was a mix of veggies, and maybe chickpea flour? It had a falafel-ish character to it.  It was nicely fried on the outside, but pretty mushy.  It came topped with avocado, cucumber and sprouts (see pic) on a fluffy bun that was not egg-washed.

When I arrived the place wasn't too busy. They have a full bar and seating all around it. The place did fill up during the course of my visit. If you are planning on eating lunch you will be given huge portions! My waitress told me that the soup of the day was a creamed cauliflower and broccoli. If you order a sandwich it comes with a heaping helping of coleslaw. They also have full size salads.

I noticed that they have a lunch special of 1/2 sandwich and a cup of the daily soup for $9.00. I saw they have a specially prepared French onion soup that sells for $6.50 for a bowl. If you want it as a cup then you must do the lunch pairing for a slight upcharge. If you do the combination then you won't get the coleslaw.

My food came out rather quickly but I must say service is very slow since I only saw two waitresses there and one manager who asked how my food was. It took a while to get my iced tea refilled but they finally obligized.

In spite of the delay the food did not disappoint. I loved the chicken half sandwich and the French onion soup was to die for!  This alone is worth having and in the future I'd pair it with a small plate.

On the positive side, it's convenient, and they make a mean heart attack sandwich, also known as the Zoozaburger: one hamburger, large, thick, and tasty; a layer of warm pastrami; melted Swiss cheese; cole slaw; some sort of dressing; a good bun.  Tomato, pickles, and some other stuff are served on the side.  Price: $13 plus tax and tip.

On another visit, I had a warm pastrami sandwich.  The pastrami was warm and juicy, reminiscent of Canter's deli.  The bread was dense and chewy, also similar to Canter's.  A very good sandwich.  On the other hand, their moderately large hot dog was bland and uninspiring, and their chicken salad had little flavor other than salt.

They also offer a ridiculously large, ridiculously rich, ridiculously fattening brownie.  This brownie gets around.  It's been seen at some of Wynn's other informal eateries as well.",2007-06-21 17:51:01

Downtown Summerlin is a mini outlet with all the right stores and delicious food. I love that they have different events going on all year.

Our server was terrific, very personable and helpful in ordering as he steered me to what he thought I would like best on the menu based on my preferences. 

I'm not sure what steak I had for my main but it was delicious as was the mussels starter with a scrumptious tomato broth. Most of our table seemed quite satisfied with their meals with the exception of one dish. A pasta selection that was supposed to have truffles on it, possibly as an add on.  When the tray of our mains came out to the table the person delivering the food turned around and went back in the kitchen.  It was a bit of time and then they returned.  After tasting the pasta, my friend, who is a chef and owner of a catering business, asked where the truffles were on her dish.  The server apologized and said that the dish had dropped coming out of the kitchen and that was the last of the truffles that they had.  They offered to bring some truffle oil/butter on the side and did.

For this caliber of restaurant, that was unacceptable to me.  We were having a great time and enjoying the company at our table and just let it go.  However, I feel the restaurant should have 1. Offered her to select an alternate dish before they served the table, or 2. Most certainly should have let her know before she had to ask and also comped her entree.  

On their behalf, they may have given us some dessert gratis, however, if it was, we were never told and I believe some of our party ordered from the restaurant week menu anyway which would have included dessert.  With a party of 6 and 3 bottles of wine, things got a bit hazy by the end of the meal!

Tack another 10 years onto your age and you'll be looking at this place with a whole new set of eyeballs and a brain that screams: ""I cannot believe you didn't die from eating here."" 

Sat on the patio and got some Old Vienna beer for $5.50 a pint (not bad but it's no $10 pitcher  - apparently those are now $15 and Amsterdam beer only). Then the waitress brought me the menu. I almost puked. It was soaked through and CLEARLY had mould/mildew growing on both sides. When I pointed it out she said it was ""from getting left in the rain last night,"" sure. But mildew doesn't grow THAT fast. I told her it had put me right off my appetite, but she didn't seem to care, really. 

so, It's lunch time and I walk inside into almost pitch blackness - electricity too expensive? then I realize it's probably to stop you from noticing how disgusting the place is. 
#1: It's only about 1 hour into lunch and already one of the ladies rooms was out of toilet paper. 
#2: There were garbage bows and relics of last night's party on the floor. I don't think the staff swept or even looked at the bathrooms when they started their shifts...
#3. Duct tape was their go-to ""repair solution as I saw it in about 5 places.
#4. A scam-artist jerk walked right onto the patio and came up behind me demanding money and actually yelled at me for not giving it to him - all on ""private property.""  I was the only one on the patio so i was scared to leave anything outside. Had to bring my book bags in with me and even hid my beer with the menu because I was sure some other crack-head would come by and just drink it - or worse - while I was gone.  

Just really not worth it... I remember it being a ""dive,"" but this is like a dive that continued to dive for another 10 years and is now stuck so deep, they are going to need an industrial strength drill to dig them out.

My dad and I both chose the blackened Tilapia - 10.99, one of the cheaper options, which had quite a kick to it. So at least you can say that while I think this place is pricey, they're not dumbing the flavor down for old people here. Appetizers, we chose the shrimp cocktail. It's four shrimp, medium-large and a bed of lettuce and cocktail sauce. Okay. 

The desserts were a slice of NY cheesecake and chocolate cake - we took them home and later they got eaten by someone else in the house because I am on a diet. I can't rate, but they looked pretty good.

2 adults and a teenager

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 2 stars
Service - 1 star

Background - After a long day of driving from Reno we wanted Italian close to our hotel.

Atmosphere - The best thing going with this place.  Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place.

Food
Appetizer - Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread.  The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza.   They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone.  If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging. 

Main Course - They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in.  So I went with the sliced steak salad.  The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut.  The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares.  The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans.  This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order.  The waiter  never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him.

Dessert - skipped it  

Service - This was really lacking.  The floor was simply nasty.  Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat.  As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left.  The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table.  I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently.  But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do.   As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us.  The table was covered in a table cloth.  When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth.  I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me.",2011-07-04 16:51:45

Had to clean the chairs at my table before I could sit down.  I knew what the last people ate by their crumbs.  

Very bad menu.  Nothing authentic, nothing pub like.  Some phony fish and chip dish and nothing else but sandwiches, pizza, steak, sliders, artichoke dip, wings, wraps, quesadilla, etc.  You get my drift!  What pub serves pizza?

Not terrible actually at $4.99 with salad, potatoes and industrial dinner roll.  Knew I didn't want to spend anymore cuz it would be awful, so went with the value priced item so I wouldn't be too upset in the end.  My daughter had the sliders which were overcooked and dry.  The worst part were the french fries and tater tots.  Both totally dry, tasteless, industrial frozen version.   

BUT, the piece de resistance came when I asked for a box to wrap up my daughter's leftover sliders and after I put them in the container and was about to put them in a bag, I noticed the filthy black dots all over the take out container.  I was totally disgusted and needless to say, did not bring them home.  The waitress asked if I wanted another box.  Imagine, like I would eat that food if it changed boxes after touching this one!

It is tinier than places that I've been to in the past, but I liked that we were walk ins and they took us right away.  We asked for gel mani/pedis.  I had Mi Mi who introduced me to the Rock Star after inquiring about her nails.  It turned out gorgeous.  I'm a plain jane who normally gets basic neutral colors on my nails for fear of taking too long to return and my nails looking jacked up for a long period of time.  Mi Mi knew what she was doing and she was impeccable.  Both mani and pedi were great.  Three weeks later I was still was receiving compliments on my nails.  

Now what I didn't like - we both asked for waxes - lip and brow for me and brow for my stepdaughter.  Umm, it's done right there in front of everyone in the pedicure chair.  I totally didn't like that at all.  Waxing is something that should be done in private no matter the body part.  

More annoyances: Decided to treat my boyfriend this time, so I returned for the same mani/pedi - bummer Mi Mi wasn't available.  I had a guy even though I asked over and over for Mi Mi.  She had headphones on and didn't hear me begging for her.  She was finishing someone up and I was more than willing to wait but I was told to allow this guy to complete my mani/pedi.  I'm sure he was nice but if I find someone that I like, I want to stick with them not experiment.  I was completely ignored!  The guy did what he could, felt a little like a newbie.  He wasn't strong in his pedicure skills but what do you need to paint a toe, right?  I could tell by his physical handling of me that he didn't feel confident.  When I asked for specific things to be done, he spoke his ""language"" to the person who was imploring me to continue working with him.  Even during the pedicure I continued to beg for Mi Mi to do my nails because I could see the writing on the walls.

2) How anyone can say they don't have a good selection of beers must not have gotten past their counting lessons in the 1st grade.  They have 8 beers on tap (which are only $2.50 a pop at happy hour--score!) and another 22 in bottles/cans. That's 30. Only two of which are your standard crappy Budweiser/Miller variety. Um, poor beer selection? If you want Heineken or Coors Light, go elsewhere.

3) We sampled a few menu items: the green chile artichoke dip served with La Tolteca chips--awesomely cheesy. I had the Calvano sandwich and the hubby had the Jive Turkey (ordered just because he liked the name). Both were delicious. Friends that were with us loved their food choices as well.

She is simply the best there is. Hands down. I had been going to the Aveda Institute for facials for the last 10-12 years but one day I saw a Groupon for a facial at True Aveda and decided to try it. It was amazing. Fatima is so sweet and gentle in her demeanor and always makes me feel super welcome. By this point she knows my skin so she knows what my typical concerns are and what my habits are, ergo she is able to tailor the facial to my needs. I cannot stress the importance of someone that knows your skin and routinely sees you, giving you a constant service. She knows about my skin sensitivity and the products that I use and always gives me great product recommendations and other tips. 

The facial service itself is divine, the masks feel amazing during the treatment and the massages you receive are divine. There is something very nurturing about Fatima. And I feel like the service can have an almost animal nurturing quality to it. Like you're in a vulnerable position, kind of exposed. But the bed is warm and you are wrapped in there, all nice and toasty while someone is touching and caring for you. I almost purr like a cub at our sessions!

I've received a couple of massages from her as well. They were wonderful, and again, as she learns about your body the sessions can only get better. At this time I cannot recall how much they cost, but they are pricey, to be honest and not in my budget to get that often. Although I wish I could! 

Get in here to see Fatima but be prepared to come back over and over again. But we all deserve self-care and our faces and our skin is so important that we must take care of it. It is an expense that I am happy to pay.",2018-03-25 01:33:00

Our original plan was a party of 3, which grew to 8, and they were flexible enough to accommodate us by switching us to a larger table. The place is long and narrow with a wall of cosy booths, and only two spaces for larger groups. There were two servers working that day, and while one was full of attitude and forgetful, the other was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.

We came for the cheesecake but decided to order some actual food first so we didn't end up with sugar crashes. Turns out the menu is not where they excel, except for the split pea and lentil soup I had ($8), and the smoked salmon sandwich I sampled ($15), which were both quite tasty. They do have breakfasts but we didn't try them. Sadly, everything was overpriced, including coffee.

As for the cheesecakes ($7 per slice), they were great! Not sure I'd say best in the universe, though. We all tried some of each other's choices. All of them were velvety and yielding.

Lemon: lemony and super sweet, slightly frozen in the middle
Taffy Apple: like apple pie on a cheesecake, yes please
New York Naked: no surprises here
Pistachio: smooth and not too sweet, dotted with actual pistachio nuts. What a winner!
Triple Chocolate: a fluffy three layers of chocolate with chocolate shavings and mousse. Decadent.

With a tweak to service, and lower prices, I'd be tempted to come back for more than just a take-out slice of Pistachio. Also, noticing that they were frozen kind of nettles me. I mean, if I'm paying $7 per slice, it better be the tastiest freshest piece of cheesecake I've ever swooned over!

I've also had Pad Thai here as well as some of their curry dishes (that comes with rice). Everything they make here is delicious so you really can't go wrong.

I haven't been here in months but if not much has changed, their prices are very decent and their portions are a good size. I'm sure the seating is still uncomfortable but since I'm guaranteed a delicious meal, I don't mind the seating at all.

Quick note: there's storage space under the seats!

tmJxPpd3zfQsYqwJNlrPgw,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,QYIhMNwxXejDoCr-F1BxDg,3,4,3,1,"OK, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. 

Thai Basil is pretty decent Thai food, but it gets frustrating when each time you go, the story is always the same: a really long wait for any food to appear on your table.

Considering it's not a fancy, hoity toity sit down place, this is a little unusual. Even soups and satays take around 25-30 minutes. There may be only one cook doing everything the back kitchen, but they need to sort this out because at least something to munch on (appetizer/soup) should appear in front of you within 15 minutes of giving your order. 

That said, now the good stuff. 

The food is pretty decent. Not amazing Thai, but not mediocre either. And when you ask for the food to be spicy, they don't just nod their heads and then ignore your request. They'll routinely make it spicy to order. I've had their special Thai Basil Chicken, as well as the red, yellow, green, and masaman curries - and they've all got good flavor. Service is friendly, and waters will constantly be refilled, and if it wasn't for the food taking forever each and every time, I'd give the service a really high rating. 

The restaurant itself is clean and not too big (strip mall setting), and you've got your Tempe undergrad/grad student/older folks mix of patrons about.

All in all, I'd give the food somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars, but the wait is what holds the overall rating back at 3, unfortunately. I'd definitely recommend their food if you're in the Tempe area, as again it is decent Thai, but either order it to go or be in the mindset for a very leisurely lunch or dinner (ie. come up with some good conversation topics with your companions).",2007-06-11 04:25:35

I've been coming here for years and one interesting and unfortunate thing is that when T-Bones has something that works - they like to change it (LOL). They used to have a few ""best in class"" items, that they've ""reimagined"" into mediocrity, but still, this place is very, very good.

Some standouts are the creamed corn, the truffle tater tots, their great wine selection, and of course the steaks. Their buttermilk fried chicken with sage gravy is the best fried chicken you will find anywhere on the planet.

If you order their mashed potatoes, order them with sour cream and chive mixed in - amazing!

For dessert, the fried oreos are both novelty - and surprisingly awesome. Even better and more decadent though is the hot toffee cake. They used to have an AMAZING chocolate cake, but have since replaced it with a replacement that sadly wouldn't stand up to supermarket quality scrutiny.

Personally the only time I eat noodles, if and when, I'll grab a pack of chicken flavor top ramen. I'm not big on the authentic Asian noodle cuisine. However, I do love me some pho. Anyways since I was in the mood to try something new we came by. The promo on their Instagram was worded incorrectly according to our awesome and super friendly server. They did bring a taster of their Dan Dan noodle to our table that my friend ate. Hence, I don't eat pork. She did enjoy her mini sampler however. The server stated it was one of their popular dishes like a few of the reviews have noted. I got the beef shank with a side of their chili paste. The chili paste was delicious!!! Also, I ordered the beef and onion pot stickers. The texture of the meat inside the pot stickers didn't do it for me. My friend order their chili wontons with pork and she enjoyed it very much. She highly recommended it. I love the concept of the open kitchen with the view of the chef make fresh noodles right before your eyes. This is my second and third time giving noodles a try. Well folks everything isn't for everyone. The water infused with watermelon was unique too but I like my water with lemon. I guess there was no pleasing me but my friend rated them a 4 out of 5!

I've dined in, carried out, and actually had it delivered last night (to downtown through grubhub!! I was feeling lazy and was super pumped when I saw them on the list of restaurants!!!). 

The food is GREAT, the people who work there are SO friendly, delivery was fast and everything was fresh, and everything is very decently priced (I'm talking everything under 10 dollars - except the platters/combos)! We were talking about GVG the other day, which prompted me to get food delivered last night. Amazing as always. 

I know their specialty is their Gyros, but it's SUPER veggie friendly, too :) I always get their veggie wrap - lettuce, tomatoes, cukes, onions, greek spread, feta (you can add more toppings), on a warm pita. Their seasoned fries are decent, I've only had them once and wasn't all that impressed, so haven't had them since. I lovelovelove their spanakopita! And, their hot spinach and artichoke dip is ridiculously creamy and delicious - served with pita triangles that are flash fried and add to the awesomeness. I wasn't crazy impressed with the Tyrokafteri (spicy feta dip) - basically tasted like feta with hot sauce mixed in. Still tasted good, though... I mean it's CHEESE.. and hot sauce! And it came with the delish, fried pitas!

I don't tend to come here often because I like to touch my produce.  I know they have fresh stuff.  They also have stuff you can't always find in other grocery stores (FRESH PEAS!!! when in season).  However, I just don't like how most items are pre-packaged.  Like I said I want to feel and smell and really see my produce plus I try not to even use the plastic bags so seeing it pre-packaged makes me feel like I'm not doing my small part.  

What I LOOOOOVE coming in here for (other than the goodies and snacks everyone goes for) is the selection of flowers.  A lot of them are organic/responsibly grown and they always have a HUGE selection.  Sometimes I forget and just go to another place for flowers and I always end up just coming back here anyway.

$8 ramen--a teeny tiny bowl you can hold in one hand, good noodles but way too SALTY, 2 thin slices of pork
$5-6 skewers--delicious slices of fish on a stick but you maybe will only get 4 bites out of these
$10--FIVE (that's $2 each) slices of pork belly with a kick of wasabi

Pros:
- great decor, love what they did to this place. Light and airy and classy and can also be comfortable and not pretentious. 
- staff was friendly, maybe over explained some dishes but friendly and helpful with suggestions, though they are still fairly new. 
- that braised beef dish. Though with the peanut sauce it seemed to need a bit more of a punch, my bf asked for some of the shrimp paste on the side and that helped. 
- Thank you for the complimentary fruit for my friends bday...

Cons:
- for all the hype and talk of amazing tasting food, it was good but not amazing. 
- for one to actually taste a dish and get the full flavor of it all, I would expect more than just one bite. You need at least a couple bites to understand what kind of gastronomy they are trying to convey. Their ""big seller"" and greatly reviewed dumplings were pretty sub par. For the amount you pay for each dumpling that was only the size of one bite? Sorry - missed the flavors there. Even if we had 3 times as much so we would have more bites, for me, I do not think it was worth it. 
- whollyyyyyy long wait!! We spent about 3 - 3.5 hours there. I understand this is not fast food and that is not what I expected. But have you eaten a meal with a couple bites for one dish then LONG wait then a couple more bites then LONG wait then more bites... and with just being good not amazing... it could really put you to sleep if you had no where to go or drive you insane if you do have somewhere to go.  The kicker was that I specifically told them I was bringing my bf there for his bday and they said they would give a complimentary fruit dish. I was trying to be discreet about it so there was no way I could go up to the wait staff and ask about it without giving it away. So we waited and waited awkwardly until I just asked for the bill since I thought they forgot and it was complimentary anyways so could do without it. Only then did they say oh well we still have  the dessert fruit platter coming. So I paid the bill and we waited for the fruit. At this point we had to get going because it was getting late. .......................from that time it was 30+ minutes More and lots of parking payment top ups later!!! Only until I asked that the fruit be put into a take out container did they hurry it up. Took us two minutes to eat the fruit. FRuit! 30+ minutes to cut fruit? I don't get it. Were they waiting for it to ripen? Did they grow it in their back yard just for this? They had quite a few servers and the servers too. That just topped off the night. 

Overall the food is good. Don't get me wrong. Not amazing as the reviews say. And the slowness of the service made me want to pull my hair out! They were friendly and nice though. Maybe it was an off night for them. 
Unfortunately I would not go back. Nor would suggest it to anyone. Unfortunately because I had high hopes because of all the reviews, the disappointment is that much more since it was for my bfs bday.",2017-07-10 16:39:59

I ordered a cheeseburger from the menu and she said they only serve sliders. Okay. I ordered the famous Mac N Cheese Muffins and she said they only have Bacon Mac N Cheese (for a slight upcharge). Okay. I added an Iced Tea and it came to $20.25 plus tip. That's a lot for sliders and 'fries'. 

My lunch was ready in 8 mins. You have to find a table in the open-air place but then leave your drink to go back outside to get your food. Okay. 

The sliders were a good size. They were juicy, with plenty of caramelized onions. They were very greasy tho. You can make juicy burgers without being greasy. I think they had the grill too low, so they pooled in fat. 

 The Bacon Mac N Cheese bites were okay but not spectacular. Again, extremely greasy. No topping crunch and no 'brown' spots on the bottom. They were either cooked too low or were old.

I have a 2003 Hyundai with only 40K miles on it.

Since I never drive at night I didnt bother until now which is about 3 weeks before my tabs are due to be renewed. 
Called Planet Hyundai on Sahara and took it in. They told me 500 appx to replace the headlight and I needed some under carriage work that was about 900.00. OR I could trade it in on a newer model and they'd give me 3k on the trade. BS. It's a 10 yr old car with ONLY 40K miles on it. I'll drive it until I'm dead. 

Anyway.. a was referred by a friend to CARS. I called - they said sure 300.00 out the door but they needed to order the part. Part came in and told me just stop by takes about 45 minutes. 

We went today, left the car and came back to it all being finished. They even replaced some fuses that were low.

A few months ago I would have given this place 5-Stars BUT I feel like the quality has gone down a little since. That being said, I still love this place. 

One of the few true AYCE sushi bars in Las Vegas. I mean no limits on sashimi orders. The boyfriend and I will order Yellowtail (Hamachi) Sashimi to no end and they keep delivering. They have a number of fish available as Nigiri or Sashimi. (Don't be be a chump, and fill up on rice... with nigiri. Just saying.)

They also have fresh oysters available, they do put a limit on those though. The last I checked it was a dozen per person so if you have a big enough party you'll have plenty to go around. 

Another thing I'm not thrilled with is the limited amount of rolls they offer. There's not a lot of variation to choose from but with the amount of sashimi I'm eating I typically don't care.

In short, this place is awesome. They have teppanyaki available but I've never tried it. They have a sushi bar usually with two sushi chiefs. Never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes either.",2013-11-17 21:11:26

Louis arrived right on time and after listening to the leak asked if I only heard it when I had the hot water running, for a long period of time, which was the case.  He could not duplicate the sound of the ""leak"" when he ran the cold water only and advised that what I thought was a leak was just the sound of the hot water pipe expanding against the wall framing which shifts over time.  What could have been a long ""repair"" turned into a very reasonable service charge for his time, which I was more than happy to pay.  As before they were professional, courteous and honest.

The only thing that pissed me off after that was the service. I understand that sushi chefs traditionally have a shogun (aloof) attitude, but these sushi dudes had straight up bad bedside manner. They were slow and forgot orders. Our waitress was polite, but she never refiled my green tea. 

I suppose we were the forgotten ones because we were the first to sit at the sushi bar, while all other guests sat at tables.

You can create your own by choosing toppings, bun, type of meat, etc. This could get pricey though because you pay for each item. I had the turkey burger (pictured) which was very good and I would happily have again. Their ""crack mac"" was tasty but underwhelming and not that special in my opinion.

You can tell this meat has been handled meticulously throughout.  I'm pretty sure these Brisket are cooked (smoked) a day or two in advance then cooled to be prepared and served.     Steamed and sauced to perfection after being thinly sliced on a meat slicer.  My sandwich had at least a 1/2 lb or more of tender brisket piled high and sauced with a KC style BBQ sauce.  Served on a tasty toasted sesame onion bun.  The bread was fresh and held together very nicely with the large portion of meat.  I'm not sure the baker of this bread but it had a great onion flavor.  For $10.99 you get this healthy size sandwich and a 6oz side.  I chose the house made American potato salad because I like the mayo mustard flavor.  This one was but could have used bigger chucks of onion and pickle. Otherwise a solid recipe.  

The new and clean facility has seating for about 40-45 people with both 4 top tables and a bar counter area.

This place is a favorite of a friend's so after we helped another friend install a TV mount and put up his TV, this is where we came for lunch/dinner on a Sunday afternoon. 

There are two options available for AYCE (All You Can Eat). Vegas Package at 19.95 and Spring Mt Package at 23.95. The entire party needs to pick the same package (fear of unable to restrict the sharing among the group without strict supervision)

Vegas Package includes Cha Dol (Brisket), Premium Sam Gyup Sal (Pork Belly), Pork Skin, Pork Neck, Beef/Pork Galbi, Beef/Pork Bulgolgi, Spicy pork/chicken/pork belly, teriyaki chicken, baby octopus, spicy/regular calamari, gyoza, steamed egg, casserole, Korean bean paste stew, house salad, and ice cream (you can see they put a sticker over the previously offered rice paper roll). 

Spring Mt Package includes everything the Vegas Package does, but additionally, pork shoulder, thin cut sam gyup sal (pork belly), beef tong, dak chang (tripe), chi ma sal (flank), honey garlic shrimp, shrimp with salt, seaweed spring rolls, jap chae, and spicy soft tofu soup. 

For an additional only $4, my friend and I wanted the Spring Mt package but the other 6 wanted the Vegas package so we opt'ed for that. 

We had ordered the brisket, pork belly, spicy chicken, beef galbi w/ some steamed egg originally. The portion sizes were pretty big. I don't know if it varies due to party size but for each order, we got a really large amount of brisket, spicy chicken, and beef galbi. Overall, pretty decent quality of meats throughout. Various banchan available including kim chi, potato salad, fish cake. The brisket was good. Not much of a fan of marinated meats but they were ok. 

Not a bad place. Only downside is the offerings are quite minimal. Beef tongue is not included in the Vegas Package is a bit saddening. Wish they had beef tongue included as there already isn't much of a selection in terms of non-marinated items. Steamed egg was decent but I feel like its much smaller than those others that offer steamed egg as well. Quite deflated even before getting to the table, which makes it even smaller than it already is. 

The ventilation in this place is horrible, if they even work at all. Our hood that spanned the table did not seem to be ventilating anything. Upon entry of the restaurant, you can already tell its pretty bad when there was only 2-3 groups here and it smelled pretty heavily already. Service wise, not bad. They gave us a pitcher of water as well as went around with another to help refill. Fairly decently attentive in terms of ordering and asking if anything is needed. I guess its a bit expected especially since it wasn't busy.",2018-02-25 20:20:32

We were there the week it opened and I enjoyed a few creative cocktails. My husband, a beer aficionado, loved the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps.

We were there again last night with friends for the fish fry. When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg. I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good. It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better to split with a friend. I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! If you love bacon, this is the sandwich for you!

My husband had the fish, which was a nice piece of walleye and perfectly fried. He doesn't normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked the slaw. He also liked the tartar sauce, and said it was enhanced with dill.

That better be some AMAZING sushi for that price.  The one roll I ordered (salmon and avocado roll) was not my favorite for two reasons: (1) they put this weird crunchy grainy stuff inside the roll... probably trying to be inventive and different... but I don't like weird stuff in my sushi and (2) it had a mayo/aioli type of sauce on top that I didn't like. again, I like my sushi traditional without weird additions and sauces.  And it's not like the menu notes these strange additions, so I couldn't even have chosen differently to begin with.

So, while it's a great looking venue and really chic, I can't imagine coming here again when I prefer the sushi at other places better for more reasonable prices.

I had to update my review bc my good friend Mike B. was commenting on my experience and he reminded me that the service was poor the night we came.  My two friends and I each ordered a roll at the same time, however only my roll came out.  When my roll came out, my friends figured theirs would be coming out soon as well -- wrong!  My other friend waited about 10 min and then finally had to ask the waitress where her roll was.  It took about another 7 minutes to come out, so clearly they had forgotten to put the order in.  My other friend ordered a veggie roll, which never came out, yet they still gave us the bill with the veggie roll on it!  I understand it was a unique situation bc we had a large party sitting in their lounge and everyone was ordering stuff, but still to totally forget an order and then still charge for it is wrong.",2014-03-04 05:05:00

Stephanie was very pleasant and went over the bakery offerings for today, which included matcha cream puffs ($4), black sesame matcha roll cake slices ($5/slice), and various colourful macarons including royal earl grey, hk milk tea, black sesame, hojicha, yuzu honey, as well as others. 

I purchased 2 cream puffs, a slice of roll cake, and 2 macarons. They also sell Sloan tea. 
The black sesame matcha roll cake was moist and had a noticeable amount of matcha flavour. The black sesame cream filling was more subtle to me but I enjoyed the white chocolate crunchy pearls and the fact that it wasn't too sweet. Hubby and I shared this with my mother in law and she enjoyed it as well.

The matcha cream puff had a crunchy exterior not unlike a HK pineapple bun but filled with a very generous amount of matcha pastry cream. Messy but delicious and again, not too sweet (as I like it).

Looking forward to coming back here again to try their earl grey roll cake as earl grey is one of my faves!

Hyatt Regency  Scottsdale is a Oasis property right in the heart of the Sonoran Desert.   With it's gorgeous pools with actual sand beach, to a Lilly Fish pond with koi fish under a very dense canopy of native desert trees.  Which believe it or not bring the most shade I have ever felt in Arizona under natural style vegetation.  It actually feels cooler right next to this Lilly Pond.  To a Lagoon that wraps the property that is teeming with fish.  There is an actual spot you can feed the fish over by the sand beach.  No kidding they sell fish food for a quarter.  To a world class golf course that is actually green in the summer time, hahahaha.  Yeah a lot aren't in Phoenix this time of year.   
I can't vouch for the food because I didn't eat at the property, nor can I vouch for the actual rooms since I just was there for business.  But I can vouch for how amazing the actual property is since I took the time to walk the whole thing today.   Kids really did seem to be enjoying the sandy beach and water slide.   Looked really cool.    
One thing I thought was unique and very interesting when I was walking around.  There are suites on the property called Casitas.  They are right on a little lagoon that I mentioned wraps around the property.  The one teeming with fish.  You get your own private Jacuzzi right next to the lagoon also you get stairs that go up to a shaded roof top deck where you can chill out and have a view of the golf course and the lagoon.   Very cool.   I suggest staying there if you can afford it.  Like I said it is very unique.  I added a picture so you can see.

It's the same size and set up as the suncoast one- an oval bar with the cooks in the middle with a few tables around. 

I had the gumbo @ $17.00 (wild rice, shrimp, sausage, chicken, okra), which was pretty good but not as good as palace or station's (but better than cheesecake factory). The flavor was really good and had thick sauce (traditional). It has less seafood than the palace/station version which explains the lower price. The shrimp and chicken were pretty good size, though. The hard rolls were very good. I like that there is a cracker basket with a variety of crackers, ritz, saltines, including oyster crackers (love it).   

It wasn't spicy (like a little heat) but Cookie (our server) gave us Cholula. She was really good- refilled his drink without my husband asking. She was very friendly, always had a smile on her face and would check on us periodically.

My husband got the crab and shrimp pan roast and enjoyed it (but his favorite is still palace). There were a couple crab shells that he would of preferred to not have. 

The bill for both of us was $38, which was pretty good.

One, you can eat outside under their mostly shaded lovely patio in summer or sit near a heater in winter.

As for breakfast, you go inside the store and choose among several hot items that may include bacon, sausage, biscuits & gravy, burritos, frittatas and the like. Then eat it on patio or carry-out. You can also choose from a plethora of baked goods. Very good coffee and a nice selection of cold teas to accompany your meal. Sundays, there is an omelet chef that custom prepares to your liking. The omelet bar is sometimes located on the patio itslelf and the price is a good value. I occasionally opt for the fresh salad and soup bar in lieu of their decent breakfast fare.

""SEX MEX.""

I remember rolling my eyes when I first read about Mercadito serving ""sexy"" Mexican food -- whatever that means. Sounds gross and unsanitary. Pitiful marketing ploys aside, surprisingly, though, their menu offerings are enticing. 

My friend and I came here for brunch, which was $20.15 for three courses. In addition, we ordered a side of ceviche. 

Appetizer - Camarón Ceviche: Delicious. This has a nice, fresh and clean taste. My one criticism is that I wanted to taste more of the lemon flavor. 

First Course - Appetizer - Mango Guacamole:  Loved this. The guacamole had a nice kick. Too bad there wasn't a little more mango to balance the fatty flavor of avocado. 

Second Course - Entree - Carnitas Hash: By the time this arrived, I was nearly stuffed. But damn, this was GOOD! Braised pork, crispy potatoes, and a sunny side egg to top it off. I could have this for breakfast every week. 

Third Course - Pastel de Chocolate: To me, this was just an ordinary chocolate cake. I should've ordered the Torrejas de Bolillo instead because it tasted like a churro.

We ordered the Chicken Pomodori Panini, Cafe Spinach Sweet Crisp Chicken Salad and Steak and Cheese Hoagie. The Steak and Cheese Hoagie was good but did not knock my socks off. This past summer I was in Philadelphia and had the Philly Cheesesteak and this one was not close. 

Also had the Crum Cake which was pretty good. My wife and daughter liked the baked goods and had a good time trying the new items.

I called over the phone and ordered a medium cheese and sausage deep dish. We were told it would be 1.5 hours before it was ready, which seems like a long time but deep dish does take considerably longer and they seemed quite busy on a Thursday night.

We drove up to the store and walked inside to pick up our pie. The inside of the new restaurant is beautiful. Spacious, well decorated and just fresh/new looking. We should have eaten in.

There was a little trouble claiming our pizza. Apparently the guy on the phone totally butchered my last name and the correct spelling was not coming up on their computer. We managed to search by phone number and thankfully that was heard correctly when I ordered and matched my actual phone number.

The pizza itself was good, I felt. It was almost exactly like the pizza from the old store, with one minor difference that I thought negatively stuck out: the crust.

This crust was very thick and bready. I know deep dish has thick crust, but I felt like this was a little too much. The cheese was pretty thick, but I felt the pizza was lacking sauce. We should have asked for a little extra sauce like we usually do. The lack of sauce made the pizza taste a little dry, and of course really bread-y from the crust being so thick.

The sausage on the pizza was tasty! It was in the form of pretty large round chunks and didn't taste very institutional like the chain pizza place sausage does.

Our 'za cost $17 picked up. At less than $9/person we definitely were full and even had a couple of leftover pieces. The pizza wasn't bad, but again we thought it was a little on the bread-y side and could've used more sauce.

I'd come back.",2016-03-20 20:19:44

I really enjoyed that.  However, there was something in the sandwich that set my mouth on fire.  I don't know if they put jalapenos in the pesto, but something was extremely spicy.  I could only eat half the sandwich.  And there wasn't a whole lot of chicken on it.  We each had some of the house root beer, which is excellent.  The service was also good and it was very clean in there.  I'd definitely eat here again, however I'm staying away from the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.

We ordered the Duck Breast taco, the Tempura Avocado taco, Green Chile Chicken taco, 36 Hour Beef Short Rib taco, the Pheasant and Potato taco (taco of the week), and the Lamb taco. My absolute favorite was the Duck Breast, it was otherwordly! Tasted surreal. I never liked duck or pickled anything but almost every taco had a pickled vegetable and it went incredibly well with them. I feel converted. My second favorite was the Pheasant and Potato taco. And third favorite was the Green Chile Chicken taco. 

The flavors in each taco are completely different from each other which is refereshing, and the flavors within each are a combination of complementary components. Yes, $5 for a taco might seem like a bit much but it's well worth it. You might end up loving a food or meat that you didn't like before, which is saying something. 

We also had dessert which were strawberry tortilla tacos with strawberries, cream, and cake.

The bathrooms were neat and had large complementary images on them and the inside was slightly surreal as well as modern. Keeping with the theme of the restaraunt's concept.

As you can probably predict, I got the lobster roll which came with a side house salad AND a side of fries.  The portions were a nice size, even for lunch.  I enjoyed the house salad which used boston lettuce and radishes.  It was a nice change from the typical spring mix you get at most restaurants.  The fries were tasty, but were much better with the truffle aioli (which you had to pay an extra $3 for, but so worth it!).  The lobster roll itself was good, but it didn't wow me.  I think the bun would have been better if it was garlic bread (though maybe not if you're going back to work afterwards!).  The lobster salad inside the roll was tasty and warm, but it just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.  

I had a bite of my friend's lobster mac and cheese.  It was so good!  It may be too ""fishy"" for some, but I thought it tasted great.  I like that it comes in a small portion in case you wanted to pair it with something else.  

I got a huge scoop of ice cream as a check in treat.  They had a number of flavours but I ordered the almond coffee which reminded me of my favourite ice cream ""Mocha Almond Fudge""  It was delicious and a great dessert to share with someone if you just want a bit of sweet.

Honestly, it's the combination of the fact that all their ingredients are fresh and taste fantastic, along with their price point. $10 for a bowl and a drink, and I couldn't even finish a small - their bowls are packed! I went for a small bowl with spicy tuna and shrimp (small gets 2 proteins) and then you get to pick all your sides. On top of that, you get to pick 2 salads, so you can really add a third protein with either the imitation crab or seaweed salad (they also have cucumber salad). The spicy tuna had just the right amount of spice, and their seaweed salad reminded me of one of my favorites in Hawaii. Overall, it was delicious, filling and light! 

The staff was super nice, and was patient with me knowing it was my first time.

8QYCGhrSLsB5PyWIroQl_g,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,UVqqsfogFwG_llByAzUQQg,4,6,4,8,"Despite substantial research indicating the dangers of overweight and obesity the World's collective waistline continues to grow, a recent estimate suggesting nearly 40% of America will be at risk of adverse health outcomes based on weight alone by 2020, and with more diners adapting to ""quick casual"" and ""fast food"" rather than sit-down dinners the need for healthier options is at an all-time high, a fact clearly recognized by the team behind Portion Control.

Self-described as ""Healthy Food Redefined"" and representing a partnership between Justin Blum of Raw Fitness plus Chef Vince Upperman, the duo opening location one adjacent Blum's Gym at The Gramercy a year ago and following up with a Henderson location in early 2018, guests entering Portion Control will quickly notice the open kitchen, high ceilings and welcoming environs, a wide mix of guests including families as well as those fresh from a workout seated comfortably as an upbeat soundtrack plays overhead.

Catering to busy lifestyles and healthier ways of being, a promise of no preservatives, artificial flavors or GMO-ingredients prominently listed atop the Menu, it is in the new tradition of counter-style ordering that guests are enticed by a large board on the wall left of entry, each item cooked to order while they wait though those in a hurry are offered the convenience of ordering in advance and receiving a call when their selections are packed and ready to go.

Additionally providing meal-prep services and group orders easily tailored to catering, nutritional facts not yet available for the dine-in Menu but reportedly coming soon, it was alongside three adults with relevant healthcare experience plus one child that nine items from a list of over fifty were selected, the youngster in the group immediately coveting a Branched Chain Amino Acid Slushy that was both flavored and priced like those at the Movies without all the excess calories and unnatural Sugars or Dyes.

No stranger to mindful eating or the untoward effects of popular Foods, the items selected thus tailored towards the sort of things People and Patients say the ""crave"" daily, it was beginning with a ""Burger"" constructed of Black Beans and T.V.P. that lunch got underway, the Patty no less convincing than New York's popular ""Superiority Burger"" with a Bun that actually holds up better while the side of Waffled Sweet Potato Fries were crisp, oilless and tasty on their own but all the better when topped with housemade Turkey Chili that packs a lot of Protein and healthy Carbohydrates into each bite despite being devoid of unhealthy Fats. 

Moving next to one of three Pizzas positioned atop a low-carb Cauliflower Crust, the Barbecue Chicken suggested by a woman who has lost over forty pounds while incorporating Portion Control as well as Raw Fitness into a healthy lifestyle, suffice it to say that those seeking the comfort of a pillowy Crust will likely be disappointed by Chef Upperman's creation while fans of thinner Pies will likely be more amenable, a follow-up Breakfast plate simply titled ""The Skillet"" not really all that different from similar dishes elsewhere but a steal at just $8 considering the Ingredient quality and nicely flavored Hash beneath an Over-Easy Egg.

Hearing frequently that Chinese Food is a trigger for those counting calories, an example more authentic than most dishes available at Panda Express or P.F. Chang's exhibited in a Bowl of ""Bang Bang Chicken,"" diners looking to add a bit of spice to their diet will likely be impressed by just how close the dish comes to replicating Spring Mountain Road without all the Oil, Upperman's spiraled Zucchini additionally providing an admirable stand-in for packaged Noodles. 

Falling short on ""Veggie Lasagna,"" small bundles of rolled Squash around creamed Tofu leaving an odd aftertaste potentially related to non-dairy Cheese that was accentuated rather than muted by Romesco, it was in baked Chicken Breast coated in a crispy mixture of Oats that Portion Control was quickly back on track, the meal finally wrapping up in three fluffy Protein Pancakes largely indistinguishable from the sort served as Hotcakes beneath Golden Arches, the Sugar-free Topping nothing that will lead 100% Maple Syrup purists swearing off  the good stuff,  but the housemade Blueberry reduction and Market Fresh Strawberries plenty sweet enough for most.

As a practicing endocrinologist, traveling gourmand, avid runner/biker and former morbidly-obese twenty-something I'd argue that my knowledge of 'what it takes' to maintain one's weight comes from a place of expertise and although there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to lifelong health a combination of daily exercise and nutrition no doubt forms a strong backbone, something Vince Upperman's Portion Control aspires to assist in with overall impressive results.",2018-05-23 11:15:33

While this is partly because many popular movies don't appeal to me enough to pay $12+ to see, it is also partly because most of the big newer cinemas are all noise and advertising and video games. Having said that, I will add that I don't mind going to the Cineplex Odeon at Eglinton Town Centre if my movie choice is playing there. As the closest cinema to my home, I have gone probably half-dozen times over the past few years. While it does have the big cinema drawbacks that I don't like, I have done fairly well going on a discount Tuesday night to see one of the big movies while it's near the end of its first run. Tuesday admission price is $7.99, and I think it is $12.99 on other nights, and there are 16 screens that show mostly the big first-run films. 

Such was my visit last Tuesday when I went to see the latest X-Men film, Logan. The cinema in general was not too crowded for the late shows, and my auditorium was more than half-empty since the movie had been out for a while. I was able to walk in, purchase my ticket from an automated terminal, and head straight for the movie, bypassing all of the other distractions. The cinemas themselves are very good, showing all the up-to-date formats on large screens with excellent sound. The one drawback that I cannot overcome is that it is situated way at the back of a large big-box plaza, so it's a good 5min walk from the TTC stop. Incidentally, I have more than once seen a few geese strolling about on the grass islands in the parking lot.

Overall, I would choose this cinema over most of the large noisy downtown ones, making it one of my top 2-3 choices for wide-release films.",2017-04-24 20:24:36

Service was good.  Very ""local"" and ""neighbourhood"" feel.  I didn't have any food so I can't speak to that, but I had a whiskey sour, and it was yummy and came very quickly.

The bad:
The place was crazy full, loud, crammed on a Thursday night.  This CAN be okay but it meant we sat at the window stools.  Which means that the freezing cold draft from the window (which are clearly not sealed up properly) kept me unable from ever warming up from outside.  They really need to either not seat people in those seats, or get a little heater, or fix the window.

Also, the crowd was awful.  It's not really my part of town to begin with, but it was all the after-work crowd and they were douchey and unappetizing in every way possible.  Literally I said out loud, ""I am so glad I am not single anymore.""

But the real reason for the 2-star review were the DEPLORABLE bathroom.  It was like a nightclub on Richmond circa 2003.  There are two stalls, with swinging doors.  One had no lock and so you couldn't close the door and the stall door would just swing open.  The one that did shut left an over two inch (THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLIC) slit in the middle so that everyone else can just see right through, to the point that there was NO need to even pretend to have a door.

Ahem, pardon me - The Bow River Barley Mill Pub Company, that is.
The historical building next to Eau Claire itself is cool - both the inside and outside have been immaculately renovated to have a rustic, old-timey feel with just the right amount of kitsch.  The walls inside are covered with wagon wheels, fishing rods, and other knick-knacks, and the bar upstairs is carved wood and polished brass, its shelves stocked with every type of alcohol imaginable. 
I think most people know this place from Stampede Week, as this is a hot spot for locals to have a cold one on their three very large patios with abundant seating.
I find the food to be ""hit or miss"", but the menu is quite varied and offers a little something for everyone.  The Bacon Mushroom Burger is a favourite among my guy friends - it is enormous.  My lady loves their yam fries with the dill mayo dip, which she substituted instead of regular fries with her sandwich for a small charge.  
This trip I tried a few appetizers.  The mini Yorkies are little Yorkshire puddings stuffed with roast beef, horseradish sauce, and served with a bowl of au jus.  I thought they were just ok, but I appreciate seeing something other than just nachos on an appetizer menu.  The dry ribs were pretty good - they are boneless and have a faint taste of soy sauce and ginger which was different.  I'm quite the connoisseur of calamari, but I would rate this plate as a B-.  The portion size was small, the calamari was a bit rubbery, but the saving grace was the combination of spices that made it interesting. 
In general, the Barley Mill has a great menu - a wide variety of items, and all of them reasonably priced between $11-15 on average for lunch.
The wait staff left a little to be desired in terms of friendliness and personality, but in all fairness, it was a pretty busy Friday lunch, and they all worked together to be an efficient little team.  Our meals came out fairly quickly and still piping hot, and rarely did anyone have to ask for a beverage refill, so that says something!",2010-03-27 03:45:22

Our waiter gave the impression he wasn't thrilled we had brought our kids (even though they love to eat out and are extremely well behaved) but the service he provided was still very good.
The food was delicious.  They have a fairly large menu and it was hard for this foodie to decide what to order.  I ended up with the veggie panino which was a pesto lovers delight (yep, that's me!).  My hubby got the cubano sandwich and he liked it but said it was a bit too spicy.  That is saying something cause he loves spicy food.  Could have just been those particular jalapeños but he ended up taking them off (which shocked me to no end) cause it was giving him heartburn.  Kids meals were very good as well.

We both ordered the Sushi Inn lunch special which came with a maki set.

My only regret is I didn't pay the extra $10 for 45 days unlimited - I only went with 10 classes for $29.

I've done yoga in the past, but a much more watered-down, stretchy-type yoga.  Most of the classes here are vinyasa or vinyasa-based, which makes for a pretty good workout.  Especially if you try a hot vinyasa class on Mondays/Tuesdays or Zeek's Baptiste, a 90-minute hot yoga class with many principles of vinyasa.

Every teacher here that I have had the chance to have class with is wonderful.  My favorites are Willow and Zeek but they all have something unique to bring to each class and will all provide you a phenomenal experience.

My favorite class is Christine's aromatherapy yoga on Wednesdays - by this point in my work week, I absolutely NEED this class.  It is so very relaxing with the all-natural oils and I can almost do a headstand now!  Woo!

If you want a workout, try Willow's Happy Hour Vinyasa Groove on Fridays at 6 and Zeek's Baptiste on Saturdays at 10.  They will get you sweating and flowing and while you may feel like you're going to die you won't (I promise, I'm still here) and at the end it is so, so worth it.

Once my Groupon ran out, I looked over the schedule and noticed most of my favorite classes were $10 cash (there's a star by them on the schedule), which is wonderful!  Sign in, give 'em my cash, and I pop a yogi squat.  This is definitely the best deal unless you go to more than 8 classes a month and know you'll be committed to it for a year - you can do a $79/month unlimited classes at this studio location only, but you have to pay first and last months up front.

Find a friend and sign up together - they are still running their $59/month for 6 months Yoga Buddies special.

The food is really good. On my most recent trip I had the schnitzel sandwich, which was fresher than you would expect due to the cucumber mayo it came with. The schnitzel was crispy and well-fried, although it could have used a little more seasoning. I also ordered the steak fries which were well-done but a little too thick and potatoey for my taste. They also could have used some more salt.

There is almost no seating inside, but they set up chairs outside in the summer.

Be warned that the portions are enormous. On a previous trip I had the Harrison burger, which came with fried cheese on top. It was delicious, but the size was overwhelming going back to the office after lunch, and I'm a big eater. Great value for money though.

This might become one of my regular haunts, mostly because the drinks are strong and I can crawl home. I decided  to stop here on a random Tuesday night before calling it a night and was greeted by the sounds of ""Pub Trivia Night"". ""Where was Britney Spears born?"",  ""ummm...the South?"" I thought as I bellied up to the bar. 

I dig the decor in this place; old school lanterns, unique European chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and a giant British Flag above the bar, so Londony! As I looked at the bar menu I noticed that they serve Poutine! The American werewolf in my belly growled as I ordered this insanely rich dish and a fresh adult beverage. If you're not familiar with this traditionally Canadian dish, Poutine is a decadent pile of french fries, cheese curds and gravy, be still my beating heart. No seriously, it could have stopped while I was consuming it. Shakespeare's Pub also has a bevy of beers on tap, but I went with the vodka & soda. I wasn't sure if I could handle a Stout beer along with gravy soaked cheese fries. 

As I waited for my food and drink, I chatted it up with the bartenders and got the 4-1-1 on the trivia nights. Not is only does it get packed in here every Tuesday and Wednesday, but if your team wins you get to sit at what I'm calling the ""Champions' Table"". It's a table with a beer tap attached, serving of course, Guinness and Harp. I'm not sure if the winners get to choose the beers. As I pondered the idea of adding a toilet to a table that I would never have to leave, my Poutine arrived in all of it's gravy and cheese covered glory. Now a normal or ""classic"" Poutine would have regular cheese curds. However, in the Shakespeare's Pub version they are breaded and fried. AMAZING! I dived in fork first. 

I consumed about half of this order along with some help from my girlfriend, after which my food coma took over. Love this place, love the people who work here, and love/hate the Poutine. To quote Shakespeare...

Food takes long to come out

Came here for a 10 course banquet for my niece's 100 day celebration.  The food and service overall is good.  It just took a while for everything to come out.  

Royale has 2 private rooms for any function you want to hold.  The rooms can hold about 6 tables so you can have about 50-60 people and still be very comfortably.  The wall separating the two rooms aren't very sound proof though.  The other room was playing music and it was drowning out some conversation in our room sometimes.

Our dinner time was set for 5pm.  It was a standard 10 course Chinese banquet meal.  Even with some people being late, we were all seating by about 530ish.  The food however was delayed for whatever reason.  We didn't begin eating until about 645.  halfway through the 10 courses, there was another 25 minute delay with the food.  Even the waitstaff, who were very good were just standing around wondering what was going on.  

All in all, a dinner which was supposed to start at 5pm didn't finish serving food till about 930.  When you have young children, asking them to sit for 4 hours for a meal is a tough ordeal for everyone involved.

The food and service here were pretty good though.  The staff were pretty nice throughout the meal.  Everything served looked and tasted pretty good.  Nothing amazing, but nothing you could find to complain about.

If it wasn't for the delays, I would really recommend this place to anyone to go and try.  I'm not sure if what happened to me was a one off.  Just be aware if you book something there yourself.",2018-03-19 12:52:18

Something happened about 20 minutes ago that totally blew my mind.  If you've never been there before, it is and open kitchen and you can see everything that goes on.  I placed my to-go order and walked down to the end of the counter to wait for my food.   

Here is the Reader's Digest version ......

Just then a kid that was clearing tables walked through the kitchen area, stopped by the cook and cook grabbed a half pita out of the basket and started eating it.

To be 100% honest, I really didn't think too much of it other than  ... man that cook must be hungry.  

A couple minutes later, the same kid walks thought the kitchen again, once again with baskets he cleared from a table.  He stops by the cook again and this time the cook grabs a hand full of fries, the bus boy starts to walk away, the cook calls him back and he starts dipping the frys in a cup of ketchup that was in the basket.

The cook finished up the frys, wipes off his mouth with this hand, packages by my food and hands it to me.  

At this point, I lost my appetite, I approached the counter and told the Owner what happened.  He reply was  ....   he didn't have a problem with his employees eating the food that his Customer's didn't finish.  I asked him  if he understood what just happened and he said yes.  

I asked for a refund and he said we would give me one in t minute.  Just when I didn't think it could get any stranger  ..........  the bus boys goes in back behind the wall and comes out with 2 other people and they are staring me down from the other side of the counter.  One of them asks me not to lean on the counter.  I responded with something like ""make me"".

I get my credit receipt and walk out, turn around at the door or one last look and to make sure I am not being followed out by anyone.  Two employees are flipping off and another one is waiving at me.

With the line of work I am in, I almost wish ""the gang"" would have confronted me, they wouldn't have known what happened until it was too late.

The Maricopia Health Department has already been called and an Inspector is on his way.  Man, it's nice to know people in the right places.

This place is located at where the good old c lounge used to be. So when I went to its opening night, I was impressed with its complete make over. The place was filled with simple 60s-70s retro style furnitures that make you to think like you just walked into a cool house party.

 This cool modern retro ""house"" lounge is divided into three spaces  : ""dining room"", ""living room"" and ""recreation room"". ""the dining room"" has a big wooden table so ppl can sit and drink around it. ""the living room"" has few small tables, comfy chairs and stools so you can have your drink services while you are listening to DJ right next you. Lastly, ""the rec room"" has TV, table football and air hockey so you can play games with your friends. Every space has full bars and patio is coming up soon. 

Over all, the concept of the place is definitely different from other lounges /clubs in toronto. It really allow you to feel like you are invited to someone's fancy house party. It was all good except the place was too cramped with all the furnitures. It was very hard to dance around nor move room to room. They literally just opened so I hope they will rearrange the setting a little bit in a future so it allows ppl to dance around and mingle better. 

Currently they have no cover and has $4 drinks to 10pm deal going on right now so I might check this place out again.",2015-07-31 09:09:49

Food: The red chili chicken wings were a standout item, really tasty. The slaw was quite good. The fried chicken and the rendang beef shortribs dishes were strictly ok, not tasty enough for me. 

Drink: I really liked my drink, which was the nagasari - it tasted like delicious wine and lemonade.

Dessert: we tried both the desserts. The pisang goreng (fried banana) was surprisingly not as good as expected, but the sago sago (tapioca pearl pudding) was delicious!

I mean I can and will say a lot more but yum is probably the best word to convey how great this place is. Picture this, a nice Saturday morning and brunch plans were made. We wanted some toast or bread to go with our food and on my way to my friends house I decided to stop here to see what treats they had. I, and my brunch friends, were not disappointed. I will say that I did order more than I normally would because they did have a $10 minimum to use a card. I usually hate these restrictions but...when the option was more pastries I really was not complaining. 

Bread:
Coconut bread. Let me tell you this stuff was great. I loved that it had little flecks of coconut cream or something baked into the bread. Sometimes shops just mix it in the batter or just have it on the top, not this, the cream was just nice and subtle but added that much more to the bread experience. It was nice and thick and toasted perfectly. Yum. 

Buns:
Ok, I admit. I had to try a few of these. I know we were going to have brunch but.... they just looked so good and fresh that I had to get a few!

Pork Sung Green Onion Bun: Um... how was this so good. I ate this the next morning heated up in the microwave and it was PERFECT. The pork was so thin and shredded perfectly and the green onions added just enough to the bun to make it perfect. I could not believe it heated up as well as it did. I would get this again for sure. 

Chocolate Custard Bun: Yes, this was a perfect little treat to eat while we were still cooking brunch. I could not believe the amount of custard that was actually in this bun. I was very surprised, pleasantly of course. The custard was not overly sweet an went perfectly with the slightly sweetened dough. Yummmy!

I got two more but I left those for my friends to eat for lunch. I am really looking forward to coming back here. I loved the buns and want to bring them to more events and that bread, I will be dreaming about it until we meet again. I think that everyone should try out the Pink Box Bakery because it was a real treat. There were so many things in the shop that I wanted but had to stop myself from getting.

They have a small selection of baked goods but they are one of those places that goes for quality over quantity.  My chocolate chip cookie was moist and fresh.  It was as good as any home-made product.  I also enjoyed my iced latte which wasn't bitter at all and was quite refreshing.

We love Main Event, and if the cost didn't add up, we'd likely go more often. We visited this location today and were there for just over 6 hours. We purchased the unlimited passes for $18 per person. Games were extra. Our kids' grandma bought the $18 pass for 90 minutes of unlimited games. I feel like the prices they charge for games is a bit ridiculous. Unless you purchase an unlimited game pass, the games are very expensive. Some of them are a couple dollars to a few dollars each. You also cannot earn tickets when you use the unlimited game pass. I think this changed because I recall being able to earn tickets with an unlimited games pass in the past. For lunch, we went to the little pizzeria they had and I felt the price was very reasonable for the family meal, which included a 16"" pizza and four drinks. The drinks were unlimited refills too! Without this offer, though, the cost of the food can get pretty expensive. Overall, this place is fun -- a place both kids and adults can enjoy!

Sometimes the service is a little bit slow, just because it's hectic, but they usually make up for it by giving us dishes on the house.
My usual is the Niku Donburi (I-13); stir fried veggies with egg and bulgogi with some sort of special sauce on top of rice. 
If I don't feel like rice, I opt for udon, usually Kaki, but sometimes tempura if I'm in the mood. 
The actual sushi is kind of hit & miss depending on what you order. The California rolls are kind of weak but you can substitute parts of your sushi order, so it's not a big deal.

As my child gets bigger and he goes from the size of a football to a boy who needs to jump into my arm for me to be able to lift and hold him, it crossed my mind perhaps he was now too old for the AZ Science Center. 

Glad to share that this is sooooo not the case!  My son is 7 now and just this week, I've taken him twice to partake in Snow Week where for the past week, they've special activities planned for each day. 

The two days I was there, there were tons of special activities on the daily schedule and these special activities were so well planned, my son and his friend enjoyed participating in them so much that both days, we spent minimal time on their permanent exhibits!!!!

Whoever was in charge (maybe it was a team?) of Snow Week did an absolutely thumbs up (both thumbs up in fact) fanta-excellent job!  Both my son and his friend enjoyed the science experiments on the first floor theater, the making of mini bobsleds out of giant spuds (Idaho potatoes) then racing the, down mini sled tracks, mini ice hockey (ice frozen on cookie sheet then min ice hickey sticks made from Popsicle sticks and pucks made from penny covered with electrical tape)- genius. My son and his friend played for almost an hour with this simple contraption!

Scented balloons were a big hit, as was making the gingerbread house. 

Aside from the special activities, my favorite section (see, and I'm a grown up- I think) LOL. Big kid at heart, that's me- is on the 2nd level where the kids can hands on learn about mechanical properties. All of us (including me) can spend hours there going from one hands on exhibit to the next. 

The permanent exhibits are an added bonus. Why do I say that?  Because they usually have a special exhibit or special activities planned that you can spend your whole day doing those!

I'm really looking forward to see what's next after Snow Week and now that I know how much fun Snow Week is from going this year, next year I will be taking my son for sure and plan on being there from open to close!!!!",2014-01-03 05:39:32

Sad, I know, but with the Riviera closing recently, the lure of ""Old Vegas"" got me in the mood to try more classics.

Worth the wait.

The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was ""Yes"" and ""Please"".

I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.

This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.

I can see this becoming one of my new favorites.",2015-06-01 04:15:45

*It's definitely not the most vegetarian-friendly restaurant around. There are certainly choices, but they're not extensive. 
*The margaritas are not good at all. Given that their Bloody Marys are great and I've had other good mixed drinks there, they would do well to invest in some fresh squeezed juice for their cocktails.

Other than that, there are a lot of things I really like about this place. First, I think the vegetarian items I have had are delicious. The veggie sandwich is done really well with great bread and the grilled cheese has the perfect combination of muenster, havarti and cheddar. Perhaps the biggest standout is Sophie's Salad, marrying crunchy pine nuts and red onions with fresh mozzarella and basil. Delicious!

I also adore the patio. It's a great size with lots of tables and just feels picturesque in front of the old house (even though 7th Street is right there). What a great place to spend a cold night or a breezy spring day. The only time it's not great is in the middle of the summer (as there are no misters). I wish that more of the old homes in the Coronado District had nice, open front patio areas.

Last but not least, the service has always been good the few times I've been. No one has been overly attentive but my needs have always been met.",2011-12-07 04:39:12

I actually don't have any ingredients mixed into it because it's pretty wonderful on it's own. I don't eat chocolate ice cream anymore, but it's so yummy here that I've made an exception. My husband loves mixing any vanilla based ice creams with their graham cracker mix-ins. There is more we have to try here - it looks like they have hot food (seasoned fries a la Potato Corner) and other dessert options too, such as cookie/brownie creations, waffles, etc. Staff is very friendly and will let you try samples until you figure out what you want.

Pho So 1's pho tai's meat changed on me. Therefore, I was pleased to know that the meat tasted like how I like it here. I never drink the soup so I've nothing to say about that. They are proud of their broth though. Next time, I'll drink some of it. I get full easily so after eating all the noodles + the meat, I don't want to touch the broth.

The second time that I went, I took a party of 12 with me (after watching Fast Five). The owner's wife is really cool. She'll tease you and stuff, but she's pretty chill.  Feel free to joke around with her and all that. It's a very personal and informal experience, I guess you could say. It's unique, I suppose. Some owners don't even interact with you. She also recommended us #12 with the brisket and I actually really liked it. Think I'll be changing my future orders to #12 instead of #11. ^^v

We sat down at the counter, and explained that it was our first time. The waiter kindly suggested a few milder, sweeter varieties of oysters. We went for the Shigoku oyster, described as having a clean, fresh taste. We each had one.

We lifted the little shells to our lips, looked at each other and slurped. The shell felt rough and cold, and the oyster was slippery and plump. I first tasted the brine - slightly bitter, like the sea. Then I tasted the sweet, tender flesh, and marveled at how a simple organism like that could offer such a symphony of flavors.

Probably under 5 minutes.  Very fresh and hard to believe it was that fast.  Despite the low price they offered to put anything else on it that I wanted so I chose the sweet peppers.

jBEBS9xFlhKEAAjmOhodow,R_wlZO-jKFGEVJnSfWISqQ,a2h9nrVMpNvfwMBo1e8ffg,4,4,1,2,"I have been to the Fillmore here in Charlotte about five or six times now and I feel armed with enough information to say that I am a fan of this venue.  Compared to the other local music halls available here in the Charlotte area, The Fillmore is the newest, the best and I must say, the most ""corporate"".  Here's what I like about this place:

1. Parking - there is plenty of free parking.  You've done something wrong if you are paying for parking at this place.

2. Ambiance - The interior of the venue is very spacious but at the same time is somewhat cozy.  The chandeliers are nothing short of perfect.  These four elegant creatures hanging from the ceiling nicely compliment the inside and immediately catch your eye.  They add soft interior lighting as well as a touch of class.  The same can be said about the hardwood floors.

3. Bathrooms - Bathroom are as good as you are going to find in Charlotte.  I don't know about the ladies room, but the all black toilets and stalls make these bathrooms stand out.

4. Price - the price is one of the few things keeping the Fillmore from getting 5-stars.  The beers are simply too expensive. Paying $20 for 2 tall bud light cans is a total fleecing.  Asking me to pay $50 for a ticket, $35 for a shirt, and $10 for a beer is simply too expensive.  END OF STORY.

5. Service - the bar-tenders are friendly and the service is usually prompt and to the point.  The people outside of the facility checking tickets, checking IDs and searching you are also cool about everything as well, and do their jobs with as little fuss as possible. 

6. Music - and finally to the music; I've never been to a bad show here.  The music is always loud and crisp, but not to the point that you need ear-plugs or anything crazy.  Performers such as John Butler, Warren Haynes, and Trey Anastasio have provided me with memorable shows and performances that I will remember for a life time. 

The Fillmore is the perfect place to catch your favorite band or performer in a nice, clean, classy, and friendly environment.  This place is a must for any music lover in Charlotte.",2011-12-04 20:14:16

I was aware that this place had mediocre reviews, but since it was right across the street from where was I staying (Harrah's), I decided to give this place a chance.  I went here for an early breakfast and was craving Chicken and Waffles.  Boy was that a serious mistake.

When the waitress presented my order I was really turned off by the presentation and how cheap it looked (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=m0tR4ibrsuJFQ_gEwUVgAA)  As you can see from the picture, it was really sad and not as described in the menu.  I didn't get a ""6 oz golden fried chicken breast"" but got fried chicken fingers instead.  What the hell??   The chicken fingers were dry but the waffle was ok.  But it was definitely not worth the $15.95.  You can actually pick this stuff up from the Flavors Buffet at Harrah's for a dollar less.

It didn't really help that I had a $10 coupon from restaurant.com, but at least that made the meal more cheaper than I would've paid for it.  If you're hungry for breakfast, skip this joint and go to Hash House a Go Go.  You definitely get more for the same price.",2010-10-10 04:03:40

Since it's been over a month since they reopened without problems and I got off work a little early yesterday, I was finally able to try them out. (And avoided getting sick lol)

The burger I got was pretty tasty and very large but didn't blow me away overall. I ordered the ""Big Squeal"" which is a burger topped with smoked gouda cheese, BBQ pulled pork, bacon slaw, pickles, lettuce, onion straws, and more BBQ sauce. I ordered my burger medium, and it came out at the correct temp but wasn't super juicy and could've used a little more seasoning. The bun was a little too small for the burger and wasn't that soft; it was definitely lost beneath the big beef patty, especially after soaking up some of the juices and sauce. The BBQ pulled pork didn't have a ton of meat on top of the burger, but the sauce added a ton of flavor, almost overwhelmingly so. The bacon slaw was very vinegary but didn't add much bacon flavor unfortunately. The onion straws added a nice crunch, and the smoked gouda was great on its own but was a little overwhelmed by all the other flavors of the burger. The burger was pretty good overall, but between the BBQ sauce, slaw, and 6-7 pickles it had a strong vinegar taste, which I didn't mind but would be something to look out for. Fair warning: do not order this burger if on a first/second date, it is BIG and it is very, very messy so you may look like a fool eating it. The sweet potato fries I receive on the side were average- solid portion, crispy, and decent tasting but nothing that would blow you away. 
My server at the bar was nice, but I was a little surprised that my burger took over 20 minutes to come out once ordering considering it was fairly early and the restaurant wasn't very busy at the time. Overall the food was good but not great, service was pretty solid, and for $14 I got filled up on a huge burger, so just slightly above average for me. This place is a little funky as well with funny posters and fish tanks all around. I think that's the biggest thing going for it- you can get decent quality burgers and (I'm assuming) decent sushi at the same place, which is just a bit funky in itself.",2015-07-29 13:47:54

We would have not waited but thankfully the patio was first come first serve so we were able to sit immediately due to everyone else seeming to be a large party. The service was just ok but honestly I think it was because they were basically under attack by the amount of people trying to eat there so not holding that against them they were just trying to survive at that point. Given the busyness of the place the food came out rather quickly and the micheladas we had were to die for.

Line was lonng, considering it was Labor Day and they had wrestlers in town.

Here, some workers just looked Unhappy with their job. It was packed and it was noticeable on their face at their frustration, especially with some cooks in the back. When a customer tried to make small talk and ask about the food the cook just gave him a nasty glare and shrugged. I don't expect the cooks to be all jolly, but it just felt since they aren't acknowledging guests then how can I expect them to make tasty quality food if they don't give a f$!k?! Plus, our waiter needed an attitude adjustment. I asked for sprite and she rolled her eyes. 

Honestly, I only enjoyed the spring rolls and salad bar. I took a leap of faith with the passionfruit ""gelato"" (It looks like the gelato melts and they just refreeze it). 

I was disappointed in the fried rice *sad face* and their sub sandwhich. The bread tasted rubbery and very dry while the fried rice was REALLY PLAIN. I felt like whoever prepared the fried rice did NOT know what they were doing. Now I understand why it was barely touched.

My daughter had the strawberry lemonade (bottomless) and I had their ice tea.  Both were very flavorful and fresh.  Daughter had a chicken salad (which she demolished) and I ordered the All American Patty Melt.  I loved that they even asked how I wanted my burger cooked.  The Melt was on point with this fabulous marbled rye bread.  It was very generous and I had to take half of it home.

VEGAN BURGER ($4.69): Comes with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and thousand island dressing. The burger is really good. I've no idea what the burger is made of or how they get it to look like a 'real' hamburger patty. It's something you have to see and try for yourself! 4/5

POPCORN CHICKEN ($4.69): I only had a few bites because I was too full to eat any more, but these were quite good, especially when dipped in the vegan ranch! 4/5

FRIES ($2.59): I ordered the curly fries and sweet potato fries, favoring the former. Generous portions. 3.5/5

SERVICE: I went through the drive-thru and waited about 10 minutes for my order. No one expects opening day to be perfect, so I was cool about it when the cashier got my order right on the third try. 

I'm excited to have a vegan restaurant close to home and will definitely be back for more.

The shop is very cute, just full of sugary happiness, after checking out what they had, we walked out with a couple dozen of the sweet goodies!

Ok now don't judge me , I didn't have them all at the same time, it was over a 3  1/2 day period, maybe some for breakfast, a snack or just for fun, but let me tell you about the cupcakes I had!!

1st off you can't go to Vegas without thinking of Elvis, and for the month of January The Cupcakery has an Elvis inspired cupcake, it was called Trip to Graceland, it was a moist peanut butter cake topped with banana cream frosting rolled in Applewood BACON and drizzled with honey. OH SWEET JESUS! This cupcake was amazballs!  Loved it!

Then there was Mocha Mocha, a rich chocolate cake topped with mocha buttercream frosting & a chocolate covered coffee bean, oh man this was delsih, before I knew it , it was gone.

Because I love coconut, I also tried Mound of Joy, it was a tropical sweet coconut cake with chocolate buttercream frosting loaded with shaved coconut & almonds, Oh My Heavens!!!! Another great cupcake

Can you believe we still had some cupcakes left over, so on the ride home I went ahead and tried the Chocolate Freckles, this was another rich chocolate cake smothered with chocolate crunch cream cheese frosting, now I'm more of buttercream frosting kind of girl, but this cream cheese frosting was light, not heavy and another sweet hit!

We were not disappointed with The Cupcakery, such a great find in Las Vegas! If you haven't been you should give them a try!",2015-01-22 18:57:11

I had heard they were awesome, and when I saw the neighborhood it was in and walked in, I was incredibly impressed. What a fantastic setting, and superior service. However, people who don't like waiters in your face all the time emptying edamame dishes or refilling your iced tea after every 5 sips - then you'll dislike the superior service. Maybe I'm just used to mediocre service, but the service is almost too much for me. I felt like they were going to wipe my face after I dripped some soy sauce.

Besides the beyond excellent service, their food was brilliant. Their ginger was even top notch. The iced tea was seriously some of the best I've ever had and they even serve it with simple syrup on the side. Their sashimi was excellent and so fresh. Their presentation was a bit over the top, much like their table-side service, but they are really taking their fine dining seriously. Great prices for the sushi too, not that much more than a RA or Sushi Brokers, but total step up in quality. 

I was underwhelmed by their rolls though, mostly because I was surprised at getting fish eggs on my california roll. The texture threw me off, and when the waiter approached me and was told I was hesitant about the small creepy orange egg things covering my roll - he was so excited and said ""just wait until you find one later, they're really fun to pop - like pop rocks"". Although I was so grossed out by that, his passion for the food was awesome. I would come back and ask for the same servers again. They all seem to have their stuff together over there. 

Although I called and asked earlier about gluten free soy sauce (and they said they didn't have any), my waiter told me they had it and brought it out. What  a save on their part! I appreciate any sushi joint that gets how awkward it is for a gluten free girl to carry a big bottle of GF soy sauce in her purse.",2010-03-20 04:57:49

I love that their pastas are made fresh in-house, as well as their delicious focaccia and bread sticks.  And there are so many items to choose from, you'll likely have trouble choosing your entree - everything looks (and tastes) so good!  

Their Queen's Feast menu has lots of options, but I'm going to describe our latest non-QF meal.  Service is definitely better--and less hurried--during non-QF times.

I started with their shrimp/crab/avocado salad.  The shrimp were grilled and were small, but plentiful.  There were only a few flakes of crab, but there was probably a whole avocado.  The salad was served atop greens with a light lemon vinaigrette dressing.  The portion was huge, but I would have preferred a smaller portion for a lower price (currently $10.99).  

My hubby started with the beef carpaccio.  It was thinly sliced, and topped with several large pieces of shaved Parmesan and arugula.  The dressing was light and delicious.  We both loved this dish, and I kept stealing bites.

For our entrees, I had the shrimp tagliolini with the cognac cream sauce.  The sauce and pasta were truly delicious.  My only complaint was that the shrimp were relatively small (but not as small as the shrimp in the salad). 

My hubby had the Dover sole special.  While it was very good, we were surprised at the $36 price tag.  I suggest you ask the prices for their specials before ordering, because they are probably higher than the regular menu.

We made room for dessert, and shared the panna cotta and creme brûlée.  Both were very good.

Our server was very attentive and we never waited long between courses.  He also expertly filleted the sole at the table - very impressive!

Despite some minor--but small--complaints, we will definitely return!",2012-11-12 01:14:41

That's another thing that makes them stand out, the grill. They aren't just warming your sub like competitors, it comes out smashed with grill lines...how I like it! :)

If you are a fan like I am, you should sign up for their point card. You get a free dessert for registering it online and after 100 points, you get a free sub. I know $100 seems like a lot to spend before you get a free sub, but you're gonna go there anyway...so why not get something extra just for swiping a card?

Located right in the heart of Tryon in downtown Charlotte, this place becomes really packed on weekend nights. And while I don't mind paying the $5 cover for guys, I don't really enjoy this bar when it gets way too crowded. It can get very difficult to move, either upstairs or down, but sometimes you can move out to the patio on nice nights & find some breathing room.

As for the atmosphere, Ri Ra has just never really done anything special for me. I just think of this place as a nicer bar that's always crowded, so I'm always looking to get out of there when my friends want to stay. They have live bands some nights & that just adds to the claustrophobia of the upstairs. If you can get a table, the place isn't as bad, with a good beer selection & excellent bar tab system. You can open your tab at either the upstairs or downstairs bar & then proceed to order from either bar. This takes away from the hassle of always having to go back to the same bar you opened your tab at.

Other than a nice setting inside, Ri Ra just never seems to impress me and/or make me want to come back again. I'm sure there is a reason the place is always packed, so I guess I'm just out of the loop on loving this place. So while it's not a one of my favorites in Charlotte, I don't mind the place for small chunks at a time.",2008-09-18 18:19:27

Whenever I've gone here, I never really had to wait in line. Service is pretty quick and you get your food pretty fast. This is something that is expected from a fast food restaurant. It to avoid going in the night time thought because the food served are usually pretty hard and chewy as I'm sure that they have been sitting in the pan all day. I'm normally a big fan of orange chicken but not the one that panda express serves. I think that the smell is too powerful. I do however love their shrink based foods such as the walnut shrimp and the new five flavor shrimp. I just wished that they're a little cheaper. The shrimp are usually pretty soft and its full of flavor. If you are craving fast Chinese food, don't expect anything fancy or anything that will make you go, ""wow"" from this fast food restaurant.

I was minding my own business and this guy pushes me saying I'm in his way and he paid $12 for the table (which is nothing compared to my group who paid more than $40 for the table as we were there several hours for a birthday). Anyway, he thought it was ok to try to start a fight with me and started pushing me and the only reason he stopped is because my guy friends were there to be like ""ok what's your problem why are you trying to fight a girl?"" I was just standing there!

Andy Poolhall handled it very unprofessionally, didn't care about him trying to get violent with me, and tried to buy me off with a shot! (but not one for my friends)

I used to like Andy Poolhall for Cherry Bomb, until gay friendly meant gays can fight women. Only reason it didn't get really messy is because my guy friends were there.

The staff were terribly unprofessional. Any regular venue would definitely throw out a guy who's trying to start a fight, with anyone, let alone a woman, gay or straight.

If I were anywhere in the entertainment district I'm pretty sure guys shoving girls around is not ok, but in a community that prides itself on sex/gender equality, I'm surprised they allowed that. He could've said excuse me but decided to take a more aggressive approach. That's immature but completely acceptable at Andy Poolhall. UNPROFESSIONAL. I explained it to the staff and she understood she just didn't care and thought a shot would make it ok. Buy me off for $7? Please. She definitely didn't handle it like any other bar would.

If you're a woman, make sure you come here with guy friends because in these here parts, it's ok to rough up a girl if you're a guy as long as you're effeminate. I shouldn't have to wear my brass knuckles and put vaseline in my hair anytime I want to go to a gay-positive bar (on a non-gay night).

So surprised because I used to love going to Cherry Bomb here and never had this problem. Can't say I'd go again after that. I don't want to spend a dime here. Buy me off with a shot? Please. You were about to let a guy fight me, and then he decided to rat on me as if I did something wrong, because he knew he was in the wrong trying to start a fight with a woman. Pathetic and cowardly. No real man would pick a fight with a woman and then rat to the bartender saying she started it (when really that's not how it went down). If you were trying to take a shot at pool and needed me to move, you could've asked me to move, like any normal person, instead of pushing and then yelling.

By the way, sometimes they'll charge $6 for a drink and sometimes $8 for the same one. The menu said $6.50 for Johnny Black, why are you charging $8? Oh, because you want to. Lovely. Dishonest bartenders here too. Why is the drink price changing depending on if I order it or if my guy friend orders it? I just ordered that at $6.50, why are you charging him $8? Dishonest.

Music was ok. Maybe 3 good songs that night but most of it was random unknown electro.

FYI unisex washrooms, i.e. girls and guys in the same washroom, many stalls. I'm all for guys and girls sharing if they play nice but that's definitely not the case here... Crews & Tango = awesome... But this place? No way, because men will fight women here because they can get away with it as long as they're effeminate enough. Management does NOT care.

Unprofessional staff that tolerates male violence against women, rip-off drinks where they charge you $8 when it should be $6.50... Bad music...

Pool tables are nice but not worth everything else I had to deal with that night. I have a huge problem with places that brush off violence, especially if it's guys trying to fight women. I'm very lucky I had guy friends with me to be like ""what are you doing? what's your problem??"" to the guy who started shoving me.

Normally I never have an issue and I REGULARLY visit this place. Tonight was something else. Never again, Andy Poolhall. Disgusted at the way you handle men trying to fight women. I'd get much better treatment at a bar that is supposedly not gay friendly at all. If not gay friendly means I don't get threatened to be beat up by male patrons, I'm all for it, bring on the homophobia. This bar is pathetic and though tries to be politically correct, isn't in that respect.",2012-01-14 09:59:43

Pros:
The sound is AMAZING! I've been to two Ben Folds shows here & have been blown away by how good everything sounds!
I've never had any issues with the staff.
Show times - start on time.
Staggered viewing area, so it's not all level where you're having to stare only at people's heads.

Cons:
I like the layout; however, the ""general admission - standing room only"" gets me, because ""you snooze, you lose"". If you don't get there early, you're stuck waaaaay in the back. Parking is an issue, too. You have to compete with all the other establishments there, so when it's time to go, you're stuck there for a while trying to leave.

well I should start with their customer service that definitely needs improvement. it's close to impossible to get someone answer your calls so making an appointment was super hard - the only way to do it is to leave a voice mail and hope for the best. 

we were also confirmed for a 45min massage while our deal included 1hr massage. we spoke to them on arrival and fixed that. 

the studio itself reminds an old apartment with many rooms. random musical instruments and fitness equipment. 

a room for couples massage was nicely decorated though. but chilly. same with the massage lotion - chilly. I would think that everything has to be a tiny bit warmer to make the muscles automatically relax. the warmest thing were hot towels that the masseuse used after the massage.

mani/pedi was ok. but I think my cuticules were cut a bit too short as I had some irritation in few places after. but otherwise it was done very attentively.

Tasty, greasy bar food.

I came here on a Thursday night.  Beer seemed really cheap... clearly this is a great place to go if you want to drink with friends for not a lot of money.  I had a microbrew bottle special for $2.50, for example, that was delicious.

Because everyone raved about the wings, I tried some (Jess Jess, $9.50 for a dozen).  I felt, like many do, that they are not ""saucy"" enough.  Almost no sauce.  But they are good.  Not great, not otherworldly, and not the best I've had in Phoenix.  But they are good, fair priced, and worth ordering if you are drinking beer and looking for an appetizer.

I ordered the Candlestick Carver, recommended by many.  It was good.  Decent to good cuts of roast beef on sourdough (texas toast like) bread, with melted cheese and roasted peppers.  Here's a hint:  ASK FOR NO MAYO.  I like Mayo, but they put like 5 tablespoons on, and it kind of ruined it, and with the dipping au jus suace, you don't need it.

I finished mine, enjoyed every bite, was stuffed, and ate a few of the curley fries (these are just the cheap frozen premade stuff you find at most restaurants).

My son ate the Mac & Cheese.  I didn't try, but it looked fine.

Anyway, will I be back?  Perhaps.  It's kind of a dive.  Parking is fine.  Serivce was nice.  Beer selection and pricing is the strength of this restaurant.  Food was good for a bar, maybe great.

But this isn't a gastropub.  Not gourmet.  Check those expectations at the bar.

I'd think this is a great place to go with a group of coworkers for happy hour.  Or a guys night out.  It's casual enough for the family if you are looking for greasy food.

Order the wings.  But don't expect best of Phoenix.  Just expect solid wings.

If I was coming here again with just one other person, I'd likely try a different appetizer to share, order a couple of their cheap beers, and probably eat their Buffalo Chicken sandwich to get the flavor of the buffalo wings without all the fatty skin.

And I'd go home a pretty content man after signing the bill.",2011-11-04 15:24:26

We spent $45 on three small take out containers. The same items, but bigger portions would have cost about $25 at conngee queen and other comparable restaurants. 

I am giving it 4 stars bc they offer gluten free options that are prepared in a washed wok with cleaned utensils. I trust that they take good measures in their kitchen to avoid cross contact  as I did not get sick at all after eating. So for that reason alone, and since there are really no other places I can get celiac safe chinese food, they get 4 stars. 

We ordered the 

mushroom fried rice - really good! we added hot sauce at home and it was perfect

singapore noodles - edible but not great. they didn't mix the curry sauce in properly so there were clumps of fry powdery sauce and overall the dish lacked anything special

garlic chinese broccoli - also really good! crisp and not super oily with lots of garlic.

We ordered the crab cakes and seafood chowder for appetizers, the lobster for the main course, and the panna cotta and ice cream sandwich for dessert. 

The seafood chowder was mediocre and a bit bland. The crab cakes were flavorful but I have a sneaking suspicion that it's because it was salty. The lobster was also mediocre, not especially fresh or flavorful. It lacked that sweetness that came with fresh seafood. For a seafood restaurant, the seafood was not fresh at all. The dessert was good, but it's hard to screw up dessert. Though I do recommend the ice cream sandwich over the pan a cotta, which could have been creamier. We also tried the lbs cocktail and it was pretty good.

I was glad to see a number of their popular dishes remaining on their menu, despite a make-over and a new chef.

The new decor is very lush and there is a warm calm vibe when you enter.  But a little later on into the night, the music gets turned up loud, and you can barely hear each other speak.  They have also tried to put in more tables into the dining space, making it a tight squeeze to leave our table, and also when heading to/from the restrooms.

Having frequented Blowfish often before, there were a lot of must-have dishes that we wanted  after such a long absence.  Still on the menu are:  the giant ebi shooter (they have also introduced a baby size but we went for the giant, of course), spicy rock shrimp, hot oil hamachi and lobster and shrimp dumpling appetizers all met the high standards that we had in our memories.

But unfortunately, where things have faltered is the sushi.  The appearance and the ""tightness"" of the makimonos were terrible - they were lopsided and they collapsed the minute you try to pick up an individual piece.  We had a lot of rice drop off into our soy sauce dishes because they were falling apart at even the most careful and lightest touch.  For the prices they charge, this is not acceptable, and we gave feedback to the server, who said he'd pass it onto the kitchen.   Fortunately, they all tasted very good, and we tried our old favourites - such as the red hot curry roll, the spicy tuna with rock shrimp, and they even made the black & blue for us even though it was not on the menu.  Additionally, we tried a couple of new dishes:  the pyramid sashimi and the jalapeño hamachi.  The jalapeño hamachi is definitely a welcomed addition, but the sashimi didn't blow us away.

Tak is still the manager of this location and he was his usual charming self, mixing and mingling with the guests.  He also comped a couple of desserts as it was a birthday celebration, so that was very generous.  One of them was a new mocha trio that was fun and delicious.

We would return again if only for the bi shooter and spicy rock shrimp - we often talked about how we missed having these dishes during their reno!  And I'm willing to give another chance to see if their makimono quality control was just ""off"" on the night we visited.",2016-07-16 03:19:05

While it has only been open about a week now you would think they have been there forever....the service was flawless.

I was especially intrigued when I viewed their website which stated that the Chef does not use mayonnaise, heavy butter sauces and heavy cream sauces and that he can create meals just as tasty without the fat.....and I must say this is not a lie! The food was amazing. My husband was extremely happy with his meal of Chicken Sausage Flatbread and Lamb Meatballs (made with Moroccan spices, Feta, Almonds, Carrot salad and pomegranate BBQ sauce)...he kept saying ""you have to yelp this place!"" lol 
I tried everything my husband ordered plus the Organic Vegetarian Plate which was also delicious. 

For drinks I had the Calistro Classic Martini made with organic vodka...yes organic vodka!...and very tasty calistro marinated olives. 

They also have an amazing wine list which I will have to start trying next time : )

Tuesdays they have all-day happy hour in the lounge (which means half-price hookah, drinks, and some appetizers)! It gets a bit crowded which may not be for everyone, but I think it makes for a more fun vibe. They tend to start playing electronic music later in the night on Tuesdays as well (I have heard they also do this on weekends).

I give them four stars mainly for overall atmosphere in the lounge and selection of the hookahs. They have a huge assortment of hookah flavors - at least 25 that you can mix and match, and you can also choose liquids other than water for the bottom of the hookah. My only complaints are that the hookahs take phenomenally long to come out (I can never understand why this part takes so long - the drinks and even the food arrives before the hookah!) and they won't refill coals - you just have to order a new hookah flavor. But, the music is good and the seating is comfortable, so the wait doesn't bother me enough to stop going.

The food is good, but not exceptional. It's decent middle eastern food for Las Vegas, but like I said, if it weren't for the great vibe in the hookah lounge, I wouldn't go for the food alone. The hummus, baba ganoush, and meat dolmas are my favorite appetizers, and the lamb skewers are a great entree.

The dishes are meant for sharing, which I love because then you get to try lots of different things. We ordered the following:

Vietnamese seafood ceviche - My favourite dish of the night. They did not skimp on the seafood or the flavour with this dish. Absolutely delicious, and all of the seafood tasted so fresh and refreshing.

Lobster tacos - These are interesting because the taco shell is made out of a taro chip. The taro flavour really comes through, but I felt like the other flavours were a bit light (i.e. lobster was not very flavourful and I also couldn't really taste the mango.) Then again, it might have been because I ate the seafood ceviche first, which overwhelmed my taste buds.

Pulled beef and braised onion peking crepe - This was delicious, although a very tiny portion. The caramelized brandy apple on the side was sooo fragrant, and the goat cheese balanced out the savoury beef and sauce really well.

Quinoa crusted onion rings - Satisfying and a nice little side. It comes with greek yogurt, sweet chili relish, and chili mint chutney for dipping. I loved the chili mint chutney, it was so unique and very refreshing, and actually all of the sauces blended together really well.

Dessert: lemongrass and passionfruit panna cotta - Great flavours, very refreshing way to end off the meal. Panna cotta was super smooth and silky, and I liked the black rice that was hidden under it.

The restaurant is fairly small, dimly lit, but has a very cool, trendy ambiance. Apparently Susur Lee spends a lot of time here now, and we actually saw him while we were here!!

Next time I will have to be more clear when I order.  The young man who was working was not very personable and I immediately got the feeling that he did not get it right.  I chalked it up to the fact that he probably had a long day and was tired, as it was almost 8 p.m.  Not the greatest first impression, but I might try it again, especially when I'm not in a rush to get to the airport.",2017-05-06 15:04:51

We had seen a groupon online that was $15 for $30 worth of pottery/studio fee. I thought that was a great deal, so we went down to check it out. 

It was definitely a little pricier than I expected. Ooph. The studio fee for two adults alone was $10 each. Then the cheapest thing in the shop was $18. My fiancee ended up getting a $18 piece and had to pay, like, $.22 to cover the difference. I had to pay about $4.00 for my $22 piece. Also, a heads up, if you do not use the entirety of the groupon they cannot refund you or let you use it again. So the $15 for $30 was better for us since we both knew we would spend that amount, rather than the $29 for $60 (although if you know you're gonna spend over that I would recommend it.)

The staff was nice and accommodating. They constantly cleaned our water and answered any questions we had. It was a bit crowded at 2 o'clock on a Sunday and it took us about 3 hours to get through the entire process of painting the piece and putting finishing touches on it. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for unique things for your house, or a gift to make someone.",2015-09-03 20:26:36

What makes the Zack's burger so great? To start the portion size is just right. I tend to get the Zack's special (two patties and two slices of cheese) and it tastes fresh and has a good ratio of fillings. I am full after eating my meal but not disgustingly stuffed as can happen with chain fast food places. The fries are delicious and always hot with a little bit of salt. The milkshakes are yummy too! 

The décor is cute retro burger joint. The music playing in the background and the worker outfits go along with the theme. I do not appreciate, however, that they are not open on the weekends. 

There is something to be said for an independently owned small establishment that has been making hamburgers so well that they have stayed in business for 40 years and can afford to be closed on the weekends.

All were prepared well and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. In particular, there were compliments on the fried oysters! And, as always, there was enough to allow for take-home boxes after we were finished. 
I will say that the reason I didn't offer 5 stars is because there were not hardly any options for side veggies. They have slaw and you can get a salad of course. Other than that, you pick from potato products and/or fried onion rings. I would recommend considering some vegetable options to accompany the baked, broiled, and grilled seafood options.

First Course: raw scallop, cucumber, beef garum (5/5)
Super fresh raw scallop in bite-sized chunks. Love the freshness and sweetness of the cucumber, cucumber juice and mint leaves. 

Second Course: humboldt squid, peas, cured pork (4/5)
First time having squid in long strips (sort of like flat rice noodle shape). Love the texture - it's slightly chewy yet soft. The beef and peas reminded me of Chinese flavours which I wasn't too fond of. 

duck confit, mushroom, comte - the duck was melt-in-your-mouth soft, topped with thinly sliced, fresh raw button mushrooms. 

Third Course: halibut, zucchini, dried scallop, dill (5/5)
Best halibut I've ever had. Cooked sous-vide, it was extremely tender and moist. Paired with fresh, sweet zucchini. Again, we can see that the freshness of ingredients is key to these dishes. 

Fourth Course: buttermilk, peach, honeycomb (4/5) 
Buttermilk snow was a cold surprise. I liked the fresh and dried peaches along with the caramelized sweetness of honeycomb.

koji, almond, white chocolate (4/5) 
Loved the almond crumbles paired with the icecream.

This pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that I didn't want my ramen anymore. I didn't even need the pork belly. The oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The ramen is no joke either. The texture of the noodles stays perfect throughout the entire meal. They don't become so bloated with soup that they turn into mush. I hate mushy noodles. My friend ate his entire ramen bowl down to the last drop of soup! Now heed this warning: The portion sizes are not of America!

I've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my English isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  But that's never annoyed me because I love the soups here.

So far I have only tried the Tonkatsu. I ordered with extra pork, egg, and (I know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  The Tonkatsu is, I believe, a pork based broth.  Its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  The pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost buttery.  I barely had to chew it.  Now, I am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.

It also makes me feel like I'm in that scene from the end of Drop Dead Fred when she's in the big scary house. Don't know why it reminds me of that scene..maybe the high ceilings? But that's pretty cool too.

One star deduction only because if I worked at place with a drink menu this freaking awesome, it would be all I'd ever want to talk about. In fact, I don't even WORK there and I still find ways to bring up Hanny's drink menu in regular conversation. But try to engage your bartender and two times out of three (I say this because there were three bartenders when we went and I tried to talk to all of them and only of them humored me), you'll get the cold shoulder. That's right, you will get #2 of the top ten ways to say no to drugs, circa  the D.A.R.E. program, 1994. 

Anyway, I've been here a few times and have always had fun, mostly because I am all about the Pimm's Cup so if it's anywhere on a menu, I'm probably having a good time. I told my boyfriend that Hanny's was special because they actually served real Pimm's Cups and most places can't. He didn't believe me and responded that he's sure Ocean Club could serve a Pimm's Cup. I responded that I have already tried (I haven't) and they couldn't (I wouldn't know, I haven't tried). Just so you all know how I roll when it comes to challenging my unchecked facts.

I also had some Absynthe (this is what I wanted to ask the bartenders about when I got THE COLD SHOULDER). It was okay. It tasted like Sambuca but was a lovely shade of green. I don't think the kind they sell here in the U.S. have hallucinogenic properties but it was about my 6th drink of the evening so I obviously had a good time with it.

I haven't had the food but I will definitely be back for some more Pimm's Cups. I don't give a shit if Ocean Club has them.",2011-10-03 21:20:46

At this same time, two bar seats opened up and we decided to roll the dice and sit there to get a beer. Once sat, we were told that we could get a beer but that we should really get in line when they are busy. On one hand...how awful is it to be standing at a bar and have to fight for service? For that fact, 100% on board. However, if I am sitting at the bar, I find to make sense to have service at that particular seat and not have to gauge the crowd to understand if it is proper to sit or stand.

first of all, this place is REALLY HARD to find! you have to turn into an office building area then find the correct parking lot for the restaurants customers, since there are many other offices in the same area. then the restaurant parking lot is super small and all the spots were taken so we had to go to an abandoned garage, which is under construction, to park at a reserved spot. yes I did not like that but that was the only parking place I got to allow me to eat there. then you walk into the building, which is supposed to be the east tower, I don't know if there's a west tower or somehing, then you need to go downstairs to find the restaurant. very annoying..

the restaurant itself is pretty nice looking. however one of the waiters who seated us was not that enthusiastic about his job. there were probably 10 entrees for you to choose from, including vegeterian appetizers rice and naans. my favorite is chicken masala. the lamb was pretty good too but I personally don't like lambs flavor. their entrees are a bit on the spicy side, especially the vegetable entrees. they also have yogurt and salad for you. I would also highly recommend the two desserts they have. one is a kind of a rice cake thing and the other one is like rice soup or something. don't really know what they are called but they were pretty good. not too sweet. overall, I would come again if I want to eat a ton of Indian food without paying too much but I hope the parking situation will be better next time. it makes me worried about my car getting towed the entire time. :(",2014-02-09 21:21:36

Ebi Mayo
Tempura fried shrimp, came in 5 pieces. I liked how the shrimps were big, not like the skinny shrimps you normally get in shrimp tempura. Batter was good, didn't taste greasy at all. It was topped with mayo and this other orange sauce that I don't know what it is - i would like to think it's spicy mayo but it wasn't spicy at all. Tastes good, nice appetizer.

Gyu rice ($8.50) 
I ordered the Gyu rice, and added extra chicken for only $2. At first I thought they would just add the chicken into the Gyu bowl but nope, the chicken comes in a separate bowl so there's good value in the amount of meat you get for $2. Apparently it was terriyaki chicken, but just tasted like mixed chicken and onions stir fry in soya sauce. The chicken meat was slightly dry. The gyu rice comes with beef stir fried with onions, edamame, soft boil egg, and 2 pieces of cantelope in the bowl, and miso soup on the side. I found it quite nice how there were other toppings to go with the rice. There was actually quite a lot of meat in the bowl too so I found that surprising. The beef meat was soft and well seasoned. The soft boil egg was more on the cooked side, I personally like mine more runny but it still tasted good.

Unagi rice ($11.95)
The bowl comes with edamame, soft boil egg, and 2 pieces of cantelope in the bowl, and miso soup on the side.The unagi was quite a large piece, however it did lack of some sauce though. It seemed like the restaurant probably just went out and bought a pre-made one and slapped it on top of rice. Still tastes good though. 

Hot Japanese Green Tea ($3.80)
This was quite a joke in my opinion. Not sure why they would charge this much for hot green tea - I know it was in a tea bag, but....quite over priced I must say. And quite strange too because they served lychee jelly inside? Not sure how jelly is supposed to go with a hot green tea bag drink.....

Side comment - I did not like the service. Whenever I raised my hand to ask them something, they see me and look at me, but then look around elsewhere but they walk towards me so I'm like so confused if they actually saw me. They could at least nod their head to acknowledge they see me asking for service. Also, when they served my Gyu rice the chicken was missing, I originally thought they would just add it in the bowl but my bowl only had beef so I asked the waitress and all she did was pull my tray away without answering or saying anything. I really questioned if she knew what i was talking about. But then I saw another waitress walking over with a small bowl of chicken so I told the waitress ""oh never mind, I didn't know it comes separately"", and then they both walked away.
..............

They had a huge sign outside advertising their twist icecream (Taro and Green Tea) but turns out they don't have Taro and it was blueberry instead so I passed. Would help if you took away the sign so you aren't doing false advertising. Hopefully next time I can try it.
I saw they have Afternoon tea specials Monday - Friday from 2:30 - 5pm, the rice bowls are only $5.99! That's a really good deal compared to their regular price.

It's slightly frustrating because I liked the food, but disliked the service which would make me want to lower my rating.",2016-05-10 03:23:47

I took about 4 classes at this studio.  The first 3 went well for me (I have been a dancer for most of my life, so yoga comes pretty easily), the 4th one ruined it though.  I appreciate the idea behind Bikram, but I just felt like the heat was closing in on me... I think I nearly had a panic attack as my whole body turned bright red.  I made it through the class somehow, but only with numerous breaks.  I thought I was dying.

I do love yoga, and I know that this studio is following the Bikram style and requirements.  However, the carpeted floors *WERE gross (glad to hear that they aren't carpeted anymore).  

The employees do have a bit of arrogance about them (like when I said I've done ""hot yoga"" before, and they basically laughed at me when I told them where... ""Oh, haha, that's not Bikram."").  The positive side is that the instructors are very helpful during practice (when it matters most) and make an attempt to learn everyone's name to motivate you.

I don't know what was going on with my pickles but they had a weird flavor that didn't blend well with the rest of the burger.

My GF enjoyed her French Dip but thought it was a rather small serving size.

Best part of the meal was the complimentary bread and the French Fries. 

After we had ordered a table next to ours was sat and told about the Daily Specials/or their secret menu.

I got the Philly cheesesteak with sweet potato fries. The fries were good, but the cheesesteak was pretty abysmal. It would have been OK if it weren't for the fact that the roll was separated (or maybe so soggy it fell apart) on the bottom, and it just made eating it really difficult. That plus it was very greasy just made it a meh experience.

Albo's pizza is located behind Dino's bar and has a nice indoor seating option if you choose to dine in.

We opted to place an order for take out in which they actually walked it over and delivered to us at Dino's so we did not have to wait :) Yay!

We ordered a large Albo Special:
pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, onions, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers 

Pizza was good, and plenty cheesy which is a bonus as they are a pizza shop that does not skimp on the cheese! That is something that drives me nuts when you have to add cheese as an extra topping just to get a decent amount, not here!

Pizza is good and the friendly personal service is even better :)

I think the lunch set menu is excellent value for the money!

However, the Strawberry and Pineapple slush ($7.29)!! It does look delicious and have good presentation. But for $7.29 that is quite pricey!!

Perfect atmosphere (San Fran farmhouse meets Tuscan bakery meets NYC buzz). 

And almost perfect food (cause I think I've had perfect-er).

I called in on a Monday to make reservations for Thursday, and thank goodness I did because everytime I called after that leading up to our dinner (wanted to change our meal time), it went straight to the machine. When I arrived, I suggested to the hostess, ""um, I wonder if one of your phones is off the hook?"". 

""Nope!"", she replied. ""I've just been on the phone all day it's been so busy!"".

Yeesh, when a restaurant in Toronto is ""hot"", man, is it ever hot.

Woodlot is definitely hot. Like... Stephen Dorff hot. Nay, like Ted Williams hot. 

We were seated upstairs at the edge with a great view of the open kitchen below, and kickstarted with a half litre of our server's recommended white. 

Food was slow to come out, but the energy in the 2-storey loft space fuelled conversation that helped the time pass, not to mention the neverending bread basket of their stone-oven baked speciality breads. Mmmmmm......

We started with the Atlantic crab and white bean salad, topped with a swirl of prosciutto. I thought it was tasty, but nothing to be thrilled about. My dining partner, however, enjoyed it much more than I did. Perhaps it was a little too light for my liking - I was waiting for the hearty good stuff!

Mains appeared - I with the smoked chicken and hock ham pie (huge, super deep dish, creamy and packed with root veggies), and my companion enjoyed the whey-fed pork chop. Both dishes were pretty hefty servings, and the flavours were just right. We also ordered a side of bone marrow potato mash. The bone marrow made the mash extremely creamy and light, and was just what we needed to balance out our mains. 

Dessert sightings looked delicious, but we were both far too stuffed to go there... ah well! By the time we finished it was 10pm. The place was still packed, not an empty table in the house. No wonder they can afford to be open till midnight for dinner.

The space is bright, cheery and airy, and on a nice day the patio is perfect setting to eat a meal. While not overflowing with options, the menu did at least have more choices than The Grind. I was excited to see a turkey burger, veggie burger and seared ahi burger alongside the beef choices. 

We decided to start with some fries, which do all come a la carte, but they were really good! My favorite were the Zucchini fries, not I might be biased just because I love zucchini, but they were so good! They weren't really all that crispy, but the coating was seasoned right and they had some homemade ranch on the side for dipping. The sweet potato fries were also really good, sliced really thin and served with a yogurt dipping sauce that gave them a Middle Eastern feel. The regular fries were also really tasty, sprinkled with herbs and Parmesan cheese and served with a truffle aioli! 

I ordered the Turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce and mayo. I had been wanting a turkey burger since last week, so I had high hopes for this, and well, my expectations were not only met but exceeded! The turkey was juicy, seasoned well and the combination of the cheese and the generous amount of avocado made it just perfect! They make the buns fresh with a combination of white and wheat flour, and wow, they are so fresh and delicious! 

The others in my group had the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple burger, both of them really liked them, saying the meat had good flavor and was cooked well. One of the girls had the Chinese chicken salad and also thought that it was really good. 

They also have a menu full of milk shakes as well as chocolate cream and banana cream pie! We were stuffed and didn't get to sample any of the sweets, but I will try to on my next visit. 

There is a lot of burger competition along Camelback right now, and while a bit on the pricey side ($10) per burger, the freshness and service really make it worthwhile. This is my new favorite burger place!",2010-03-24 20:37:22

I also go in knowing that it's going to be stressful due to the amount of money we are talking... but it's no use going in to be mean to people.

Because of that... they practically GAVE me my new car.  I saved $6k. :-)

The service was quite prompt and friendly and I enjoyed my beer, Skinny Dipping Stout; they have a pretty impressive beer list with a fair bit of variety and the prices are pretty fair, too.  Several of the selections are also available as half pints.

I've only eaten there once and it was a daily special: smoked Ontario mushrooms; it was on New Year's Day, 2016 when TC was one of the only venues open in Kensington Market.  TC is quite spacious so good for larger groups with long tables and they have a 'stage' area in the back where live bands perform.  I may be back soon with a social Group for brunch, which I haven't had there yet.  Looking forward to my next visit.",2017-08-22 00:41:23

That statement in itself doesn't look tasty at all, but I have to say for the many varieties of flavors you get, Popped is diverse with kettle corn snacking! I only stopped in when I was in the area for fresh52, and if you're curious to give it a go, they have an amazing deal that for $4 you can get a small bag of their kettle corn with every flavor mixed into it for sampling (I believe they called it the ""Dirty Vegas"" mixture!)

I found it to be a stellar buy when you get $4 a bag to sample every flavor they got. It ranges from sweet, salty, and even spicy (I would be careful if you're not a spicy fan and you purchase ""Dirty Vegas"", since they put it all in one bag!) There's kettle corn flavored in caramel, chocolate, jalapeno, pickle (not as bad as it sounds!), ranch, cheddar, and a plethora of more flavors!

I had started my search for a new car online and narrowed down the car I wanted and reached out to Audi Boulder in Colorado, Audi Las Vegas and Audi Henderson.  You can't even compare the level of professionalism between the three.  Let me explain...

I was lucky enough to work with Bob Breisch, at Audi Henderson who is extremely kind, patient, accommodating, and professional.  He did exactly what he said would in terms of cost, no added nonsense, or last minute ""hidden cost"".  Whole process was transparent and dare I say EASY.  Moreover, when we set-up times to talk on phone and meet in person, he was ready for my visit.  This was the opposite of what I experienced at the other two dealers.  Mr. Breisch's professionalism set the tone for what was to be a seamless transaction. 

I was literally in and out of the the Finance Office in less than 30 minutes, my compliments to Laura Lopez.  Ms. Lopez handles the ""money"" part of the transaction and was a pleasure to work with! 

Oh I almost forgot to mention Austin who assisted me when I picked up my new ride.  He patiently went over all of the technology, offered to come to my home and program the garage door opener.  The best part he was able to program the opener in about 2 minutes while I was still at the dealership and it worked like a charm.  He gave me his contact info and said not to hesitate to contact him with any questions.

If you like taking the TTC, by all means ride the rocket and get off at North York Centre then walk Southbound for 2-3 minutes. If you are a lazy bum like myself and just want to drive home quickly after the meal, you can park on the streets or near a Green P parking lot. Parking after 6pm usually yields better prices. Otherwise, just carpool people!

I love going to Japanese restaurants because everyone serves like their lives depended on it. Typically, Japanese servers are super attentive and overly energetic - that's their culture. I have a feeling they employed Chinese servers too but they worked hard, so it's all cool with me. Our cups were always refilled without us asking first, and they cleared our dishes like a hurricane. They were SO FAST! Overall, I was fine with the service - great Japanese culture! The downside is that the place is small, like super tiny! You can hang purses and jackets on the hook beneath the table but that isn't super helpful in the winter times.

[Food]
I gotta give it to them, the signature clam broth ramen is quite unique. You aren't going to find this anywhere else in the 416. It's definitely not too salty and you can taste the clam flavour just by sipping on the broth. Unlike other ramen restaurants, their noodles are quite firm. For those who like it soft, you won't enjoy your stay. Unfortunately eggs are an additional cost, so I didn't bother adding on top. The pork is soft, not to the point where it melts, but you could tell it went through sous-vide. If you don't know what sous-vide means, time to buy yourself one of those machines lol. Do I think it's the best pork ever? Definitely not.

I read somewhere that the chicken karage came out cold for some people - that's a big nono, it should always be hot. I was quite fond of the chicken, the skin was crunchy and the meat was super tender. The pieces were decent-sized given the price of $5. Gyoza were on point, super oiley but tasty exterior and the content inside was warm. I liked it.

I'm surprised that people gave it a low score because I would rank it above many other ramen stores. In fact, I would fathom to say it's in my top 3-4 of ramen places. It still does not beat Sansotei but it's a close 2nd or 3rd. I also really like the Black Smokey Tonkatsu ramen. Like the name suggests, it seems a bit roasted? toasted? smokey! lols. The broth is undeniably fattening but it was like a fat fat pig swimming in heaven. I know, makes no sense LOL. I will agree with the majority that this is no Michelin-star, in fact, it's not even close to most ramen chains in Japan. If you haven't been to Japan, their broth is to die for - literally! I like how hot the ramen comes, how chewy the noodles are, and how absolutely tender the pork is cooked/made. Nothing in Toronto can replicate that taste.",2018-03-27 02:47:11

It is hard to find seating for happy hours since it's only available by the bar and they do get busy but once you do so worth it. My mom usually gets the peach sangria it's her favorite. I get different things. But we always. Always get the spicy shrimp sauce and eggplant appetizer. It's to die for.,2015-05-31 23:38:20

I didn't catch until when is the lunch special offered, but at night they let you order the lunch specials after 10pm. The menu is quite large and all under $7.50. 

I've never been as it doesnt really stand out outside and is in a shopping center that's easy to drive by and not know what was in there. I came with a group of friends who have been here for late night eats after going to 2nd Chance Prom. 

We ordered family style - 

Crispy noodles with seafood - the noodles and veggies were good, but I found the calamari a bit fishy. 
Eggplant and tofu with garlic sauce hot pot - this had great flavor and liked how the tofu surface soaked up the sauce quite a bit
General Chicken - this was actually really tasty. It was prepared in a way that reminds me more of sweet and pungent than most places Tso's and has a nice light crisp to it. 
Salt and Pepper Shrimp - these were cooked to a crisp to where you can eat the shell and all. I can eat a lot of these. 
Greens steamed with garlic - simple but good. Gotta have some veggies. 

It fed 5 people well for under $50 - not bad! I did appreciate that items weren't as greasy as some other Chinese spots open late. 

It's no frills, quick and cheap food that's pretty decent. If you're looking for a cheap lunch or late night meal then try out this spot. I will be back!",2014-06-04 07:57:08

Avant de lire l'avis de Sarah M, je ne savais pas, et ne voyais pas, le fameux loft aux deuxième dans le fond qui doit être l'un des endroits les plus chaleureux où s'installer pour prendre un café, un sandwich, une viennoiserie et s'installer confortablement pour lire, jaser, étudier ou travailler. Comme Sarah m'a recommandé : mettez vos pantalons de yoga confortables et installez-vous sur les divans. Pour ce qui est du service, on m'a très bien aidé avec un sourire aussi, donc je n'ai pas eu la même attitude que les autres avis semblent mentionné.",2013-01-10 16:41:24

We also went over prices and honestly they are very reasonable. I was pretty shocked at how good their prices are. So ended up getting a ombré which surprisingly only took 2 hours! The thing I liked about Kasadee was that she explained what she was doing and why. She even went as far as explaining it scientifically lol! Aside from all that she was easy going! As for my hair I am really happy with the ombré! I also asked her to give me a bit of a v shape and some layers which turned out great! Highly suggest checking out this place!,2014-03-19 04:11:58

Roasted Chicken:
Simply seasoned with good ol' salt and pepper but the garlic sauce it comes with is amazing! I dip everything in their garlic sauce. The chicken is nice and juicy 4/5

Beef Kabob:
For people like me who isn't a big fan of salty food, this is awesome. It comes with salad (I chose Tzatziki which is listed under salad), rice and pita...and a drink if you get the combo 4/5

Shawarma:
Tasty and juicy meat + their delicious garlic sauce. You should definitely try this. I've been disappointed by lots of places in town that serve shawarma but I wasn't disappointed by this place. Hooray! 4.5/5

They deliver in the nearby vicinity. I foresee more visits here in the future.",2016-01-21 05:47:35

Located on Union avenue in downtown Montreal near Phillips Square and opened since the end of April, I heard a lot about this place all over and finally tried out. I was not dissapointed at all. The place was jam pack, so popular. The waitress was like you have 1h to eat. Ok. A bit rush but it was worth it. Nice vibe, beautiful & authentic mexican decoration into a big industrial loft. Delicious guacamole 6$ for entrees, the ceviche 11$ was good, the ribs 13$ were so delicious, the tacos were ok, my michelada 11$ was refreshing. Service was very fast & pleasant, prices are good. Totally converted, I will need to good back to taste more of the menu + drinks. ¡Buen provecho!

Ordered the Nutella bingsu (?) which is one of the toilet bowl dishes and it's a definite hit. The cafe is poop themed. The seats are toilets, the cups are urinals and the walls are drawn in all sorts of poop themed art. Dessert is good on it's own so worth the trip for the ambiance ;)  it's cash only for now",2016-10-15 15:41:53

I dig Yusef's. The Gyros are delicious. The hummus is delicious. Everyone is nice. It's cheap. Maybe not Haji-Baba cheap, but if two can get a good lunch for under 15 bucks, that's cheap enough. I've never bought anything from the grocery, save for a chocolate-covered banana candy, but they seem to have a pretty good selection of everything you'd need to make some awesome grub.

I hope they're open today - I'm hungry.",2008-12-24 17:00:18

It must have been plenty strong enough because I ended up falling asleep during the show that we attended. We started with vegetable egg rolls tasted like average egg rolls from a Chinese restaurant. For dinner I had the sweet and sour pork which was good and had a nice amount of peppers and onions on the plate. For dessert we split creme brulee which came out with two cute little cordials. It wasn't long into the meal that we decided this restaurant was basically PF Chang at strip prices. So, the food definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the price.",2015-07-06 02:21:35

I'll break it down:

Service - impeccable.  Totally spot-on, without being stuffy formal.  They didn't miss a beat from filling glasses, setting proper cutlery, serving, follow-up...all of it was perfect.

Presentation - while not over the top architectural, it is French Classical cuisine, so presentation is tight and clean.  The dinnerware was lovely and different.  lol

Food - outstanding.  There was a pinot noir butter sauce on the sea bass that I could have drank from a demitasse cup.  Apparently I moaned through every course, as the food was just THAT GOOD. 

And, to top it off, they give you a lovely little red jewelry box filled with chocolate truffles to take home.

My only ""complaint"" is that I wish they instituted some kind of dress code.  I know it's Vegas, but the couple next to us was in tee-shirts and sneakers/jeans.  To me, fine dining should require a bit of class from the patrons.

Otherwise, phenomenal, and if you're in Vegas, GO.",2014-06-19 03:01:02

This clean, no frills place always has a good number of standard Indian dishes like chicken tikka masala, chicken curry and more. There is always a lentil dish and spinach or Cauliflower.  If I had any complaints, it would be too offer more than an array of chicken dishes and to mix it up more with lamb, beef or fish. However, the spice level is relatively mild and they bring fresh, hot Naan to your table. The staff is very pleasant and service is prompt.

I got sesame crusted salmon that was burnt and shouldn't have left the kitchen. The server and manager both corrected the problem and my second attempt was very tasty.

The price was right and the menu was just big enough to provide ample variety without straying from what they say they're about:  shawarma.  Walk in, go to the counter and order, then pick your seat.  The menu is right on the wall but if you need a little time, you can also grab one of the menus from the counter to review.  I didn't get the name of the lady behind the counter but she was very nice, as were the other employees we saw interact with customers.  Before we knew it our lunches were brought out freshly prepared and hot.

I tried the beef shawarma plate with spicy garlic sauce.  It came with the beef on top of rice, hummus, pickled veggies (cabbage, carrots and celery) and hot pita bread on the side.  I went with a colleague from work who ordered the chicken shawarma plate and we both left satisfied!  There was definitely enough food to put a strong lunchtime desire to rest.

The restaurant is a little small, but not cramped.  It was also very clean.  Located in a storefront, there's plenty of parking, even though there aren't a lot of spaces right in front.  No big deal though.  For the time we sat there, it seemed there were always a few spots open, and there are plenty more around the corner.

If it's time to eat and you're near the intersection of 95 and Craig Road, definitely give the Shawarma House a try!",2017-08-12 02:01:33

The perfect opportunity arose when a friend of ours was visiting from out of town and the three of us went to this museum.

It's much larger than we thought it would be. There's three floors of exhibits and interactive displays. It took us a good two hours to go through the museum and that's without reading all the description of the exhibits!

The customer service here was excellent as well, from Noelle at the ticket counter to the volunteers located throughout the museum. Melissa and Holly H. were wonderful answering the many questions that guests were asking.

I highly recommend this attraction to locals and visitors alike. If you're from out of town, this is a good place to go if you want to escape from the casino.

There's a variety of discounts available to save you some money.",2015-10-21 01:40:24
