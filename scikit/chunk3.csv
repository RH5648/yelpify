My wife and I were here for dim sum, and it was simply disappointing. Only one out of the six things we ordered came prepared properly. We were not planning to come back, but my father-in-law insisted in giving this place another try, so we did.
The dinner experience was a LOT better. The food were all above average at a very reasonable price. They have a special in right now where the Double Boiled Fresh Milk Mixed with Egg White in Papaya is $2.8/person on Saturday, Sunday, and Public Holidays. They did this desert justice. It was done properly, and was very tasty.",2014-04-20 00:19:36

KALdk1Mk03_O3FT_uXRyIg,3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,4,6,3,3,"Delicious vegetarian restaurant located in Chinatown, in the same plaza as some other eateries (including Swish Shabu Shabu and Island Malaysian Cuisine) and a supermarket. Located on the 2nd floor, close by the stairs.

Anyways, when we entered, on Christmas Eve a little before 6:30 pm, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a table for 2. After we were finally seated and looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:

Turmeric Salad, $5.95 prior to tax- This salad automatically comes with the dressing on the side. I really liked this salad. It is made with a mix of the healthy dark green leafs, Romaine lettuce and spinach. The flavors were good, especially the dressing. And this is a great starter to share with another person. 

Curry Duck, $12.95 prior to tax- I thought this curry duck was good, but my husband really liked this more. I thought the ""duck"" itself was average, and wished the texture was better. I liked the sauce of this dish. I liked that there were braised green beans in this entree. This dish is good, but not as good as I was hoping it would be. I probably wouldn't order this again.

Spicy Veggie Crispy Beef, $13.50 prior to tax- The texture of this entree is very similar to beef. I really liked the flavors of this dish as well. I thought the sauce was good. I liked the chopped nuts (well I think they are nuts, but they may have been something else) on top of the beef and I also liked that there were a few broccoli florets on this plate, but would have been nice to have a little bit more. 

Both the curry duck and crispy beef entree came with your choice of brown or white rice. My husband and I opted for the brown rice (which was made perfectly).. 
---------------------
(Total= $35.02 after tax, prior to tip)

Service was good for the most part. Our server was nice and gave good recommendations. I appreciated his input when I asked him what his opinion was for some of the menu items. But we did wait quite a while to get our check and to get our boxes to take home some of our leftovers. 

By the way, there is a $6 credit card minimum and there is also free WiFi here (chefkenny, one word). 

There is also one single men's restroom and one single women's restroom. The women's restroom was clean upon this visit and stocked with the essentials. 

The 4 employees working here all speak English and are nice. They are more than happy to explain any of the menu items. 

Will definitely come back here again. Would like to try their veggie happy roll and some of their lunch specials.",2016-01-07 06:16:00

I'm 7 months pregnant and the bartender made me a super-fancy cucumber/ginger concoction so I could feel like I was part of coctail hour - seriously one of the best cocktails I've ever had, liquor or no liquor!

I HIGHLY recommend the brown bag chicken sandwich; the addition of hazelnuts and blue cheese absoultely makes it.  The mixed grain salad definitely lives up to the hype.

r6kOv2LBbsVRvOJial5uRA,kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,5,5,0,2,"One disappointing feature of many Las Vegas restaurants is that, while it is truly remarkable to have so many big name fine dining establishments in one city, those places never seem to live up to the quality of their parent restaurants.  Mesa Grill was disappointing; BARMASA was a disaster.  The burger at the now-closed Daniel Boulud Brasserie was not quite as tasty as the one at db Bistro Modern in New York City.  Rao's, Guy Savoy--the list goes on and will surely keep going on in the future.  So even with the imprimatur of three Michelin stars, I was a bit skeptical visiting Joel Robuchon--after all, Picasso and Guy Savoy received two stars each in the 2009 rankings, and I was relatively disappointed with both.

Joel Robuchon bucks the trend.  First, the restaurant environment is fantastic:  Not too large, there are purple highlights and silver trinkets everywhere, including slightly creepy framed black and white photographs of Nicholas Cage and Dennis Hopper that certainly take the edge off.  The lighting from the ceiling is dramatically aimed onto each table and certain spots in the restaurant, including where the bread cart is kept.  The sound insulation is also impressive as you remain completely unaware of the din of the casino floor until you step outside the restaurant doors.  The space as a whole is extremely elegant and formal while retaining a hint of the playful and whimsical.

The experience begins with the bread cart, a wide selection of different flavored breads including bacon bread, cheese bread, milk bread, saffron bread, and basil bread.  Selections off the bread cart are taken away and reheated.  Personally, I would have preferred a much narrower selection of freshly baked bread, but such is the fair trade-off to enjoy the variety.  The basil bread with the olive oil is a great combination, and I also enjoyed the relatively subtle flavoring of the saffron bread.

The Blood Orange amuse bouche provided a good pre-meal awakening of the senses.  The dry ice under the bowl provided a visually impressive effect, while the slightly sharp taste of the blood orange stirred the palate.

The Truffled Langoustine Ravioli with Chopped Cabbage as an appetizer was truly amazing.  The ravioli contained whole pieces of langoustine, and the black truffle--including the thin strips of truffle delicately set on each of the three ravioli--fit with the slight sweetness of the langoustine.  Pair the truffle sauce with the saffron bread for another great combination.

The Foie Gras and Bacon Foam Soup with Celery was good, though probably something I would trade for other options in the future.  The taste of the bacon is present and tightly controlled in the foam, and the small pieces of foie gras were a solid addition.  I would view this soup more as a respite along the course of the meal rather than a major attraction.

The Spaghetti with Soft Poached Egg and Shaved Black Truffles was a straightforward but nevertheless impressive dish.  The homemade spaghetti is covered with a layer of black truffles circled around a single poached egg.  The recommendation is to break the egg and stir everything together, thus mixing the spaghetti with an egg and truffle sauce.  The result is certainly gooey, but I actually enjoyed the texture as well as the taste--though the truffles were a lot more subtle than I had expected (given the sheer quantity involved).

My second entrée was the Beef Ribeye.  I enjoyed the accompanying vegetables but the beef itself, while good, was not really superior in any way.  The side of whipped potatoes are extraordinarily creamy, seemingly more butter than potato.  It is probably much too rich for some but definitely worth at least a taste.

The second entrée was followed by a cheese course, selecting cheeses from a cart of about 15 or so.  Dessert was a Chocolate Soufflé topped with Chocolate Sorbet.  The chocolate-chocolate combination was overkill but admittedly my own doing--I would recommend going with the other sorbet selection or none at all.  The soufflé is light but remains rather sizeable and is a bit of a challenge after such a large meal.

The service at Joel Robuchon was exceptional.  The sommelier stood out in particular, indulging us upon request with the history of selections of one of the winemakers in particular.  The wine list is quite impressive, tending towards--and appropriately so--""special event"" level bottles.

If I had to nitpick, I wish something more could have been done with the Beef Ribeye, which seemed more like a convenience selection on the menu for those really hankering for beef.  Still, with the amazing and well-thought through restaurant space and excellent dishes like the langoustine ravioli and spaghetti with truffles, Joel Robuchon Las Vegas is certainly a destination-caliber restaurant worthy of five stars.",2012-04-01 07:47:13

After many trips to Deagan's, I just don't know how I feel about it. The food is good. I loved their ""unicorn"" tacos (seitan with Asian-influenced veg and sauce), have enjoyed many dishes, and think the menu's accommodating. The beer and wine selections are pretty nice, and the atmosphere is pub-lite. It has a decent amount going for it... but I'm just not feeling it.

Maybe it's the forgettable waitstaff, which has never left any real impression. Or the monstrously long waits on a weekend night--or any night, for that matter. Maybe it's the hip gastropub fare of charcuterie boards and chicken livers and oysters, paired with the always glaring ESPN channels all along the bar.

The Volcano Roll was pretty good - they set it on fire and I was in awe! The lollipop roll was surprisingly good! I came here with a total of five people, so its good for an intimate setting or to talk with a small group of people.

Still 2 stars.

The good:
- Pizza is good (especially for delivery pizza)
- Not that expensive (definitely not cheap but considering the quality of ingredients, I think it's an inexpensive price)
- Driver is always polite

The bad:
- Estimated delivery time: 610pm. Actaul delivery time: 530pm.  This is the opposite of the usual Pizzaiolo experience. Why wouldn't I consider this a good thing? Because now I'm used to getting the Pizza 90m from when I order it, so I order it and plan to do other things before it arrives. They have taught me to expect it to take forever so I work around that.  The inaccurate/often ridiculous delivery times are really frustrating.
- My pizza had the wrong toppings on it today. It was still good but it wasn't what I ordered. I double checked my online order to make sure I hadn't made a mistake in their crazy-stupid online ordering system (it's a series of 100 radio buttons) but I hadn't.

Overall, I will still order this pizza again, and I guess not know when it will be delivered or what I'm actually going to get, but I'm sure it will still be good.

While not necessarily a bad thing, you should now expect the usual side effects - long waits for seating, harried service and the food itself sinply isn't as good as it was even a few months ago. 

However, we will continue to go for now and hope that things will once again improve over our last few visits, the most recent of which we waited 45 minutes for a table.

One peeve in particular is with the new menus. During our very first visit, we were told bilingual menus were ""on the way"" and to expect them in 'a couple of days'. Several months later they finally arrived but are entirely in French with no English in sight. I can't recommend this as an Anglo-friendly place even if one or two of the staff have basic English skills. That any restaurant in the city doesn't offer menus in English is shameful.",2015-01-05 03:17:54

Cute, welcoming, unique decor that has a homey feel to it.  We were first seated, then advised that all the coffee/baked goods were to be ordered in the front while the back counter had all the lunch items.  We placed our order and then waited for server to bring it over to us. 

I got a cafe latte, my fiance ordered bancha green and shared a raison scone.  Their small latte is about 8 ounces which is smaller than most places so it was stronger than I was expecting it to be but still enjoyed it.  The bancha tea was served in a teapot with a cup both served on a wooden platter - cute.  It was paired perfectly with the raison scone which was sweet and had a light lemon flavour to it.  I'm usually not a fan of raisons but this was good.

I ordered a pizza online, gave the card number to pay for it and received a confirmation/order number. The pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour. An hour later, no pizza, so I called. Gus' had no record of our order, no specials and no website, or so I was told, and yet, I was looking at the website as the employee was telling me they didn't have one. I went to the bank and sure enough, money had been taken out to pay for pizza at Gus'. I called again.
One of the most curious things was the different stories I got depending on the employee I was speaking to. During one phone call I was told that the order was on its way. I waited. Nothing. I called again. No record of the transaction, no order placed, no pizza on its way. I inquired how a pizza could be ""on its way"" if there was, allegedly, no order placed. I was placed on hold several times as the employees desperately tried to get answers to these questions they could not answer. Finally the manager. No record of an order placed, yet paid for. An interesting business practice. 
Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience and an investigation is under way. The funds should be returned in 2-3 business days, but for now, I have no access to them and no pizza.
Think I'll stick with Papa Murphy's; for delivery service is like a box of chocolates-- you never know what you'll get, or in this case, if you'll get.",2014-09-28 15:25:46

The food was passable. The burger was of the frozen and cooked in a steam table variety.  Think your school cafeteria - the kind of patties with little bits of gray sludge on the patty. The hot dog was actually pretty good, despite I'm guessing it's kept in a steam table/water also, as the bun was very soggy after a minute or two. Fries were awful. Choose bagged chips. 

I passed on ice cream but my kids loved it!  They raved. My older son had a chocolate shake, which was huge. I tried a small bite and it was pretty okay. Mild chocolate flavor, which I prefer. My younger son had a cup of mint chocolate chip. I didn't care for the flavor at all. Personally, my big hang up with the ice cream was the texture. It's just different. That doesn't make it bad, just for me, it was off putting. Clearly, this is a lower fat product vs a premium ice cream. More of an ice milk if you recall that type. Just not my thing, but that's just me. 

The best part of the trip, and the reason I would take my kids back (just for ice cream) was the experience. Really nice, down to earth people - staff and customers alike. It was fun just to sit in the old booths and watch everyone's ice cream creations go by. It's hard to look grouchy with a huge ice cream cone in your hand.

Our meals came out quickly and our server was attentive.

I ordered the enchiladas verde and thought it was okay. It was a little lacking in the flavor department. The green sauce was good and spicy, but the shredded chicken inside the tortillas was very bland.

First, the interior is not your typical Chinese restaurant. Rather, it's a quaint, cozy little spot with tables, booths and white table clothes. Although the lunch crowd was beginning to pick up, the service was fairly quick so good for those who need to get back to the office. The menu is extensive and would be great for a group if everyone wanted to try different dishes. We, however, just ordered off the lunch menu. My one friend and I had the crispy beef ($10) and my other friend had the chili shrimp ($11). All entrées came with steamed rice and a spring roll. I really enjoyed the crispy beef as it was, in fact, crispy but not chewy and the sauce had the right balance of sweet and savory. Sometimes I find crispy beef can be too much like candied beef, if that makes sense. My friend that had the shrimp enjoyed it as well; she said the shrimp were very fresh.

My favorite thing here was the mocha. It was smooth and creamy, so perfect for a breakfast. I decided to order from the specials out front and got the breakfast crepe with chicken, mushrooms and a variety of other vegetables and hollandaise sauce. It was originally paired with asparagus, but I switched that out for hash browns. 
I didn't actually like the crepe. There was a cream soup base inside mixed with the chicken and
veggies that I found off putting. I did love the hash browns.
Jacob absolutely loved his chicken tortilla soup, the fresh tortillas on the side was a great way to start off his breakfast. I'm also not sure what he got for breakfast as he ate it super quickly, but I know it came with their roasted potatoes which he enjoyed as well.

I came here with my partner on a Friday evening and the place wasn't all too busy. There was plenty of space indoors in the main hall with the majority of people sitting outside on the patio with live music. The atmosphere was lovely, you can see the Toronto skyline in the distance, and it was the perfect combination of liveliness and quaint-ness. You order at the counter, and the food comes to you after. Water is self serve, there's paper towels, and extra BBQ sauce at your table - it's all very convenient and everything was just right here. 

We went with 1/2 lb brisket, pulled pork with sides of potato salad and quinoa salad. It also came with some pickles, onions, jalapenos, and some slices of bread - which I really appreciate because it completed the meal. 

We were big fans of the pulled pork which was juicy and succulent although it was a tad on the salty side. The brisket on the other hand was a bit confusing. I'd say it was somewhat disappointing. It was definitely tender and broke down easily but was more dry than I expected - which masked a lot of qualities of the brisket. The flavor is much more subtle than the pulled pork which was good. I'm a really big fan of their BBQ sauce which has a really nice sweetness to it and ended up almost drinking it because it was just that good!

The sides were also decent (especially the quinoa salad - a very good healthy option to make by the way!). It was really balanced with the ingredients in there but the potato salad on the other hand was more acidic than I expected. But I suppose when you eat everything together, it balances out. The portion size could have a been a bit better for the potato salad, but the quinoa is fine as it was packed.

Overall I really like this place and would definitely recommend it if you're in the area.",2017-07-31 01:52:08

My husband and I agreed that this year we would swap our yearly trek to Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Great Arizona Picnic for Devoured. I have heard wonderful things about it.

Now it has chains and crappy over-hyped restaurants. Is it still fun? Yeah, kind of. If you want to get drunk and people watch and you have a lot of money to do it. One year my friend and I counted the boob jobs. I think we got up to 38... But I digress...

At first we were scared off by the ticket price of Devoured. Then we added up how much we typically spent at the GAP. It turned out to be less and it is in all inclusive price.

When we first got in I was overwhelmed and giddy. It was pretty much a blur after that but lots of fun. Good vegetarian choices, LOTS of wine and booze tastings, Roger Clyne and his delicious tequila, and way less annoying people than GAP. And useful too!

That's okay when places like Acai To the T appear on the scene.  Only recently opened, this place seems to know what it wants to be:  your neighborhood shop to get your Acai or Pitaya fix in the form of bowls, smoothies and juice.  So far it's been a great experience.  Go in and you'll find yourself in a simple place with a trendy air about it, and a very nice staff.  The ladies who work behind the counter are super personable and do a good job of remembering returning customers.

The bowls come in two sizes, but don't be fooled, the regular size is filling.  You have a number of menu choices for what goes in your bowl.  If you're in the mood for a smoothie, you can also go that route, along with a number of additives to enhance your order.  The ladies will also let you substitute fruits on top if you need to, or prefer.

The only odd thing about the store is where the menu is located and where to order.  Don't sweat it:  walk in, go to the back, look at the large menu, then proceed to the register to order and pay.  No big deal.  They'll work out the signage and flow, I'm sure.

You can enjoy your order right there or take it to go.  Just grab a lid from the counter if you need to bolt.  If your plan is to sit a while, keep in mind there's very limited seating inside the shop.

If you like Acai or Pitaya, give this place a try.  If you're looking for a recommendation, try the Berry Good or Rise and Shine bowls.  I think your mouth will be happy!",2015-12-22 18:18:33

Esther's cuisine: All the carbs are made fresh in house and wow could we tell.  I had the Rigatoni Carbonara and it was delicious.  That grana panada cheese and egg yolk are a great combo to match up with the Guanciale pork.  My ahh dood's Lasagnette nero was tasty, I love the truffle action and that dish brought it.  The Branzino fish was offered that night and it was prepped perfectly.  The preserved lemon that was in the herb fettucini was a taste I've never tried before and worked well.  We grabbed a side of meatballs/polpette for fun and they were yum and large enough to share.

Esther's Ambiance:  The clean Industrial look with plenty of wood throughout the room keeps it casually classy.  A black and white beach mural on the wall really pops and is visually pleasing.  The tables are close to each other but not too close as to take away from the intimacy.  The bar with the blue wall takes helps take care of drinkers and single diners.

The location is deep in the Arts district downtown and is a fine addition to the area. Reservations are highly recommended because the word is out already on how great this place is.

Since I wasn't going to get my annual chicken parmesan in Vegas this year, I thought I'd give theirs a try, with a side of greek salad and a baked potato.  The salad was lightly dressed, a nice opening to the meal, and everyone got a fresh hot and fluffy breadstick with butter.  The chicken was a nice large piece of juicy meat, not overly-breaded with generous sauce that included little meatballs!  The cheese was a good portion too, definitely went well with the chicken.  It was delicious.  The green beans were a little overcooked for me, and there was some zucchini as well which was nice.  The baked potato was HUGE with loads of sour cream (my favourite topping naturally).  For dessert I tried their tiramisu which had a nice light coffee flavour but a unique maple-twist to it.  I swear they used something maple in it because that really stood out in the aftertaste and it was amazing!

It has a selection of food to please most. Burgers, hot dogs, gyros, and some Mexican food too. Very eclectic on the inside. Kind of a mish-mash. I ordered a burger combo and asked for no bun, telling the order taker I had my own bun (yes crazy, I know but I'm gluten free and so few places offer a bun for me). When my order was ready, they had not only wrapped my burger in lettuce, which I did not ask for, but they had cut it in half, also not requested. This made putting the burger on my bun a challenge but I managed. I am sure they were trying to accommodate me and be helpful, maybe the order taker did not understand I had my own bun.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The place was dead as it was Sunday but the food was good.  The chicken quesadilla really hit the spot and the buffalo chicken wedge salad was a hit.  Our waitress was cute and friendly and attentive. (maybe because we were one of three customers (I even forgive her transgression of KEEPING MY CHANGE).  

A few notes:
1) Although an Irish Pub, very few items are authentic Irish meals, or even attempts thereon.  Basic Pub Food is what you should expect.
2) Although there are some TV's, not all of them are in direct view so if you come here to watch specific games make sure you sit in the center or pointed at the game you want.

Firstly, I'm in love with their menu - a lengthy list of America's classics and favorites with a few extra non-traditional additions just for good measure. Choosing what to eat at this diner was my biggest challenge of the past week. I eventually settled on the Greek Hobo omelet, which is a delicious mix of gyro ingredients that comes complete with a side of Tzatziki sauce to go with the ensemble. Add in the amazingly fresh hash browns and heavily buttered toast, and I was served up quite the feast. And I devoured it like the happy glutton I was!

Not only did the food leave me happy, but keep in mind that my group was a group of over 10 people - all of our food was at our table within 15 minutes of ordering. And based on the comments of ""that's delicious"" that I heard all around, that speed is all the more impressive due to the quality of the food that was produced.

I will definitely make the trek out to Ritters again in the future - especially now that I know that they have their own parking lot, as parking is the biggest reason I don't venture to this part of town very frequently. I need to try a few more things that caught my eye on their awesome menu.

Admittedly preferring my macarons of the crisp, light variety popularized by Herme or Laduree it was perhaps a matter of personal taste that I found the shell of each cookie a bit harder than I'd have liked but with an excellent break quickly melting away to smooth flavors it was the fillings that truly shined, the butter cream especially impressive and the sort of thing I could definitely see highlighting one of the bakery's custom cakes.",2013-12-30 18:01:32

I haven't stepped into a Harvey's in a while and even though Harvey's is technically a fast food restaurant (which I don't usually post about), I think this juicy hamburger warrants a post from me.

We ordered the Original Harvey's burger combo and an extra Original Burger for me.  I remember advertisements in the past where Harvey's boasted the fact that they have all their burgers customizable and you can add whatever toppings you want on top of the burger.  I added pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, relish, mustard to my cheeseburger and it was so juicy.  The beef patty was so tender!  I was impressed.",2018-01-12 03:23:31

If you don't care about being at a fancy place and want grimy, tasty, extremely inexpensive food,  this is the place to be.
If this was a rating based purely on food I would give it 5 stars because its amazing. There is just so much variety.  Chinese food, bbq chinese food, korean food, japanese food, bubble tea, drinks, icecream, bakeries, are all there.


The reason why I'm leaving a 3 star review is because its not a fancy type restaurant.
The place has great food, but the service and the venue is complete crap.  There are flies constantly annoying me.

But other than that.  I have been coming back to this place for years.

As my tech was working on my toes she noticed the ingrown toenail from hell I took care of the previous night. She advised that she would clean it up a bit more and that the next morning I put neosporin on it to help heal it faster. Since I got two different types of nail polish but wanted them to match, she did her best to find a normal nail polish to go with the gel. She had found one but said it wasn't an exact match, the nail tech next to her doing my friend's pedi got up and found the exact match. Now that's what I call going above and beyond for a customer.

LOVE THIS MALL.  its probably one of my favorite malls in N. America. Of course it has pretty much every store you can think of.

It also connects to PATH (Toronto's underground shopping and business area).  Not very many underground places in the States.
Many restaurants are connected in PATH also.

I love how the train connects right to the mall so I don't have to drive or park anywhere. Can get  a lil too crowded sometimes.
IMO, it out ranks Houston Galleria, Dallas galleria, and Glendale Galleria.  Well, i guess I havent been to many big malls in N. America lol.  Maybe thats why I like the Eaton Centre so much.

Overall the mall is very clean and a nice scenery part of downtown.",2008-12-16 09:46:36

Whether your goals are to lose weight, hypertrophy, or muscle gain, this gym has everything you really need. You name it, this gym has it.  But what I can't understand is the low ratings. First things first, this gym membership is pretty damn affordable.  I workout at multiple gyms and this one is by far the least expensive.  Second, this gym really has everything that you need to reach your fitness goals.  This gym may not be as big or equipped as an LVAC and I get it.  Some people need a variety of machines to get a good workout.  Not me.  All it takes to keep me happy at a gym is a few dumbbells, a power rack, some 45's, and a bench. My only issue with this gym is during the hours of 5 PM and 9 PM on a weekday, especially on a Monday.  This is when EoS gets packed and almost all of the benches are taken.

We started with the anti-pasta dish.  This contained a baked ricotta that was the star of my evening.  I could have eaten an entire plate of that alone.  So yummy!  The other items on the dish were yummy too - Giardiniera, roasted red peppers, marinated olives, caper berries and prosciutto di Parma.

This was followed by the Rigatoni alla Scamorza - Rigatoni with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, peas, roasted and salted pistachio nuts in a cream sauce with Reggiano, fresh ground black pepper and parsley.  The portion was on the smaller side for a pasta, but it was plenty filling and I actually could have eaten less than the whole thing (which I ate because it was so good).  It was really nice combination of flavors and textures that I would definitely order again.  

Stuffed as I was after dinner, I couldn't skip the dessert, so I took home a piece of the lemoncello cheesecake.  A little too lemony for me, but probably the best textured cheesecake I have ever had.",2017-01-16 15:51:18

Here's the scoop. Three of us ordered fried chicken. As I watched one friend tuck into a drum stick i noticed a lot of red. I asked him if his chicken was ok. He said he thought so - only a little under cooked. I balked at the news. My chicken was fine, but I also thought a trick of the light may have made it look more red than it actually was. They use a lot of tungsten lighting so everything is bathed in a warm glow.

My other friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich. She cut it in half and immediately dropped her knife. It was about 75% raw. Basically breaded and fried and served raw. I almost spat out my chicken. Luckily she's in the habit of cutting her sandwiches and burgers in half - otherwise a mouthful of raw chicken breast.

I alerted the Manager and he promptly took the plate away. Our server came and apologized profusely (not his fault). They brought her an alternate shrimp Po Boy on her request very quickly which was good.

Still, I've worked as an undergrad for years in restaurants and this is a nightmare for the kitchen and overall reputation of a place. Raw chicken is so dangerous. The Manager should have come and spoken with us and at the least comped my friend's meal. He did nothing beyond remove the plate and made the server deal with it. Lame!

If my other friend ends up sick (the guy who ate the red looking drumstick) then we know what the deal is.

While I think Museum Tavern has great potential I can't get the image of raw chicken out of my head. And the way the manager dealt with the issues implies that it's not a big deal since we caught the mistake before being poisoned. Toronto's food scene is rich, eclectic and competitive. I'll not be coming back here again. For those who dine - check your food before eating.",2015-04-03 04:50:38

I started going to this place for their dim sum lunch on weekends, because I like to have dim sum, especially when served on carts being pushed around the floor. I really enjoy their pork and shrimp dumplings, and the sauteed garlic beans are awesome too, though they don't always have them.

Last week, for the first time we went here for dinner. Wow, it's like a whole other world in the evenings. While the place is jam-packed for weekend brunch with a wait almost always, for dinner they are always hardly filled. When we got there, only two other tables were occupied. The head chef came over and started talking to us about the menu and soon we were having a conversation about how everyone makes hotpot differently. It was a very insightful conversation. He told us what ingredients go in the chili oil that they have (there are 10 different things in there, btw). He was extremely friendly and enthusiastic, and patiently answered all of our questions.

My boyfriend ordered the orange beef, I had the Eight Treasure Hotpot and our friend had the vegetarian Ho Fun. I think the Ho Fun was my favorite (yes, he let me try some). However, my hotpot was delicious too, as was my boyfriend's orange beef. Btw, when I say hotpot, I don't mean food that's cooked at the table in front of us. Their hotpot is basically a soupy medley of veggies, meat and tons of flavor, brought to the table in a really really hot pot. Also, let me warn you about their serving sizes... They are LARGE. The hotpot lasted me three meals including the in-house dinner. My boyfriend finished his orange beef, but that's because he dined on it without the rice so we had a big bowl of rice to take home, and our friend had some ho fun left over too. 

The prices are amazing... This dinner cost less than what our lunch there costs, although we do seem to lose track of how much we are ordering when there's all this mouth-watering food being pushed around us. I can't wait to go here again, although next time I know what I'm getting. One huge order of Ho Fun, baby... And all to myself!

PS: Their pan fried noodles are delicious too.",2013-01-29 20:52:27

I arrived, was the only customer inside, and there were no employees at the counter. I waited for a minute and someone finally came out and took my order. Like I said, a Reuben to go, nothing crazy. Immediately after I ordered, a dad and his two sons came in and ordered. I waited about five minutes, and somehow their THREE sandwiches came out before my one. Also while waiting I noticed that the floor was pretty nasty. Discarded Cheetos and shredded lettuce were littered under almost every table. Maybe they had a lunch rush and had not had time to clean up, or maybe they only sweep once a week, who knows?

I continued to wait and overheard the two employees discussing how happy they were that they were only open another three hours. I mean, I'm no fan of working on Sundays, but keep it at a lower volume so customers can not hear it.

I was pleased with the sandwich, but overall pretty disappointed in the experience.",2017-01-16 02:26:32

We dined at Cooper today for lunch, have been wanting to try since our takeout experience. We were quickly seated, though the parking lot and indoor seating were packed. We were seated in the extension in the front. A big plus not available in most Indian food places, ice water yay! I docked a star because the wait was ridiculously long for our order to come out, over 30 min! Not great if work is strict with you about your lunch break. 

Finally, the food did come out. My favorite was the saag paneer $9, it was the most flavorful dish out of all our food. The spinach and paneer were plentiful. I'd get this again, but can't say the same for the other items. Dhal makhani side at $7, not worth it. Every expensive for the portion you get and it was not as flavorful as I had hoped. I've gotten better dhal makhani out of smaller less trendy places. The chicken tikka for $11, I don't think I would purchase for lunch again. I'd have to stick with takeout dinner on this... The gravy was abnormally very watery and had an underwhelming flavor compared to the takeout we previously ordered. I'm guessing they have a big pot of gravy premade and then add protein/veggies as needed. Which is totally fine if you can pull of flavor and consistency, neither or these were there today. 

I'd come back for the saag paneer at lunch, everything else is probably go dinner service. Tho I recommend going with traditional dishes, the fusion dishes may leave you disappointed if you are already experienced with indian food.",2016-10-14 20:23:00

My friends and I were seated right away, and the first thing I noticed about the place was how it's actually pretty small. It looks big on the outside because of the patio I think but no big deal because it didn't feel like a squeeze. Wouldn't really suggest it for a big group though. The dim lighting and bench seating make it interesting. 

The service was decent, no complaints there. The food was great. I always say that there are no fries and dip better than the St. Louis fries + creamy fill but the waffle fries + creamy dill at Crazy Wings may just be my new fave.

Walking in, we first had misgivings due the weathered and aged decor: beer-hall type seating, cavernous interior, banquettes with split padding, old and beaten paint... you get the point... but.. we'd read the reviews and a friend of ours recommended the place so we went boldly forward.  

Note to self: largely empty buffet restaurant probably never implies a good experience or fresh food... we both had this warning bell going off, but again, silence it and tried to give the place a fair shake.

The salad bar was ok... acceptable but not stellar and gave us hope.

The into the entres.. uh oh... the ""steam tables"" were keeping the food ""warm"", certainly not ""hot"".  The food on the ""grill section"" was just _barely_ above room temperature.  After the 1st tasting we nearly pulled the chain and left, but neither of us was crazy hungry and we were there, so we bravely went on.

There were serving plates on the ""hot"" tables that were empty and looked like they'd been that way for a while.  The single person from the kitchen was out in the dining room having a beer, so this probably wasn't getting fixed any time soon.  We gave up on entrees and decided to go for dessert.

The baclava was the type you buy in a grocery store (read: cheap and  unappealing), most of the ""cakes"" were in need of replacement (picked over, smushed and unappealing), there were huge parts of the dessert bar that weren't stocked (perhaps a total of 6 desserts excluding icecream).  The best part of the entire meal was the crap barely-frozen Chapman's ice cream (4 flavours) that was available.

I've been to quite a few buffets and can pretty honestly say this was the ABSOLUTE WORST buffet experience of my life.  We went there for my birthday, so my ""meal"" was free but the $25 we paid for Kim's meal (including tax and tip) really seemed like far too much for the quality of the food served.  

Will NOT buy again. OMG. Total EPIC FAIL.",2012-10-15 00:52:06

We went for lunch on a Monday afternoon and the place wasn't that crowded. We were sat promptly and our server came to ask if we had ever been to the restaurant before. Nope.... That we haven't. He explained the menu items and the favorites everyone orders. There was also a three course special they were offering, but that sounded like too much.

Boyfriend and I ordered the Mesa Margarita and it came out in a heart beat. This is def one of the smoothest best margaritas that I've had, but I thought it needed some ""kick"". Figured it would come out with a chipotle salted rim or something. I mean it IS Bobby Flay. But overall really happy with my drink.

As soon as the waiter came back we ordered. Boyfriend got the Salmon and I got the Mesa Burger. It was really tough for me ordering off this menu, because all the menu items are so complex which is why I guess many people love it here. But I'm more of a plain Jane, so the burger seemed fail proof. After ordering we were given a basket of bread with blue corn muffins, raisin bread, and a jalapeno bread. Jalapeno was right up my alley, but the rest weren't hitting the spot. Not a fan of blue corn, not a fan of raisins, so that's really MY fault. Shrugs.

After the good components of the bread were gone, and the margarita gave me that nice little buzz everyone needs when they're in Vegas eating lunch, we waited... and waited.. and waited....

A family of 5 set down next to us about 10 minutes after we arrived, and got their food well before us. Actually finished it before ours came out. Another couple ordered after us as well and were gone before our food came out. We spent a good 1.5 hours there, and most of that was waiting on our food. Something like 45 minutes? The server came out a few times letting us know that it would be 'right out'.... Not sure what happened. Maybe someone lost the ticket.. but I think the server was pretty irresponsible for not checking with the back after the 20 minute wait mark.

All in all I think this is a great little get away in Vegas. If my pallet was more up to par, I would have enjoyed my food more. Horseradish mayo = ewwwie. My boyfriend's salmon did not have any sides with it, and for $22 I expected more from his plate. My favorite part was my chipotle salted french fries.

It lacks depth and creative choices for brunch options. There were three fritattas and some omelet options and of course waffles and pancakes. I was just searching for something more creative.  It was a little heavier on the lunch side than brunch. 

I got the chicken and waffle sandwich. I had issues with it and had to send it back. I'm not one for sending food back unless it's just wrong. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and desperately needed some salt.  The waffles were rock hard, you could Crack a tooth on them. I was with a large party and 3 of us hard waffles and we sent them all back. Both times my sandwich didn't have the honey&hot sauce and ligonberry jam on it as described on the menu. When I asked about the jam, no one seemed to know or realized that the jam was supposed to be on the sandwich. And I never did get the honey & hot sauce combo. 

The Greek fries were great. I actually paired them with their homemade tzatziki sauce, which I was charged $1 extra for a small ramekin of.

But so far so good. For $8.29 I got scrambled eggs, bacon and 3 pancakes. Very good bargain for quality they dish out. I really liked the pancakes! The Truffle Mocha was okay. They charged additional for soy milk. There's only cinnamon rolls and croissant listed for pastries in the drive-thru, but the do have cookies, and whatever is in the pastry case for sale. Everything was packed in sturdy plastic containers and was still warm when I arrived home. 

Service thru drive thru was quick. Less than 5 minutes. Then again at 6AM, I was the only customer there. The pathway for  drive-thru is narrow and might be a tad difficult for larger vehicles to navigate, so drive slow and carefully!

I ordered the New York Strip Steak, which came with the tastiest lentil soup ever. it's pureed, which I wasn't expecting -- so it has a smooth consistency, and really is delicious.

They are now getting deliveries of these hard to find gourmet donuts a few times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sat and Sun (don't know if I should have saidi that because I don't want competition).

Be warned that it is very tricky getting donuts here because they sell out really quick.  How quick you ask?  Well they open at 8am and by 10:30 on some days they are completely sold out.  Now mind you, they don't order alot.  They get a few varieties and it is always changing but they usually don't get more than 20 in total.

Filled donuts are  $4.25 a piece, lemon merringue is not bad, the cocunut cream pie didn't leave me wowed.  The donut is very soft (but I suggest you eat it shortly after you get it.  If you eat it later in the day it can taste stale).  But the cream and filling was tasteless and waste of calories IMO.

Only downside to this place is that they do not have boxes if you are just buying a few donuts.  They were going to cram it into a small paper bag (suitable for bagels) which would have been terrible given the layer of cream on the top.

I wanted to get my cat nuetered and they quoted me a fair price over the phone. I got into the office and I was advised that the price that was quoted over the phone was a low end price. They advised me that they would not give him an IV or some of the other things they didn't consider necessary but they would strongly recommend it because my cat could die if there is a complication. The vet assistant advised me that she buys the extra package because she wants to make sure her pets are safe. This felt like an entire sales presentation. When you are playing with someone's emotions over their animal and trying to extort more money from them it is extremely unprofessional. I walked out and would never do business with a place that doesn't put my animals safety as its first priority.

There were plenty of event staff around to point you in the right direction. There was a metal detector that I had to walk through before entering. There were plenty of concession stands to chose from. Most are cash only which helps keep the lines moving. Bathrooms were spacious which also helps with long lines. I didn't see one single usher once I started making my way to my seat which was unusual. The seats... they are very wide even for a large caboose to feel comfortable in for 2 hours. Also a big plus.. there was ample space for my legs. I didn't bump my shins into the seat in front of me once during the entire night-score!

Scored a 1 BR suite that had a living room AND a screen that came down that also turned into a projector for the tv. Sweet set up for the kitchen as well. Makes sense since these were condos that didn't sell and got converted into hotel rooms. 

Here's the downside: the service SUCKS. The funny thing is, this room was comped because the first time my boyfriend stayed here and got such horrible service that they comped our room this time (hey, you can't turn down a free room). This time, they didn't clean our room. We got back to our room around 5PM, saw house keepers outside and assumed they'd clean our room. When they didn't (and left!), we called customer service who said they would send someone to clean our room. We leave and come back around 1AM and our  room hasn't been touched at all. We call down to customer service and they said that our room got a note that said we ""refused service"". What the hell? Finally they send someone up after 20 minutes (poor lady) and we don't get back to our room until 2AM. That's pretty crappy way to end the night, especially if you've been out all day. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but cmon when most people stay at a hotel, they aren't expecting much. In fact, the only thing you expect is for them to clean your room. That's it. If you can't even do that, that's pretty much a fail in my book.

Dim Sum still excellent, although limited in selection.  Salad bar is good and my GF said that their spinach/mandarin orange/walnut/feta salad was outstanding!  They also had what they called pork canitas on the menu yesterday and that was sliced and served from the carving station.  I thought that this was an excellent entree since it was not the typical shredded carnitas that you generally get.  And I believe they used boneless pork shoulder which left some strips of fat within each slice of meat, with the carnitas seasoning generously rubbed on the exterior of the meat, just like dry rubbed BBQ beef brisket.

I turned to my trusty yelp search to look for places near-by.  We mapped ourself to this place, a dim-lit restaurant in a tiny strip mall.  I think it was next door to a convenience store?

I thought yelp had led me wrong... it was an unassuming interior, and I worried about the order.  But it was all just useless worry, because it was an awesome dinner.  I ordered the Korean ""hwe dup bap.""  It's basically like a chirashi, except it's with Korean chili paste (go chu jang).  It was very good, and the sushi was great quality.

As far as the sausages, which is what this place is known for, it's probably the best in town. I also love the bun they use which I believe they get from a place on College called Golden Wheat. After going here, I find it hard to buy anything from anywhere else even though it will be cheaper.

Their fries are really tasty as well especially those cooked in duck fat and they give you a pretty healthy portion for what you pay for.

If you're a microbrewery beer connoisseur, you're in for a treat as they have an extensive selection of draft and bottled varieties.

I'm not sure why they even have a valet, especially on a weekday night when they aren't so busy. Anyway, that started the night oddly. Then, as the BF was parking, I went in to the restaurant and there was no one at the host stand. I waited for a few minutes before anyone came by. The place wasn't that busy....not awesome. Then, when the host did come he awkwardly asked me if I wanted to go to the bar while waiting for the BF instead of being seated.....so I did.

When you walk in, the charming atmosphere makes you feel like you're part of the neighbourhood, and when you look at the display cases, you'll see the usual staples like almond croissants and other types of bread, along with more upscale fair like a decorated Japanese cheese cake.

I had the Mont Blanc pastry which looks like a you guessed it, mountain of chestnut paste, with a cream interior on a cake base, topped with chocolate and a whole chestnut.  The care and precision that they assemble their pastries shows that they really put a lot of effort into each piece.

To start off, the food was not as great as it used to be.  The scallops had a sour after taste to them which I attributed to being in the smoker way too long, and they needed a better sear.  The wild boar meatballs needed more seasoning. The duck confit relleno was pretty good, but the batter was oily and fell right off the chile.

Next off, we got seated in the brightly lit room to the left as you walk in.  The room resembles nothing of the ambiance of the rest of the place.  I was turned off by the faux wall artwork.  The waitress seemed rush every time she came to us, and it showed with her missing our mushroom pan fry order.

It's hard to explain what it was like being there.  Have you ever gone to a restaurant, and you just wanted to leave after being there for 10 minutes?  Bad service, so so food, and being in a room that reminded me of the olive garden leads to wholly bad experience.

This was in so many ways an awful experience for our party of 4 and very embarrassing since we were trying to show our family a good time and enjoy a nice dinner. First off, when we came in we asked if we could have a booth but the server said they had none and took us to a table. As we sat down we noticed a booth was indeed available across the way but another party was sat there just a minute later and we didn't have time to ask if we could move. OK no biggie. 2nd, it took FOREVER for someone to come to the table, once they did they simply said are you ready? Really? No apology, no introduction to who you are or a welcome? Nope, none of that. OK fine, of course we already knew what we were having since we had forever to look at the menu. Our food came about 30min later and it was good BUT no one ever came to check on us to see how everything was, if we needed anything (which we did). Fast forward to the lovely way our meal ended. We asked for boxes and they came with boxes and a check. We were going to ask for their dessert menu but I guess at 9:30pm on a Friday evening they were already getting ready to leave. It truly felt like they wanted us out, everyone out so the staff could go home. We saw kitchen staff hanging out in the dining room looking around as we were chatting, obviously they wanted us out. Now let me explain, I've got a background in restaurants over a decade of experience. I would not sit around for hours after closing while staff is waiting on us. I'm telling you it was 9:30pm, there was a party of 8 right next to us still dining and another couple of tables. They all stared us down. Needless to say, no dessert and we paid the check. Also, I almost forgot to mention how the staff was mopping with Fabuloso (I know the smell very well) while we were eating our meal. Not once we were done, but while we were still eating. Do you know that it's not the best idea to clean with chemicals while your guests are still dining? I will not give this restaurant another chance. They had many chances and missed every opportunity to make things right. We did not enjoy our dinner and there are simply too many other options all over Phoenix & Tempe to have good Thai food with great service.

We ordered the sourdough bread as an appetizer, it came with a side of butter in olive oil. It was amazing, it was actually the highlight of our meal. The olive oil was so... olive-y. I decided to play it safe and order the carbonara since all the pictures of it on here looked great. For $17 it was kind of bland. When I order carbonara I usually switch out the peas for capers to add some saltiness, but when I asked if they were able to do that the waiter just said no. Why the 4 star rating, you ask?

We each had the tasting menu to celebrate one of my milestone birthdays with some wine. Everything that came out was a party in my mouth from the bread cart all the way to the dessert. I won't bore you with all the details here that will be regurgitating everything else people have already said.

the overall feeling was that so much focus was placed on everything from the limo ride to the presentation of the food, that it was at times distracting from the real reason we were there - the taste of the food. these distractions were the good distractions though. i enjoyed feeling regal for one night. the bad distractions though, were a little annoying and less the fault of the restaurant than the patrons. 

there were so many patrons there that night that didn't follow the dress code, or lamely so if that was their weak attempt at trying to dress up. i get that some people are ballers who want to be on the dl but the last thing i want is to feel like i'm dining at a las vegas restaurant vs. joel robuchon. if joel robuchon was in any other city, people would dress up way more to come here. maybe it was just an off day but it was still annoying to see slobby people. it really brings down the ambiance. secondly, the tables were too damn close to each other. thankfully, the couple we were sitting within earshot to, basically rubbing elbows with, were in their 3rd to last dish when we sat there so they were gone by the time we reached halfway through the meal. still, it's really annoying to sit that close to other patrons when they're in their  casual attire, talking about super annoying things when i'm trying to have a moment. the meal is too expensive here to be ruined by stupid reasons. 

disclaimer: this was my second choice restaurant after not getting a reservation at the french laundry so i may have been in an off mood. the food was really delicious, just nothing really stood out in a way that i would gush about it, the way i do about akelarre (san sebastian, spain), arzak (san sebastian, spain), le garde robe (paris), les papilles (paris), vandermeersch (paris), seongbukdong (koreatown).

I ordered food for lunch and got the chicken shawarma wrap. The gentleman preparing my wrap was extremely friendly and attentive to my order/needs.  He genuinely seems to love what he does and the service he offers.

It was my first time at this location and I just told him to put everything on the wrap! There were so many flavours happening, but it all worked incredibly well together. There was hummus, hot sauce, tahini and garlic sauce, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, pickled beets, tabouleh, onions and an amazing cabbage salad. The best part was of course the chicken.  These ingredients provided the sweet, spicy, tart and aromatic flavours I crave. I can't stress enough how UNREAL the seasoning and herbs tasted.

One thing I will warn people: this is way more complex than traditional shawarma. Some may be disappointed because it does not taste exactly like the simpler, garlicy version. But, you can always opt out of the fancier toppings!

The best (and maybe most unfortunate) part was the size. This thing was the size of a football. I am a small person, and there was no way I could eat this wrap like it was intended. I had to cut it in half a use a fork and knife. But, this did not take away from the awesome deliciousness that is Shawarma Land.",2015-05-28 19:37:28

She litereally knows everyone who walks through the door and greets them with open arms.  She is the epitomy of customer service.  We love her!!!  Make sure if you visit and run into her let her know you heard about her on Yelp!  ;)

Last nights dinner - on the patio mind you - (Love) starting with crab wontons which are always perfection sitting on top of a plate of a sweet and sour kind of sauce.  They are to die for.  The BF had to have the edemame which for some reason at this place they always seem to be on steroids!  They are huge.  It is served with a little cup of sea salt that you can sprinkle on as you see fit.  For the entrees BF had mongolian beef with steamed rice.  Very similar to PF....aws flav.  I usually try to steal a few bites when he's not looking.  I ordered the seseme chicken but instead of fried I asked for their ""stalk velvet"" which is a healthy version of cooking.  I think its kind of pan seared.  You can order most dishes this way but you have to ask for it special.  Their brown rice is alway cooked to perfection.  I dont know why it is that hard to cook brown rice but you'd be suprised.

I've come here twice now, and both times, I've been knocked off my feet from how outstanding Dressler's is, both to its commitment to fine dining, and the way the staff treats you like an honored guest. Really, they do. Nothing I hate more than being greeted by a surly or condescending host/hostess that shoots you that smug ""You're Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?""** look, while giving you grief over your reservation  - actually, we were 10 minutes late, but they weren't too crowded, so they sat us immediately.

Last night was our second visit to Dressler's. We'd been looking forward to coming back after our first visit, which was wonderful in its own right. To our delight, we were offered a table outside. Let me paint the picture for you: you're facing the greenway off Metropolitan Avenue, you have an unfettered view of uptown Charlotte from where you've been seated - and watching the light show on the Duke Tower is truly wonderful - and you couldn't ask for a nicer August evening, free from oppressive humidity. In other words, the perfect spot for a fantastic meal and some people watching.

We were greeted by our waiter, who identified himself as Johnny Utah***. Seriously. Helpful, attentive, exactly what you want in a waiter.

The wedge salad is a staple in any fine dining establishment, and their Wedgie is no exception. Yeah, it's a wedge salad, but it's a phenomenal wedge salad. I also sampled their grilled sausage, accompanied by some very tasty arugula. Outstanding.

For our main course, my wife opted for the ribeye with a side of steamed spinach. The mark of a quality eating establishment can be narrowed down to a simple question: can you grill a good steak? Of course Dressler's can! When you can cut a steak with a fork, you know they're giving you top-quality meats, grilled by someone who knows how to grill a ribeye. She loves their ribeye; it just might be her favorite in town.

I went for the seared Mahi, accompanied by gnocchi and a light lemon vinaigrette sauce. Perfect, in its preparation, its size, and its presentation. Best yet, I hadn't even been in the mood for Mahi, but if it looks good on the menu, then I know it's going to taste even better.

Finally, yes, what you've heard about Dressler's cheesecakes is absolutely true. Best cheesecake in Charlotte, no question about it. Game over, pal. Dressler's cheesecake is the undisputed heavyweight champion. So good was their featured cheesecake - Oreo Cheesecake! - that my wife called it ""pure, concentrated evil that'll make you lose your load."" No kidding. I would have ordered a slice of my own, and given myself into such delicious evil.

You really can't ask for a better dining experience, without the pomp and pretense. Dressler's is fine dining without the snooty (SNOOTY?) or snobby (SNOBBY?) atmospherics.****

When a restaurant is better the second time around, you know you've found a keeper. Dressler's is now on my list of Must-Eat Places. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.

However, you're not reading this review to find out about the customer service.

The menu was varied and was much better than standard bar fare.  We tried the wings (a lb is about 8 wings) which were ok.  I like others better, but these weren't bad.  I had the salmon salad which was really good.  Not necessarily the freshest, but cooked really well and tasty.

The chicken sandwich was very juicy & tasty.  Skins on fries aren't my favorite.  They're saved a bit by being skinny ones.  They could save them a bit more if they crisped them up a bit more.

It's basically the local version of Panera, but without the bakery - which is not necessarily a bad thing, considering how bad for me that bakery at Panera is...

My friend and I both had a Pick-2 Combo when we ordered; I opted for wedding soup and a panini, and he a chicken sandwich and mac and cheese. I actually kind of wish I'd ordered the mac and cheese, because it looked very, very good - not to speak badly about my own soup, which was pretty darn good though lacking in a few extra meatballs which would have made the mix perfect. But then, I'll forgive even this considering that I love a good tomato and mozzarella panini, which is exactly what I got.

Keeping with the Panera comparison, while the sandwich and side options are absolutely delicious, don't expect to have a lot in terms of drink options: water, diet soda, or super sugary teas and regular sodas are all you get, which was a little disappointing. I even debated driving down the road afterward to go to Panera and get a giant cup of hot tea - the non-sugary kind. Also, seating here is fairly limited if you're looking for an actual table, so be prepared to sit on a stool at a high table if need be - that's what happened to my friend and I.

Where was I going to get my Korean friend chicken? Korean pizza? The cheesy corn??? Well you might not be able to get all those here, but all is not lost.

I had a lot of reservations coming here, but it was a birthday dinner and I hadn't had Korean food in a while and was having major cravings. At first, I was a bit miffed by the prices, but all that soon melted away. We ordered family style with the pork belly, hot stone bulgogi bibimbap and budae jjigae (army style hot pot). The portions here are gigantic! The bibimbap is definitely made for at least 2 maybe 3 people, and the soup is made for more like 4-6. The food was also very good. Good level of spicy and weren't stingy on the sauces. Ban chan was also decent, although I thought the Kim chi was ok. Food got an A for tasty, and very reasonable prices...plus complimentary fresh fruit dessert!

I also enjoyed some drinks like makgeolli (banana is surprisingly a very delicious flavor recommended by our server) and hite. I was hoping for baekseju but alas, there was none. Service was excellent - very thorough, attentive and friendly.

Overall, a pretty solid place for Korean food and drinks in the Phoenix area with very reasonable prices.

 I got a price list since it seemed to be a mystery online... I do not know how to cook duck but that does not seem to be an issue here. There are a few recipes you can get online or in the store to be able to create a decent meal from duck. 

King Cole duck has fresh air chilled duck all different cuts ie) whole duck, half duck, duck eggs, duck burgers, frozen duck, even duck tongue(eesh) (my opinion) . You can even purchase pre seasoned duck. 

I know its not for everyone. But I must say the prices are very decent if you eat duck and its all fresh no injected gmo type stuff. 

I will say that for a whole duck you can buy a package with six whole ducks for about 70.00 dollars. A friend tells me that is a ""duckin"" good deal.

While I was there the environment was great, it definitely lived up to it's name as a kind of flower-child-meadow-old barn feel. It was a big space. 

The mushrooms were big and meaty, and the tofu was well cooked and flavorful. My number one complaint is that the broth was way too spicy for me. I like spicy food, I like sriracha in my pho, but this was out of control. The jalapeño slices are cooked in the broth, and it didn't bring flavor, it just brought some really intense, tip of your tongue heat. It hurt to eat. It was so spicy it affected my speech. It was so spicy it still hurts now, an hour later. I can only imagine how spicy the spicy salmon nabemono is, if they bothered to label that as spicy.

Plaza Midwood is kicking and Soul Gastrolounge is no exception. Soul is located on the second level, so don't try to go to the front door. With the doors opening at 5pm and them not taking reservations I suggest arriving early if you want to eat at a decent time. Soul is also on the app ""Nowait"", where you can put your name on the list only if there is a wait. 

Arriving at 6:30pm on a Friday night it was almost an hour wait if we wanted to eat inside. We sat on the enclosed balcony. This area also has heat lamps and overlooks the skyline, not a bad deal. I wanted to sit inside because it was our first time at Soul, but waiting over an hour was not going to fly. 

Libations
A lot of their specialty drinks are on tap which I found interesting. The Feeling Squirrley was an awesome beverage, but I don't think it was worth $13. 
Cucumber Mule was light refreshing and had just the kick it needed. 

Grubs
Keep in mind these are tapas //small plates. You should share with folks, but when you have a veggie and a meat eater together it's a little hard. We opted to share a sushi and then get our own small plate. The portions are decently sized for being tapas.
+Dirty South Nachos, the pickled okra was the best part of these. Felt a little overdone and trying too hard for Soul.
+Flatbread- this is the reason I would bring someone to Soul. This flatbread had my taste buds jumping for joy. 
+Dancing Tuna Roll- Seared tuna with avocado are what dreams are made of. This roll made up for the wait, the drinks and the chicken skin nachos. I can't even tell you about it because you'll just have to try it yourself.

I almost fell asleep before even going into my massage! 

I had only had one massage in my life before, so I didn't really know what to ask for.  I'm pretty muscular, and like a semi-firm massage. My masseuse, Brian, was phenomenal! He paid special attention to some of my trouble areas in my back, and after the hour was up I felt like a million bucks! 

My friend's masseuse was Elise.  Unlike me, my friend gets massages very frequently. She gets massages at places like Massage Envy, as well as higher end spas, and she said Elise was BY FAR the best masseuse she's ever had!

I have never had paella before and I was happy to see they had a tropical paella with chicken, shrimp, chorizo, mussel and rice. I am not a fan of mussel so I told the waiter to leave them out so it doesn't go to waste. My mom ordered the black bean, shrimp and jalapeño omelet  but requested just the shrimp and cheese be left in it. The table beside us received their food and it wasn't long before two of the three sent their dishes back. Our plates came out and my moms came out with jalapeños and black beans, so her dish went back to the kitchen to be fixed. The manager was very apologetic and took the omelet off the bill. When mine came out, scallops were mixed in with the paella and I am also not a fan of scallops. I didn't say anything, I just picked around them, but it would have been helpful to know that these were included in the paella as well. I did feel bad wasting them, but I will say that the paella was bursting with flavor. It's a bit on the spicy side, but it was not lacking in the flavor department that's for sure. I would recommend this true Caribbean dish!

And it's not just that they have it, it was some of the best tasting ice cream I've had ever. And I never would have known they didn't use cow's milk. I ended up with some Brown Butter with Lavender Brittle which was delicious. I tried all sorts of things, some were very good, and some were very strange, not bad though. Gotta give them props for taking some risks. Then when I requested a to-go container they don't have any but the girl made me a make-shift one by taping two bowls together inverted and it worked just fine.

On our last trip we started with the malay lobak and it's a tasty table pleaser with its combo pork, tofu, and shrimp options. I have a tendency to almost always order the ginger house salad, forgetting that the dressing has a slight bitterness to it that isn't my favorite... it's completely edible, though.

The service is still wonky. If my server doesn't forget an item they forget about our table, and on the last trip we had a new girl who couldn't answer very many of our questions about the menu.  But, with my improved view of their food, I'll take a few missteps in the service part, and overall they've been efficient when I've needed to get in and out during a lunch hour. I might go back to the sushi at some point, but for now I think there are too many other delish things to order.",2012-01-05 23:23:28

The service was great, the food was good, and the atmosphere was nice.  I can't hate on anything they did, but dinner with my family (two adults and a ten year old) came to almost $70 (with tip).  

Entrees range from $10-13, tap beers are $4 or more, and most of the appetizers are around $10.  It adds up fast, and I don't really think the burger and a smattering of fries I ate tonight was worth the $10 and change it cost.  This place is serving glorified bar food.  It's good bar food, but it's still bar food. And bar food should cost bar food prices.  Burgers, $7 tops.  Appetizers, $4-6, tops.

L'endroit est petit et vite archi-plein et peut accueillir une trentaine de personne.  Réservez à l'avance.  Aux heures d'affluence, le service peut devenir considérablement lent, (ce qui est normal quand on songe qu'il n'y a que deux personnes à s'affairer dans la cuisine...).

Le menu est limité, peut-être 8-9 choix de plats, et manque certainement un peu d'originalité: Après tout, pourquoi se déplacer dans un restaurant si c'est pour se faire servir un poisson grillé ou un steak dans son plus simple appareil ?  Tous les plats sont accompagnés des classiques haricots (délicieux) et de salade (ok).  
Nous avons opté pour le poulet sauce à l'arachide, dont la sauce s'est avérée un peu décevante et le poulet plus ou moins grillé, et pour la brochette de coeur de boeuf mariné, dont la marinade était des plus ordinaire, mais dont la cuisson était parfaite.  En somme, pas de quoi se plaindre mais pas non plus de quoi se réjouir...

On nous l'a préparé sur demande, (comptez une quinzaine de minutes) avec de beaux gros morceaux de poisson (du tilapia ce soir-là), que le citron n'avait cuit qu'à l'extérieur, laissant l'intérieur cru, comme il se doit!  Servi avec des oignons marinés, le tout était à la fois délicat et savoureux, et en plus, servi dans un format gargantuesque.  Vaut définitivement le détour!  Un fait à noter: le ceviche n'est servi qu'en entrée, à 7$, et ne fait pas partie de la table d'hôte.  

En somme, ça reste un resto sympathique, sans prétention.  Le menu est un peu décevant, mais le ceviche, ainsi que le prix, rachètent bien des imperfections.

At first glance it looks like every stereotype you've ever heard about Scottsdale. At second glance you realize that it is, indeed, every stereotype you've heard about Scottsdale. It's a ""Mexican Restaurant"", so when I was there I tried a few of their tacos that were on happy hour. I'm giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good, but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food. More on this later. 

El Hefe has a cool in-table tap system, where you pay at the table and can pour your own beer. When I saw this I liked it a lot, though they only offer two beers, and it's not cheap. After the ""cool"" factor wears off, you realize that you're paying extra to pour your own beer. Not so cool. The upside is the fact that I get beers for myself much faster than the servers at El Hefe did for me. 

The booth seats are covered in plastic, in the style of your great grandmother. This is assuming, of course, that your great grandmother commissioned Ed Hardy to design her living room group. The ambiance isn't my style, but I'm sure that a lot of people love it...The biggest issue I had is the way the food is brought to the table. They start you with chips and salsa. It seems hard to screw up chips and salsa, but it happened here. The salsa comes in small jars that are downright weird, and they make dipping your chip absolutely impossible. You need to be a salsa MacGyver to figure out how to get the right amount of salsa on your chip...It's strange. After pushing some salsa around with a chip on a small plate for a while, our food arrived. Apparently, when you order tacos, they come 5-6 at a time, placed on wooden slabs that are roughly the size of a Las Vegas buffet. Our server couldn't remember who's tacos were who's, so we played a game of musical tacos (and wooden slabs) until we all figured out what we'd ordered. When a group of 4-5 orders 10+ tacos, you end up with 2-3 giant wooden slabs on your table and a very confusing family style presentation. 

Like I said before, the duck taco I had was pretty good, and I hear good things about the BeerRita. However, unless I'm dragged against my will by a large group of people, I don't see myself returning to El Hefe anytime soon.",2011-11-01 21:30:29

For a white cat he definitely has a great sense in the mastering of southwest cooking.  Definitely stop by this place if you are in Vegas and want a moderately priced place that will produce great food.  

I have eaten here for years and have to admit it never gets old. The appetizers, you have to try the queso fundido which is one of many you can enjoy.  Maybe the chorizo meatballs to complement the cheese with a nice wine pairing. 

Dinner here is always a new dish for me the last I tried was the Mango Spiced Tuna which was pretty amazing, I need to find this recipe and impress on the next home dinning experience.  Note to self, Bobby loves spice so if you notice most of the items on the menu will have a kick.  MY ALL TIME FAVORITE drum roll please..... definitely has to be the porterhouse chops, one of the best dishes in vegas.

Overall, the food is pretty good.  The tostado was a flavor bomb and hit every tastebud in one bite - but both of us got this strange salty undertow, otherwise it would have been a flawless dish.  I would recommend it.

My brother and I *love* beef tongue, so the lengua was a must.  It was stewed in mole sauce and very tender.  I liked it, but far from the best I've had.

The surprising dish was the meatball dish.  Very tasty and something I would eat again... and again... and again.  My favourite dish of the three.

The dishes are for sharing but are pretty small and are about $9 - $12 each and it can be pretty pricey considering you need about 2 - 3 dishes per person.  The two of us ordered 3 plates and decided to bounce out because nothing else look too appealing and my brother (who is a tourist in the city) wanted to save his stomach for another place.  He wanted to check Agave Y Aguacate out due to the Bourdain recommendation on The Layover.

We were seated downstairs and at table facing the bar.  Noticed another Yelper liked the odd seats (you and your dining partner seat on a high bench, with a table between you) for the intimacy, but it just made talking awkward as the natural tendency is to face in the parallel direction.  It might be good for an intimate date, but as my brother and I didn't want to rub knees under the table, you twist your body to face each other as your legs dangle in the walkway.  Might have liked it more if the seats were better -- but I did like the little shelf above the table to keep things off the table.  I think this was built specifically with phones in mind.

Overall, pretty good but think there are better places in the city at ~$30/head.",2014-02-26 07:50:50

Also, a bit of warning. Both me and my roommate at the time, both ended up with upset stomachs after eating here. Did we eat too much? Its possible. Was it the food? probable.

Call me snobby, but one has to have something to spread on the scone as you sit and sip on a nice cup of coffee or tea. And when you're paying close to $5 for a scone, you deserve it;) maybe even warmed up as well.

I finally got to try the Markham location (give them a year to iron out any bugs...) and was very impressed.  Gone are the bento boxes and gaijin McSushi Rolls (in Markham, walk 10 metres in any direction and you'll find those), instead is a much smaller menu of totally authentic Japanese dishes. It appears Zen is taking a page out of the Sushi Kaji playbook, by offering a curiously similar Kaiseki dinner for $135 (I'll definitely return and try it).  

I went with the $65 Omakase Sushi, and if you want to order this, make sure to reserve a spot at the bar. At the previous location the bar was much smaller so I would have this at a table, which meant they would make all the sushi pieces, assemble them on a plate, and deliver them all at once.  At the bar each piece will be served immediately after it's been made, as it should be.  You will not need to dunk sushi in soy sauces (which you do at the tables) since the chef brushes on the right amount of sauce on each piece before delivery.  A more impressive touch, for some pieces, after brushing on the sauce, a very light dusting of lemon rind (finely grated) was added, the acidity from the lemon oil helping the vinegary rice and the soy sauce balance out the fish.  Also, each piece was seasoned which just enough wasabi. Again, all about balance. Just eat each piece at once, then take a small slice of pickled ginger for a palate cleanser, then await the next piece.  Omakase sushi at its authentic best.  No mixing up nasty Yoda sauce here.

My dining partner (who is not a fan of raw fish) went with three cooked dishes from the appetizer menu, the tempura, kuro-ton (breaded pork cutlet), gindara saikyo (black cod with miso).  I sampled some of these and found them to be excellent.  If you've had these at Chinese run AYCE places, there's no comparison.  This will amaze you.   Even though they no longer offer the gaijin dishes (see above) members of your party who don't like real sushi will not be disappointed.  This was one of the complaints I read here soon after the move to Markham, and it appears they boosted the cooked apps selection to satisfy such diners without having to sell out to the Chinese Monster Truck McSushi-rolls/teppanyaki/bento/AYCE crowd.  This was a pleasant surprise for my partner who did not go in with a positive expectation but left satisfied.

There's no longer a need to travel to a seedy part of Scarborough or all the way to the wilds of Etobicoke (or pay a small fortune at Hashimoto) for an amazing, authentic Japanese dinner.  Take your gaijin friends and family here to show them what real Japanese food is about.  One meal at Zen and hopefully they won't crave McRolls, Benihana, or the latest Groupon deal anymore.",2016-02-13 18:37:58

I went back today for the first time in a long time.  It's about noon time, so the menu is quite different from the menu at 2 AM.  I asked our waitress about the peanut butter and egg burger, she says it's called the Memphis burger and that they generally don't serve it until the late night hours.  However, she was nice enough to see if the cook was able to make it anyway.  If they couldn't make it, then I'd have the gyro platter (which is bomb btw).

THE soup was ok but it was so small, 2 salads, (a chicken salad made like no way I have ever seen before, a ""torn"" chicken salad?)...only 2 tablespoons of it, the other salad was 2 tablespoons of curley pasta, with some green leaves, from the ""garden of hell"" as a decoration.    These ""little guy,"" child size,  salads....were sitting very sad and pissed off because the plate was gigantic, a white porcelain the size of a beach ball, porcelain was all over the place with tiny, little, ""snibbles"" of food for $8.99...And there were 10 employees in the back looking at me...10 employees and that's the scraps you give customers???  

 The baguette was miniscule...aren't you a bakery???? Fire them all, you could save $50 an hour and give more food...holy smokes, people!!!

NEWS FLASH!!  You are sitting in the shadow of a casino and a  $8.99 luncheon buffet at Sunset Station!!! 

 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU CHARGING FOR??? A SAMPLE OF FOOD???   I returned that insulting, piss/poor, excuse for a meal and got my money back...",2017-06-30 00:31:25

I usually order the same pasta dish as my daughter but last night I ordered the steak salad for the first time.  Don't order it.  They dip the meat and shoe-string onions in some dark sauce that is unappetizing.  So instead I ate half my daughter's pasta dish along with the garlic bread with marinara we ordered.  We'll go back but they need to taste test that salad.  The service was great.,2018-08-05 07:49:19

It's been awesome! They come out twice a year to service the heating/AC unit and keep it running. Before them, we'd have breakdowns every summer (and have to wait days for service in 100+ degree heat). Now we have a company that will send someone out almost immediately if we have a major problem. But the best news is - since we've started using them, we've only had a problem once (and they covered the labor since they had just serviced it)! Preventative maintenance works!

Even though our unit is old, they don't pressure us to buy a new one or do major upgrades. They clearly explain any issues and provide options, not requirements, for repairs. My only complaint is that they used to do hot water heater emptying on the plan, but it looks like they moved that feature to a more expensive package.

Les meubles n'ont rien de particulièrement inspirés, mais c'est pratique et les prix sont raisonnables. Je pense qu'il faut avoir vécu loin d'un Ikea pour vraiment l'apprécier. Cela nous est arrivé lorsque nous avons vécu un an à Cannes en 2004-2005. Le Ikea le plus près étant à 3 heures de routes, nous avons opté pour l'achat d'une armoire dans un semblant d'équivalent Français d'Ikea appelé ""Fly"" (Ils ont fait une tentative d'implantation au Québec au début des années 2000). Eh bien, je n'ai jamais eu autant de difficultés à monter un meuble! Je m'ennuyais vraiment de Ikea. Après cette aventure, croyez-moi que pour tout cryptique que sont les instructions d'Ikea, cela ressemble à un livre pour enfant à comparer aux alternatives!

De plus, une visite récente dans des magasins d'ameublement plus traditionnels nous a convaincu que leur clientèle doit certainement avoir des maisons en banlieue... les meubles ne rentreraient juste pas dans notre appartement de locataires montréalais.

Tout ça pour dire que les meubles Ikea étant d'abord penser pour les intérieurs européen, il est possible de trouver des meubles de dimension raisonnable pour un locataire urbain. Il est aussi possible d'acquérir des meubles sans devoir hypothéquer son avenir et il reste possible de les abandonner lors d'un déménagement outre mer sans avoir beaucoup de peine à cause de leur valeur ou du style...

Il est évidemment préférable de venir ici en voiture (il y a du transport en autobus raisonnablement près mais pas très pratique) mais le stationnement  comme le magasin devient plein la fin de semaine... alors, préférablement de jour la semaine.

Le début de juillet  est à proscrire... leur stock devient alors bas dû au déménagements massifs au Québec et il est presque certain que vous ne trouverez pas votre commande entière en stock.",2013-01-05 22:27:55

We left to live and work in Japan for a year from Aug. 2012-Aug. 2013; before we left, we had 2 bad experiences at Tomos. The first time, we thought it was just bad luck. They messed up our order, forgot to bring some things out that we had ordered, and still charged us for those forgotten things. The second time was with a gift card we had received from a friend. We went to use it and found out that the person who sold it to our friend never put the money on the card and had pocketed it instead. WOW! We told the owner (I think?) and she said she would take care of it. I trust that she did! ;) 

After returning in 2013, we figured we would give it a try again. We went back and had a bad experience again, over a year later. I had hoped they had fixed the problems while we were gone, but we were sadly disappointed. They forgot to bring us our plain white rice that we had ordered... in a Japanese restaurant. THEY FORGOT THE RICE!!! :P We went back one final time a few months later (2014 now) and had a similar experience where they forgot the rice. By the way, we were charged for the rice both times. They definitely removed it from our bill at the end, but it's crazy.

We used to love this place. The atmosphere is great, the food is great, the drinks are great... but the service is not. The chefs and all the people in the back, plus the bartenders, are awesome, but we have just had terrible experiences with the wait staff. It's unfortunate, but going out to eat is expensive, so I would like to enjoy my entire experience when I do spend my money for someone else to cook food for me! :)

(Edit: Forgot to mention that the past several times we went, they switched servers on us at least 2 or 3 times... insane! I bet that's why the orders get messed up. After looking at other reviews, it doesn't seem like we were the only people to have experienced this poor service here. Unfortunate!)",2014-07-29 15:38:39

hzCFXEZE4lhprhQ_hlFoqw,GMKoemATfrXg1deaXxt2jA,Jl-lJisnmsy8BCV0Pif4xg,3,0,0,0,"This is a lovely Greek restaurant  that my husband and I just happened upon while walking downtown looking for a suitable venue to dine and drink, being tourists still and not yet quite moved to the area.  

We had already been in one restaurant in which the wine prices were through the roof and had looked over several other menus tacked on the outside of some other restaurants.  Then, lo, and behold, Monica, I'm assuming one of the restaurant owners, walked up to us on the sidewalk menu in hand convincing us to come try her restaurant just a few strides away. And convincing she was.  ""Why not?"" we both thought.  She did such a good job giving us a sales pitch, we thought her restaurant deserved a chance tonight.  

We were ushered inside the small venue to a table very near another couple just finishing dessert and asked about their experience.  The fact that they were happy being there and the fact that there were other patrons was a positive start.  I was so afraid we were going to be ushered into an empty place begging for business but, not so.  There was a steady stream of clientele, most due to Monica's steady persuasion, I'm sure.  

We started with hummus and pita and a glass each of Greek white and red wine.  Then we ordered lamb and chicken kabob combo and some other greek dishes which came with a decent salad and a side.  Finally, we had to order dessert, knowing full well it would be home made.  The guests nearest us had ordered the Jackie O (as in Onasis) cake and another pastry, which is what Monica recommended to us so that's what we ordered.  It was all pretty good, not stellar, but pretty darned good.  I've definitely had more flavorful kabobs but I did appreciate the family home cooking aspect.   The wine was ok but would rather have ordered off a wine list.  The salad was a nice size and was good.  The Jackie O cake was light and moist -- a hit.  

One point to know that has been mentioned in other reviews:  the main meal looks to be inexpensive but it will add up quickly.  Everytime Monica looks at you with smiling eyes and asks if you'd like some wine, then ask if you want another glass, or do you want some hummus, and finally if you'd like dessert, you really want to say ""yes"" as if you're at your favorite aunt's house.  But, of course, each of these items comes with a price which you're glad to pay at the end of the meal because of your gracious host's manners and offerings.

I swear that Monica has the best work ethic I've seen in a long time.  From the moment she saw us on the sidewalk, she was in motion from ushering us in, to seating us, to taking our order, to presenting our order, to refilling our water, to cleaning tables next to us, to flagging down more clientele, to making sure we and other clients were satisfied with their meals, to taking our payment.  

One small humorous note as other reviewers have pointed out:  Ask for directions to the restroom and you'll be ushered through the kitchen, saying hello to the dishwasher and the cook, down the stairs.  I've never experienced that before (probably for good reasons).  But, it was humorous.",2014-04-03 18:54:24

I've been eyeing Tsujiri's tsuke soba ever since I saw it on Instagram, and finally decided to get it this past Tuesday. It came with a plate of matcha flavored soba and a bowl of dipping sauce, made from a mix of pork bone broth, soy milk, and chili oil. The texture of the soba was firm as it should be, but taste-wise, the buckwheat flavor is stronger than the matcha; not bad per se, but I just expected the matcha to be more prominent. And I do like the earthiness of it. As for the broth, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. It had this semi-creamy peanut-y savory soy taste to it. I actually can't think of anything to compare it to, but it did remind me of thai flavors. 

Overall, it was a confusing yet interesting bowl of noodles. I'll be back to try their dessert platters.",2018-05-20 04:44:43

I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!

Parking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  

The food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the ""crab"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain.

My luv for the cheddar bay biscuits have gone on for many years, but I find that my enjoyment of Red Lobster continues to dwindle a little bit each time I go. At one time red lobster was the apex of chain seafood restaurant where you went for an ""expensive"" seafood meal, however a lot has changed and now it is a higher quality restaurant on pare with Outback or Longhorn. The long waits that use to exist have melted away which is nice. Our family of four was seated on a super long table which gave us plenty of space to spread out. Our waitress took our orders without any issues, but again we had the typical conversation ... are drinks included with the kids meal ... No ... but it says it right here they are ... I don't think they are but I will get you one anyways... The food itself was okay, the obligatory caesar salad was dressed well. Finally the biscuits arrived with the meal. My seafarer fest looked a little different then the menu item with it haphazardly thrown together in the picture, but maybe I am to blame as I did not get the broccoli and opted for the potato which threw off the arrangement. There was no hot butter to dip my lobster which I did not realize until now after looking at the pictures of my meal. Overall the food was okay, the shrimp scampi was super salty as usual. All and all I think with y time to time cravings, I will head out to Red Lobster to get some cheddar bay biscuits along with whatever seafood meal looks appetizing at that time

Pros: variety of seafood dishs that include lobster tail, scallops, shrimp

Cons: Plating of the meal does not look like the website, occasionally slow service including timing of the biscuits to the table

That might sound odd, but I have a weakness for some things. One of those things are apple fritters and fortunately/unfortunately Karl's literally makes THE BEST apple fritters in the world. Not only are they super moist (but not mushy) and filled with loads of apple chunks on the inside, they are super crispy and lovingly covered with the perfect amount of glaze on the outside. Now add to this to the fact that they are the size of a adult human head and you can see why I need to avoid the place. I could eat one of these every single day of my life and not get tired of them! 

I have tried most of the more average bakery items at Karl's (the stuff you can get anywhere), but they have some items that are simply above and beyond what you find elsewhere and those are the things that make me come back time after time. 
1) The Alligator - a huge flaky dough thing covered in nuts and a caramelized topping that makes you drool. It's big, so I take it to family events and there are never any leftovers. Poof. Gone. Ahhhh happy tummy. 
2) The Apple Strudel - Karl's does the flaky puffed stuff proud and the filling is perfectly spiced. Another fabulous family meal treat! 
3) The Season Fresh Fruit Tarts - Check out their FB page to see what the current offerings are and you won't be disappointed. There is a ton of fruity topping on these, so they have to be healthy right?!! 
4) The Quiche - As the lovely Christina P. points out the crust at Karl's is really good. Great taste - perfect flaky bite - baked to just the right golden level. They usually have 2 or 3 fillings to pick from. Get there before lunch if you want to be guaranteed to find your favorite. Tip: this is another great thing to take to a brunch. 

Family owned. Non-chain. Great selection. Uber friendly staff. Co-workers and family have all benefited from my relationship with Karl's. Stop in and pick up a sweet treat... just please please please, leave me one apple fritter! : )",2011-09-29 20:06:49

It is really a tight-squeeze to get through the aisles and the customer traffic.  Lots of Adjumonis preparing mandu, ttoek and other delights to sample.

Decided to break the budget today and bought of box of Korean pears from around the Gimhae area in the south.  Worth every penny, luscious, dripping with sweet juice ... ahhh ... 

Their meat counter also had the usual BBQ type meats, high-end and regular type cuts.

The store is surrounded inside by little restaurants (within the store) - we tried Hwan Ga Ne and Osaka Sushi which was OK.  The fish cake noodle was good - and of course splurged on the HOTTEOK cause I really 'need' a hotteok ... LOL.

What can I say.  I miss Korea and this is one of my go-to place when I can pick up my favourite items, see (and try) some new products on and partake of tteok or bean-paste stuffed dough shaped like a fish.  Don't shop when you're hungry, you'll buy everything ...",2018-03-24 19:08:50

However, this is a new avenue for this hotel and trending towards lighter and brighter and upscale but not pretentious Italian food.  Not sure why it's called Costal Italian but it is.

Good to know

We each ordered a salad, huge, and we could have ordered one and split it.  As it was I only ate about half of mine.  Nice vinegrette, too much grated cheese and primarily lettuce with a couple of tomato pieces tossed in.  Hubs had a Caesar which he said was ok.

For entrees I had sea bass which was cooked perfectly and it was the entire fish and of course I could only eat about half.  I ordered a side which was an eggplant something or other and not very good.  Hubs had lasagna which he said was really good but huge portion and he couldn't finish it.

And you freakin well BETTER ""believe my review"". The prices are very expensive here. Our total bill for two people and one three year old came to $54. That's with a simple chicken and steak dish for me ($22), a hibachi vegetables with chicken on the side for the wife and a noodles and chicken for the kid. No sushi. Inside, the place is okay - although they took us to the back room (we opted for the sushi side rather than the hibachi side) which was very cramped - even without it being particularly full we still had to move chairs out of the way in order to scoot through to our table. The food was okay - I've had better. I would have gone for a little nigiri or sushi rolls had I not been put off by the price - a SINGLE piece of yellowtail nigiri for $2.50? Pfft. The rainbow roll wasn't the common one with shrimp, yellowtail etc, which I ALWAYS get - instead the picture showed it with different colored fish roe instead. Pass. Didn't look like they had spicy crab roll either. Already, Fresh Wasabi was ahead IMO. The kid's dish was adult-sized, far more than a three year old could hope to eat unless they're a Ricki Lake special. My kid is not.

The highlight was the server. He was very attentive, friendly and helpful - returned several times, always kept the glasses filled, had a couple of menu recommendations, offered to help by looking up deals at the counter for the chicken/veg combo the wife ordered to see if he could punch in a better deal (which didn't happen, but whatever), and even boxed our takeout for us. Then again, doubling the tax got him a hefty ten buck tip so.. (shrug)

Won't be going back, I'm afraid. Simply because this is apparently the only teppanyaki restaurant in Surprise doesn't immediately convince me that I need to gush over how awesome it is. That Greek place down on Reems that died and got replaced by Nick's Diner was awesome. Ritters was awesome. Babbo's spaghetti and meatballs special is awesome. This place is meh, bordering on bad value for money especially in this shitburger economy where even McDonalds is now offering two big macs for $3. You can feed two people for $3 and I fed three tonight for almost $55. Seriously, I tried my hand at Gordon Ramsay's smoked paprika chicken stroganoff recipe a couple of nights ago (although I substituted pork loin strips for chicken and roasted poblanos for green peppers), and not only were the ingredients half the price of my meal tonight but what I made was twice as delicious.

The restaurant is tucked away on the 10th floor of the Venetian and walking into Bouchon, you are immediately transported into a Parisian bistro. The interior is classy, with tiled floor, wood pillars and waiters donning traditional French uniforms. This contrasts nicely with the  rest of the Venetian-themed hotel.

Their brunch menu is expansive ranging from American favorites like chicken and waffles to traditional French classics like the croque-madame. Not surprisingly, the prices are a tad bit on the higher side. Just to give you an idea on pricing, the cheapest item on the Brunch menu is the French Toast at $12 and the most expensive is the Steak Frites at $33.50. 

I wanted something more unique, so I ordered the croque-madame. It's a French ham and cheese sandwich covered in cheesy béchamel (roux), topped with a fried egg. It came highly recommended on Yelp and after eating the sandwich myself, I must say its praise is well-deserved. This grilled cheese on steroids cost $18.95 and it was worth every single penny.

It's a heavy but delicious dish. The thick slices of buttered brioche bread were grilled to perfection with just the right amount of texture. The addition of the sweet melted Gruyère cheese and salty ham lead to an explosion of flavors. 

In addition, the dish is served with a giant heap of french fries. They are thinly cut, light and crispy without being too oily. They are truly addictive and deserve to share the spotlight with the croque-madame. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch at Bouchon. The food exceeded my already high expectations. Bouchon is a must try if you're staying at the Venetian or Palazzo. It may be on the pricier side, but you need to splurge once in a while in Vegas.",2014-04-02 13:45:21

Hopefully things improve once they have been open longer. I'd hate to see another business fail in this location.",2016-05-20 23:38:16

At first I walked and asked what's good today and looked over the counter. They said everything!! But if you want something special, you can have a Roasted Pork Back Ribs and a Duck Leg on rice..  Both are my favourites, so I quickly agreed. The rice box came up to $10 plus change which is about $2 extra for the best cuts... 

Told them I wanted to dine-in and they immediately told me it's extra $2 to dine-in.. I was a bit shocked.. but told them I will pay the extra money to sit down.. and then they asked me again, are you sure you want to dine-in? Wtf, didn't you hear already? Plus I see 2 others having a dine-in lunch too..

At this point, I was about to give them a 2 star review... wtf..

Sat-down and ordered a can of pop to go with my meal..

Lunch came up to $14 - holy shit, that is expensive for a Chinese BBQ 2 item rice combo..

Anyways, i started eating the pork and the crispy skin was probably one of the best I have ever had!!!!

The skin on the duck leg was also super crispy!!

Too bad the meat portion was smaller then most places...

By far, one of the best tasting BBQ duck and Roasted Pork I have ever had in the Markham area!!

I love that there are a few vegetarian joints located in Chinatown.  I was excited to try this place out since I had scored an awesome deal on Groupon. 

My hubby is a meat-head (LOL), as am I, but I like having vegetarian options and like to taste how people get creative with vegetables.  

Its a nice cozy little place that has delightful, attentive workers, and when we were there, we saw Chef Kenny making his rounds at the tables.  I like when the restaurants do that, gives you a lot of appreciation of whats about to go down in your tummy.  I heard Chef Kenny say to the couple he was speaking to about how he employs chefs that are also vegetarian.  Guess to be okay of the veggies plates you're preparing, you should be a vegetarian yourself, Hehe.  

There are TV sets on each side of the room that display the varieties that they serve here.  So you won't be completely lost about all the faux on faux on faux they got here.  

My hubby and I tried the Shark Fin soup, Oyster Mushroom with Lime Grass, and the Spicy Beef.  Soup was okay, a bit salty for me, the other 2 dishes were bursting with flavor.

I ordered the chile ramen with beef- essentially a lot of msg-laden egg noodles [like pancit] in a ponzu-mirin sauce with a little bit of beef and a few vegetables.

Friendly staff and service. Menu is very simple, although you might have to ask what some of their stuff are but they are more than willing to educate you. On my first visit she asked me if we've been here before and then proceeded to explain their menu. Latti are their milk tea. Cotton candy is their shaved ice. It's in a small cup and it's pretty great. They have 4 flavors of that, and I've tried milk (condensed milk pretty much), coffee, and earl grey. I liked all of them. Will be trying their matcha flavor next time I'm in.

Their raindrop dessert is what's got all the people wanting to come in (at least for me) since it's so appealing visually. It's not anything to go crazy for, in terms of taste, but it's fun to get. The brown powder is roasted soybean powder, I believe, and depending if you get regular or green tea, that's their sauce. I've tried both and they're pretty decent.

I've yet to try their Latti as all I've had was their hot jasmine green tea. So far so good for everything. Their tables are pretty small (and round) except for their one big table as you enter the cafe, but the seats are kind of spaced out.

Unfortunately for me, that Saturday was my chinese lunar calendar birthday, which meant i had to be vegetarian for a day (something ive done for quite a few years, when remembered - why i need to do it? i dont remember. good luck maybe? something my mom has always told me to do). Prior to coming here, we checked out the menu online and seemingly had 1-2 main noodle dishes that were vegetarian. So i was ok with going. 

A downside is the plaza its in. This plaza is known for difficulty in finding parking as parking spaces are super limited. With a few popular restaurants in this plaza, it fills up the spots REALLY quickly. Especially patrons of Ichiza. This restaurant took over the same spot where the yakiniku place used to be, to the left/east of Tea Station. 

We came during lunch time-ish but got lucky with a table being open, so was sat fairly quickly. We were quickly served 3 cups of some sweet mung bean soup looking thing and we were really unsure what to do with it. Lol the placemat shows to dip your noodles in it to eat but looking around, i just saw people drinking from it. I guess its the ""normal"" drink to serve at this restaurant. Water can be requested. The sweet mung bean soup does help cut on the ""spiciness"" if needed. They do give a small amount, for you to try. Someone comes around with a pitcher later if you do like it and will fill it to the top. 

I had gotten the Szechuan Hot & Sour Noodles with added complementary extra noodles. This dish and the Szechuan Cold Noodles seemed to be the only two vegetarian options available. Though, i dont remember egg being a vegetarian item so i had given my egg to my friend instead. The extra noodles came in a separate bowl in its own soup. Though menu says its 100g, oh man it seemed a lot more than 100g. Especially after eating my original bowl, it seemed like it was way way more than 100g. LOL Flavorwise, pretty good. Nice amount of sourness. I had issues with my uvula that day so i had to eat really slowly so i wouldn't choke. (yeah... dont ask). The noodles they use are thin noodles. Unfortunately, i think they cooked it for longer than i had preferred so it was quite soft. Aside from the fried egg (friend told me it was overly cooked by a large margin) and the green onions sprinkled on top, they had added these ""fried peanut"" like things to simulate meat i guess. The picture made me think it was ground meat. Totally not. Lol. 

My best friend had gotten the Piquant intestine noodles with fried egg but without extra noodles. According to google, Piquant means ""having a pleasantly sharp taste or appetizing flavor."".. Lol? Friend said the soup has a very ""mala"" or ""numbing"" aspect to it but without the apperance of the szechuan peppercorn ! Which is great but we hate accidentally biting into one of those XD though she still found like 2. Lol 

Her fiance had gotten the house beef noodles. Didn't hear him complain about much besides the egg i gave him was over cooked. From what i saw, the noodles they got in theirs were different from mine. A bit more wavey and thicker vs the thin straight noodles i had. 

We dont have much complaint about food wise but service was a bit lacking. Not sure if the waitresses are not paying attention or what. My friend had tried getting their attention twice and was ignored. I essentially had to appear/flag down a person in front of them to notice. 

Overall, would like to come back again to try the intestine and beef noodle soup but hope they improve on their service.",2017-08-31 17:36:15

I ate my bison as usual with a side of the fries and no shake and now, 6 hours later, I still feel pretty uncomfortably full.

I am a medium-well person and I can choose to get something that is way too well (no pink) or way too undercooked for my liking (pink). I asked for them to make it somewhere in between once and I just wound up with a completely gray burger. 

Also, the fancy cocktails are $7-8ish and the beers are $7. Either the cocktails are not particularly alcoholic and/or have cheap booze, or the beer is way overpriced. Just my opinion.",2013-08-06 05:16:21

They were out of literally half the menu and we were forced to only choose from one little portion. The 16 dollar serving for the blazing chicken did not taste good at all as well a 16 dollar portion should look like a 16 dollar portion not a 7 dollar portion. Next time I'll get a spicy rotisserie chicken from the grocery store because that tastes way better and I'll go to Galleria supermarket when I want some korean fried chicken.,2014-04-21 05:12:23

Chips like it hot and spicy!!!!  It is two o'clock and time for the daily feeding.  Imagine Old School Buju Banton lightly pumpin out of the stereo speakers, ""cause I keep on,, loving you,, and I don't know why,,oh why"".  I can only say that this is one heck of a transformation. Don't get me wrong now. I miss Shalimar's delicious Butter Chicken and Burnt Naan.   Back to Radica.  This is their second location. First one in Brampton now here in my Sauga. This place is clean.

I have tried the Shark and Bake, Doubles and a Mini Boneless Chicken Roti.   I start with the three orders of the doubles- hot. Nom nom nom. All gone. A Double, in case you don't know, is a chickpea stew wrapped up in between two pieces of fry bread. A chickpea stew sandwich. Beautiful smooth texture with a nice hit of garlic and sweet heat.  I can eat them everyday. The Thursday special that I chose was the Mini Chicken Boneless Roti- hot. Vacuum on and I sucked that roti down. If you haven't eaten a Chicken Roti, it is basically a chicken stew that is wrapped up in flat bread called Roti. It is usually rectangular or square in shape. It was a perfect ratio of chicken to roti. Every bite of chicken was moist and juicy. The curry stew in the background was scrumptious and added to the moisture in the dish. It all melded perfectly and was nice and spicy. The way Chips likes it. Oh ya!   The Shark and Bake was unique.  Deep fried shark in cased between two pieces of bake. (Deep fried bread). The shark had a dehydrated texture to it.  A really good chew to it. Not my style. See my pics. Peace out Yelpers.",2015-05-28 19:29:11

It reminded me of Southeast Asian comfort food. Very rustic, lots of stews and soups, and lots of slow cooked items. Everything is super flavorful with lots of spices. It also reminds me of Thai food without the limes or sour notes.

I don't think they serve just Malaysian food. Just like many Asian restaurants this place has some Thai dishes and Chinese dishes. I'm not sure if they are Malaysian twists on Thai and Chinese dishes but I'll try them one day.

We had very nice servers. We got some recommendations but decided on some ""classic"" dishes we both heard of.

Everything came out fast and fresh. Everything was piping hot.

We had barley water, roti with curry, curry puffs, beef rendeng, curry mee, charr geau theuy, and chicken rice. Everything came out to $50. For two beverages, two appetizers, and three entrees it was a good price.

The roti curry app was small. I wish I got my own except we had so much food! Roti is like a super thin and crisp crepe. The curry was really good. It had potatoes and chicken.

Beef rendeng is a spicy braised beef dish with a thick curry like sauce. It was super spicy as in spices and as in heat. It was delicious with the chicken rice. The rice was like Hainese chicken rice. The beef was very tender.

Charr guea thyeu is like Thai pad se ewe except with lots of bean sprouts and sea food. It had shrimp and squid in it. I liked the strong wok taste and how natural it tasted.

Curry puffs are like empanadas filled with curried potatoes, peas, and possibly a meat. I did like this but it was bland compared to how good everything else was.

Curry mee was a curry noodle soup. It reminded me of Thai ka soi. It had a really rich meat and coconutty flavor. It was spicy and just good. I can't really describe it but I definitely recommend this.

The staff was nice. They did a good job with the questions we asked and with recommending dishes. Malaysian food is delicious. With this place being affordable and the food being delicious I can't wait to come back.

My two cents would be the wait for the check was off. This can be so awkward! Maybe let us know before hand if we have to walk up to the counter to get our check or to wait on the staff. We waited a good 10-15 minutes after obviously being done eating. 

Last the food is a bit greasy. I understand this as most of the dishes are slow cooked meats in sauce or soup. Not a down side but just an FYI to the picky eaters. I just equated this to more flavorful food.",2015-08-20 08:03:17

The game room was pretty crowded, but not as crowded as I expected. However, there were a lot of games that were out of order. And one of the games ate our tokens. Also the card readers never worked the first time and we kept having to insert the card multiple times in different directions and at different speeds until it worked. It sure why that was happening, it could have just been my card because it is a few years old. Overall, it was acceptable, we had fun, but we did get annoyed a few times.
The dinner portion was below our expectations, we had a coupon and I'm glad we did. The food was fine, but definitely overpriced. I'm glad we had a coupon because I would not have paid full price for what we got. The server told us the wait would be 30 minutes but we ended up waiting an hour. Whatever estimate they give you I'd say double it and that's what you will really wait. This is based on our experience but also the experience of larger parties that were also waiting. It seems like the reason why the wait is so long is because there is a delay in bussing and cleaning tables. The service is slow but our server was very nice. 
Overall, I would come back here to use my other coupon, and maybe play a few games. But it is overcrowded and overpriced. If you can deal with that you will probably enjoy yourself.",2018-03-04 13:54:38

It's as decadent as it gets. It's sausage on a stick dipped in a waffle batter & fried. Oh yeah I said fried. It's the ultimate sweet & salty.

We seated ourselves at the bar and automatically greeted by our bartender, Adam. We received a BOGO cocktail for checking into Yelp! Adam was clueless about this offer and had to check with his manager first. But we Yelpers won & each got a free drink. Yay! 

Madison Ave $10 -- very delicious. I definitely did not taste the alcohol but I did feel it after. It had a cinnamon sugar rim that really had me goin & I hate cinnamon! But together it just complimented each other. 

Mint Coffee Martini $13 -- the beau got it. I'm not a fan of coffee based drinks so I really didn't like it. 

ScoobieDoo cocktail -- off the menu. It's suppose to be a shot but Adam made it into a cocktail & it tasted just like juice! I loved it.

Service was great. Greeted quickly and offered drinks soon after. Thai iced tea for two, wine for one and water for the last. 

We ordered pork Larb, dumplings and crab Rangoons for apps. The Larb lacked mint and was served on top of the lettuce, making it very hard to make a lettuce wrap. Not much meat either. The dumplings and Rangoons were very good, both served with a sweet pineapple sauce on the side. Would've preferred a spicy soy dip. 

For entrees we order Shrimp Pad Thai and Beef Pad Thai, plus Crispy Noodle Seafood. Both Pad Thai dishes were good, but it's tough to mess those up. The Crispy Noodle Seafood was disappointing. There was no flavor in the 'gravy' and the noodles were right out of a package. They were stale, unless they were submerged in gravy: then they were soggy. Don't recommend that dish.

Stopped by last night with my girls for happy hour, and snagged a great spot out on the patio (since it's finally getting cool). We had the pleasure of being served by the phenomenal Ms. Soto -- ask for her, she's the greatest! She brought us our drinks quickly. All of them are yummy! I opted for the Coug Cup, refreshing, light, and tart -- drool! And my girls got the Old-Fashioned and Bennett & Bubbles, both were good, however the Bubbles was a tad too sweet for my liking. We asked Soto what she recommends as far as food items, and she informed us that the Grilled Fish Tacos are amazing (try them, you won't regret it -- there's 4 per order), and the Flatbread (the chef's creation on this particular evening was a white flatbread: Alfredo sauce with grilled chicken along with cheese and yummy spices). 

We were here more for the ambiance and catching up, but we couldn't have had a better evening. The food and drinks were scrumptious! Soto was the absolute greatest -- she's incredibly sweet, funny, attentive, and kind! Sam, the GM, even came by the table a few times -- (mainly 'cause we kept asking for him... hey, girls need some eye candy, hehe). And the other guests are great, too! It's like going to a huge neighborhood BBQ; everyone was chatting with each other, just having a great time and enjoying each other's company... which let's face it, in today's world, it's nice to see such great human interaction rather than everyone being glued to their phones.

If you're looking for helpful and friendly instructors, a clean studio, and a friendly vibe, I recommend coming here! I love that these classes are a mix between Pilates, yoga, ballet, weight training, and cardio. You really get a full work out and definitelyyyy break a sweat. Not going to lie, sometimes I feel like I need to be wheeled down the street in a wheelchair after these classes, haha!

The studio is not large but not super small to where you feel on top of anyone. I also like that there's room for everyone to have a spot at the bar. There's a chalkboard that lists what you need for that day's class so it's really easy to find the materials you need. They have towels and mats so you never have to lug your own over. Each class does require grippy socks, though, so you need to bring your own or they have really cute ones for purchase!

The instructors are really nice -- willing to help you make sure you're doing the movements right and encouraging on the mic to get you to push up an extra inch or push yourself a few more seconds until the next move/rep. I never feel embarrassed if I can't execute something perfectly. 

I do the 5 class package so that I can come when it best suits my schedule and I have never felt pressured to purchase bigger bundles than that, which is great.

Tips: Entrance is via the Greenway side of the shops. Stretch stretch stretch before class. Bring a big bottle of water and keep it with you. Keep a towel with you, as well. Wear yoga leggings vs yoga pants, sweat pants or shorts because they're easier to wear for the movements and watching your execution in the mirror.

There's a bar, a fridge, microwave, comfy bed, pullout sofa bed, and plenty of room for 3-4 people. The decor is chic and modern, with dark (black) hardwood flooring and mod furniture. There are 3 flatscreen tvs, including one in the bathroom. We also had a sweet upgrade to an awesome front-and-center view of the Strip (we were on the 27th floor)

The bathroom has a frosted glass pane and no door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom, so it seemed to us that this suite was made more for couples or people who are fairly 'intimate' with one another. The walk-in shower is sexy -- has a see through glass door and 2 showerheads, one on the wall and a waterfall showerhead on the ceiling that ""rains"" down. Aveda toiletries - nice touch! There's also a separate jacuzzi tub. Like I said, very 'coupley'! 

While Palms Place is connected to the Palms, you have to take the elevator to the ""sky tube"" on the 2nd floor, then take two conveyor belt walkways (long) to get to the Palms, then take another elevator to the Lobby. So that could be annoying to some, but for us it was fine. 

Overall has a more grown-up, chic vibe than the Palms, which is still a good spot for young partiers, but is starting to lose it's glam, I think. Rain & Moon draw a much different crowd than say, Marquee or the other higher end clubs, but we still had fun partying at both clubs since we had free passes and never have to wait in line. The convenience of no cabs to party, drink, and walk back to our suite as just too sweet to pass up :)

The parks have grass and are really well kept. They have benches and tables and wall areas where you can sit while your pooch goes and makes friends. 

The big dog area is obviously larger than the little dog area and there is plenty of room for everyone to comfortably run around in both areas. The dogs my pup met today were all really friendly and owners were good about watching their dogs and picking up after them. 

They have containers to hold plastic bags to pick up poop but they seemed a little low in the little dog area. Maybe to be safe, bring your own poopie bags.

Now when you walk in, the brightfully colored wigged staff greets you like most Japanese places in town. You seat yourself and they come by and take your order. The environment is relaxed and cozy. The decor features anime art plus you have anime playing on the tvs, except for that one tv that plays American football. The staff is nice but they do seem a bit inexperienced. They did forget a couple things here and there but my only issue was when they kept asking how we were doing every 5 mins. It just becomes annoying after a while. The guys I was with did mention how they enjoyed the scenery at the place and would come back to just ""hang out"" there. Men!

Anwyays, yes the menu is small but what more could you want? They have ramen, fried rice, some appetizers and bento boxes. And they're portions are actually a decent size for the price you're paying.

At $8 a bowl, we ordered the miso ramen, tom yum ramen, kimchi fried rice ($6) and the usual teri beef (?). First off, this isn't Monta or Ichiza but I give these guys kudos for trying to bring this concept to Vegas. The fried rice was better than I expected, actually I enjoyed it better than Shuseki's version. Ichiza's is still my favorite. The only thing is that, the rice did contain pork so if you're not a pork fan you might want to make note of this before you order it.

The Miso ramen wasn't bad. The guy that ordered it enjoyed it very much and said it was very flavorful. I tasted the broth and the broth was nicely flavored. Not too bland but also not too salty.

I ordered the tom yum ramen and honestly I couldn't stop eating it! I love tom yum and their version was very comparable to some of the Thai places around town. Add some ramen with the chicken and mushrooms and you have a winner winner chicken dinner. I ordered it spicier but alas I still needed to kick it up a notch. Just thinking about it makes me crave a bowl. Normally I can't down the big bowls of ramen, which is a bit surprisingly since I usually have a big appetite, but I did find myself scrapping the bottom of this bowl. This surprised me, that never happens! I was so full but was determinded to not this go to waste. To top it off, the Thai Ice Tea boba went down great with it. 

So with that being said, yes it's not Monta or Ichiza but at least give it a try and judge for yourself. I like the concept of it especially since it's Vegas! Despite what some might say or think, Las Vegas has a pretty decent Chinatown compared to some other cities. We need to support these places before they go away with this economy.",2011-11-01 19:44:17

The food is a solid 3.5 stars. Neither I nor my wife had any complaints about the taste or seasoning of the dishes we ordered. Although the Beef Pho was just ok, our problem with Rice Paper was the portion sizes versus the cost. An ""order"" of fresh spring rolls in every Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to is two spring rolls. Here, it is only one spring roll that they cut in half to make two pieces. At $4.75, its half the food for more than the going price elsewhere. The Shaking Beef I had was again, very tasty, but quite small as far as portion sizes go. Also, on the menu, it is described as ""cubed fillet mignon"" but I am highly suspicious as to whether the meat I had was indeed filet mignon. If it was, it was one of the worst cuts I have ever experienced. My suspicion is that it was probably a decent sirloin cut instead. You can see the portion size by the photo I have posted.

I think the reason why there are a lot of bad reviews here on yelp is because  a lot of Pho restaurants on Spring Mountain  have the word ""SAIGON"" in their title. There is ""Pho old SAIGON"", ""Pho SAIGON 8"", "" Pho SAIGON"" ""Pho Huong SAIGON"" ""Pho Vietnam SAIGON"", and even another ""Pho Little Saigon"" that is an unrelated restaurant. .  I think most the people are confusing this place for another restaurant because there is no way you could dislike the food from here. 

Everyone who follows my weird and profanity filled reviews knows that my favorite food in the world is Miso Ramen.  The Pho at PHO LITTLE SAIGON is the only Pho in the world which I would eat over Ramen on occasion.  Obviously, I would still rather go to a place like ""Anime Ramen"" where everyone knows your name after only your 1st visit, and your bowl of noodles practically comes with a show + entertainment....but  sometimes I'm just in the mood for cilantro and a clear soup.

I recommend everyone to try the Rare Steak Pho.  They use a very high quality cut of steak. I think it might be petite sirloin because it was extremely soft tender and just melted in your mouth. It almost had the texture of Filet Mignon. What I really liked was how the steak  was blood red. They don't even cook it, they just poor the hot soup over the meat and serve immediately. 

The broth is crystal clear and clean. It looks like the water off the coast of Hawaii because you could see clear down to the bottom.  The top of the broth is full of natural oils. These oils are common in soups where you had to boil bones for over 20 hours. They are purely natural and are a great visual indication of the high quality.

They use Red Onions instead of generic onions! Red onions make the Pho taste so much better than the regular brown onions. 

They are definitely not cheap here. You get over 1/2 a pound of free bean sprouts and basil. You ask for extra limes and they literally hand you the whole lime(and it's a giant lime).  Most places like ""Pho So 1"" and ""Pho Kim Long"" give you half of even a half of a lime wedge.  If you ask for extra onions, they literally slice the whole onion and give you the whole thing. 

The service was very quick and fast. 
I think it's worth mentioning that they are Cash Only. So don't blow all your cash at the casino..save some of it and bring it here. It is also worth mentioning that they are open 24 hours/ 7 days a week. 

From now on, this is the only Pho restaurant I would ever go to in Las Vegas. Not only is the food great, but you don't have to sit next to the typical drunk-degenerate-immature Vegas Club Douche like at  ""Pho Kim Long"". And you don't have to be ignored and treated like crap like at ""Pho So 1"". PHO LITTLE SAIGON also better fits my lifestyle.

We had to wait 25 minutes for our order because they make it fresh - well worth the wait! We browsed the Chapters nearby while waiting.  I look forward to going again. With such a wonderful variety of options it will be an adventure. The menu describes the dishes well. I wish Little Spice great success, they well deserve it.

The person who organized this dinner is good friends with the staff (including the chef), so we were treated really nicely. Appearance wise, the restaurant has a nice rustic feel to it and the patio out in the back is really relaxing. When it starts to get dark outside, the staff light up the tables with little mason jar candles and turn on hanging lights above. 

For appetizers there were an assortment of olives, peppers, squidink bread, prosciutto, shrimp (which was delicious), potatoes, fried artichoke, white fish tacos (wrapped in a lettuce wrap - which was also delicious), friend green tomatoes, croqueta, tomato salad (amazingggg!), flying fish, and a potato-cheese-sausage concoction

For dinner we had the paella negra (which is black ink paella with grilled octopus - to die for!), paella del Carmen (which is shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, chorizo, chicken and saffron paella - also delicious) 

To drink I had the white sangria which was really good. 

To sum up, I really enjoyed everything I tried and felt that all the dishes really complimented each other. The service we received was unbelievable and the chef's personal attentiveness made the experience all that much better. I'd come here again!",2015-07-06 13:55:33

The place resembles a fast food joint more than a restaurant but it has full service. Decent food but I'd probably not come here again. 

I think this is a place everybody should try at least once. If you're adventurous and want to try exotic foods you've never tried before, you need to come here. They have some Turkish entrees that I haven't seen elsewhere. When people think middle eastern food, it's usually falafel and shawarma. Yes they have those here too but if you come here, you really need to order their specialties like Pide or their Turkish entree dishes like fish and meat saute. 

We ordered Meat Saute with lamb and Sheperd's Braised Chicken. Both came with salad and a basket of bread. For $15 an entree, I think it's reasonable but I'd prefer it to be cheaper and without the salad. I'm the kind of guy that likes to keep my orders around $10 outside of special occasions. They both tasted pretty good but not mind-blowing. They were not ""WOW I need to come again"" kind of goodness. The braised chicken had tastes similar to Chinese stir fry. The meat saute also tasted similar to stir fry.

The bread was awesome. It tasted like it came fresh from the oven. Too bad we had to ask for it. Our server seemed nice but he almost forgot our bread. The bread made us happier than the entrees.

Don't get me wrong. It's a decent restaurant but it fails my value test. If they chopped $2-3 off most of their entrees I'd consider coming again. If you want Pide pizza there are other options in the GTA for better prices. Besides, this place is in the middle of nowhere. There just isn't enough reason for me to drag myself all the way here for food that I feel is slightly overpriced.",2013-11-18 15:15:59

So she threw it away and I drove to KFC, because we already had buns with mayo and lettuce, we just needed the chicken. They've got this new menu, and one of the things on it is called ""Tenders and Wedges for Two"" which is awesome, because that is exactly what I want. Now I haven't been to a KFC in like, 8 years. So how did I know the menu was new? Because when I ordered it, the guy at the counter had no idea what I was talking about. I mean he was cool about it - he wasn't an idiot - I was just apparently the first person ever to order that. So he called up two other guys and they all tried to find the item on the register so I could order it, and eventually the first guy found it, and everybody went back to chicken making.

And the chicken was pretty dagone good.  I totally recommend you make your own sandwiches, but then toss in a couple of chicken tenders. Delicious 'tendies' as some call them. And the potato wedges were great too.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

The food is tasty, but very little seems authentic. The Tom Yum soup that I had was made with Western ingredients (wrong mushrooms, for example), with only a slight nod to the famous soup that I was expecting to taste. I was disappointed. The rolls we had were also very Westernized, and the dish my friend had was almost Chinese. In fact, there's a lot about this restaurant that screams Chinese, and it seems like the attempt at Thai flavors was merely an afterthought.

That being said, the food is tasty, but don't expect authentic Thai by any stretch.",2012-03-04 20:31:43

I will note the things that have changed though.  They have new menus now, since the old ones were all scribbled on, torn, falling apart.  The Mandarin menu is still up on the wall, but they now have a beautifully done full menu in English (feels like a textbook almost!) that contains all the dishes in English.  My favorite though is that they also now offer a smaller, ""Americanized"" menu, with the stuff Non-Asian ethnicities are likely to expect at a restuarant.  Even this though is still 100s of choices.  

Second, you now have to pay a table cleaning fee.  Before, you were expected to clear your table (just remove all dishes and trash to bins located all around the restaurant) but I guess too many people were just leaving their dishes and no tips either.  Hell, I often would leave tips even when we cleaned off our tables because the staff is always so nice.  But yea, it's like 50 cents I think per person, and they now clean your table off at the end, so it's actually very reasonable.  Still no tips expected, you just pay the fee on your bill.   We still clean our table off for courtesy, but you don't have to.  

You also get your table number after your order now.  Also, lot's of people will stand up front and look through their menus, but we always just take them back to our table first and look while also grabbing a table we want.  :D  

All and all, the food is still amazing, and I've never had a bad dish here.  I'm definitely starting to get to the point though where I have found so many excellent choices that are so superbly good, I just stick to them.  As always, the staff is super friendly and courteous too.  The front counter lady, I believe her name is Tina, is one of the nicest people I know.  Seriously, she puts a smile on my face, and I just want to give her a big hug.  She treats everyone like family, and it makes me so happy to know there are people still like that out in the world when there is also so much bad going on.

All and all, this place is still top notch, and do yourself a favor and check it out if you haven't already. 

Pro Tip:  Go with a large party and share your platters.  Even the small size meals are enough to feed two people heartily.  It's a ton of fun though to just have everyone order different stuff, and pick a little bit of everything!",2012-04-03 18:47:12

Driving up, I felt like I reached a desert oasis built for the elite. The lush grounds are warm and inviting, and the lobby is something to marvel at. Plan to hang out at the big community table, where they host nightly wine tastings and coffee and tea get togethers in the morning. The staff at the front desk was extremely helpful and they really made me feel welcome after a VERY late drive from Tucson.

My room was huge: Fit for a king. There was plenty of space to spread out my clothing and work gear. The bathroom area was also spacious, the mini bar was stocked, and the modern conveniences like the flat screen TV, free wireless internet (for In Touch Members) and ipod docking station made it a super comfy home away from home. I'm not really a ""froo-froo"" person when it comes to soaps and things, but it's worth mentioning that the Firesky is stocked with Aveda body products, all the more reason to get dirty and get showered.

The staff was truly interested in making my stay pleasurable. One morning when the gentleman at the front desk called with my wakeup call (yeah, REAL people call you, like in ye olden days!) he asked me if I wanted to hear my horoscope. HOW COOL?! 

Only thing that put out my fire a little? I was a little weirded out that I had to drive to my room, as in, the rooms are separate from the lobby and reception area. At first it felt a little ""Holiday Inn"" to me, but after the first night I warmed up to the idea of being a little more removed and chocked it up to being a bit more private.

The springrolls were just OK. The rice paper was a bit dry, but I did love the peanut sauce. That was fabulous! I got the Happy Pancake as my meal and still, not impressed. The pork was a little rubbery and the meal overall was fairly bland. The dipping sauce almost seemed pointless. I started using the leftover peanut sauce to make it more tasty. Meh.

What is unique about this sushi joint is that you can customize your maki. I opted to try that and it was quite fun to choose ingredients and build my own roll. They make it pretty straightforward by giving you a piece of paper which states all the options very clearly. I also ordered their Chicken Karaage appetizer. It came with a garnish of green onions and garlic mayo sauce which had a sweet hint to it. I really liked this! The chicken was juicy and crispy and the sauce complemented it very well. 

The service was amazing. The owner, Rob, is very friendly and really appreciates his customers. He even gave everyone in the restaurant a few samples of other rolls to taste so we know what else they have to offer.

1.  If you are watching a game during any part of the day, bring a shade tent if you have little ones, older folks or just don't want to bake.  There are some shade trees but you may end up far from the action.
 Also don't forget chairs if you are watching soccer or football.
2.  If you are hauling lots of sports gear, bring a wagon as you might have a long haul depending which field your kids game is going on.  Parking is north of fields.  Fortunately the baseball fields are close.
3.  Bring frisbees, ball and gloves, football, basketball or volleyball to keep your non participants busy.
4.  Bring toilet paper.  I had to take to restroom a couple times and people aren't clean at times.

Wild boar and polenta was also quite tasty, though I didn't like the polenta as much. Rich and substantial, the boar and meatballs were quite filling.

House-made Spaghetti all'Amartriciana
House-made spaghetti all'amatriciana was really, really, good. We pined a little for bucatini instead of spaghetti, but it was only a minor gripe. Had this again recently and it was still so tasty.

Pappardelle w/Braised Oxtail
I love my pappardelle and this pappardelle with braised oxtail and rosemary was a solid dish.

Salted-Caramel Budino
And then, my favourite of the night: salted caramel budino. With crunchy chocolate meringue and salted caramel sauce, this is the best dessert I've had in recent memory. Just a lovely melding of texture and sweet and salty and chocolate. Good enough that I had wanted to stop by after visiting The Black Hoof the next day. Except that Campagnolo is closed on Mondays. Had this again recently too, and the taste was the same, though the pudding texture wasn't as good as the last time.

It's hard to pin-point what is so good about Campagnolo. With high points for food (more dishes in the gallery below), interesting notes for decor, and an all-around comforting vibe that the space exudes, I'm not sure it really matters.

The location is small inside and seemed to be busy the entire time we were there.  There is also patio seating that will accommodate once the weather warms up a bit.  I had excellent service.  The gentleman helping us was very helpful since we told him it was our first time in.  

I had ordered the grilled garlic shrimp plate.  It was accompanied with feta fries and pita bread.   Delicious!  There were 2 skewers of shrimp with 4 on each.   This was definitely plenty to fill my stomach.  Not to mention the outstanding fries.  This was my first time having these and I love feta cheese.  Yum.   My plate also came with a side salad which I didn't finish.  The dressing was a little bit much and overpowering.  But overall it was great.   

I had asked the gentlemen if they had lemon potatoes since they weren't on the menu.   They do!  You just have to ask them to make them.  I might just have to go back soon to try those out!

Random fact: peridot is August's birthstone...my birthstone. I was meant to be here on my birth month...destiny!

The shop is so cute with a cabinet full of colorful cake stands...pretty chandelier, modern furniture and the pretty desserts. I was ready to sink my sweet tooth into one of those Nutella macarons so I marched to the counter only to find out they didn't have them. Goodbye hopes and dreams! My heart sank...why let me down on my birth month??? I was so perky when we first walked in then all of a sudden, my mood changed and my world crumbled.

I set my focus on the next best thing: Nutella cupcake. The chef must have felt my pain and so they told me ""we can make you Nutella macarons. We have the shells already made, we just need the filling."" Yaaaaaay!!! Happiness was restored. I got a dozen Nutella macarons.

While waiting for my macarons, I was eating my Nutella cupcake. The frosting was soooo good. The cupcake itself was a tad bit dry. So I ate the top half with the frosting and shared with a friend. I make the same cupcakes but I've been to lazy to make anything these days and now, I have Peridot, I have no need to bake.

The Nutella macarons were ok. I was expecting they'd mix Nutella with something else to make the filling but they didn't. It was straight up Nutella from the jar. The shells were sticking to my teeth. But because they took the time to whip up a batch just for me, I still like them and I very much appreciate the effort.",2013-08-18 23:18:53

There are a number of excellent day hikes, and even better rock scrambles.  Red Rock is also one of the premier destinations in the United States for rock climbing.  There's bicycling, mountain biking, and horseback riding (although not necessarily within park boundaries).  It's a popular place, and certain areas can get crowded.  However, all you need do is hike a couple of miles, and the crowds are gone.  Go rock scrambling, and you may see no one else for hours.

If such strenuous physical activity isn't your idea of a vacation, there's also a 13 mile road that loops through the park.  Is the drive worth it?  If you haven't seen much western U.S. desert and mountain scenery, then yes.  However, the view from the road isn't as dramatic as at places like Valley of Fire, Zion National Park, or Death Valley.  You really need to get out into the park to appreciate it.

UPDATE as of September 2007: There was a major rainstorm recently, which had a dramatic effect on some of the routes at Red Rock. In the area above Brownstone Canyon, torrents of water washed down an amazing amount of rock. A very narrow slot canyon was mostly filled in, with at least 10 or 15 feet of gravel; large trees are now buried up to major limbs. Another part of the area used to be filled with scrub; part of it now looks like a bulldozer created a gravel road, 30 feet or more across. Amazing!",2007-06-28 15:34:54

It always amazes me how many employees are just mulling about at this store, none of which will lift a hand to provide any service. 

Kudos to the guy at the security podium for saying hello but that's where the love fest ends. 

My first purchase here was an MP3 player which I returned since the Associate who helped me pick it out volunteered information that wasn't even close to accurate. 

My next purchase an entertainment center which I needed to be ""smart"" since I don't have a ""smart"" tv. This time it cost me $800 to realize that once again the associate sold me a bill of goods that wasn't close to accurate. Luckily for me, he owned up to his sale and after 2 more trips and some help from a manager I was actually given a plug-in faub which essentially upgraded the system to be ""smart"". Not exactly what I wanted but it was a fix. 

My last trip was using their website and purchasing a desktop. My goal was to upgrade the system with compatible ram, a monitor, external drive and a printer. As I stood in line to take delivery of my system the clerk there was on the phone. There was literally no one else in the pick up line yet 10 minutes ticked by with this clerk still on the phone. I was amazed at just how many other employees either passed me by or were engaged in conversations with each other while I waited and waited on this ONE guy.  

Eventually I got the attention of the pick up clerk and with him still on the phone, he motioned for my receipt. He literally waved his fingers in the air like a mime. I handed him my printed receipt, he got my computer, and dropped it on the counter. Still on the phone he handed me a paper to sign and without missing a beat waved a hand at me as if to say thank you for coming. 

Not the best start to my experience, but hey, I still need a few extra items. As I make my way further into the store I run into an employee, and I ask her who I should talk to about buying some upgrades. She points to the guy on the phone at the counter I just left. Umm yeah, I have no clue how to mime ""printer"". Its time to cut my losses. I head right to the returns desk. A few minutes later I am on my way to Frys a few exits away where I should have started.

Now I know better. I literally have to pass this Best Buy every time I head over to Frys and I can't help but wonder if they may be better now. Should I try just one more time. Nah.

I was pretty content sitting there watching the news and eating chips and salsa waiting for my burito to be prepared then i was asked to step up and pick what i wanted on my burito.  When i stepped up i was greeted by a massive burito full of mexican flavor, and the person was answering my question about each topping or garnish so i was sure to have a burito perfect for my palet.  Now that was pretty awesome.  So when it was all wrapped up on a plate this thing was massive.  I've had a few buritos, but not one the size of this thing.  Talk about man vs. food.  This time the burito won, I just couldnt finish it all.  I tried, the flavor was excellent, and everything was fresh and tasty, and i love the cheese they put in there.

They have everything to electronics, washer and dryers, clothes, workout equipment, shoes, kitchen appliances, school supplies, bathroom and bedroom decorations and appliances.

The longer the item has been around the higher discount you will get. That is what makes this place a bargain! When you decide to come make sure you give yourself plenty of time to shop around because it is easy to spend an hour or two looking for deals!!

Recently I had a strong craving for some bubble teas and finally found this place in the neighborhood. There aren't too many boba joints in the East Valley.
It was so good, I ended up buying two bobas, each with a mix of two different flavors. One I got was a snow slush and the other just a regular slush, with the snow slush being a bit creamier and tarter than your regular slush.
I also got them to add some coconut jelly, which tasted great alongside the boba.

Until I've had a bad experience or meal, I know what I like. While Garcia's may not be the best or most original Mexican restaurant I've dined at, it's never failed to satisfy.

The Thomas Road location is close to work so I've enjoyed enough lunches here over the last few years. Today, a co-worker chose Garcia's from a short list of suggestions to go celebrate his birthday. He got no argument from me.

I like the look of this location. It's a good example of ""subdued"" Mexican style. It's classy, comfortable and always clean. We were seated as soon as we stepped in and were greeted by Lauren (our server) right away. She did a wonderful job too. As soon as our drinks were dropped off, she took our orders.

We ordered Edamame, calamari, and 6 rolls.   We are still not sure why we ordered 6, but the prices were so low we assumed they would be smaller portions like you get at other happy hours.  WRONG

We had so much food we ended up setting up a buffet on the next table! 

Apart from the Tropicana roll, which had some weird apricot gel on it... everything was seriously good!

Important Notes: CASH ONLY!

This place is pretty much a completely ad-hoc restaurant. You walk in, no menu is served, it's on a plastic stand on a table with limited choice (Wonton, Fish ball or beef noodle soup or non-soup), vegetables with oyster sauce and that's pretty much it. Also nothing is actually served except the food, so you gotta get up from your lazy ass and serve yourself some tea (meh I guess I can do that but it makes me pretty reluctant in providing any tip!).

Now one thing about this place that it's known for and that is it's INSANE SPEED!! You can be in and out of this place in less than 10 minutes flat if you're in a rush! My friends and co-workers had constantly told me about the ridiculous speeds at which they serve their food here so I decided to actually time it to see if they were bullshitting me or not. KID YOU NOT, we ordered 2 wonton noodle soups and a plate of chinese vegetables with oyster sauce. The timing is as follows:

30 SECONDS AFTER ORDER: Vegatables Served!!!!

25 SECONDS AFTER VEGETABLES: Both wonton noodles soups Served!! 

Yes you read that right, nearly A MINUTE after walking into the restaurant we were already served our food!

The place looks better than it did before but considering the amount of time it took to reopen, I expected more of a transformation.  It is clean, freshly painted, old bar gone and an inordinately large bussing area added.  Some pictures on the wall, but nothing to deliberately add anything meaningful to the decor. The bakery is almost sparse of baked goods--just a few trays of cookies, but no slices of cakes or pastries one might expect in an italian bakery. 
We were served complimentary hot bread & butter.  We couldn't decide at the table whether it was good or not, but I thought it was.  Later on when they brought another seeded roll, it was agreed that the seeded bread was really good.  Entrees came with small salads consisting of iceberg lettuce, one slice of tomato, thinly chopped black olives and one pepperocini pepper.  Everybody loved that little pepper.  The salad was mundane but it was nice of them to offer one with the entree. 
Ordered Fettucini Alfredo, eggplant parmagiana which came with spaghetti and one order of chicken cutlet/eggplant combination without cheese (also came with spaghetti).  We were so impressed with the portions when they arrived--except for the fettucini alfredo.  Although it was just pasta (no meat or veggies in it), the portion seems awfully small for a pasta dish.  In addition, salt had to be added to it to make it edible.  Somebody under salted the pasta water.  Very important when making pasta  I also noticed that the pasta was not drained properly which caused the alfredo sauce to become watery.  Other than that the other two dishes were very good.  Hubby was really happy with the eggplant/chicken combination and I was happy with the eggplant--really nicely prepared.  Frankly, for me the red sauce was not stellar but it was enough to satisfy most pallets, including my husbands.

While we were eating, we noticed many groups being turned away because reservations took up the restaurant - even bar seats were reserved! 

As their logo is a chicken (while Kinton's is a pig for pork!), their main skewers consisted of chicken parts. Now, I say chicken parts because there is really no limit to what they skewer from the chicken. Rare finds include: chicken tail, chicken oyster (ie. chicken testicles), chicken gizzard and chicken neck. Most chicken and pork skewers range from $1.30 - $2 but the beef skewers range all the way up to $9 for a Wagyu beef skewer

Yakitori Kintori grills their skewers using Binchotan technique which is a traditional Japanese charcoal that burns at a very low temperature for a longer period. This results in less smoke from the charcoal which is perfect (and much more preferred) for indoor restaurants.

ON TO OUR FAVOURITE DISHES OF THE NIGHT:

- KITSUNE UDON ($7 for 3) deep fried tofu & udon noodle in dashi broth
This was one of the most unique dishes of the night! We were really confused when the dish came because we ordered this expected a bowl of soup udon. Imagine our surprise when we realized the udon is actually wrapped in the deep fried tofu and served in a delicious dashi broth. Adored the presentation of it all and it was really odd biting into a tofu and getting a mouthful of noodles instead. 

- CHICKEN KAARAGE ($6) skewered deep fried chicken
 Guu's karaage never fails to impress and this karaage fell nothing short of our expectations of Guu's.

- DEKITATE TOFU ($7) tofu prepared at your table
This is a MUST ORDER. We were really excited to try this dish because the tofu is prepared fresh tableside. Not only is the dish fun because they prepare it table side but holy cow, this tofu is the softest tofu I have ever eaten. It is served with a white salt and a smoked salt, which was absolutely HEAVEN. Give the tofu 10 minutes to cook, then scoop it into your bowls. A really nice break from meat and fish.

- NONKOTSU KAARAGE ($5.5) deep fried knee cartilage
This is another of our family favourites - we LOVE chicken knee cartilage. While this was really good, we were missing the distinct crunch from the cartilage. But we would order this again in a second.. In fact, we were going to if we weren't so full!

- HOUJI CHA CREME BRULEE ($5) Green tea creme brulee
A definite recommend! The tea-flavoured is unreal and does not taste like the artificial tea you typically taste in supermarket green tea ice cream . It really, really tastes like a cup of tea. Very enjoyable and ended our meal on a very sweet note.

- BEER SORBET ($5) Sapporo beer sorbet
For beer fanatics, this is your saviour. It is a very strong taste of beer with the same bitterness. Very refreshing and enjoyable but it is not for everyone. If you're not the type of person to drink beer, you probably won't enjoy this.

There were some hits and misses but we will definitely be stopping by Yakitori Kintori again. Service is on point but it is more of an eat and go restaurant rather than a long lengthy dinner like JaBistro. This is NOT the place for a bunch of hungry men. Like Guu, while each plate is cheap on its own, it is very easy to rack up the bill.

Got there around 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and the tables were filling up quickly.  Cute decor, island music and nice youthful ambience.  I was feeling good...but not for long.  
Chips and pico were served. Took a quick glance at the menu and knew what I wanted.  Fish tacos!  What else?  The place bears the name so it must be their specialty, right?  Wrong!!  I ordered the blackened mahi fish tacos.  ($10.50 for 2 tacos +1 side).  They were wrong in all senses of the word.  Where do I even begin... 
Ok, so the plate looked nice but the fish was dry and warm (I like my food hot unless its supposed to be cold).  It had absolutely no flavor.  Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of ""white cilantro sauce"" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess.
For my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!

They currently have a special where you can choose an appetizer (anything except the crab cakes, shrimps, or sweet potato fries), a main (anything except for the steak), and a dessert for $28. If you want the crab cakes or sweet potato fries, they are willing to give it as a side (smaller portion- one crab cake vs three etc.). There's another option where you can pick the steak and either one appetizer or dessert for $32. We all opted for the $28 meal cause it's a good deal. Even if you get a la carte, the deal is cheaper! Well as long as you don't want three crab cakes ;) 

The food was delicious. Is a fusion of Canadian, Italian (kind of),  and asian. I had beet salad, cod, and mixed berries cake. Sooo yummy.

Their Thai noodle soup is unique and the large chicken or seafood Tom Yum can serve even as an entree. Best of all, most, if not, all of their dishes are around $6-8, making for a much more affordable meal than Lotus. My one complaint from my last visit was their mango sweet sticky rice, which was less than par.

Noodles (forgot what kind) - pretty good
Calamari salad - pretty tasty
Beef dumpling appetizer - okay, nothing special
Short rib  - tender and okay
Lamb off the ribs - alright

Most of these appetizers were ~$20 each. Granted the portions were slightly bigger to accomodate family style, but c'mon who charges $20 per appetitizer for something like dumplings and noodles?!

We went there for a late lunch one Sunday. The place was not busy so we were seated right away at a nice breezy table and the waitress immediately brought a water bowl out for our pooch, which was very nice. The service throughout our visit was very accommodating (which is the only reason this is a 3-star review not a 2-star one). However, we were incredibly unimpressed by the food.

We specifically asked about the Crispy Asian Glazed Brussels Sprouts appetizer, and the waitress raved about them. So we ordered them, but wish we had sent them back as soon as they got to the table. They were NOT crispy. In fact they were mushy and gross. I've had better brussels sprouts out of my own freezer. They were also overly sauced. Definitely not worth the $8 price tag.

We also each ordered the Strawberry Salad and both added Shrimp as a protein. The salad was fine, nothing to rave about, but was a bit small for an entree salad. $16 for a salad with shrimp is within the range I'd expect to pay, but it simply wasn't very delicious. 

After tax and tip, both my husband and I agreed that this meal was not even close to being worth the $50+ we spent, and we had no interest in eating there ever again. 

I can see how the place would be nice for drinking and watching a game on the many TVs, but it's just not up to snuff when it comes to the quality of their food. (I blame an overly active microwave that they're definitely using instead of an oven or grill for items like the brussels sprouts and the shrimp that went on our salads).",2018-08-15 11:44:17

I don't think i fully embrace the whole tex-mex concept. I ordered the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash and two poached eggs and it didn't look anything like I expected it to. They were two huge meatball looking things with eggs on top and a hollandaise sauce with a weird spicy sauce on top of that. The whole concept of this dish seemed like a good idea adding in the sweet with the salty but the bites of chicken and hash were a little heavy handed.

We ate: 

- Nachos: Whoa I've never gotten nachos from a bar with so much cheese! They definitely don't skip - there had to be 1/4 inch of cheese covering each chip (yum). I didn't really like that the nacho toppings were served separately on the side which meant a lot of dipping & paying attention to the food instead of the game. 
- Garden burger: I love that they have real veggie burgers but mine was very soggy & undercooked. The bun it came on was amazing, super thick and bready and delicious. The creamy sauce, cheese, & toppings were heavy but perfect for drinking food. 
- French Dip Sandwich: My boyfriend got this and thought it was fine but nothing too special. 
- Beer Battered Fries: Yum. I was hoping they would a little more battered & thick, but instead it was a very light crunchiness on the outside of the fry. Still a very grubbing snack.

Walking in to the market, the place smelled brand new. Give it a couple weeks until it gets that unique Filipino supermarket smell. Grill City is the very first restaurant you'll see to the right when you step inside. The communal dining area is very clean after only being open for less than a week, so we'll see how it goes as time passes by. 

For lunch, I opted for their #1 Combo: 1 bbq skewer with rice for $8.50. The marinade on the bbq pork is sweet, but not overpowering. Light coating for sure which my face appreciated for less the mess after eating. Nice big slices of the pork on a 12"" bamboo skewer.  

A la Carte Mungo - nice thick stew-like consistency, instead of the watery versions you get at other restaurants. Love the big pieces of greens inside.

A la Carte Chicken Adobo - not a fan. They use chicken drumsticks and very oily. Lacks the vinegar tang that I'm used to from other places. Definitely skip this for my next visit.

A la Carte Pancit Bihon - rice noodles that is not over cooked, greatly seasoned with no need to add a squeeze of lemon,  but it would be great if they provided a wedge. Generous cuts of vegetables which I love. I wonder if they can do half rice half pancit for my next visit?

A la Carte Calamansi Juice - avoid! Very watered down. Such a waste of money. 

After filling my lunch tray and sitting down,  I was not a fan of the long style dining table. For a brand new place, the table was very unstable. Not the best if it gets full and I just foresee a  accident waiting to happen.

Recently I checked into Flamingo hotel for the New Year celebration due to its location and availability. I guess when they remodeled the casino, they forgot to do the same thing to their rooms.

When I walked into the room, the stench was horrible (think stale cigar/weed + old damp furniture + extremely dusty ventilation vent + yucky nasty rug) and everything was so old and outdated, that it looks like something you would see at low cost motel back in the 1980"". My friends and I literally said ""we paid $500 for this shit""? Since we checked in late on New Year eve and we were tired and thinking we wouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway, we decided to let it be and go have fun.

Anyway, when we came back to the room at 3 am, the smell got so bad that we couldn't even sleep. We decided to check out and drove home to sleep. While we were driving, I was shaking my head and just couldn't believe that a major casino would let their rooms be that bad. SMH",2015-02-03 22:28:56

We hit Krung last night after doing an ""Open Now"" search on Yelp at 2 a.m.. After eliminating all of the usual casino coffeeshops (with their limited late-night menus) and deciding against a drive to Jean to try the all-night buffet (summer break = Teachers Eating Wild!),Krung it was.

""Wait, didn't this building used to be Satay?"" My husband had been bugging me to go to Satay ever since trying their chicken sticks at the International Food Fair. (Translation: 2007.) Well, look honey, you finally got your wish.

I was rubbing my hands in anticipation because my love affair with Marnee Thai, also in ""Chinatown"" and also open in the very wee hours, was cut short on the second visit when we found the menu, ownership, and seemingly the chef had all changed. Noooo! We were supposed to be the Brangelina of late-night Thai. Shari + Marnee =... Sharnee! A portmanteau for the foodie ages! But now I had a second chance at finding late-night Thai love. (Shari + Krung =... Shrung? Hm.)

Right away I was struck by the pleasant, spacious decor. (Space is a big deal with me. It's an only-child thing.) We were seated in a long, cushy booth by the little stage where bouncy remixes were blasting. A customer soon came over to turn it up even louder. Eeek. The cushions in the booth were shaking like we were playing the Top Gun slot and just got the bonus game. Then a waiter hurried back to turn it down; we gave him an appreciative nod. Then he came back to turn it up again, asking us if it was okay. Awkward. At this point we were the only people sitting by the stage, and the few other patrons across the room didn't appear to be the partying type. We shrugged it off as Krung's ""thing"" and got used to it. If the restaurant had been busier, though, the overall noise may have been too much.

Several reviews of Krung complain about the promptness of the service. Our two servers were polite and swift with refills. Absolutely no problems there.

We ordered large. We're never too proud to get to-go boxes for tomorrow's lunch. Fried tofu, chicken satay sticks, fresh (not fried, although that's available) spring rolls, pad thai with tofu, and basil with chicken. Although I'm disappointed every time I go to a Thai restaurant and they don't have summer rolls like Panna Thai does, the menu was nicely varied and much on par with Archi's in that regard.

Fried Tofu: The best I've had in Las Vegas. Definitely crispy, pieces not so large that the center is gooey, and I really liked the usual sourish sauce with a heavy layer of peanuts on top. 

Chicken Satay Sticks: And these were, according to my husband, the worst in Las Vegas. Ever. Bland. Kind of cold. ""Tasted like they'd been microwaved, and not very well."" The satay sauce was not unlike unsalted peanut butter.

Fresh Spring Rolls: Huge! Imagine a double-fistful of salad wrapped in lettuce, and the salad is deliciously aromatic with a spicy crunch. Fun to try, but hard to eat, and we definitely didn't need four of these giant things. (Came with the same satay sauce in quasi-shot glasses with peanuts on top. We eventually started dipping them in the bowl of sauce that came with the fried tofu instead - much easier to manage.)

Basil: I'll let my husband review that one on his own, but he liked it.

Pad Thai with Tofu: I know, not very adventurous, but I just love pad thai. The tofu seemed to be fried first then cut up, making for some unfried sides, which is not how I prefer it, but it was still good, especially since the tofu pieces were small. 

I asked for the heat to be ""7, maybe 6-7,"" and I feel they nailed that perfectly. That said, on a few occasions I crunched into a tiny pepper-pocket that must've still had seeds, as my tongue nearly blistered right off. I don't seem to get that problem elsewhere.

Overall, the flavours mixed well to suffuse the entire dish, and I can honestly say this is the only pad thai I've had in a long time where I didn't seek out all of the tofu bits to eat first.

As good as the service was, we did have a timing problem after all. Our two main dishes came out within a few minutes of our appetizers, so we had almost no time to linger and enjoy the ""courses."" Instead it was like a tableside buffet. Luckily we'd realized at this point that we'd prefer a quick meal, but if it had been a more normal hour and we'd not been on the tired side, this would've been disappointing.

Overall, Krung is a place I will delight in visiting after-hours, but when the sun is up, it's still going to be Panna Thai, Archi's, and maybe Pin Kaow II for me.",2011-06-30 04:09:45

The inside is very open and with only four small tables, with four chairs each, it's understandable. It is well lit and very clean. You have easy access to see the menu and the frozen custard options. This location has two soft serve machine each with two flavors and one ""twist"" option that combines the two. You also have 12-14 water ice ( a supper smooth Italian ice) flavor options and just so you know, if you choose a fruit flavor one, say watermelon, you also get pieces of the fresh fruit in your ice! My favorite option is a Gelati where they layer the soft serve frozen custard with the water ice! So yummy and so refreshing in these summer months. For those with a super sweet tooth you can also add toppings like jimmies (aka sprinkles) or have candy mix-ins, like a blizzard from DQ, that is called Blendini.

Don't be shy to ask for samples, its hard to choose from all the flavors, so expect to visit more than once as they do rotate their flavor options. For those a little more health conscious, Rita's does offer a low fat custard option and two sugar free water ice flavors.

I believe their menu claims to be the ""most authentic mandarin, hunan, and schezwan in town"" but seeing that I am from none of those backgrounds, I can't really tell if that's true. The food didn't give me a stomach ache so to me that is good enough for 3 stars, though it's a bit salty.

The food is ridiculously cheap, with lunch plates running for only $5 (including entree, soup, egg roll, fried rice, fried chicken and a crab puff). The other combos are only about $7. We all had different plates since some people didn't want to do it family style and make use of our lazy susan! Everyone seemed pretty satisfied and my friend who had the house special duck really enjoyed his meal. I liked my combo of shrimp and vegetables. They didn't skimp on the shrimp 

Too bad there were only 2 other customers aside from our group of 7. I think they should get more business.

The décor inside is very nice.. clean and rustic. Plenty of seating and very nice for larger group get together as they have long benches and tables. 

The drinks on the other hand were a huge disappointment. Royaltea was the first in the GTA to offer lightbulb drinks.. but these lightbulbs are pretty much solely for picture purposes.. You do not get to keep them.. unless you want to pay a premium. I'd much rather have a disposable cup as it is much more hygienic.

I ordered a Grapefruit Green Tea (it was available on R, L and Supercup sizes on the menu.. but the girl told me they only have it in Supercup.. not sure why but ok, fine...).. ended up costing $7.50 for this drink.. absolutely ridiculous for something that was half foam in a tall, skinny plastic cup. WTF.

My second drink was the Roasted Oolong Pearl Milk Tea -- orders this 30% sugar and it tasted exactly like regular sweetness Chatime Roasted Milk Tea.. way too sweet for my liking and nothing special.

Definitely more on the American modern style setting. Kinda gives a feel for a wing house dining setting especially with all the large flat screen TVs located all around the restaurant. Food was delicious. Service was a little bit slow. I felt like the server could have checked on us more often. 

We order two appetizers: the fish tacos and pork belly buns. Our tacos came out first, and the buns were still missing. I had to ask the server if it was still coming out because she came to bring our entrees which was the pork chop combination rice plate and I had the shaken steak and egg with tomato rice. So I was a little disappointed the belly buns came out last considering I ordered it as an appetizer. Why is it even an appetizer of it's gonna come out AFTER my entree? that why I'm giving it 4stars verses the 5. Feel like the ball was dropped there.

Out of all the items we ordered... All though my shaken steak was great, it wasn't phenomenal. It was a little too oily, although the flavor and taste was great. Even though I will be back for it. I think the one that really stuck out for me... Flavor and taste wise was the fish tacos. I must say it was to be one of the best fish tacos I've had.

Whether you're wearing shorts and a tee shirt or a three piece suit, you're treated like royalty. Despite this, the restaurant effortlessly balances what could easily become a very formal meal into a relaxed and enjoyable experience. 

Continuing the top notch theme, the food is smart and special. There were interesting concoctions all over the menu from sweet to savory, and it's all incredible right down to the butter!

After you valet the car (you have to- it's the only option) you walk into an outdoor area very similar to postino Arcadia.  Head inside and be greeted by a lovely hostess.  We sat at the bar with a carafe of wine.  All wine is served in a carafe, ala on tap style.  I like this.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant in a super chic way that you can observe what is going on around you and kinda hideout or be seen- the choice is yours.  

We were seated in what I think was the best seats in the house.  It was in a corner booth that was right at the corner of the restaurant.  Once we all slid into our booth seats, we all agreed it was like hunkering down in a basement somewhere on a leather couch.   We were introduced to Dan, the super slim, urban hipster server with a nice face and a witty personality.  When asked if my burger would be better with fries or mac n cheese, he asked me how often I eat burgers with mac n cheese? uhh, so yeah, I ordered the mac n cheese--- GREAT choice! 

We started with the Smorgash board that had pita, cheese, the most kale chips and largest kale chips I have ever seen, hummus, some veggies and smoked salmon-- it was interesting enough, but I probably won't be ordering that again.  But since they just opened, I am happy to try anything on the menu!

Entrees included the waldorf salad that was only so-so, it was called ""a bit too much"" by a friend, the Barley salad was a huge hit as was the corn chowder.  My burger was good, I recommend going easier on the caramelized onions.  I felt like it started to taste more like a dessert before I even got half way through it.

After we ate, relaxed and Dan check on us the perfect amount of time, we walked through and headed next door to Churn for dessert.  We passed the bar, said hello to a few friends we ran into, observed the outdoor seating one more time, and then walked though a hallway decorated in old cassette tapes, that was awesome!   At the end of the hallway was a bathroom marked ""ladies and gents""- I absolutely despise shared bathrooms.  So that grossed me out thoroughly.

Both times I got one of their yummy mojitos, fresh guacamole, and two different tacos. I've tried the tinga chicken, classic chicken, blackened fish, and one of the seasonal specials at the time that had zucchini and other veggies with a spicy aioli. I think the size of the tacos is perfect because you can have two, possible three if you wanted to go Wild, and get to try several of the unique flavor combination choices. I've had the guac with tomato and goat cheese and mango and goat cheese, clearly I think the goat cheese mixes well with the creamy avocado. I also love how they give you normal tortilla chips but also plantain chips, which weirded me out at first but have a great crunch and saltiness like a normal chip. 

If you've never been, they tell you their history and explain that their style is more South American than Mexican. So I'm thinking this could be the only reason people have been disappointed and wrote bad reviews. If you're expecting authentic Mexican, it is definitely a different style of food.

Inside all light fixtures are actual lamps with lamp shades which was interesting.  My issue is actually the table (or it may have been the table we were at), the table itself is with a plastic sticky mat which covers the entire table, so it holds plates well, but that means you can't slide plates around if you wanted to share with others, you would need to lift your plate and pass it.

It comes with a few mushroom slices on top (maybe 5), lots of green peas, yes, peas not beans and a very potato cubes.

We also had the upstream benny (smoked salmon, pickled red onion, basil hollandaise) which was served on a waffle.

'Chile Relleno' Empanadas - cheesy, bland flavor
Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings- my favorite thing we tried, but my husband was annoyed by the presentation (served in Asain soup spoons)
Broccolini with garlic, soy, chile- strong on the soy sauce, but pretty good

Sadly, as big as it may look when you walk in, it's actually smaller than the other locations in town. The center of the store being mostly home accents is a bummer because I'd rather have more ""hobby"" options than home decor. I do love the home decor HL has to offer and have many things decorated in my home from HL however I ordered all of that online from their website. I have found that there is a larger variety of home decor, craft and hobby selection on the website and it comes packaged well and not dinged up or broken like many of the items are in the stores. I have also seen the same items online for 70% off that are 50% or less in the store. Keep that in mind when making an expensive purchase and you can still use the 40% off one regular priced item online as well. The Hobby Lobby on Rainbow near Lake Mead is larger, cleaner and the employees are more helpful and knowledgeable about the items in each department than at this location on Decatur.

While walking around the store it looked dirty and cramped. There were broken ornaments on the floor making it hard to get my cart around in those spots I came up on. I do cake decorating and was really bummed to see all the Sunny Side Up (I believe it's a hobby lobby brand but could be wrong) baking stuff. I've tried that brand and it's poor quality compared to Wilton and other known brands. If you hold up a cake pan by both Wilton and Sunny Side Up you will see the difference in quality, a lot of the pans are thinner copycats of the Wilton stuff. I did score several Wilton pans and tools from the clearance section that I was very pleased with. The spray paint in the craft section is way overpriced compared to Walmart and they carry Krylon (I prefer rustoleum) which has the nozzle most people don't like. Walmart carries both Krylon and Rustoleum.

If you like Wilton brand products check out Michael's because they have a big selection and not just that, but they have items by Wilton that are exclusive to Michael's only. Michael's offers the same 40% off coupon as well often offers 20% off your total including sale items. They also give a military discount which Hobby lobby does not. 

They have no lights on any of the registers making it hard to know which one is open. The area where you put your merchandise at is small making it awkward for the customer as well the cashier when trying to unload items from the cart if you have a lot of stuff. 

I used to really love Hobby Lobby, but have seen it change so much over the years with them changing out known brands for their own and not offering the classes at each location like they once did. Consistency is key. I'll definitely stop back by Hobby Lobby for sale items after different holidays, but more than likely I will go to one of the other stores that isn't so cramped among other things.",2015-11-07 16:17:44

The restaurant itself is on the small side and somewhat tucked into the back corner of the complex. Inside you'll find a modern, but homey and inviting feel. There's minimal seating alongside a fairly small bar, and I'd imagine there's going to be a wait during peak times...but, it's worth it.

In addition to their regular menu, they've also got a daily special board that hangs on the wall towards the back of the restaurant. It looks like many items rotate, but on our visit there were some non-standard specials, including $1 oysters. There's plenty of options between the two, and even a few things for those who don't eat seafood. Had my stomach been able to take it, I would have likely ordered everything on the menu. Instead, our party of 3 decided to share a few things...

Spicy Edamame - Per my 6 years olds request, we started we these. Solid starter, but they live up to their name. They've got a kick, and were too much for him. I'm a sucker for spicy food though, and couldn't stop eating them. I like that they use a dry seasoning, opposed to a spicy sauce like you find at a lot of other spots.

$1 Bluepoint Oysters - Juicy, plump, delicious...and cheap. We ordered these with two of their sauces, the Pickled Pepper & Habanero, and Ponzu Salsa. Neither did much for my taste. The habanero flavor was basically nonexistent in the first, and although the salsa had great flavor, I didn't think either were complimenting the oyster well. I see their sauces get great praise, so maybe they were just off on our visit? 

Oyster Foi Rockefeller - I'm not one to order oyster rockefeller normally, but with foie in the mix, I couldn't resist. Then they came out, we ate them, and asked eachother ""where's the foie?"". I've seen pictures of these, and ours looked like they had maybe half of the foie others had, maybe less. Maybe just off on our visit, but based on it, I wouldn't order them again.

White Fish Ceviche - Paired with perfectly crisped sweet potato chips, this is a must try in my opinion. Unlike the prior sauce, the ceviche had a very present, but enjoyable habanero kick. The fresh cilantro was a nice balance, and they aren't skimpy with the fish. When you run out of chips, it's delicious on it's own...trust me on this one.

Amberjack Crudo - Quite possibly their most popular dish, and for good reason. Fresh, tender fish and a delicious sauce with a little bit of sweetness, and a little kick. This was my first time having amberjack, and thanks to Other Mama, I'm constantly craving it and will order it anytime a restaurant has it.

Live Scallop - Excellent! Sliced thin, but still with a nice, rich, tender and buttery taste. Absolutely delicious on it's own, and so good that even my 6 year old couldn't stop eating it. 

Overall, pretty much everything we had was great, and aside from the oyster foie, I'd order everything again in a heartbeat. Must tries in my opinion are the ceviche, amberjack and live scallop. 

Unfortunately, our service wasn't quite as excellent. Our waitress seemed a little rushed, like our questions were bothering her. Since we got seated with only a couple other tables full, it was a bit disappointing. We also had one of the bussers take two of our plates that had food on them, without asking if we were done. Just walked straight up to our table, grabbed them quick, and was gone. Our food was up without a hitch, and our drinks stayed full, but service was nothing to write home about.

A few little hiccups, but still an extremely enjoyable experience for me. Other Mama has only been open less than 3 months, and mine is just one of the many of positive reviews that keep flowing in. If you've yet to come here, stop procrastinating.",2015-05-29 21:51:41

Our server finally arrives and apologizes as it was a ""food rush"" (okay, 1:30pm is not exactly ""lunch time""). Firstly, there are too many menus. We were given 3 menus to choose from (lunch specials, specials, regular menu). Food arrives in separate deliveries (lunch orders should arrive together; this is not a-la-carte). The sweet-and-sour soup was good, not too spicy. The wonton soup lacked flavor. One of the menus seemed to list authentic ""home town cooking"" (if you like sheep intestines). 

Food was okay overall, definitely not a '5' as many have raved. Sub-standard service brings this rating down from a would-be ""4"". Bad experience, won't return.",2018-05-30 16:13:00

However, if you live close by and want something to feed the family that is ok and relatively cheap, this a good place. It''s very loud inside and the decor is very busy but nice. 

My reason for one start is because three times now we have ordered to go food and it seems that our dish was sabotaged each time! Twice came without chicken and all twice with the bread being super cold as taken out of a freezer recently. One time came swimming in sauce and it became disgusting to eat. 

I called the restaurant for one of the occasions. They didn't act if it was important or a big deal. They refunded me only after I requested and it took over a day. I was told someone would call me back to follow up and I received no calls. 

If you are in business to serve people their meals, you should take a little extra precautions that the food is done correctly. I should not have to get home with hungry kids and have items missing. This should never happen twice or even a third time.

Swaddee Thai is a little pricey for me... yikes... (then again, I am a seriously broke college student & a barista so I'm sure if you're a normal professional human, you'll be just fine)... their lunch specials are awesome.

Whenever I go, it is always empty!!!  Usually not a great sign... but I think I just get cravings at weird times.  HAH.  Always order a Thai Iced Tea... because it is some sort of sugar coma inducing tradition.  Delicious.

But to the main reason I'm writing this review!!!  PAD THAI.  The shrimp are always plump... the noodles are always just right... the seasoning is exactly what I want and need out of my Pad Thai dish.  The bean sprouts are crunchy and wonderful.  I'm a wimp & I get zero to none spicy because I can't take it otherwise & it's usually still spicy?  I think they do that just to spite me.

Pricing is wallet friendly, food is bar-type with extra flair, staff is friendly and informative, and parking is a breeze.  I agree it doesn't really qualify as a neighborhood pub; however, folks were hanging with their friends, making new ones, while a trio of 60+ year olds flirted with the bartender (like they stood a chance).  McCoy's is 100 yards away and they manage the same flux of hungry souls, too, so apparently not a big deal. 

I ordered the Cialis Burger because I wanted a juicy hunk of meat with an egg running all over my plate  (and not because I need help getting it up.  Hey, that's what it says on the menu--just need to vanquish any doubts!).  Both the burger and egg were cooked perfectly.  I added salt, however.  The shoestring fries were a surprise.  Gone.

This started off as a small Toronto shop selling clothing made from reclaimed vintages fabrics, and now there are offshoots in Montreal and Sydney! Pieces are pricey, but well-made and one of a kind. Their clothes feel comfy and familiar, like your favourite sweater, but still fresh and new. It's the perfect place to pseudo-vintage shop. I have a couple dresses from this store. One of them has sleeves made from the softest cashmere ever -- aka probably made from a very luxurious cashmere sweater I could not have afforded new. Another dress is made from an old Pierre Cardin garment in navy wool pinstripes. The styles are quirky patchworks of different pieces. Some of the ones with clashing prints are a bit hard to pull off, but others are more simple and work-appropriate. They also carry adorable accessories, homeware, and a very limited selection of items for men, children, and pets. 

Look out for their sales. They have at least one big warehouse sale each year, plus boxing day sales, plus random ones, e.g. the 'hopscotch sale' (they had hopscotch in the store, you throw a bean bag and whatever square it lands on, you got a different discount 20-50% off).",2012-02-03 02:12:39

I informed the waitress and she said she would inform the chef and left the check behind. No offer to send over the manager or deduct it from the bill. She ended up brining a new one to go.

We know this for a fact since we love dim sum and frequent many places in the east valley.  We also tried their house special chow mein noodles and that was pretty good.  Looked at their roast duck, roast pork, and char siu pork and ribs -- all looked good (but did not try) and all was cheaper than most every other place.

The food is amazing. By FAR the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. 

You will almost always wait. Be prepared. The music is kind of loud outside and it's all EDM. I feel it's a little weird. But, whatever. 

Some of the servers/cooks do NOT do a good job at explaining the process.
They are more traditional style here, so they do the cooking for you. 

Our server/cook was super nice, but not very attentive. That was the only downside. 

Plan to be here for awhile. This is a feast, bitches.

We decided on one of their specials, the $59.95 ""Smokin' Deal"".  And let me tell you, it was smokin!  Absolutely worth he price.  The 2 of us shared 1.5lbs of snow crab, one pound of shrimp and one pound of clams.  It also came with corn, potatoes and sausage. For flavor we had the ""smokin style"" and heat level of 8.   It was great! A little to spicy for my taste but I survived.  The Husband loves the heat so of course I obliged!  We also opted for an order of the bacon wrapped shrimp thanks to Billy's suggestion.

NIcole B. wanted pizza - she was interested in trying something new.  I suggested Custom Built - she got the groupon and we walked around the North Premium Outlets for 3 hours in preparation for dinner!

When we arrived, there was no wait which was great because we were starving.  I ordered the regular crust, spicy diavola sauce and a few dabs of pistachio pesto, ricotta, buffalo and shredded mozzarella...and then here comes the veggies!  Fresh tomatoes, artichokes, jalapenos, caramelized onions, eggplant...then I added chicken.  They added a fried egg on top after cooking the pizza, then I asked for the toppings that are added after the pizza is cooked: fresh spinach, basil, green onions, cilantro, and sundried tomatoes.  It was truly a work of art.  It was cut into 8 slices this time rather than 4 like when I first got here.  Nicole B. ordered the honey wheat crust for hers and she really liked it.  I got a Mexican coke and we ordered the s'mores pizza.  Since it was Nicole's birthday, it was ""on the house""!  The staff here was SOOOOO nice!

When our pizzas came out hot and delicious, I was so excited.  Mine held up.  I do like the thicker crust because it allows for tons of toppings.  At Project Pie the crust was thinner and fewer toppings were recommended because the crust got wet while cooking.  This is not the case here.  We polished off our entire pizzas (no easy feat, seriously) and then chatted for awhile before asking the staff to fire up our dessert.  When it arrived, our mini pizza was delivered smelling amazing.  It was smeared with nutella and marshmallows that had a nice brown color on top.  It was heavenly.

I soon realized that these were HORRIBLE chips for nachos though.  They were too thin and broke apart way too easily.  These nachos were topped with the usual toppings like cheese, beans, pico, sour cream, guacamole etc.  They came with 2 types of cheese....shredded and nacho.  I'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos.  I prefer just shredded cheese.  The nacho cheese tasted ok though so it wasn't nasty.  The chips were really a killer though.  I probably only had about 5-10 chips that I could actually scoop stuff up with.  The rest of the chips were too flimsy, broke in half, or were covered with toppings.  I gave up pretty quick and grabbed my fork, mixed everything together and ate it like it was a nacho salad.  The chicken they use is a little funky too.  I'm pretty sure its boiled.  It didn't have much flavor and was too ""wet"".  I picked around most of it.

Overall, not the least bit impressed.  I doubt I am coming back to try out any of their other offerings.  It wasn't gross/disgusting food, and I did eat most of the nachos,  but for the price and taste, I will be heading elsewhere in the future.",2014-11-14 04:10:56

Restaurants.com had a coupon for buy $25 for $10.  I snagged it but the conditions were annoying- spend $45 to get the $25 and no alcohol is included.  BOO!

Anyways, I ordered the shrimp cocktail to start.  It was okay- 6 nice sized shrimp served in a martini glass with cocktail sauce and 2 lemon.  Not bad, the shrimp could have been a little colder.

For dinner Kev had the buffalo chicken wrap with onion rings and I had the cobb salad with a side of balsamic vin.  I like the cobb- avocado, chicken, pieces of bacon, toms, egg, lettuce.  It is good but nothing special.

Our server was nice.....

The food here is just very blah.  The atmosphere is good to watch a game.  

That $25 coupon didn't get us very far.  We ended up paying $54 with tip and with the coupon!  I guess our bill didn't add up to what we needed it to be to get the full bang for our buck?  Still confused.......

Didn't want fried fish and pasta was a long, sit down process that we didn't even want to deal with especially after being out and about, running errands, we really needed something in our blow hole and fast.

So as we drove down Wilson Mills, I was really debating Chinese vs. Cheese Pizza when I spotted Qdoba.  I thought that might be perfect since they could probably can stuff enough meatless objects in a tortilla and make it taste really good.  We absolutely loved our meals!!  Fresh ingredients, great flavors, super filling, exactly what we needed.  Alison went with the Qdoba bowl (meatless) and I went with the Queso Burrito, YUMM!  I am now in love with that 3 cheese sauce, its soooooo good.  Great job Qdoba!!

Slaw not the best I've ever had for sure, but hard to keep good seasoned slaw around for long before it looses it crunch, chicken had ok flavor but seemed to taste of vinegar and no that's not the type of slaw it was.

I was skeptical about cheese with red bean but it turned out to be a rather good combination. It's cream cheese so it is a sweet and salty bun. 

I love the sweet potato cream bun. Sweet potato flavor is subtle and the bun is really really soft. They have a green tea and regular cream version too. 

I tried the peanut crunch one and my bf was a big fan but I felt like it wasn't quite crunchy enough so it came off as a stale sort of crispy to me. The cream in the middle is just regular white cream, not flavored. I'm not a fan of it but it wasn't bad overall.

JIpBD0Yi9JcJ-RPf8PjByQ,QlRsVCCytArycuuKSyUBLg,4m_hApwQ054v3ue_OxFmGw,4,3,0,1,"I had been dying to try Patria ever since I heard about it from a friend, and finally got a chance on Saturday night. I came without a reservation, and even though we arrived past 9 PM, the place was PACKED. They put us on the waitlist and told us it would be at least a 15 minute wait, and said we could just seat ourselves at the bar... only, there weren't even any seats left at the bar, it was that busy. We ended up just squishing ourselves in and standing around for a bit until a table freed up (we probably waited about 15-20 mins in total.)

The menu at Patria isn't huge, but it is definitely very unique, especially given that there aren't too many other authentic Spanish restaurants around. Pretty much everything is tapas style, meaning they are small dishes meant to be shared. Our server was very friendly and informative, as she was able to explain some of the unfamiliar food names to us and also offered us some recommendations when we asked for them. She recommended that we order around 3-4 dishes per person, so in the end we ended up getting 6 things.

Pimientos Rellenos De Buey ($14): these are piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail and manchego cheese and came in a set of two. I'm not sure what is supposed to be special about the pepper, but it just tasted like a regular red pepper to me. The oxtail inside the pepper was very soft and tender, cooked perfectly. I also loved how it blended with the salty flavour of the manchego cheese. Interesting and worth a try.

Dátiles Con Tocino Ibérico ($9): dates wrapped in ibérico bacon and stuffed with manchego cheese and guindillas (chili peppers). Apparently this is one of their most popular dishes, and it came with 5 in the dish. It's such an interesting and unique dish, the slight sweetness of the dates mixes really well with the saltiness of the bacon and cheese. I have a really low tolerance for spiciness, so I could definitely taste the chili peppers, but the other flavours balanced it out enough that I could still enjoy it. Would recommend trying this.

Selección De Embutidos ($16): kind of like a charcuterie platter, this came with four different types of meats: ibérico lomo, ibérico chorizo, jamón serrano and morcón salami. For me, this platter was just okay. Quite honestly I found most of the meats to be dry and rather bland for the most part. I think the salami had the most distinct flavour, but all the other ones tasted pretty much the same. I would rather skip this and shell out the extra $$$ to try the jamón ibérico ($30) next time.

Queso De Cabra Frito Con Higo Y Miel ($13): deep fried goat cheese with orange blossom honey, walnut and fig. We got this on the recommendation of our waitress, and it actually ended up being like my favourite dish of the night. Then again, I LOVE goat cheese, figs, and sweets, so this was perfect for me even though it's so simple. The goat cheese was so creamy, and the slight sweetness from the honey and fig really hit the right spot :D

Patatas Bravas Con Huevos Fritos ($10): crispy potato with spicy tomato sauce and fried egg. This was another mediocre dish for me. It's basically just like home fries but with a spicier sauce and a fried egg on top (which they will mix in for you). Nothing special.

Capon Al Ajillo Y Almendras ($29): wood fire roasted cornish hen with onion sherry sauce and almonds. Another recommendation from our waitress. This was good, but larger than the typical size for tapas. I would say if you are going to order this, then you can cut back on the other dishes. It was cooked very well though, the hen was not dry in the least; on the contrary, it was very moist and very soft and just flavourful enough, although I couldn't really taste any distinct onion or sherry flavour. While I enjoyed it, I wouldn't put this on my list of ""must-order items"" from this place.

With the 6 items we ordered, we were both quite full. With two drinks (cava suprema - $13.27, and a bottle of Estrella - $7.96), our bill ended up being just under $130 before tip.

My biggest qualm with this place is probably the location. It's located beside (just west of and kind of behind) Weslodge, and is connected to a residential condo. It can be a bit of a challenge to find, especially in the dark because the area between the two buildings is dimly lit and it is hard to see the sign. We walked right past the front door, then turned around and walked past it again and accidentally entered the condo before we finally figured it out. Definitely need some better signage here.

Despite the slightly hefty price tag, I would come to Patria again. My friend doesn't eat seafood, so we didn't bother ordering paella this time, but I am determined to give that a try next time, as well as their desserts! Food is for the most part very good (although some things are more worth it than others) and actually reminiscent of Spain, service was awesome, and I had a great time here!",2015-01-04 20:42:30

I've gone their for years. Today I couldn't communicate to the detailers to roll my windows down a bit to wipe the window edges. I walked up to the manager, ""Dustin,"" with my five dollar tip in my hand and said, ""I'd love to tip someone if I could get them to wipe off my window edges.""
Dustin first let me know that, ""hey, they don't speak English, so what do you want?"" (with a grin and a dismissive shrug). 
Then he let me know that it was against owner's policy  and that he would lose his job if he had the window edges wiped. I said I thought that was ridiculous. 
THEN he said if ""you want the window edges wiped that's a two dollar charge.  You have to pay two dollars for that.""  This was silly, especially because I'm standing there holding a $5 bill I'm trying to give someone. 
At that point the little guy was up in my face and was very confrontational. So I said that I know BS when I hear it, and the verbal exchange went downhill from there. 
Needless to say, I didn't get my window edges wiped and the staff didn't get a tip. 
I just think its odd that a so-called ""business"" owner would encourage his staff to be so obnoxious over trivial stuff; but from the other comments it sounds like the owner is an incredible jerk and that certainly is communicated by his staff.

It manages to draw a large crowd for its space, but is not the best in the area. On my most recent visit, the beer was warm and the service was lousy.  While the service is typically lousy, the beer is not usually warm.  Here are some key points...

1. The place is a large space.  On the left side as you walk in, there is a bar, while a little further back beyond the restrooms, there is a back bar.  The front bar has a few beers and is mainly for food, where the back bar handles most of the cocktails.  On the right side of the place there is a bank of old pinball machines and board games that you can bring to a table.

2. You order your drink at the bar, then find a seat (if you can.)  There are about 12 beers on tap here.    

3. The crowd here is almost entirely Caucasian between the ages of 28 and 32.  It is not really a hipster crowd, but more of a young professional crowd.

4. The place is best for meeting a group of friends, not for parties of two or one.  Most people arrive as a group of four or more.  If you observe, you will notice (especially on busy nights) that couples will often turn around and walk out because it is loud, there are few tables, and the service is not inviting.  It is a loud and festive atmosphere. Even louder when they have live music playing on the stage in the back.

5. The prices for cocktails are a bit high and the pours are small.

6. The food is OK.  The best bet is to opt for the later evening ""snacks"" that run around $5.  The main meals are good enough, but the atmosphere may not lend itself to a $20-$30 entree.

In conclusion, if you are not picky about service and you come with a group of friends within the age demographic, you will be fine with this place.",2013-04-15 21:15:01

This past weekend I chose the grilled fish tacos and they were outstanding. The smashed avocado added to each taco was perfect and the little ramekin of white beans and pico on the side was so tasty.

My husband had the beef short rib stew, served with an egg on top and a corn muffin on the side. He wasn't feeling 100% (I very nicely passed him a cold I picked up a while ago) and this was delicious comfort food for him.

They have another location on McGill College that I didn't have a great experience. However, the LOV on de la Montagne is a completely different experience.

First of all, let me just rave about the decor and ambiance. When you're walking in, they have a beautiful outdoor patio/terrace. During this winter season, they have it decorated with lovely Christmas lights and trees. It gets even better when you walk inside though. Their decor remains in the same theme as the other location, with a predominantly white/green color scheme. Such a gorgeously designed restaurant and they spared no detail when decorating.

The only thing better than the decor was the food itself. My friend and I ordered the basil/arugula pesto gnocchi, stuffed portobello mushrooms, and the kimchi fries. I'd highly recommend the kimchi fries, it's excellent and perfectly seasoned! Their food is delightful and fresh. You can tell immediately that they're using high-quality fresh ingredients. Was thoroughly impressed with all the dishes and can't wait to come back and try out more. It's quite rare to find a vegan/vegetarian upscale dining experience that isn't completely overpriced.

VwfPO-aApiACQ4UsnGVRNQ,QGOtNZfasBwWCuawKjypYA,M-AvKB7yDY_3BpqsP_bHZQ,4,0,0,0,"This is a hole in the wall bar kind of out of the way with a cool back story. How often can you say you going out at a bar that used to sell farm equipment?

They have some parking along the side of the building and a gravel lot out back. There was a $10 cover charge the night we were there. It's cash only and I'm guessing they only have a cover charge when there is live music on the weekends.

This is definitely a Southern bar. There is Nascar everywhere you look and I attempted to ignore the large Confederate flag hanging up.

The whole place is cash only, so come prepared. 

The best part is the large stage that they have for live music. We went to see out friends band play and I thought it was a good venue for it. 

If you're looking for a local hole in the wall with good live music, this is your place.",2018-02-12 02:17:28

Propeller coffee, openable front window and spacious interior with a wacky front entrance where you can do a catwalk into the place without even entering, neat! The menu looked good for brunch and they have some cute little booths along the back opposite the windowed kitchen in the rear and opposite the gelato counter. Why go to Starbucks when you can get your caffeine fix at this cool spot just a few doors down? They have an awesome staff with some talented cooks in the back whipping up some creative gelato.
The newest thing is a partnership with Pizza Thick from the east end. Last time I was there the pizza was being whipped up and sounded impressive. And this is what Alex park needs! More pizza. Sure we have Maker pizza now, but they don't do slices. Why? Who knows, but DVG can help, and there's no doubt there.",2016-10-27 22:16:30

One common theme about the District is that it's quiet and clean.  During the holidays the District is still calm and festive.  A beautiful sight to see. 

I don't get out here that often, but will make a stop every once in awhile for REI, Las Vegas Golf, the Sports Store, and the Cheesecake Factory.  There's plenty more eats and shopping.  These are just the few that I frequent.  The District at GVR also reminds me of a smaller and slower pace Town Square. It's also a nice walk with good company.  And if you're the gambling type, you got Green Valley Ranch Resort and Casino right next door.  

I was just recently here and the place reminded me that I need to come back.  I remember when I first moved out here, I would bring a packed lunch and have an impromptu office day under one of the trees.  Once it warms up a little, I will probably make more trips out here to simply get away.

I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 just because of the ridiculousness that was my sandwich. I asked for no cheese, add avocado. Simple right? Apparently not because about 80 percent of the time I have asked for avocado (and it costs an extra 75 cents mind you) I haven't received it. You think I would just learn and stop asking for it, but I tried again. This time they gave me cheese and no avocado. Apparently this is the hardest thing this place has to do because they can NEVER get it right. And this time they actually added something I specifically said not to. So eff you Spicy Pickle. I am breaking up with you.   5/1/11

----------------------------------------------------------

Working in an office is sort of like searching through yelp. Your coworkers bring in lunch from random lunch places you didn't know existed, and then you file them away in your bookmark section of your brain to try later and review. Spicy Pickle is one of those places I had no idea existed. I moved to this area of town almost two years ago and I am still finding new places to try. Its like a food expedition every time I go out. I had seen one of my coworkers bring in Spicy Pickle about four times before I decided to try it late last year. I have been here at least seven or eight times by now, but lately I just have not been that impressed.

When I first came to spicy pickle I was excited about another sandwich place to try. You see, I love sandwiches. You give me two pieces of bread with any combination of dressings, mayos, and veggies in between them and I am one happy girl. I don't know if the excitement got to me or what but for at least a month after I found this place I was in here every week at least. Its right down the street from my work as well so that made it super convenient. I have only had the Bastille sandwich, but of course I customize it to my tastes. I skip the cheese, sub sun dried tomato mayo for basil mayo, and add avocado. It was pretty tasty. But then I don't know what happened. Maybe I ate it so much I got sick of it, or maybe I just realized it was only a sub par sandwich, but I fell out of love with Spicy Pickle. Every time my husband wants to come here now I make a face. Maybe its because they added on a side with every sandwich as well as raising their prices. I'd rather have no side and less expensive sandwiches, thanks. 

BUT! There is one thing I continue to love about Spicy Pickle, and you guessed it. Its the pickles. They are so spicy and crunchy and I love that. I have a hard time finding a spicy pickle at the store that I like. Maybe I need to learn to make my own. But anyways. It has been a few months now since I have been here and I haven't had a craving to return. Perhaps one day I will. But for now I will continue to think about their pickles and wish I could just buy them by the jarful.",2011-04-25 02:39:14

Here's what we had:
Thai sausage - these sausages were very different from your usual sausages.  It reminds me of homemade sausages.  
Roasted duck curry - very delicious duck meat and the curry is full of flavors.  
Pad kapow with chicken - this was also very flavorful, but it was not as good as the duck curry. 
the pad jew noodles - thai soup noodles with shrimps, squids, char sui (bbq pork), and napa cabbage.  It was as close to the actual thai soup noodles I had in Thailand.  
~One thing I should mention is that our food wasn't spicy enough.  We ordered 8 out of 10, but it was still lacking some spiciness.~

They also had mango with sticky rice, but we'd have to wait 15 minutes for the rice so didn't end up getting it.  Definitely will come back to try it. 

The service is also very friendly.  Overall, Lao Thai Kitchen offers home-cooking flavors in a friendly atmosphere at a reasonable price!  This is going to become our regular dinner spot!

I walked in with the dismal notion that since I did not have an appointment my split ends would have to wait another week (to get the attention they desperately needed) when Renee politely welcomed me into the salon. I  was a little nervous at first, as I flashed back to 6th grade catching a whiff of that ""awesome"" perm solution smell. For valid reason, there was in fact a more mature woman patron getting her curl on!  Renee was gracious enough to squeeze me in for a trim. However, not only did she continue to tend to her other client; she managed to give me a lovely shampoo, scalp massage, perfect cut, AND blowout. I started out asking for a trim and decided after much debate that what I needed more than a trim was to liven up my ""dome"" with some edgy layers. She was spot on, kept my length in the back, put in some long bang layers and I was ecstatic!! To top it all off, as I went to redeem the ""$75 for $50"" deal she told me to save it as it was not even $50. Kudos to this this salon AND Renee. I will be back for those highlights for sure now!!

I had been to the location in Arizona a couple times and I remember loving the entire experience. So, needless to say I was yet again pleased with my experience at the Las Vegas location. 

Honestly, I was a bit reluctant it being inside a mall, even though yes its the Crystals mall (which is not any average mall). We were seated at a table overlooking the edge, which kind of gave the appeal of being near a cliff. The host who greeted us was extremely friendly and personable. Our server greeted us within a few minutes and went over the menu and a couple items he suggested.   

We started with the foie gras and escargot for appetizer. The escargot was average but the foie gras was delicious. Served with some sprigs of green and toasted bread. We also enjoyed half a dozen oysters on a half shell. We then moved on to have our entrees. Japaleno tuna sashimi definitely recommend this item. Truffled gnocchi was delicious as well as the creamed spinach. 

Discovered a new wine as well, Leviathian, a red blend from St. Helena California. Extremely smooth and vibrant!

Only complaint I have is that I wish there was more parking available. They only have 5 spaces there and I suspect that patrons of the Blockbuster Video store across from it are using those spaces. That can be pretty annoying.

I came in for lunch with my dad and unfortunately for the restaurant, we were the only ones in it. Almost for the better, as dad had a lot of questions about where the ingredients came from and we had the full attention of Nick and the bartender. The space is clean, and has some local art on most of the walls. One wall though, needs to be decorated... it's very empty. The restrooms are outside the restaurant, which is only a minor inconvience.

I ordered the gnocchi and it was good, but I have been very much spoiled by Marcellino's gnocchi, so I didn't truly think it was phenomonal. The portions at this restaurant are also crazy small. I honestly don't think I've had such a small meal at a restaurant as long as I can remember. I understand about ingredient prices, profit margins, etc. But I'd rather the prices be a couple dollars higher and get a larger meal.

Well I pull up to the drive-thru and I was immediately greeted with a GOOD MORNING HOW CAN I HELP YOU and I proceeded to place my order.  Before I left to drive around to the window he even gave me my total before I drove off.  Most places tell you to pull around before they give you the total so that was a plus to me.  There was a car ahead of me and it appears that they were in park waiting for their food.  I understand because they don't have pre-made food sitting around and your food is made as soon you place the order.  I was in the drive-thru for about maybe 10 minutes but it wasn't long enough for me to say ""what's taking so long"" so I was fine with that.  The gentleman that helped me was also very friendly and pleasant and gave smile when dealing with me. (+++++ for me)

Now onto the food.  I ordered a steak breakfast burrito and requested 3 of the green salsa cups.  Well the burrito is not as big as the other ones (since I'm greed) but it did hit the spot I needed it to.  There were a couple hard pieces of steak that almost killed me because my tooth is somewhat bothering me and I was almost in tears because it literally hurt that bad.  So not sure if it was because my tooth is sensitive that it appeared really hard because when I chewed on the other side it wasn't a problem. There was a balance of the meat, cheese, eggs, and potatoes which makes for a great breakfast burrito.  It was hot an warm even after I got to work and got settled. 

This location is okay and I probably will come back because of the service alone. Please don't let the wait time in the drive-thru discourage you because when you place your order that is when they start to make it which is a good thing.  Some people complain about every little thing and inpatient about everything.  7-10 minutes in the drive-thru while they prepare your food isn't bad at all.

Yo, fellas, I ain't forgettin' 'bout y'all. This is for everybody who like to dance.""  Particularly if Mr. Nasty was to be using the word dance as a metaphor for being outside.

If you go fishing, there's no place to go anywhere else for your gear.  The different types of lines, alone, fill a wall.  And rods, reels, tackle?  Ohh - I think I understand what it's like for some of my friends to go shoe shopping when I'm in those hallowed halls.

Then there are boats, and all that good stuff.  But also pillows that are shaped like giant fish.

She argued with me when I didn't want to buy the current ""balloon special""...I just needed 11 not to spend any additional money or add more balloons to my already crowded car...

When I asked if they had a book for balloon bouquets to check for our upcoming party she told me I could check down the aisles and look for the packages, ""if I could find them"".... Pure laziness. 

Because of this, I said forget the balloons. I'll order it online, as big of an inconvenience as that is, I would rather do that rather than put up with Barbara's unfriendly service again. Luckily we only have one more month of balloons, in the meantime I'll have to find a different party city.

I usually get the paella, but our server recommended the Zarzuela de Mariscos --a wonderful seafood stew, loaded with fish, shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams, scallops and lobster in a tomato sauce.

He brought us new drinks and was very tentative throughout the meal (plus, he was a cutie! lol)

I was surprised at how affordable the lunch prices were for a fancier restaurant. Most of the dishes were about $12 and under. The soups of the day were Brocolli Cream and Tomato Parmesan. OF COURSE we had to get one of each. We also ordered the ""Thai Crispy Calamari"" as the appetizer. There was a kick of wasabi in the sauce, which was unexpected but nonetheless enjoyable. Although, they weren't very crispy which was disappointing. My friend and I both got the ""Grilled Chicken and Risotto."" The risotto was made perfectly and the chicken was very flavorful. I'm tempted to try the shrimp and grits or the fish  tacos next time! Last, I got creme brulee as dessert. It was very succulent and sweet, but very enjoyable!

As it was Happy Hour - Yes - we quickly ordered a selection of the half off appetizers and drafts. Quite a deal

Beer - Yes - ever-changing selection of 12, some unusual.

Sliders - Yes - 3 - chicken, bison, beef - on delicious brioche rolls. These were the best thing we ordered. I would have wished each to have a different personality but they all had cheese and a pickle. We liked the chicken best and though the other two were slightly different we couldn't (nor could our server) tell which was which (note to Burgatory - put a different marker on one of them). Sadly they were a bit dry which may not reflect on the regular size burgers that we didn't try. I'm a toppings person when it comes to burgers to that decreased my enjoyment of the selections. A homemade pickles/toppings bar like Michael Symon's B Spot would be welcome. We should have stopped with just these. 

Mushroom Fries - No - as other reviews highlight the large battered portabello fries and I love mushrooms I was looking forward to but disappointed by these. I was pulling the batter off and then wiping copious grease off my fingers before trying to enjoy the plain mushrooms. Perhaps leaving the gills/underside of the large pieces makes the coating wet when it goes into the frier? Not sure but a mistake. And I love peanut sauce and could discern some peanut-y flavor - maybe from peanut oil - in the dip but I'd call the black thin sauce Asian or Soy or something other than peanut that I expect to be thicker and more peanut-y.

Side of fries - were fine.

Wings - these were okay. The skins were a bit rubbery but edible and tasty. We were disappointed though because they were called Siracha Wings which sounded awesome. We expected a spicy, hot and red wing. These were natural colored with a thin Asian style sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds and scallions. Far too mild for us.

We've tried the lobster bisque, clam chowder, crab cakes, baked pear and blue cheese dessert, their raw oysters and pastas.  I've got to say though, it's only their seafood that really stands out, so my suggestion to to go for their raw oysters, soups, and crab cakes and other appetizers in general, and leave the mains (pastas, meats). 

A fairly big caveat is that as far as I know, they don't take reservations, which can get annoying, especially if you want to bring along a couple of guests.

Prices are reasonable, considering it is seafood and most of the oysters are from out of country!

A suggestion though, if you're willing to sacrifice the experience, is to go next door to their fresh market and pick up products there (raw oysters, crab cakes, canned soups) and prepare the food at home.  It's /almost/ the same for a far lower price!

I arrived at about 3:15PM on a Friday.  The ""OPEN"" sign was lit, their Express Smog van was parked just to the left of the business, with a window down, and what I assume to have been the employee's old pickup truck, with windows down, was parked on the other side of the van, but the building's door was closed.

I pulled-up as-usual & waited for a minute.  No one came out, so I knocked on the door & waited.  No answer.    I stood around for a couple more minutes before I left.

Unless the service tech was keeled-over dead or dying inside the shack, I assume he or she was nearby, going to the bathroom, getting some food, or whatever, but I had eyes-on the structure for a total time of almost 10 minutes, and no one was around during that time.

If the service tech needs to go on a break, that's perfectly understandable -- but leave a ^%$#* sign on the door stating you'll be back in 5 or 10 minutes, and try to keep an eye on the place, so if a customer does show-up, you can come back out or at least yell that you'll be back in a few min.  I would have been fine with that.

 But based on you wasting my time & mileage yesterday afternoon, I am very happy to spend some of my time today giving an honest report of my experience, and I will not come back to your business because I simply can't trust that your business will actually be open during your posted business hours.

Today was Taco Tuesday, which means $1 tacos! I'll be honest, I like that they offer it, but they only do a couple of different proteins and limited styles. So even though I'm paying a bit more, I still got the Locos Al Pastor. Pork so good you wouldn't even think it's pork (sorry Pork lovers, I'm usually don't get excited about it). Outstanding fresh toppings piled generously on 2 authentic corn tortillas per taco.

The salsa bar is great as well. I've taken quite a liking to the Pineapple Habanero, but it's just a bit to spicy for me so I cut it with some of the mild salsa. It's been fresh and delightful every visit to Sabor.

Lee served me and Jeremy was behind the line today. Great service, I've been to the Sabor closest to my house and was real disappointed with the crew. Glad that this one really values it's customers.

If only I can be the aZn kid, Data from the Goonies then it would be awesome. Don't mistaken this spot for the Bouchon Bakery located on the casino floor, that's just the decoy. You must first start off in the lobby where you follow the signs near the check in/out counter. Find the elevator that takes you to a secret Da Vinci floor. Bank a left out of the elevators and continue through the Michelangelo (inspired ceiling) hallways until you hit the spot on your right hand side. 

We arrived here around 1030ish am for brunch on a Saturday. The wait was about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations. The restaurant was crowded and the tables are right next to each other so don't expect much privacy from your neighbors. I do recall the dude next to us throwing a fit about something.

Let's talk about their table bread. They just throw that bad boy on your table without a basket or a serving plate. Interesting concept but don't worry germaphobes, they use wax tissue paper to handle the bread. The butter and jam is what makes this a winner. First, I believe they're both made freshly. Second, the bread+butter+jam equals a scrumptious treat. Heed my warning: if you're on a carb diet, it's probably not a good idea to try it because you won't want to put it down. The flavor of the day was blackberry I believe. Sooooo bombskiz.

In honor of Le Roscoe Pierre Chicken & Waffles that I do love to eat in LA, I ordered the: the brunch chicken and waffles. From looking at the price ($25), you'd think they were giving you duck confit and waffles. Although it's a little pricey, I have no buyer's remorse. Honestly, I'm craving it as I type this now. The bacon and chive waffle leaves a distinct taste in your mouth. Normally, you're only use to the taste of butter and syrup. Not these waffles. You get a hint of the saltiness and some other unique flavors with every bite. You even actually feel the crunch of the bacon bits in the waffles itself.

The chicken is served in 2 pieces. Looks will deceive you here, the portion of the chicken may seem petite but when you actually rip the flesh off the bones like a carnivore that you are, you'll realize that there's plenty of meat to work with. Although the chicken was slightly salty, it was still very tender and juicy. It's accompanied by a mushroom type chauffer gravy sauce.

Service was great and the atmosphere is loud & vibrant. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu and to eat some more bread with homemade jam! It's definitely not a cheap meal but how often are you in Vegas anyways? Also, try their desserts or the bakery items if you have room for it.",2010-03-17 01:38:04

You talk only to the salesperson who goes back and forth between you and the finance people to grind you into a higher profit margin for the dealer.  So we would certainly consider buying another car here.

The service department seems to be as busy as they want to be, so they might not have time to fully address your needs.  When we bought our CPO used LaCrosse, it came with a broken center console.  It took a week and a half to get a service appointment to address that and a couple of minor issues.  I dropped it off early on a Wednesday afternoon and they told me to come back Friday afternoon to pick it up.  That Friday, they ordered the console (even though the service adviser immediately spotted that it was broken at the time I dropped off the car), but never called to tell me that it had come.  They said it could take a week and a half.  When I called two weeks later, he didn't know if the console had arrived and promised to call me back.  He didn't.  But I eMailed, then had to call him after hours with no reply.   (The service adviser has responded to only one of six eMails sent on different days.)  When I called, he told me it was there (not when it came though), and setup an appointment. 

I live in Arizona (naturally).  Hot air comes out of the vents, even when it is in the 60's outside.  Its not very hot air, but much hotter than outside under most operating conditions.  As a result my wife and I have to run the A/C even when it's cool outside.  She might be wearing a jacket outside then she has to turn on the AC when she's driving.  Something's not right.  The solution Coulter offered (after a couple days in the service department) is to make sure we have the temperature control turned all the way down.  Yes, that is obvious.  No, it doesn't solve the problem.  The air should blow at close to the outside ambient temperature.  It blows about 15 degrees hotter, typically, and often as much as 20 degrees hotter.  In AZ that isn't a good thing. I actually went to the trouble of logging the outside and vent air temperatures, time and operating condition data as I drove, parked, and idled the car with a temperature probe in the vent and one outside the car.  I eMailed it to the dealer, but never heard anything back.

During my call to make reservations here, I was kindly informed by a gentleman that there was nothing too special about the big taste menu, and that they offered the same courses for a slightly higher price on a weekly basis anyways. I had thanked him kindly for his information and thought nothing of it. Now... Fast forward two weeks to the night of our reservation. Apparently the gentleman that had taken it had written it in the wrong time slot, but they were able to find us a table anyways. 

We were seated in the middle of the restaurant. The resturant appeared to be quite cozy. I felt many accidental bumps by servers throughout the night. I was much confused on their use of paper on top of their table clothes and found their use of plastic flowers to be a bit disheartening. Nevertheless as follows is a breakdown of the items we ate; I did come here for that purpose after all. 

Housemade Crabcakes with Tropical Fruit Salsa: They were a good sized crabcakes, found them to be a bit on the soft side. Not enough crisp to it. There was very little salsa, but that was fine as the salsa was quite tart.

Mixed Green Salad with candied pork belly lardons & Boursin Cheese: I was much disappointed with the salad, as I have a love affair with yellow beets. The beets on the plate had no sweetness to them, they were bland. The vinaigrette on the salad was a good balance to the boursin cheese. The candied pork belly was a bit tough for me, but the bf loved it. There was only one piece of it though... even though it's pluralized in the description.

Charbroiled ""Brick-Cut"" Alberta Grade AAA New York Steak with Back, fig & port wine reduction, fresh seasonal vegetables, hand rolled potato cakes: I liked their take on the potatoes; they were a good change from mashed. The steak was oddly cooked as the pink was mostly on the underside of the steak with a good inch at the top cooked to well-done. We weren't too sure what the purple vegetable was on the side as there was no waiter around to explain.

Charbroiled red spring salmon fillet with roma tomato, sweet bell pepper, cilantro, pine nut salsa, tarragon & jasmine steamed rice, seasonal winter vegetables: The salmon was cooked well, under seasoned and I don't know if it's just me... but I disliked the temperature difference between my warm salmon and ice cold salsa. I couldn't taste the tarragon in the jasmine at all. On the bright side, I finally got a golden beet with flavor.

Auchentoshan crème caramel: Presentation was not great. I've never had this dessert before, but it was a bit too watery for my taste. Soft though, reminded me of Japanese caramel pudding.

Irish cream cheesecake with wildberry coulis: I didn't taste any of the Irish cream... are my tastebuds that desensitized? The wild berry coulis... was blueberry sauce to me... They should've just called this a blueberry cheesecake... then my expectations and experience would be equally matched.

Final verdict: I think my expectations were much higher than they should've been. Will know better for next time.",2015-03-20 05:46:42

She spent most of the time talking about a birth control pill only available in Mexico and asked if my daughter knew anyone there that could send it to her and that would be the best prescription for her.  My daughter had to stop her from leaving the room to say she still hadn't asked all the questions she wanted to. Dr. Keller prescribed a medication and said she would call it in but didn't. They charged us twice as much for the initial visit but did no special tests and was dismissive and rude. Before considering this doctor be sure and read all the reviews on Yelp. you will see very very few glowing reports...wish I had done my ""Yelp"" research before I put my daughter through this humiliating and frustrating first-time experience at a gynecologist.",2015-12-23 19:47:00

I tried it again today because my office wanted to try something new that the doctor hasn't tried. I am going to base my review on my food today & not how I felt about this place years ago. 

I got the Chicken Sate lunch special. The chicken was good. It comes with a peanut sauce that used to be my favorite part. The cucumber salad was good as well but not as I remember it to be. The part I didnt like the most was how much rice that came with the lunch special. It didn't compliment the amount of chicken I got with it. 

Also, I am a big fan of Spicy Thai Beef Salad and they didn't have that here... I mean it's a Thai restaurant? Lol

Master bedroom- King size bed, zebra print chair, whirlpool, big bathroom with private toilet, shower, double sink, and washer/dryer.

2nd bedroom- King size bed, pull out couch, small kitchen with sink, microwave, and fridge. Bathroom is a decent size with the tub being a 1 person whirlpool.

Living room/ kitchen- huge space, full kitchen with large dining table, two big comfortable couches, huge projector screen to watch tv. The suite has 5 tv's located in the kitchen, living room, bedrooms, and master bathroom. The decor is sleek and sexy.

Love that this hotel is attached to the Miracle Mile because it makes it very accessible to shops and restaurants. The pool is a nice size but seems overly crowded. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was horrible reception and no free wi-fi...that's how they get you to buy because none of our phones had reception and we all have different carriers.

The bread was the worst sandwich bread I've had.  I don't know if they overmixed it's, over proofed it, or under baked it. Whatever they did to it it was pretty bad. 

And their so-called famous meatballs were the most bland pieces of tough meat I have had in a very long time. Their zesty sauce has zero zest and was too sweet for my liking. It was huge flavorless mess of hot, sweet tomato sauce and meat boulders.

The soup was gray. I ordered broccoli cheese and it was gray. It smelled terrible, and had a chemical taste. I'm glad I tasted it first. I ordered it for my toddlers and I would not feed it to them. I am sick to my stomach.

When we got seated upstairs there were a good amount of empty tables so that was a bit strange. Our server was friendly and got our bottle of wine from the bar sent up as the hostess said she couldn't bring it up with us. The atmosphere upstairs was nice, open and its perfect for a get together with friends.

The menu has many great Italian options we ordered the arancini, garganelli pasta and mushroom pizza. The server came back within 5 mins to tell us that they ran out of pizza dough!! We were super disappointed with that. So we ordered the cod and tuna instead. 

When the arancini came out the runner plopped it on the table said ""meatballs"" and walked away lol. They tasted delicious (best in the city) and they were not meatballs. The garganelli pasta came out great, I would definitely order it again, my friends were happy with the tuna and cod as well.

For dessert we had the Dark Chocolate torta which was good. It wasn't too sweet which I liked but I would probably go for something else next time. It didn't wow me, we didn't even finish it (unusual for dessert).

The wine and conversation flowed all night.
 
If it wasn't for the mediocre service and the fact that they ran out of pizza dough on a Friday night (Big thumbs down!). I would really rate Cibo higher than a 3 star.

I had high hopes; I started with thai iced coffee that was dark, flavorful and sweet, but things deteriorated from there. 

Once all of us had placed our orders, the food came out in odd segments. Two people were served while the other two sat and waited awkwardly. Those who had food didn't want to dig in and be rude, so they sat and waited with us for 5-10 minutes. We were given one large rice bowl for four people, which was quickly doused in curry sauce. 

We sampled the papaya salad, which was decent. A fair portion for $5-6 bucks, but nothing to do a jig of joy over.

I ordered the roast duck curry. There were a few pieces of duck swimming in the sauce, but it seemed that it was mostly skin/fatty bits and a few pieces of vegetable. At $7-8 it's not horridly expensive, but it's not a generous serving of protein OR vegetables; it's just a whole lot of sauce. 

Halfway through the meal, one girl found a large cork-screw shaped piece of metal in her food. It didn't cut her mouth, but was alarming nonetheless.

True story:

When me and Art were first dating and I lived with roommates, they had a tin full and he would always just take 4 or 5 upon every visit and soon enough their full tin became an empty one and it was time for me to move out. LOL!

All jokes aside, this store is pretty fun just to venture through. Items and selections that are vast and from everywhere. 

Everyone is always helpful with very customer service orientated attitudes. One visit I knocked over two or three bottles of root beer with my purse. They cleaned it up fast and I steadily apologized but they never made me feel bad about it and assured me that I wasn't the only one that this happened to. 

I could easily spend an hour or two in this store just browsing over everything. I could easily spend a whole paycheck here too if allowed. 

I recently discovered their coffee and it is hands down some of the best coffee I have ever had in my life. I am in love with their Peruvian whole bean blend. 

If you join their member club you get awesome coupons, like $10 off a $30 purchase or more. Twice a year they do a special on their coffees, buy one get one free. And I even have a coupon waiting to be used for a free bag of coffee.

My friend and I were craving anything with rice, did I mention the fact that we're asian? Anyway, Jun's Korean Restaurant came up and we were immediately on our way. This place has Meat Jun! (I don't know why, but they called it Meat Chun... In Hawaii we all say Meat Jun lol) 

They have their own private parking lot shared with the surrounding restaurants and shops. It is also located next to the Regal Cinemas. I came for the Meat Jun but ended up getting Bi Bim Bap (about $11 including tax), which was also very delicious! 

Bi Bim Bap is a signature Korean dish with veggies, eggs, sauce, and beef on top of rice. And you mix it all together. In this restaurant you could have it either on a plate or in the stone bowl. Of course I got it in the stone bowl because why not?! The taste was a 4/5, I've had better in Hawaii but it was still a successful lunch choice (Best Bi Bim Bap I've had in Vegas thus far)! The distance is quite far from where I live, so I would come here only if I was in the area craving Meat Jun or some good Bi Bim Bap. The proportions were good for it's price, my friend and I both couldn't finish our plates.

The customer service was okay, but not too much communication took place. However, may I say that the interior gives off a mellow/relaxed feeling. The pictures on the wall were big and pretty, just like their menu behind the front counter. It was easy to read. There were about 10 or more size-varying tables/chairs in the dining area and no outdoor seating.

Yesterday, after a failed attempt to see a new movie, and a really long drive, we found ourselves at Champagne's for a drink, and REALLY hungry...so I pulled up the trusty Yelp app, searched for All you can Eat Sushi, and found Sakana.

With a four and a half star rating, and .5 miles from where we were, this was the winner for dinner.

We walked in, and they were not busy, just a couple tables of people.  
We chose to sit at the bar, to make things easier on ourselves.  

The menu was big, with items that I don't usually see in other places (like a few lobster options.  WHA?!)

Yesterday we had:

Garlic Tuna
Super White
Cajun Albacore
Unagi
Ebi
Smoked Paprikia Salmon
Ocean Trout
Scallop
The X Man Hand roll
Tako (Octopus)
A Lobster Nigiri roll (can't remember the name right now)
A lobster and bacon skewer
Seafood salad
Spicy garlic edemame
Gyoza
Egg Rolls
Seaweed Salad
Mini Honey Toast

So, the really good:
The Garlic Tuna. 
For me, this is just under the quality of Sumo Sushi's garlic tuna, which is the best I've ever had.  
Sakana's was AWESOME.  Super garlicky, moist, and HUGE.

Yeah, let me take a moment to discuss the portion sizes.
Ridiculous.  SO. MUCH. FISH.
On the one hand, I was thrilled about this.  The fish to rice ratio is amazing here.  Small amount of rice, TONS of fish.  
On the other hand...I was able to eat a lot less because the fish portion was basically doubled, so I hit my wall a lot faster than normal. 

Also really good:  
The Lobster nigiri roll:  lobster and crab with a bit of cream cheese (I think) was lovely.  Even my fella liked it, and he's not a fan of cream cheese. 

The Smoked Paprika Salmon: I'm not usually a fan of salmon sushi, but this had great flavor. 

The Scallop:  I was really stuffed by the time I ate this, but I'm so glad I did.  Delicious tender scallops on rice wrapped in seaweed, topped with a tiny slice of lemon:  mmm. 

The X Man hand roll: 
Soy paper, rice, beef and salsa, this was like a teriyaki burrito.  Fella didn't care for it, but I'd order it next time for sure.  Really tasty.

The Seafood salad:  Holy sashimi Batman!  TONS of fish, dicon radish, cucumbers, jalapenos...mmm.  and HUGE.    

The Mini Honey Toast:  I got excited when I saw this dessert.  A favorite of mine, Honey Toast isn't something I am able to have very often...this was incredible.  We ordered mine, and my fella doesn't usually do dessert...but after one bite of mine, he ordered his own!

Now the good, but slightly different/strange:
The Super White:  Fish was great, but they put screaming o sauce on it...for me, it took away a bit of the flavor of the fish, and my fella hated it.  

The Ebi:  Delicious, but the small lemon slices on top added just a bit too much to the shrimp.  It brightened the flavor, but was a touch too much. 

The Unagi:  DELICIOUS...but I don't know if they just have a different eel sauce, but this was more of a ponzu sauce.  So it was good, but not what I was expecting. 

The Ocean Trout:  Good fish, good flavor, but the toppings were just a little...salsa like for me.

The Cajun Albacore was a little weird, with a crunchy topping that I've never seen before. 

The good/Standard:
Seaweed Salad
Gyoza
Eggrolls
Lobster and bacon skewer
Spicy Garlic Edemame.  

All good, nothing spectacular or amazing.

The service here was on point.  Fast.  Friendly.  Everything you could ask for in a sushi restaurant, really.

I will absolutely eat here again.  There are lots of things on the menu that I want to try that I didn't have room for yesterday. 

DInner is only $24.95, and apparently they have 2 for 1 sake and beer every day...I may try that out next time, since I didn't have a chance to yesterday.

The dog park is hidden away far from the rest of the park, down on Chapata, and while there's no designated parking, you can park on the street.

It's one large park where dogs of all sizes mingle, so if you have a dog of either extreme (teeny tiny teacup Chihuahua or behemoth Great Dane) who isn't used to dogs of all sizes, this is not the best choice for you and your pup.  That not being an issue for my furball, we went in.

It's a nice park, with a long run of grass, some dirt near the entrance, and covered seating near the entrance.  It's not a very popular park, or at least not from what I gather as the few times I've been there's only been a handful of dogs and people.

At some spots, you may love the steak, but skip dessert, but from start to finish, Brand delivers creative, delectable dishes. It's the complete package.

I had the luck of enjoying the Yelp Spring Break prix fixe, and so unlike my usual meal, I actually had both an appetizer and dessert. I admit I did not have a steak entree, but from the drool rolling out of my husband's mouth as he sliced up his bone-in filet, I am confident they do the steak right.

For an appetizer, I had the hot rock: thinly sliced sirloin brought to the table uncooked with a smoking hot rock that you employ to cook up your meat. Regardless of the taste factor, I just think this is a fun appetizer, perfect for a date.

For my main entree, I ordered the chicken. I know it is a shameful steakhouse choice, but it was perfect: not too thick and served with a dreamy, crispy skin. 

For dessert: Strawberry Baked Alaska. They did not set fire to it tableside, but the sweet strawberry goodness stood on its own without the theatrics. Although I haven't had it, the Grilled Banana Smores Restaurant Week dessert is the stuff of legend, so judging from my experience and the word on the street, Brand is a dessert destination must.

But, I have saved the best for last, as the dish that I am still savoring weeks later is the creamed spinach. Eating your vegetables never tasted so good, and I am a vegetable lover.

Our service was solid, despite a little delay at the end receiving our check.

In conclusion, Brand is particularly well-suited for dates and groups. There is something for everyone, and everything from small plates to dessert is executed with deliciousness.",2012-05-29 18:34:22

Our server seemed to have been sat four tables at once, including ours. Because of that she fell behind very fast. She rushed through our drink order so fast I wasn't able to order a drink for my son before she walked away. Drinks took awhile to arrive as well. We ordered fried pickles and they came fast and were quite tasty. And when the food was dropped she was prompted to get our dinner order. She apparently placed it quickly, too, because timing was beautiful for the entrees to come out. 
Our server, and forgive me for forgetting her name (black hair with black rimmed glasses), had a great positive attitude, bubbly and very nice once she got caught up. And she got caught up pretty fast. So our one star start quickly rose. 
We received our food, fish and chips sub onion rings, b.a.l.t., and chicken tender basket. The fish was cooked perfectly, but slightly under seasoned. No biggie. The b.a.l.t. was picture perfect. Golden brown, built nicely and not all sloppy. Just a good looking plate. The tenders, not so much. I was expecting a crusty, crunchy hand breaded tenders and these were more like cut strips of breasts dusted in seasoned flour. Like you'd make at home in the skillet. 
Our server was quick to replace it with another b.a.l.t. but with regular tomato instead of fried. Again, just gorgeous. At first I thought it was also under seasoned with the avocado but then remembered that it usually comes with a fried tomato and I made the change. So with that in mind it was perfect. Great ratio of all the filling. And the fries, as silly as it sounds, but they were the example of well cooked fries. They came out almost to the overcooked point. Not greasy though, not a bit. Well seasoned, and crunchy. Cooked so perfectly that my last fry, ten or fifteen minutes after it was delivered was still crunchy. 
I'll be here again, but next time in the bar which seemed very welcoming. 
The only reason that I'm not giving a five star is because when our server was sat four times there were other employees that could've helped her but didn't. Although one gentleman, which I think was the manager, was supporting her and was wicked busy. 
And when we were dining another employee rolled the mop bucket through the dining room. Over tile. Very, very loud and rude when people are dining.

Passing through Lake Jacqueline was a beautiful scenic sight before I turned right of a roadside curb to a clear view of a large sign of ""Marché Bacchus"" seen straight from the road curb. Parking was not a problem at that hour as it was 9:00 p.m. Walking along the parking lot to the entrance gave me a serene, quiet feeling, with no one else in sight but a few cars parked on the vicinity of this plaza of other businesses. The doors open to a receptionist/cashier desk to my left and all throughout is where the wine market shop is. Rows and rows of wine can be seen, some laid out on oak barrels and other wine bins. I was informed that the bistro and wine shop closes at 9:30 p.m. Nevertheless, my friend and I can still dine even after its closing time which is 9:30 p.m. As I was there first, I roamed a little around the wine ""market"" and saw the cozy indoor dining area of the bistro to the far right. I finally walked away from the wine bins to a doorway leading to table seating on the patio. I was ""enticed"" by the music coming from a guitarist who was playing sweet jazz music that have overtones of samba and latin rhythm by the patio door as I walked in the patio area, thus, setting my mood to a romantic, calm dining night. The patio overlooks the Lake Jacqueline. On a moonlit night it sparked the love fires in me as I sat on a table next to a fireplace. Tables were set on various angles, quite nice! One dining area had curtains set on poles flowing onto the patio floor. I gazed out to the lake...c'est magnifique! The moon reflects so beautifully on the lake's serene, calm waters. Amidst conversation, candles and cool night breeze, red wine was served on a choice both my friend & I both preferred. We were two of the other two guests remained seated at the restaurant that night till we left at around 11:00 p.m. .

For menu & wine market hours & bistro hours, visit their website http://www.marchebacchus.com 

My favorite from the menu is: ""Escargot Persillade"", ""Grilled Scottish Salmon"", ""Peppercorn Filet Mignon"", ""Lobster Pot Pie"", ""Grand Marnier Chocolate Cake"" with raspberry & ""Traditional Bread Pudding"" made with cinnamon & rum sauce....yummm, the best for me. I also recommend the ""Cheese Platter"" as a welcome beginning to start the palate.

Live entertainment on the patio on Wednesdays & Sundays from 6:00-9:00 p.m. Wine tastings on Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. -1:00 p.m. Friendly and good service from waitstaff and Hostess / Cashier. A selection of wine from the wine list or have any wine you choose from the market can also be served while you dine.

I like this French cuisine with a contemporary & New Orleans touch and French wine is at your fingertips to enjoy at a lunch, brunch, dinner, events, or party dining atmosphere that is oooh la la!

Walking up to the front desk on arrival, the clerks were gabbing loudly on the phone selling rooms.  It was akin to listening to commodity traders on the floor of the stock exchange.  We stood there for about five minutes.  No one made eye contact.  No one acknowledged us.  Finally, a young woman emerged from a back room and asked, ""Are you being helped?""

We received nothing for being Gold members.

This is a newer hotel and the rooms are very large.  However, they have a design flaw which causes us great discomfort.  The bathroom sink is part of the room at large, and the bathroom itself consists of only the toilet and bath/shower.  I hate not being able to wash my hands until I leave the bathroom.  If someone needs to use the sink at night or early in the morning, you will wake anyone who is trying to sleep.

We needed a night at a pet friendly hotel, and Mountain Shadows was above and beyond what I expected. First, they do not charge a pet fee for your extra guests (and I had my 2 fur children in tow, so that was amazing). Second, if you let them know that you are bringing your furry friends with you, they will set up beds, bowls and treats in your room at no extra charge.  They also give you a door tag to put on your door so if you leave your pets in the room, the staff is aware that your guys are in there.  That little extra care to be sure that my dogs were well taken care of from start to finish really set them apart from all other pet friendly hotels I have stayed at before.

And besides that, the resort itself is beautiful!!  The views from the back of the hotel are unblocked of Camelback Mountain, and they have a roof-top patio you can sit at to enjoy it in all its glory.  Plus, the rooms are very large, modern and comfortable.  We were provided with top quality amenities, and I felt like I was at a true mountain paradise while I was there.

It's totally hit and miss - sometimes you can get a great meal here, and sometimes it's so, so disappointing. I was mega-excited when I discovered it because I love Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food and campus is a desert wasteland when it comes to healthy, tasty, fresh eats. 

At first it lived up to its promise, but lately it's gone downhill. They've started making substitutions and messing with things that they were getting right. Today I ordered a ""spicy kale and bean soup"" - I was pretty hungry, but figured that and a grilled cheese would fill me up. What I got was a bowl of salty water with some mushy celery, peppers, and a few shreds of kale (no beans in sight). Looked nothing like the photo they had advertising it. The salad bar used to be great - their lemony broccoli salad was delicious - but they've started replacing the broccoli with cabbage and cauliflower (maybe to cut costs) and adding in gross things like beansprouts... ewwwww. Other salads, like the greek, similarly suffer from a stingy hand with the good stuff like feta and olives - I once had one that was entirely cucumber. 

Other dishes are also hit and miss - I love all the pickles, hummus, and tabouli  you get on their chicken sandwiches but the chicken itself, as others have mentioned, is always waaaaayy too salty. The shawarma is usually kind of dried out, especially if it was cut off the rotisserie thingy awhile back. 

Then again, the creamy sundried chicken they sometimes have looks freaking amazing - will have to try that sometime. And their Arabian pies are always delicious - try the olive one! The curried lentil soup is also killer.

As for prices, it really varies - the grilled cheese and soup combo came in at around $7 after tax, which is decent, but if you get a shawarma combo you are looking at around $11 for a sandwich and salad or soup. 

SO yeah... it's a game of chance! Choose wisely - I recommend going for anything Middle Eastern/Lebanese - and don't set your expectations too high, and you'll probably be fine. After all, it's not like you any better options around here!",2015-04-02 16:29:11

I was very impressed with this Marshall's location - cleaner, brighter, larger, and more organized than other ones I've been to.

What impressed me most, however, was that when I got in line to pay for my purchase, only one person was ahead of me.  There were already two customers being serviced at the two open registers.  But the manager opened up a third register to handle the overflow.  I have never, ever seen this happen at any of the other locations, where they never give a damn if there are 20 people in line!

VuN5MT-_Joud-2NnzY6cSg,nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ,4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g,1,1,3,1,"I am just perplexed by the good reviews of this place. Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. 

We have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.

First impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. 

Menu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. 

We both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. 

My drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. 

My soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. 

My husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. 

His drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.

We finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. 

We REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. 

We flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special.

Once we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. 

Finally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. 

So yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. 

One another note, another review says, ""If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out."" I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of ""Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out"" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well.

We also tried the cauliflower cake (so-so) and the ""pieuvre saisie"" (would order again). Although each dish tasted good, I think we left a little disappointed because  we wanted more variety in each of our orders. We did try many different dishes overall, but the tastes didn't quite mix well together. Also, the tiny cups of lattes did not satisfy the coffee drinkers in our group and we had to stop at Starbucks on the way home.

I did my research on-line and saw the ""Happy Hour"" menu posted, and I asked about that when I was greeted at the bar. I was told they don't have a happy hour menu but instead was given the regular menu. Another bartender asked to take my order and gave me a glass of champagne, and that's when I found out there was an ""In Between"" menu with a few food items at lowered prices from 3 to 5:30.  Apparently, the menu I was given didn't even start until 5:30, and I was there around 4:45.  ??????
Great, I spent 10 minutes deciding on something and it wasn't even on the ""In Between"" menu. So, I ordered the $11 Poppy burger from this new menu, which comes with Poppy fries with a delicious sauce. I ordered the burger medium rare and it was much closer to rare, but it was a good burger overall, I love the fried egg and pickles. 
My bill was incorrect, as I was charged the regular menu price instead of the ""In Between"" menu price. The manager did speak to me to apologize for the error and correct the mistake, and she was very considerate and invited me to come back.

Back then I found it novel to be able to try as many things as you want and stuff yourself with food until you're sick. I'm not a kid anymore though, so maybe buying into the buffet was my main problem here.

Either way, I don't feel like this place would be worth it. I spent the 12 bucks on the buffet lunch because everything else on the menu was just as expensive, so I figured that being able to choose a bunch of different things would make it worthwhile. My girlfriend does not like curry, so she got a made-to-order dish for about what I ended up paying.

I picked out a few curries with some rice for my first trip. I took one bite and it was ice-cold. I mean, usually when people say ice-cold they're exaggerating, and their food is actually just luke-warm, but mine tasted like it had been sitting out for many many hours, and was truly very cold. I stopped the waitress as she dropped off my girlfriend's plate and asked her to reheat it in the back, and let her know the buffet was cold. She was apologetic and checked on the buffet table, came back and said something about it being hot on the bottom but all the cold stuff was on top. I think she turned up the heat but I can't be sure. 

Regardless, she was nice enough to throw my plate of curry in the microwave for a few seconds and brought it back hot. Maybe it was the microwave or maybe it just wasn't good food, but I was nonplussed with what I was eating. I took my time eating to allow the other food to heat up more, and then tried for a second plate. It too was just as cold, and this was after following the waitresses second set of instructions (something about stirring it up beforehand).

I left most of the food on my plate and finished my mango lassi (which was ironically one of the better ones I've had). Tried a bit of my girlfriend's Szechuan beef and it was at least hot, but was meager in portion-size and really wasn't anything special. We paid our 30-something dollar tab and left.

R9wLdpvRP-tKYtzyF_M1Iw,qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,5,5,3,3,"I ate at L'Atelier on opening day, and another four times since then. While the excitement of going to a great new restaurant is gone, the quality remains. L'Atelier isn't cheap, but it serves the best food of any restaurant in its price range. If you like innovative food that tastes great, you owe it to yourself to try this place.

The best way to sample what L'Atelier has to offer is to get the tasting menu. It varies a little over time, but remains recognizable. Here are notes from my 1st meal (I took better notes then):
* Vegetable Fondant Topped With a Delicate Avocado Cream. A small martini glass with a layer of tomato gelee, soft yet firm, smooth, bright red, with an intense tomato flavor. On top, thick avocado cream/puree, bright green and delicious. Take a spoon and get a bit of both layers; it looks beautiful on the spoon and tastes just as good..
* La Langoustine Carpaccio With Roasted Poppy Seed Dressing. A rectangle, paper thin, with micro chives, pepper, and lemon oil. It's a tiny portion but with strong flavor and a soft, melting texture.
* Les Huitres: Poached Baby Kumamoto Oysters With French Echre [sp?] Salted Butter. Three tiny oysters with salty butter on top, with black pepper; warmed briefly. I don't like oysters, but these were terrific! Perhaps I've been eating oysters in the wrong places.
* L'Oeuf: Egg Cocotte Topped With a Light Mushroom Cream. Another dish served in a martini glass. In the bottom, some bright green parsley puree. Next a raw egg. The glass is then steamed, cooking the egg white but not the yolk. On top, a frothy, flavorful cream of mushroom soup, with a couple of pieces of chanterelle mushroom on top of that. Another wonderful combination of flavors; another case where I wasn't so sure I'd like it, but did.
* Le Foie Gras: Rich, soft but slightly brown on the outside. I loved it.
* Le Morue: Fresh Cod Filet in Vegetable Broth. The broth had a drop of basil oil, giving it an interesting flavor. The cod was barely cooked through, wrapped in a very thin piece of ravioli.  Excellent!
* An extra treat, compliments of the chef: a papillote of langoustine. This was a generous piece of langoustine wrapped in a thin layer of phyllo dough, and quickly fried.
* La Caille: Free-range Quail Stuffed With Foie Gras, With Truffled Potato Puree. Two small pieces of quail, good flavor, firm but not dry. Now about the potato puree - potatoes can't be this good! They take raw potatoes, and rub them against a fine sieve. They're pureed with lots and lots of butter, and some snippets of chive are added. All of this is covered with a layer of thin truffle slices.  Incredible! [note: the next time I went, they used much less truffle, but it was still excellent].
* La Framboise: Raspberry Jelly Madam Yuzu and Citrus Cream. The jelly was not too sweet, not too thick, with very intense flavor. The citrus cream was thick and delicious. There were several very large, ripe seedless raspberries.
* Le Chocolat: Chocolate Sensation Cremeux Araguai, Oreo Cookie Crumbs."" Yes, a second dessert; my kind of place. This was a tiny portion that is in the running for my favorite dessert ever. At the bottom was (I think) a bit of bitter, thick caramel. Above that, thick, very dark Valrhona chocolate. Above that (or to the side) was something like a ball of ice cream - I can't describe it very well, but it was delicious. Finally, some finely crumbled Oreo cookie, and a thin piece of chocolate in the form of a ring, forming a cover with a hole in the middle. [sad note: this dessert has gone downhill over time.  There is no longer any caramel, and the chocolate layer is more like a regular chocolate mouse.] Rating of VG - very good, but nothing like the dessert last time.
* The meal ended with a choice of cappuccino or espresso; I chose cappuccino. It was rich, not bitter, and came with rough cubes of brown sugar and white sugar.

Not a single course was merely good. Everything was beautifully presented. At almost any other restaurant, any of the courses I had at L'Atelier would have been a star of the entire meal.

I've also ordered a la carte, but space limitation prevent a full description.  A couple of highlights:
* La Lisette: Fresh mackerel on a thin tart with Parmesan shavings and olives. Almost like a tiny, thin pizza. The flavors were strong; the very thin crust was very flaky. Simple food wonderfully prepared.
* Le Homard: Maine lobster salad with a sherry vinegar dressing. A very generous amount of sweet lobster, in a strongly flavored but not overpowering dressing, served on top of greens. Very simple, but expertly prepared.

**UPDATE October 2007: I tried the tasting menu yet again.  It's changed a little, e.g.: halibut instead of cod; new desserts; a much smaller portion of potato puree. However, it's not that different, and the quality is as good as ever.",2007-06-21 16:32:57

A few things to note for first time visitors. 1. It's fast food, but you can't think of it as fast food. The quality is much higher which makes it more expensive. Think of it like going out to eat. 2. There will be a wait. Just expect it. Even opening day I waited 30 minutes. In Shake Shack world, that's not bad. 3.

The $14 ticket price (with no matinee pricing) is just insane, and an extremely cynical business move on the part of Harkins. This theater is the only theater in Phoenix to show the smaller indie fare, so for serious film fans like myself paying the $14 ticket price is my only option other than waiting for DVD.

In addition I find the seating uncomfortable. I'm a tall person (6'4"") and my feet just hang off the end of the recliner.

I have also noticed that Harkins (at least at this location) has no PSA of any kind about cell phone usage before the movie starts. While most people are respectful, it only takes a few to ruin the experience. Someones phone rang in my last movie here, and they answered it!

We got one of the last available tables.  Soon after we placed our order, there was a line at the door.  

This restaurant gets super busy, but it took very little time to receive our appetizers, followed by main courses.  The pastas here are good (penne alla vodka, fettucine alfonza) and the pasta properly al dente, but we think the star is their pizzas.  The thin crust and generous toppings (and flexibility in substituting toppings) made the pizza cheesy, full of flavour yet not too filling.

Prices are reasonable here (including their wine list), and service is prompt and professional.  Tables turn over fairly quickly, but there seems to be a constant line-up once dinner hour begins, so plan accordingly!

Our original reservation was at 8am.   They called us to see if we could go in at 7:30am.  I had no issues with that!  Being as we were the first group that day, there weren't any delays.  I know the website says plan on 3-4 hours to be there.   We arrived at 7 and were done with everything by 8:30!!!  NICE!  

When you first get there, you sign the releases and watch the safety videos.  This doesn't take very long at all.    Then you demonstrate for them on an ottoman that you understood how to jump with the tandem person on your back.  Very very simple! Once that is complete, you go into the back hangar and put on your skydive suit and meet the person you will jump with.  If you are with anyone, they are allowed to come back with you.  My husband was able to get more pictures back there.  Once everyone in your group is suited up, you go outside by the planes where the instructor explains more of the procedures to you.  Since I bought the video portion, he is also talking with you to catch your entire experience.  They wear the little 'GOPRO' cameras to get every second of the jump.   LOVE IT!   Since I was the lightest in the group, I got in the plane last.  This means I am FIRST to jump.  It actually made it awesome because I got to sit by the door and get an incredible view on the way up! AND I didn't have time to change my mind once we were at jump level.  

The free fall is amazingly awesome!!  I am a roller coaster enthusiast. I thought you'd get the stomach drop feeling you would on the roller coasters.   Wrong.  I didn't get that feeling at all! Most people were shocked when I told them that.   Maybe it was just me but I was completely comfortable and enjoying every second!  

When all was said and done, you go back to the hangar to give them back the jump suit and then you are good!  Since we purchased the video and pictures, we only had to wait about 20 more minutes for them to complete those and give us the discs to take home.  That was great to not have to wait to see them all.  For the DVD and picture combo, the cost was an extra $130.   For this ultimate lifetime experience,...  totally worth it!  

Would I go back again? HELL YEAH!  Would I recommend this place to everyone?  HELL YEAH!  So happy to finally skydive!",2013-07-16 00:37:05

Even had a 4 star review drafted to express my love towards this place...but this evening I am sick and called to cancel my appointment as I'm not feeling well. The owner answered the phone and told me that I need to pay for my massage because of their 24 hour cancellation policy. I have poor reception at home so my phone disconnected. Within a few minutes I received a text message from her saying that I need to pay $38.00. I explained that 24 hours ago I didn't know I would be sick this evening, and she said ""Mayra still needs to be paid.""

Now I can understand the enforcement of this policy if I was a one time customer or someone who hasn't been coming once a week for the past 12+ weeks. I've never been late and always tip my masseuse!  

Not wanting to waste $38, I told her I would come in then and just use the groupon I purchased for my mother (as I don't want to send this place anymore business).  She told me that groupon is for first time customers only (doesn't say that anywhere on groupon) and then she text me ""bring $38"". 

Beyond rude. 

Other issues:
1) they don't keep any customer information so it took them over 6 weeks to stop calling me and trying to give me directions to their spa, a couple hours before my appointment. Annoying.  By week 6 shouldn't I be considered a VIP? 

2) they don't keep customer records to know who you saw last week or the week before. There was a massage therapist that I really didn't like and didn't want to have again. When I was trying to book an appointment with their spa (my usual therapist wasn't available), I was so afraid I was going to get her again because they don't keep records.  I ended up just waiting for my therapist to be available. 

3) they take your credit card into a separate room to process payment. I hate this. It feels a little suspicious and makes me uneasy. 

4) they advertise that their normal price is $80 but you can purchase groupon $38, living social $38, yelp $38 and even call them directly for the ""$38 special"". You're not actually getting a deal. It's their normal price. 

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1, is because of Mayra. She's a great therapist and if she goes to another spa, I would definitely follow. :) 

I guess I saw this break up coming, but really liked my therapist and the convenience of this spa.  I guess I need to move on...",2015-09-11 00:52:49

First the pasta was AWFUL, there was no flavor.. at all. There was melted cheese on top and I couldn't even taste that. Alfredo is supposed to be creamy, yummy, and this was far from it. Ive literally had better from the grocery stores freezer section. The pasta itself was mushy, really mushy. The garlic bread tasted like oil, no garlic taste at all, no butter-y goodness, just oily and tough (like chewing beef jerky)

The pizza was weird, like the crust was almost cardboard-y, the sauce had a strong sweet taste like they added to much sugar, its got a strong basil taste as well. The cheese had no flavor again, it was almost fake tasting. The sausage I got on it reminded me of ground beef thats how SMALL the chunks were. 

The salad was even odd. For one they put it in the SAME bag as the pasta which means it was warm, and sweated. The tomatoes were slices (how much energy does it take to chop a freaking tomato) and the cucumbers were soggy. Lettuce as meh, but what got me is the ranch was gross. It tasted like a cole-slaw dressing mixed with ranch. Sweet and mayonnaise-y with an odd powdered ranch taste. 

The soda was good though, perhaps its because they didn't make it. They took over an hour to deliver and they are less than a mile away.

I have to admit that it felt pretty unique to me when I surveyed and explored the store. They have a bakery section with a variety of breads and pastries that I recommend taking a visit before exploring the rest of the store. Next to the bakery, they have a little cafe area where you can order Mexican fast food staples like tortas, tacos, burritos, combination plates, etc. It might be somewhat more normal in a Mexican supermarket for them to have those things, but all of these American supermarkets don't get too creative at all.

The one thing I love about La Bonita, are their prices. The prices of their food is really cheap compared to American supermarkets. They have super sales on Wednesdays and Thursdays, so look out for those! In general, the advertised items on their weekly ads are a lot cheaper than most of the sales at American supermarkets.

Don't be freaked out that it's a store with a lot of Hispanic people in it. We live in a new day and age where we're all use to seeing different types of people in different places.

This place has been on my list of bookmarks for quite a long time. When we had the chance to go to their first ""Pop-Up Brunch,"" I jumped at the chance.

First of all, it was super easy to find, off Charleston and Main.  There is a very small parking lot attached to the building, but it was full when I arrived. Luckily, I was able to find a spot in front of the restaurant, across the street. Since it was Sunday, it was also free.

Now, this will be an interesting review for some of you, because Velveteen Rabbit does not have a kitchen or normally serve food.  This brunch was (hopefully not) a one-time thing.  2 awesome Chefs from DOCG worked out of a mobile catering truck out back and served an amazing meal.

I need to go back to see the actual decor. For this occasion, all of the normal furniture was removed and placed out back on the patio (which actually looked really cool). There were large round tables set up with folding chairs.  The event was held to 40 people (and sold out), which was perfect.

Upon entering, we were each handed a glass of Moet Ice. There was fruit and herbs on the table to add to our drinks.

On the tables to start, there was a charcuterie board (with duck sausage, fresh mozzarella and other items), fresh fruit and pastries. One of the pastries was a bacon cream cheese stuffed corn muffin. OMG!!  There was also extra bacon cream cheese on the table, which we all slathered on everything (it was really good). There was also a strawberry rhubarb crumble, which was probably my favorite. It was sweet without being overly sweet. 

Everything was served family style, and there was SO much food. There were semolina waffles with huckleberry compote and honey butter, porchetta benedict with sage biscuits (holy cow!), smoked salmon bruschetta with prosecco creme fraiche and caviar, corned beef hash (yum!), kobe short rib quiche, quattro formagio quiche and salad. As you can see - A LOT of food.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was so freaking delicious. It seemed as if every dish was better than the last. Seriously, very well done ladies!

After all of this, there was still dessert to be served! The TOWER of tastiness came out and we were all so full, it was barely touched.  The selections were: cream puffs, chocolate mousse cups and chef's selection of mini cakes.

The cost of this meal: $50 per person, plus gratuity. What a total steal - it also included 3 beverages. First was the Moet Ice upon arrival. Then we had the ""All Hail Mary,"" which was Belvedere vodka with tomato, bell pepper, lemon, basil, sage and spices. This took a bit to grow on me, but it was so flavorful and well made.  Last was the ""Lazy Sunday,"" belvedere vodka, grapefruit kaffir lime leaf liqueur, lemon and fresh strawberry. Most everyone said that this was their favorite - it was like strawberry lemonade with a kick.

This was such a great experience - I REALLY hope that they do this again soon.  Everyone at our table had an amazing time and all said that we would do it again. Very well done! I can not give enough praise about this experience - it was by far 5 star, but since I haven't actually had a true experience at Velveteen, I am going with 4 stars for now.

Service was attentive from the beginning to the end, and the I didn't have to wait too long for my NY strip. It is definitely not cheap, but the steak you get is huge, probably even enough to share between two people. The taste and texture were on point, and although I realize that having the bone in is what makes this a classic, the tendons in mine were quite stringy and made the meat harder to separate in some parts. So I'd probably say the price is more for the amount of steak that you get rather than the quality of the cut (maybe this isn't as true for other items). Assuming you don't mind using your hands a bit, you can probably get more of the meat than with just using your knife and fork.

The staff were really sweet and the one guy who helped us knew a ton about different breeds and played with all the dogs regularly so he had insight into their personality traits. He was someone who you could tell was really passionate about his job and genuinely cared about the animals. He asked us a lot of questions and said that he does that because he wants to make sure that it's a good match for both us and for the dog. He wanted to make sure it would be a forever home for the dog since all of the dogs there have already gone through enough heartache. That's the kind of person you want working for your company. I was really impressed and glad to know that someone like that had the backs of these helpless animals. Sorry to go all Sarah McLachlan on you but I couldn't not.

The first dog we adopted was about three years ago, her name was Bebe in the shelter and we renamed her Baby. Two years later Baby was looking in the mirror a lot while crying so we took that as a sign that she wanted an animal friend. Fast forward a few weeks and we adopted Sonnet from the ""poetry pup siblings,"" who we renamed Coco. Both of their stories were sad, Baby's family had left her behind and Coco and her siblings were found homeless and scared of people. I wanted to be a bit detailed in case the staff read these reviews so they can get an update on the dogs they helped. Both of the dogs are so happy and lead very happy dog fun and friendly lives.

also, they had advertised mutton one week, I went to buy and the counter guys insisted that mutton was goat meat, not lamb....I am pretty sure I was right, that mutton is older lamb, a bit more gamey than most lamb sold (young).  No big deal, just passed on it, not real sure on what to do with goat meat!

haven't really purchased anything else other than from butcher counter and on occasion some fresh bakery items, so honestly can't do full comparison to a Smiths or Albertsons.

So we descended in the tower elevator to see what Roxy's on the casino level had available.  The dessert case in front featured various small cakes that appeared to be too large for just two people.  But, after perusing the menu, we saw that sundaes and other smaller possibilities were also available.  So, we presented ourselves for seating in one of the booths.

Not long afterward, I saw that more substantial fare was also featured on the menu--besides half-pound burgers.  The hunger pangs became more incessant.  So, in addition to an Apple Cobbler ala mode to share, Diane ordered Popcorn Shrimp, and I a BLT with Fries.  Little did I know at the time that this would be the biggest BLT I had ever seen.  

The massive sandwich was buoyed by lightly toasted Sourdough Bread that was smeared with a thin layer of mayonnaise as I had requested; contained crisp lettuce, fresh tomato slices, and very good just slightly crisp bacon.  It was accompanied by slightly malleable Skin-on Fries and a Kosher Dill Pickle spear.  All were very tasty.  Somehow, within I-1/2 hours I succeeded in polishing off the whole BLT, plus Diane's tender Onion Straws.

Then came the baked Apple Cobbler with a very large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  Unfortunately, because the dessert had real Raspberry Sauce trails streaked all across the top, and Diane is allergic to berries, we had to send this dessert back.  But our server immediately offered to bake and bring forth a new one, which he rather quickly did--after making a diner at another table happy through receipt of a free Apple Cobbler covered with Raspberry Sauce.  So, service was very good, and all ended well with a delicious large, warm, and doughy homemade Apple Cobbler adorned only with Vanilla Ice Cream.

Last week I decided to give it another shot and ordered two other Yelp review favorites, the Papaya Salad and Duck Fried Rice.  My thought was I'd counter the unhealthy fried rice with the papaya salad and maybe eat half of each.   The best laid plans of mice and fat men....

Went and picked them up (service both times seemed a little rushed, but not unfriendly).   Prices are pretty standard. 

 Upon getting back to my office I went for the salad first.  I thought it looked really nice, but I didn't enjoy the flavor at all.  Now it must be said for the 50th time how much I typically do not like salad so maybe it's personal, but I found the bean sprouts in particular to have that dirt taste that they sometimes get.   Or is this the way bean sprouts are supposed to taste?  I love them cooked usually, but maybe raw they taste like dirt.  I didn't get any sweetness from the papaya and I ordered a 7/10 and wasn't getting much spice either.  Maybe I was eating it wrong.  Either way, YELP YOU FAILED ME ON THIS ONE.

But redemption comes in the form of Duck Fried Rice.  Holy Moly.  Toss that silly salad aside and dig in.  Now it doesnt seem too complicated:  take greasy fried rice, add a healthy amount of unhealthy, fatty duck and voila!  A star is born and a salad is forgotten.

The table got the cornbread to start (amazing), and we finished with their banana cream pie (UH-Mazing). The rest of the sides, salads and entrees that we ordered were very good as well.

At some point intending to visit each and every one of The Strip's 24/7 eateries it was largely as a result of my participation in the 2014 Dress For Success Power Walk that I ended up at Planet Dailies just after 6:00am on Saturday and although much could be written of the inebriated eye-candy still lingering after a long night of drinking and dance it was actually the food as well as the service that proved even more remarkable, a pleasant surprise to say the least.  Clearly not a typical pre-dawn patron for the Los Angeles import whose vast size only serves to magnify the sound emitted from LCDs displaying videos of top-40 hits it was with a request for a table toward the rear of the restaurant that I sought solace from the post-club 'scene' and graciously assenting to my appeal despite the section being otherwise unpopulated I was no sooner seated than a young woman named Deidre arrived along with a menu and all the right answers to questions regarding an order meant to make the most of my morning.  Happily offering a true ""All Day"" experience inclusive of breakfast favorites straight through sandwiches and steaks to dessert it was with gluttonous eyes focused more on variety than the costs involved that I inquired about single serving options and after confirming with the cook that such an order could be compiled it was in a quintet that I partook, a bottomless cup of coffee never coming close to half-empty throughout my sixty minute stay.  Opting to proceed in two courses with the first consisting of three a la carte griddle favorites plus a decidedly dry cinnamon roll it was undoubtedly the eggy French Toast that shined the brightest of the selections and with fresh fruit toppings all made in house along with hand whipped vanilla cream I'd be hard pressed to suggest which accoutrement was actually 'best,' though the juicy ripe peaches and boozy bananas foster certainly made an equally strong case.  Undoubtedly a substantial order given the heft of the custard laden challah it was unfettered that I moved on to a choice of desserts and although the restaurant's signature carrot cake certainly warranted a second look it was in the 'Heaven n' Hell' style bread pudding that I placed my trust - the juxtaposition of black and white batons proving absolutely delightful with the former resembling a semi-set brownie while the later featured laminated layers soaked in butter and cream that slowly melted on the tongue.",2014-07-29 04:42:40

We'd read many bad reviews, but were willing to give it a chance because there are so few places to get paella in the city and were just in the mood for Spanish food. After the service we experienced and the food that we got, we would never come back.

The Good: The atmosphere was lovely. Perfect set-up for a date spot with wonderful lighting and a romantic ambiance. Totally ready to dig in and ordered several different dishes (the bacon-wrapped dates, assorted meats, the paella, etc.) Until....

The Bad: Yes, I get that they're tapas. Yes, I know that they're small. But there's a difference between little appetizers that leave one's stomach feeling intrigued, excited, satisfied (which many of the other Spanish tapas restaurants we've been to, like Bar Isabel were able to get) and servings that are just plain stingy. Think: a sliver of cheese with one piece of bread on the side, three puny wrapped dates in one small bowl (really greasy and overly sweet), a few slabs of meat poorly arranged on a plate (unseasoned, bland, and tough to chew), etc. Would be worth it if the food was of high quality (to match the prices), but it wasn't.

The Ugly: We came here for the paella, and we were left deeply disappointed. First, when trying to gauge the size of the paella, we asked the server which would be best for two of us to share, as we were both pretty hungry. Knowing what we had ordered previously, he said, ""Hmm, I don't know,"" and continued looking over our shoulder. I asked again, ""Would you recommend the small or large?"" And the server replied, ""Hmm? Oh, small? Okay, yeah, that should be filling for both of you"" and hurried off.  About ten minutes in, we noticed that the table next to us had ordered the small serving of paella and realized that that would not be enough for us. As I hadn't yet seen the server punch in our order, I asked him if it would be possible to change it. He immediately refused, stating, ""NO, the paella is ready to come out now, it's basically done and just waiting for me to drop it off at the table for you.""  My boyfriend and I both worked in customer service/the restaurant industry before and understand how frustrating it can be for servers when customers change their orders, so of course we were accommodating and agreed to stick with the small serving. 10 minutes later, did the paella arrive? Nah.  How about 15? Nope.  What about 20? No.  Over thirty-five minutes later, our ""ready-to-come-out"" and ""just-waiting-to-be-dropped-off"" paella arrives and the server makes no excuses, just drops it off and disappears again.  We waited over an hour - an hour!- for all of our food in total, despite us asking our server earlier how long it would take (because we were in a bit of a rush) and him assuring us multiple times that it would take ""no longer than 20-30 minutes. 

The bottom line: Inattentive, lousy service. Come here if you'd like mediocre Spanish food in small servings, with a side order of attitude. Otherwise, check out other places in Toronto that genuinely care and are excited about their dishes, like Bar Isabel, etc.",2016-07-26 05:00:23

Get there early for the lunch rush, as lines can stretch out of the building and down to the parking lot during spring and fall months. The staff is always courteous and the tables are sparkling clean. Even the bathrooms are kinda fun, with retro cartoons playing on small tv's in the walls. Make sure you hit them up on your birthday, for $10 towards your meal. Joe's Farm Grill is one of our favorite restaurants to visit when the weather is nice, and the Agritopia area is one of the most gorgeous spots in Gilbert. If you're looking for something different and want to enjoy the gorgeous spring/fall/winter weather, definitely head here!",2015-08-09 17:13:41
vyhCFlphXUVhzJsb6gEDNQ,BgF9Iy2wKPLYAcU-1Kfq_w,PWGIAIXAoh91nayfIOQMTQ,1,2,0,0,"I had the worst Panera experience ever at this location.  

I ordered a chai latte and sat down with my computer.  I wanted to get a lot of work done, and I needed a little milky treat to get me started.  After a few minutes I went back up to pick up the drink but the girl was still working on it (even though there were no other drink orders other than mine).  I stand up there, and I can hear that the girl is not aerating my milk at all.  She's just keeping the wand all the way at the bottom of the pitcher.  Bad sign.  About 5 minutes later, I finally got my drink.  I was excited to finally have my warm, delicious chai, but I was so disappointed when I took off the lid and saw a thick skin on my milk.  

Having worked at coffee shops for many years, I knew that this meant that the girl had seriously scalded my milk.  I took it back up and asked her to remake it.  Now, let me tell you something.  I never complain about food or drinks.  I usually just live with it and/or throw it out.  But I don't complain.  This was disgusting, though, and I knew that if they remade it without scalding the milk, it would be fine.  The girl reluctantly agreed to make it, but only after acting like I was crazy and telling me that milk skin is normal.  Umm...no.

So she makes it again and when I get it, I take off the lid to check it out.  This time there's no skin, but my drink is curiously only 3/4 full.  I think, ""she did this on purpose to get back at me for having to remake my drink.""  Instead of having her make it a third time, I ask for my money back.  They get the manager, who gives me a refund.  As I am getting my stuff to leave, the two girls behind the counter are audibly talking bad about me and laughing.

I will never, ever come back to this location.",2012-01-06 23:58:19

Tom (our server on this trip) was AWESOME.  He gets 5 stars... attentive without being annoying and in fact was VERY accomodating.

I tried the Grapefruit Cooler cocktail and it turned out to be too sweet and syrup-y for me.... and Tom swamped it out for a beer for me.  Most servers wouldn't even bother. I was really surprised and appreciative that Tom did that for me.

Timing on food was perfect.... ordered an appetizer and it came out quickly... and that was cleared... we waited a couple minutes and our dinners were served.

The Food....
The Tuna Poke is sweet.... by that I mean I think it's marinated or tossed in a sweet ginger, sesame dressing.  It didn't have the type of texture or flavor like at a sushi place.  So, if you truly like poke... don't order this.  Of course, because of the sweet factor... it's not fishy at all... so if you like sweet.... you will probably like this.

My Turkey dinner.... was GREAT.... the gravy was a bit salty but then I'm overly sensitive to salt so I'm not knocking them since I easily scooped most of the gravy off the meat... the meat was big and meaty.  The potatoes were ok, but when you get a small bite of potatoes with a bit of turkey and gravy and then dip it in the blueberry cobbler ... it creates a fantastic all in one bite...oh yea.... Thanksgiving Bites.  :)    This was a ""Comfort Dinner"" for me.... of course... I am a big fan of Thanksgiving foods.  The steamed veggies were good but they were drenched in butter ... so... while I ate them... I didn't feel like it was as healthy as it could have been.

The husband had the Short Rib dinner... these too were good ""Comfort"" foods.  Not the best we've ever had... but pretty darn good.... good texture but not melt in your mouth amazing... but there was a good rich flavor.  

This is a good place to go when you can't figure out what it is you want to eat or where you want to go.... because they have all sorts of options on their menu from salads to steak to beef strogonoff to pot pies to tacos and everything in between.

It's quite small, with about 6 small tables - 3 at the window and 3 along the side. Although seating is limited, you can still come to study during the day. But you may want to come by yourself as one table will barely hold your drink and laptop. There is also free wifi that is strong should you need it. Or you can come and catch up with a friend over coffee and Greek pastries. 

Now, the best part - food and drink! I ordered a coconut latte to drink. Wow - the balance between the milk and espresso was perfectly unexpected. To accompany it, I had a ratatouille quiche for lunch - a great vegan option. Even thought it's vegan, the crust had a buttery texture and the spices and flavour of the spices used in the veggie filling was absolutely delicious. Definitely a strong garlic flavour so beware if you're not a garlic fan! 

I hung out for a couple of hours studying so I ended up getting a Wanda's Pie in the Sky ""hermit"" cookie. Another good (more affordable) vegan option. Soft, subtly sweet and full of texture from the raisins and nuts.

We have tried the mussels with chorizo, the steak with pommes frites, their oysters and the crispy Brussels leaves with a fantastic balsamic drizzle. Everything has tasted so great each time we order it and for the fact that each dish is either $1, $5, or $7, it is a lot of food. The mussels are some of my favorite, it is a huge bowl of mussels with a great broth, tons of chorizo, and their bread is fantastic. The steak is enough for two to share, cooked well and with delicious pommes frites. 

If you only get one thing off my list, the crispy brussels leaves is where it is at. They are cooked perfectly and the balsamic drizzle is 'lick the plate' delicious. We actually got a second order because we each wanted our own, that's how good they were.

Geoff loves seaweed salad and eats it whenever he gets the chance, he said it was pretty average,not the best,but not the worst, just average. the sashimi salad I did enjoy, it looks gorgeous, I love the presentation but it didn't blow my mind, but it was good for sure. the shit comes highly recommened it's fried, it has a yummy sauce, what's not to love. the dragon balls are mushrooms with lobster mix deep dried,very yummy. now, the Towering Sashimi Poke o...m..g! so good!!!!!!! it comes on a lil fried wonton chip with crab mix and some poke and a lil like salsa mix on top it's fresh and yummy definitely get the towering poke!we ordered it twice it was so good. the service was better this time than it has been for me in the past. other times I felt completely forgotten about as far as refills are concerned tonight was much better. still a couple times they almost gave us someone else's food, but it was quickly figured out and resolved,they were very busy with lots of servers and busers running around so I can see how a lil confusion can happen. next we got the sashimi roll, the summer crunch roll and the honey screaming O. I liked all of them my fav though was summer crunch, it's lobster mix deep fried with some other goodness, they are lil balls of heaven or as Geoff says ""a tasteplosion in my mouth"" the screaming O was different than I thought it would be from the other pics on yelp.it was good, but I was a lil disapointed that it wasn't what I expected.im still on the hunt for the one ive seen in other yelp pics.next we had the Chanel roll and the Be Happy roll. I really loved the Chanel, it has assorted fish on top, crab and tempura shrimp inside and screaming o sauce, it was yummy. our server also said it was his fav. by the time the be happy roll came I was so full lol! it was similar to chanel as far as sauce and assorted fish but it had fried soft shell crab inside instead of crab mix. this was the first time I have ever tried soft shell crab, it wasn't bad. it was a Lil chewy from the shell of the crab I think. it was different but it was good. finally we had the tempura ice cream, also a first for me it was pretty good. it's small so perfect to share after you are full of sushi lol. just a lil sweet treat to end the night. it had a funnel cakeiness to it that I liked. we actually ordered the summer crunch a second time, for the last round but it never came, we ended up being really full anyhow so we didnt say anything.i gotta say even though the service sometimes irritates me, I love sakana. they have so much to choose from and they are always coming up with new and interesting things. and they really take pride in presentation. the  Chanel roll and be happy were very pretty! i just wish they would tighten up their customer service a  little bit.like i had to ask for my first refill of ice tea, when he was right there when we ordered the 2nd round, my glass was empty but he didnt seem to notice, so i asked the next time he came back. and he did do it after that without asking (i drink a lot of ice tea lol), but I don't want to have to ask at all, especially if you are standing right there and my glass is empty, notice and offer a refill, it's why I am going to leave you a good tip. tonight was better than times before, but there is still room for improvement.i wish i could leave a 3.5 star thats really what i want to do.just  a star and a half to improve service a little bit. next up on my bookmark list is Yama sushi, close by sakana. I wanna see how they compare to each other. really I wanna find the best sushi spot in vegas, maybe it's sakana, maybe it's somewhere else , i dunno, but I am gonna find it lol.",2015-08-31 05:33:13

I appreciate the salsa bar offering red and green salsas, pickled jalapeños, carrots, and onions, cucumbers, and radishes. The salsas could be better, but I like the flavor of the red salsa adds a nice spice to the food. Service isn't necessarily friendly, but for a two-minute interaction, I don't really care. You order your food at the cashier, you pay, you pick up your food, then you eat. That's it.

This location has only a picture menu with no prices (except the breakfast options). A lot of their items are drenched in (not-so-melted) shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or guacamole, so you've been warned. I simply order my meal without one or all of these toppings and I'm satisfied.

I've only been here a handful of times, but the experience has been consistent. I normally order Carne Asada Fries or Nachos and/or Carne Asada Tacos. I don't normally deviate from these items, but I have had the Breakfast Burrito and Tamales. Everything has been tasty. 

During my visit yesterday, I wanted to see how their Pastor stood up to street vendors, so I ordered two Al Pastor Tacos ($2.30/each) topped with pico de gallo and guacamole. Not too shabby! I was surprised that the pork was so tender and flavorful. Certainly a good alternative to street tacos! Ruben ordered the Chicken Quesadilla Combination Plate ($6.35) that was packed with three very large slices of quesadilla, refried beans, and Mexican rice. The chicken was moist and juicy and there was so much of it! They're not holding back. We also shared Carne Asada Fries ($6.95), always delicious, although they never season their fries, so it just needs a bit of salt. A small drink with unlimited refills is just $1.50 (no lemon-lime soda option) and all prices include sales tax.",2014-02-25 05:08:19

The sides are served family style.  I tried the crispy potato cakes.  They were very good.  The scallion creme fraiche added some good flavor as well.

For dessert I ordered the beignets with 18 year old Macallan butterscotch pudding.  The beignets were very good.  They did not have as much powdered sugar as Cafe Du Monde, but were at least as good in flavor.  The butterscotch pudding was very good as well.

Apparently on the weekends there is karaoke, and let me tell you, this is not your average karaoke experience! I mean, karaoke where 3/4 of the people that sing actually have decent to really good voices?? Geez, where are the horrible screeching renditions of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" or ""Fergalicious""??? Oh wait...that's right my husband was there and sang the latter...and he was awful, but in a funny way. If you do go to participate in karaoke, there are plenty of TV screens with the words. I really liked that a few TVs were reserved to show football and Sportscenter!

Apollo's itself is a moderately sized establishment with an outdoor patio. I only saw the ladies bathroom, cleverly marked with a ""Goddesses"" sign, but it was tiny; however, there was never a line as most of the crowd was of the male persuasion. My husband and I had beer, so I can't comment on the prices for mixed drinks or shots, but beer was cheaper than most places I have been to in the Valley. Bud light drafts were $2.75 and Fat Tire drafts were $3. Since I was the designated driver that evening, I switched to soda halfway through the night, which was $2 and included free refills. The bartenders were extremely friendly and very prompt in service. There is also a waiter that floats throughout the space if you don't want to go up to the bar.

We shared a Ruben which was so great. A nice pile of pastrami and a whole grain mustard and sourkraut to boot on a marble rye roll.

Totally worked. The greek yogurt sauce had a smokey flavor to it. Very good. Friends had the church potatoes and some mac n cheese that they both scarfed down so Im assuming they were great as well. I had a cucumber drink that sounded weird but was actually delicious. Other friends had a different drink with blueberries blackberries and lemonade.

I think Bronze Cafe may be my all-around favorite spot for a casual lunch (or dinner). Their sandwiches are out of this world. I'm a sucker for vegan/vegetarian friendly places as I'm generally not a huge meat-eater.

Their veg sandwiches are pretty great. They're more than just some vegetables slapped between some bread. They're flavorful & delicious! My favorite veg-friendly sandwich is the The Good Earth: roasted vegetables, spring mix, hummus, sprouts, lemon vinaigrette, and spicy sunflower seeds all on a soft & delicious pita. I like this over the Tree of Life Pita. My go-to non-veg sandwich here which I consider to be one of the most delicious sandwiches... well... in all of Las Vegas is called The Complicated Order. It's an LGBTQ (that's a sandwich) w/ avocado & turkey ;D That's housemade bacon jam, maple-glazed bacon, spring mix, tomato, basil aioli, and lemon vinaigrette, avo, & turkey on a toasted ciabatta. Much bun-love here. Much everything love.

They have salads and the usual cafe suspects. I really like their Bizness. It's a massaged kale salad base + any 3 sides. A little steep at $10 but it's still worth it to me. It's mighty delicious and you get a pretty healthy serving. You really can't find better vegetarian food in Vegas. It's rare and hard to come by here. This ain't LA people! My favorite sides are the beet salad, roasted mushroom, roasted potatoes. Skip the curry quinoa. But really, there's so much mix & matching possibilities just try whatever sounds good to you. Their sides menu is huge! You're bound to find something you'll like. 

In addition to their relatively large food menu, they also have some great drink selections. Pineapple Mint Chia anyone? Also have protein shakes and other blended drinks for your post-workout reward. The Real Results shake is vegan & gluten free. It's quite delicious: housemade almond milk, kale, PB, vegan protein, dates, cacao, maca, & flax. Whew, that's a mouthful. It really is. More like a meal replacement.

Other than the food, I'm not sure if it's the spacious layout of the restaurant or if it's the trendy casual vibe I feel as soon as I enter. But either way, they found a regular customer in me!

They're mostly known for the Pho but the rest of the menu is amazing! If you're willing to splurge a little extra, your server will bring a Specials Chalkboard to your table with some options for you but otherwise, you'll probably be very satisfied with their menu!

 TO SHARE:

Spring Rolls- Personally was never a fan of spring rolls until I tried the ones here. The rolls taste so fresh that I sometimes tell myself that I'm eating healthy whenever I order these. I also like to ask for no mint just because it tastes too strong but otherwise, I can eat them all day. 

Oxtail Fries- VERY generous with the oxtail meat and the fries. That's all you need to know!

ENTRÉE:

Rice Combo Platter- You get rice, an egg cooked to your preferred taste, sliced Taiwanese sausages, and you get the option of either pork chop or short rib. I HIGHLY recommend asking for both and paying extra! They're BOTH so good that no one should have to choose between one or the other. With a hungry stomach, you'll be able to finish the plate and feel quite full/happy. But if you're not that hungry, I would suggest asking for both meats and sharing it with someone else or taking the rest! It'll be more than enough. 

Never had an issue with service. They know what they're doing!

There were just two of us and we just wanted to sit at the bar and have an adult beverage and possibly grab some bar food.

We were able to slide into the bar area and find a couple open seats. Even though we were greeted immediately it took some time before the bar tender was freed up enough to where she could take our drink orders.
They have cold beer on draft and some local offerings, but nothing too extravagant or crafty. (At this point in time they had Sugar Creek and OMB.)

After flapping our gums and catching up as old friends do, we finally put in a food order. The bar tender was gracious and respected our time to chat and then decide on order. My friend ordered the basic cheeseburger and I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, which sounded amazing and must've been because she quickly reappeared stating they just ran out of the lettuce wraps. Dagnabit. I opted for the buffalo boneless chicken wings and french fries. His burger looked delicious! Should've went that route, I wasn't overly excited about my order. It filled the stomach but did not WOW me...

The bar tabs were now paid and off we went to check out the arcade area... where all the little kids and big ""little"" kids spend way too much money. But, man, is it fun! They did a good job with mirror trickery, making your eyes assume the arcade appears much larger than it actually is, but they still managed to cram in game after game. That is good and bad, because is there is a large group hovering around one game it may be hard for you (and possibly your group) to enjoy your specific game.

The atmosphere has a bit to be desired as the interior of the restaurant is very plain and inexpensively furnished.  The veggie spring rolls are generally quite fresh and come with the standard peanut sauce.  The veggie Pho here, though, is really just rice noodles with tofu (because I asked to add this) without anything like broccoli or bok choy as Noodles Ranch serves.  Saigon does offer the same plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, and cilantro, and the Pho generally tastes good but is not the best I've ever had. 

I also made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine here when my husband and I dined here one evening.  Now, I realize that this is not the type of place that would even have a wine list and was not surprised that my options were basically house red or white wine by the glass.  What I do expect, though, is that if a place is going to serve wine, that they at least have enough taste to discard wine that has been opened for a week or more, which was the case with the glass of white wine that I was served.  It literally tasted like vinegar and I didn't drink it.

I've stopped in to pick up take-out orders several times and am somewhat concerned about the overall cleanliness of this place which makes me wonder a bit about what the kitchen is really like.  Twice now when the staff has brought out my order and placed it on one of the tables near the cash register, when I walked over to the table to retrieve my order after paying, my shoes literally stuck to the floor.  I don't mean that it kind of felt like something may be on the floor, I mean that while wearing sandals, my shoes almost came off when I tried to take a step because the floor had a stickiness factor equivalent to that of duct tape.  Now that I've noticed that, I would be a bit reluctant to dine in again since I am definitely a cleanliness freak when it comes to restaurants and just knowing that the floor isn't clean would really creep me out to eat there.",2011-07-01 09:53:58

For anyone who hasn't experienced a Brazilian Steakhouse, its meat, meat and more meat. There is also a salad bar with some tasty treats. I am not a fan of salmon, but they salmon at the bar here was excellent. They also have a fabulous squid salad.

To start, you get this fried polenta stick I think? It was like a potato but it wasn't. It was yummy. As another yelper mentioned, they also provide silky whipped potatoes. Some of the best I've had. 

My last experience here was for my birthday and we had a late 9:30 reservation in which we were late. The staff was very accompanying and understanding. Although it was practically closing time, they did not put on any pressure at all. I sensed the urgency, but they were not aggressive one bit and I greatly appreciated it! They also ensured I had every cut of meat I wanted - even offering to cook anything they were out of. Thats what I call service - even at closing time. 

At the end of the meal, they still sang the birthday song in Portuguese for me and gave me cake. It was awesome, simply awesome. They have won a customer for life. It wasn't just dinner here, they truely made my dinner an ""experience"".

We've (Hubster and I) have been wanting to try this place when we saw it being renovated some time ago.  In an impromptu move, we left a restaurant (I'll write that review later. Ugh. Not good) anyway we left dinner and I mentioned giving The Gallery a try.  So we did.  And we're extremely happy that we did.  

Situated near Seoul and next door to Craft Tasting,  it's in a prime location.  We walked toward the front and my heart leaped with excitement.  Cute front patio with couples drinking coffee and wine! Already from that moment I knew this was the experience that I was looking for in a wine/coffee/bakery place.

We walked in and was really taken aback by the posh decor, (beautiful art on the walls..for sale) the fresh smell of coffee and the sweetness of the famous LadyM cakes.  I am sorry but I teared up a little.  We were greeted and handed menus and were told to sit anywhere we liked.  I bee lined it for a corner two person table and sat in sheer delight surrounded by beautiful artwork, quiet rumblings of intimate conversation and the music of Frank Sinatra.  

Hubs and I enjoyed rosé and a chocolate LadyM cake.  I read about those cakes in Charlotte Agenda and knew Hubs would love them.  I loved them just as much!! So light and airy and so delicately delicious!!! 

Free wifi so if you want a place to work during the day it's perfect.  I felt like I was in a different city...maybe country and I breathed in everything that this place had to offer.

My new go-to wine bar and secret hideaway.  It wasn't super busy which was awesome.  Living in the land of brewery heaven..with the packed patios and loud conversation.....THIS is where you'll find me...  Sipping on wine quietly.",2016-08-14 00:20:09

So yeah this place doesn't look Canadian but it has some great stuff so I figured why not. I love that the interior looks like a giant German Oktoberfest hall. All the tables are communal so you are encouraged to be social. The atmosphere is very friendly and bright. It's mainly a beer scene but their sausages are delish. 

I ordered a pheasant sausage (apple and sundried tomato) with sweet peppers and sauerkraut, all for $9.75. I also got duck fat fries (5.75) and smoked gouda (4.75) on top. I was allowed one dip so I chose chives and roasted garlic. Total with tax was ~$22 but it was delicious. 

The pheasant was steaming hot so be careful! It had a light gamey flavour and the texture was not too tough to chew. Very flavourful indeed. The sausage could be served in a white bun (which I got) or with curry. 

The fries were delicious but SUPER salty, and it might be a ruse to get you to try their beer. I had to buy water from a convenience store after. Anyway, they were a little burnt but otherwise very good and potatoey. My friend said she never saw such thick fries (and she's American) and was happily surprised. She couldn't finish her regular fries. I managed to finish all mine.

So we rephrased our question which I thought was very straight forward and very strange for someone to answer a question back with another question. He suggested the raindrop cake because he said the flavor tasted like strawberries and the golden lychee for a drink because that's how favorite and it also had great lychee flavor to it. So we took his suggestions and ordered them both. We were disappointed in his suggestions because both were not up to par with what he said. The rainbow cake was tasteless and although when you got to the strawberry it did taste like strawberry that was the only flavor in this cake but you'd expect the strawberry fruit to taste like strawberry right?

A few plus' to mention, the waiting area is nice and has lots of snacks to choose from, it is connected to a Robertos Tacos which you can never go wrong with, and shares the parking lot with a Mimi's Cafe and a Chiles if you really want to sit down and have a meal while you waste your precious hard-earned money for a terrible car wash.  By the way, it is also located in Boca Park, the heart of commerce in Summerlin.  I always pay for the upgraded wash, and twice now I have been disappointed. They leave dirt and trash in the car, heavy water spotting on the paint and glass, and don't really clean the console.  They didn't armorall the tires and they left the rims dirty as well.  It's funny, the last time I went Shawn Hogan was the manager and I got great service and coupons for a future 50% off car wash.  But because he is no longer employed there, my coupon was not honored.  So basically the cashiers think I'm a liar using coupons given to me on the sly.  Thanks for the benefit of the doubt.

The pastries live up to the hype. After looking at the reviews, we came here for brunch, as many others did. This place is pretty hidden inside the Venezia tower. I like that it's a little quieter than the rest of the Venetian though. The space is nice, airy and overlooks the pool.

We ordered:
-Beignets: delicious and jam filled. I liked the chocolate sauce better but both were good.
-Four pastry combo: You select the four you want. We chose:
Croissants: plain, blueberry and pain au chocolat: quite possibly the best croissants I've      ever had. They were perfectly flaky and buttery. The flavored ones were very on point and not too sweet.
Cheese danish: tasty and it's heaviness was a good contrast to the croissants.

Entrees:
-French toast: I tried some of my dad's and it was oh-so-delicious! The flavors were spot on.
-Salmon du jour: my mom and I shared this dish. It came with smoked salmon, butter lettuce, tomatoes, house made chive cream cheese and a baguette. This was ok but nothing special...besides the bread (seeing a pattern?!), which was a perfect loaf.
-Croque monsieur: didn't try but my brother liked it
-Classic breakfast platter: didn't try but my friend liked it

The service here was also great and they were very accomodating.

While the salmon dish was ...nice...the pastries are where it really stands out. Everything we loved included some kind of bread/flour (dieters beware!) and we all loved that and our experience at Bouchon.",2016-07-16 15:38:17

They were absolutely fantastic to work with (for instance, offering pulled chicken even though that's not on their catering menu) and the price was the best around (compared to Famous Dave's, Blues, Lil Porgy's, and Hickory River).  

The food was such a hit with the crowd that those of us working the event didn't get a chance to eat much of it, so we went back to Black Dog afterwards and got dinner!  The potato casserole is divine, the potato salad is spicy and delicious, and the meat is just phenomenal.  I've tried the Carolina Red and the Chipotle sauce, both of which were delicious.

The fish of the day was wild salmon, and at first I thought this would be a strange choice for a fish taco, you never can go wrong with the freshest fish available.

The service was quick and friendly. After paying the expensive price of $11 for the four fish tacos, I was delightfully surprised by the flavour. Not only was the salmon moist and flavoured nicely, the wasabi miso sauce served alongside it only enhanced the fish tacos taste. The blanket of crisp leafy green vegetables with the tomatoes and cucumber just made everything served on the plate taste great.

Located in the Artist district in Downtown Las Vegas parking can be found either on the street or in the small parking lot behind the bar. 

Upon entering, a bouncer popped out of nowhere and asked for ID. Fair enough, as I am the first in our group to flip him my CA license. He takes one look at it, then at me and said enjoy!

For a Saturday night around (I say and only because I am taking a wild guess because we started drinking a tad early that night) that it had to be somewhere around 11:00-12:00 am. This place was jam packed with happy people sitting around the bar and in their lounge area. The DJ was spinning random electro jams all through the time we were there. Our Vegas buddy found a cozy little area for the three of us to hang out in. One over size velvet chair fit for the Princess (me::smiles ::) and two other chairs for the boys. 

Vegas friend went up to the bar to get us a drink menu, now if this is your first time coming here, do not expect to have a giant list of house drinks. From what I understand the menu changes by season. 

All their Elixirs are handmade and ready to order when you are. Some of the ingredients you can swap out (i.e. if you cannot drink vodka then they can swap it for gin. Just ask your friendly bartender when ordering).

Eight different choices of Elixirs all different and are made with amazing stuff. Some sour some sweet some in between! However, no matter how to mix it each one only costs $8.00 a pop.

That is right you heard me $8.00 freaking dollars! That cheap considering on the strip you are paying $12.00-$15.00 for one watered down drink!

Our bartender was wonderful; it did not take too long for him to notice me. Asked if I had any questions and if I was ready to order.

Ordered:

Brawl and Seductions- Gin + house made sweet vermouth + genpy + fernet syrup + absinthe rinse.

Chronicle of the Priest- Rye + amaro montenegro + walnut liqueur + maple syrup + salt + angostura bitters. 

Bartender smiled and said great choices and went over to the other side of the bar to start working his magic.

I enjoyed watching him mix our drinks; it takes a special hand to know how to do that kind of mixology.

In no time our drinks were ready and both were filled to the brim (which I really liked) $16.00 total plus $4.00 tip = $20.00 total. Holy rabbit what a deal!

Carefully not to spill my drink and our friend's I made my way back to our area. 

After toasting to an awesome night out with good friends, we took a sip. Wow, mine was strong but not over powerful. It was more sweet then sour. It was all around a tasty drink that I would have probably gone back several more times after I had finished this first glass.

Now our friend's drink was way too strong for my taste. His first sip had him saying whoa, this is strong. However, after a couple more sips it started to mellow out.

Come here to drink, listen to some awesome tunes, take photos, and just have fun. It is dark in here with low lighting and candles! And as you all know this is my favorite type of setting!

Before attending this show, I already knew it was going to be shocking, but I was still surprised. I work for a company that received some criticism from a proclaimed doctor who saw this show and decided to write some snail mail letting us know how he felt. He said it was extreme and God forbid anyone watch it. Of course, that opinion from a proclaimed PHD recipient made me promise myself to see this show.

When arriving to see the tickets, I was able to easily pick up my tickets from will call without hassle or a wait on Wednesday night. I was directed to walk up a flight of stairs. I was in seating group C, which is midway to the back of the venue. When first seated it reminded me of the small cinema experience you would see back before IMAX was a thing. It was tiny and awkward like you traveled to another dimension. Part of me eerily enjoyed this aspect, the other part of me felt it was a bit clammy. 

The show started with a bang, showcasing their fully live band on a balcony above the stage. The cast danced to an upbeat song pumping me with fear that I was attending a musical. Have no fear though, the mood quickly switched when the main character (owner of the Club Z) set forth information about what was in store. We got to see some surprising sexy zombies showcase true talent, whether it be hula-hoop tricks, singing, or one of the many forms of dancing. Their was some crude humor that was meant for people who don't easily get offended, but overall the cast was very positive. The cast often interacted with crowd and we eve got some free jello shots. 

Since the show, I have the song "" I Eat Boys Like You for Breakfast"" by Ida Maria stuck in my head. I was inspired to give zombies a chance and also to let all of my friends know how awesome this show was.

*****Environment: The place is definitely pretty spacious. Definitely one of the biggest I've see n compared to other competitors. I do like the big projector TV displayed by the bar, giving this place a great place for game nights and also the wooded walls where they allow you to write and doodle. I didn't feel crowded here at all. The place looked clean and smelled good for being a place that serves this type of food. The bathroom was clean and so were the heavy duty hand washing stations.

***Food: The food was alright, it wasn't the best flavored I've had but it definitely was up there as far as spice levels. You have an option to choose from 1-5, 1 being the lease and 5 being deadly. Let's just say I got a 4 and my nose was running while I was eating. I ordered the Snow Crab, Crawfish and Shrimp. The flavor was a little on the weak side. For picking the Trifecta flavor I felt it was lacking the garlic flavor and the sauce was very minimal to where the seafood couldn't take in the flavor as much. I was a little disappointed in the sauce. Also the Oysters I ordered weren't as rich in flavor, not sure if it was a bad batch. The crawfish, I could tell were previously frozen as they were dark and the shells were tender. Other places I know charge cheaper for frozen vs fresh crawfish. But the shrimp and snow crab I feel was a good size, quality over the rest. If I was to come back I'd probably just order the shrimp or snow crab. 

*Service: The server was a little interesting. It took a little longer than expected to receive my beer and also I wasn't sure if he was try to crack jokes to be funny? The reason I said that was because he offered bibs to everyone at the table. However when he offered one to my brother, he said he didn't have enough to cover him since he was a bigger guy. I found that definitely offensive, especially to crack fat jokes when we haven't established any type of friendship connections. I feel one would need to be at a certain friendship level before cracking fat jokes. My brother was ok with it, however I was. I felt it was rude and unacceptable.

My favorite plates were the breads, the brussel sprouts, the chicken slider, and the short ribs. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese and the beef tartar. These dishes were okay. The beef did not have a lot of flavor and I guess I'm just not a fancy mac and cheese kinda guy. The cocktails were delicious. They're also deceptively strong. The gelato dessert was so good. If you are just looking to get small plates, we had 5+bread between 2 people and were totally stuffed afterwards.

I'd already been bad all weekend (I'm not going to name names, but someone ate an entire 1/2 medium pizza in one sitting, & it was me) so I decided to use some self control & limit myself to 1 cupcake. 

After much thought, I chose the PINK CADILLAC. Heaven all mighty, it was everything a cup cake should be & so much more! By far, best cupcake I've ever had :) Yes, they are on the sweet side, but they're supposed to be! They're cupcakes, not a fruit salad.

(Disclaimer: I know it's not exactly the same since at Nando's you go up to a counter to order and it is more of a fast food joint).

I ordered the quarter chicken leg (lemon and herb seasoning) with peri fries as the side. My food was delivered to my table pretty quickly. The food looked okay but more on the fast food side of things (presentation lacking a bit) versus what you'd get from a proper sit-down restaurant. First bite - chicken seemed a little dry and the flavour was there but not super exciting. I definitely recommend adding some more peri sauce to help the chicken along. The sauce was in bottles up front and you can grab it and bring it back to your table. The fries seemed very basic. They didn't seem that much better than frozen fries you would bake at home. The spice was sprinkled on top but wasn't really embedded in the fry.

 My son and I stopped by for a quick visit to grab some drinks on our way out of town. I knew I wanted to try the sea salt cream since I've never had that before and it seemed intriguing. The lattes are the drinks to order if you want to try this foamy layer of sea salt atop your beverage.  Choices for the lattes include jasmine, oolong, mango, and strawberry. I chose the regular size (16 ounce) mango latte and added boba, something I haven't indulged in for too long. Dennis was the friendly and helpful staff member who took care of us. He gave my son a sample of the lychee jelly to taste and that convinced the kid to order the Sunset on the Beach slushee with the lychee. He wasn't even going to get a drink at first. His drink was a tropical-tasting concoction, a little too sweet for me, but he liked it and I would concur that the lychee is great. I liked my latte very much, as well, but I should have mixed the drink because by the time I got to the bottom of the drink, the sea salt foam was too salty. Dennis had told me that I could mix the drink or leave it as is, my choice, but since I didn't know better I chose not to mix.  Now I know and I'd definitely have it again. 
As mentioned by others, there is a stamp card:  buy 10 drinks and get a free regular size drink.  Dennis made sure that we tasted our drinks before we walked out, verifying that we liked them and offering to re-do if not: satisfaction guaranteed!

My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  

I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.

The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal.

My husband had the spicy tuna which was his favorite out of everything. Most places chop the tuna into mush but this place left nice big chunks to mix with creamy spicy sauce which he applauded and devoured. The other rolls he ordered were a bit too rich  with all the mayo and fried items mixed in together. The volcano (todd roll) roll was a big disappointment with more orange slices than roll for $15. There was not even rice in it which is boggling to call it a roll if theres no rice.

She said that she did sns all the time at her old salon she worked at, and you can tell she definitely has experience!! My nails look fantastic.

The reason for the 3 stars is because this place just doesn't stand out. I never understand why you don't get a hand/arm massage when you pay extra for things like gel and sns? I'm spending my hard earned money, it would be nice to slap a little lotion on me and rub for a minute or 2. I saw some of the nail techs giving  a massage so not sure who gets one and who doesn't.

What a lovely dinner!  The food was FANTASTIC.  Service was almost flawless; waitstaff forgot to bring our grilled artichoke appetizer before our main dishes.....BUT they comped the appetizer to make up for that oversight and gave me 3 free desserts because it was my birthday!  

Our dinner began with the bread basket and honey/cinnamon/garlic butter.  Warm, soft, crusty bread with sweet butter.  What's not to like?  The grilled artichoke was decadent and delicious.  For our mains, we both ordered fish: I had the the seared ahi tuna (YUM) and hubby had the black cod (again, YUM).  Portions were not huge; rather, they were ""normal"" sized and allowed us the stomach space to have a multi-course meal.  Desserts were perfect.  The chocolate cake was rich and velvety and indulgent, the key lime pie featured fabulous bright flavours that contrasted with the graham crust, and the pina colada cake was just plain good.  The waitstaff even sang ""Happy Birthday"" to me whilst bringing out my desserts.  How cute!

Let me spare you the disappointment and say don't eat here for lunch or dinner. Just about everything you can order here makes it taste like the poor man's red lobster, and is even more expensive. Get the bang for your buck and avoid ordering anything but the generous portion of nachos (only above average dish as far as taste and value), and the perfect margarita (only drink guaranteed to NOT be short-poured).

If you visit Westgate on a Saturday night, you may be tempted to visit again. They book some live bands who do some pretty good covers. Speaking of covers, there isn't one to get in!

Don't worry, you'll pay handsomely for that at the bar. Six dollars for a 20 oz. Coors Light? Jolly rancher shots that are 50% cranberry juice? All from bartenders who spend more time tossing around bottles of bottom-shelf swill than actually learning how to make a drink. If you're already a bit buzzed, and want some good live music with a nice crowd, this will be an ok way to end your Saturday night. Unless you talk to security...they're jerks.

For appetizer, we tried the 'Jumbo Lump' Crab Cakes ($11). They were absolutely delicious but it was a very small appetizer. Two tiny patties. Luckily it was just two of us sharing.

For entrees, I went with the Jerk Chicken Thighs ($18) which came with 3 thighs over well seasoned red beans & rice. It also came with a side of tomatoes, avacado & jalapeño which went great with red beans and rice. The entree also had a few pieces of perfect pita bread. 

Bobby ordered the Skirt Steak ($27)  mainly because he wanted ox tail. The steak was seasoned so well, full of flavor and it was delicious!. I tried ox tail for the first time and I loved it as well.

We had 2 appetizers, one good one merely average.  The Chicken Satay was particularly good with tender and juicy chicken that had a very nice yellow curry aroma and flavor.  The other appetizer was Little Mermaid which is shrimp and bacon wrapped in spring roll skin.  It was not nearly as flavorful as I expected.

The main dishes we shared were Pad Thai and Panang Curry.  The Pad Thai was particularly nice with fresh and distinctive flavors.  We ordered the Panang Curry with chicken and beef and we ordered it mild so that the kids would try it.  It had a bite, but not nearly enough to bring out a sweaty brow-so pretty mild.  It was very heavy on coconut milk flavor and the curry was nice but it could have used a bit more complexity.  There were an abundance of string beans which were hardly cooked at all-too crisp.  I think they were just tossed in at the last second.  There were just a few sections of red pepper and a couple of lime leaves.

The service here was very good.  We had 4-5 people checking on us regularly and my water only went empty once.  I drink copious amounts of water, so that is pretty good.

The fries were standard steak fries, nothing exciting. The carrot cake consisted of thin layered carrot cake in between cream cheese frosting.

My hair was growing out after a particularly bad cut (OK, so I shaved my head), and I really needed a new, cute style to make me feel pretty again. I read about Jeremy in the Daily Kent Stater and went to him blind,  without any recommendations except the Stater review. I told him my story & begged him to fix me --- and fix me he did.

I gave Jeremy total free reign over my hair and he gave me one of the cutest styles I've ever had. It was a little extreme, don't get me wrong -- reddish and dark black, a little spiky in the back with blunt bangs in front -- but it was exactly what I needed to get my self-esteem back in place following my brutal shaving experience and the Spock-like look it'd grown into.

I have since moved all over the damn place & still always wait until I'm back home to get my hair done because I've yet to find anyone else who matches up. Jeremy can do everything, seriously. He can give you a spiky rainbow-colored punk look or he can give you a gorgeous updo. He does the hair of conservative little old ladies and girls who you'd never take home to mom. He's just plain talented, no matter what you're looking for.

Sushi bar:
Pros: upscale, trendy surroundings, bartender was pleasant and helpful. Lots of choice on sushi rolls; unfortunately, most of these were not raw, but cooked, deep fried, baked, etc. 
Cons: like a reviewer below me, the tuna roll was LITTERED with sinewy strings, making for a very unpleasant texture. The sushi was served room temperature and the quality was not at all what I expect. Basic rolls run $6-8 off happy hour, pay $10+ for specialty rolls. 

Teppanyaki-style grill:
First off, please save yourself a dime and the space in your refrigerator: SHARE YOUR DINNER ENTREES. I took my grandmother for lunch and for the two of us, we spent $60. Entrees are pricey, but can be shared for a small fee. Appetizers are really unnecessary unless you have a large group or are VERY hungry as the dinner entrees come with plenty of meat and veggies. My chef seemed experienced, albeit young, and provided lots of flair and entertainment. Obvious cons are that the food is very pricey and you may have to wait awhile until the seating around your grill has been filled. 

To sum....

Sushi: skip it, unless you are desperate and really have nowhere else to go.

Teppanyaki: go for a special date, anniversary, etc. Don't bring young children as the dramatic flame surging from the grill and the clanging of knives makes them scream and cry for a half hour on end ;)",2011-07-01 21:50:11

But the minute the food arrived, I felt right at home, stuffing my face with pleasure-inducing food! Mid-meal, this group of cougar conference goers came in and commented on the scent.

So now they have an open and large space.  What really shines here is the food.  I split a pork shoulder dinner with my oldest daughter now 11.  With chips and guacamole.  You order at a counter and they bring it out to your table when its ready.

The chips are homemade plantain chips.  They are large slices of plaintain that are smashed and fried.  The guacamole has passion fruit mixed into it.  It's not overdone and just right.

You get a huge portion of pork shoulder with beans and rice.  I picked out a bay leaf while I was eating.  I'm ok with that.  There are layers of flavors in the meat.  The sides are some of the most flavorful sides I've ever had.  I'd eat here all the time if it were closer to home.  So so good.

On a previous visit I had a Monfongo.  Basically it's pork shoulder with rice packed on top.  It makes a huge ball and its also very delicious.  I noticed the desserts in the cooler where the latin inspired drinks were.  I like the coconut soda.  Its different.  But the flan in the cooler caught my eye.  I asked where they got the flan from.  Guy pointed to the nice lady cracking eggs into a kitchen aid mixer and said she is actually making more right now.

I had had Jaburritos at the time and loved that, then subsequently came to To See Roll, and then finally, I tried out Sweet Poke. Since I literally had so many choices, they were pretty much all the same to me. 

Fast forward to this day, I haven't had Jaburritos in a VERY long time because it's close to work and we ate it so much that I'm absolutely sick of it. 

After trying out Sweet Poke more, I realized To See Roll's portions fall short and now I always go to Sweet Poke. Also very convenient that it's on the way home and I visit that plaza a lot more often now. 

I started off getting their set items but nowadays I always create my own. They're generous with portions and I absolutely always have enough to eat.

This is definitely the dreamiest and the prettiest ice-cream I have ever eaten. After seeing countless pretty ice-cream photos on Instagram, I've decided to play a visit to this dessert house and give it a try. The store itself was very bright and clean. I was lucky that there was no line up. Since I really wanted to try everything on the menu, I asked the store owner for advice. They told me their bestseller items and I decided to go with his suggestions. 

-- Food and Drink --

I ordered two ice-creams:

1. Cotton Candy Affogato on mixed soft serve ice cream (Japanese Green Tea + Vanilla) 
2. Japanese Green Tea Mochi with Japanese Green Tea Soft Serve Ice-cream

For the cotton candy ice-cream, I liked how the espresso taste wasn't too strong and it balanced the sweetness of the ice-cream. Since the cotton candy was very, very huge, it took me quite a while to finish everything first before start to work on my ice-cream. I was quite surprised the ice-cream wasn't completely melted. The caramel popcorn in the bottom was a nice-touch. It added an extra layer of texture. Since there were too many things going on with the ice-cream cup, I could not really taste the difference between the green tea and the vanilla ice-cream. However, the Tiffany Blue colour vanilla ice-cream was definitely Instagram worthy. 

I actually liked the green-tea mochi ice-cream. The mochi was very soft and chewy and I could actually taste the green tea flavor in it. The koala and waffle cookies on top and the pine nuts in the bottom of the cup were very crunchy and it mixed well with the ice-cream.  

-- Overall --

I would definitely come back to Dolce 21. Pretty and tasty ice-cream, amazing service, plus a very cute and obedient puppy. I am normally afraid of dogs, but this is the only one that I am not afraid of in person. :)",2016-04-13 01:44:29

I must point out however, I am not a NY Pizza expert by any stretch of the imaginiation.  I would have given Rocco's 3 stars, but it earned an extra star for reasons explained below.

The prices are a touch on the pricey side, I think it was about $3 to $3.50 per slice and a slice is a little over 1/8th of a 18 inch pie.  The crust is thin, a little chewy and very pliable.  In genuine east coast fashion, they reheat the slices of pizza you order so they come to you nice and hot.  I had the pepperoni and sausage and sausage and mozzarella pizza.  The all meat pizza was a bit greasy and nothing special, but the sausage and mozzarella wasless greasy and very tasty.  I also ordered a small order of freshly made caprese salad.  Which brings me to the reasons why I gave an extra star to this restaurant.  Friendliness of service and selection of goods.

The owner (?) was super friendly and let me buy a smaller single serving size of the salad which was greatly apreciated.  There are also rice balls, homemade cannoli and zeppole on their menu.

1.BEST MOJITOS IN TOWN.... its hard to find a bar in these parts familiar with the Mo, let alone that it should be served with fresh mint, muddled with simple syrup and the right kind of Rum. Kaya does not fail here. 

2. Jerk chicken wings, pulled pork Quesadilla, and calamari are lovely, I am not overly familiar with this cuisine. But I feel like they hit the right mix of flavors here a little spice, a little peanut, sometimes coconut mixed in. Nothing overly done. I've also tried the Jerk tofu tacos, nice and still flavorful for the vegan or vegetarian. 

3. Best Customer Service, so I ate there with a friend tonight, who can be picky. She first asked for the jerk tofu done as jerk chicken tacos, A dish not on their menu but they accommodated. The chicken in the tacos was blackened, as Jerk meat often is she did not care for it. She asked for the wings, they came back and she again felt they were burnt although she began eating them anyway, when the waitress asked how were they? I promptly ordered another drink thinking I was settling in for a long night. My friend replied she felt they were burn but i could see the meat was tender, and why would she eat one if they were burnt? 

Again the kitchen and wait staff accommodated and brought her a dish of her choice, she went with creme brulee. Then out of the blue the manager who had already once rushed to her unsatisfied side, said they would be picking up our tab. This was not necessary as we told them we were happy with the rest of the food we ordered and we would be back. We put our cash together for a tip for the waitress and thanked them again. 

I feel guilty for my free meal i completely enjoyed and would have paid for, Kaya I will be back and not just for your fabulous Mojitos and excellent customer service.",2012-12-10 02:52:53

The beer is top notch.  Kiltlifter is my #1 favorite beer of all time.  I've tried them all and they are all very competitive but Kiltlifter takes the cake.

Onto the foodies.  Without a doubt, any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful.  Mushroom and Swiss is my backup but I've recently fallen in love with the Jalapeno burger.  It's cream cheese, roasted jalapenos (not spicy) and onion straws.  For $9 you can't beat it.  I really haven't strayed away from my favorites (I tend to stick with what I love) but anything anyone has ordered on the menu, there has never been a complaint.

The  two main singers had spectacular voices and did a great job with the songs that they were assigned. The dancers were also quite good.

Unfortunately, it did not for me. I'm not sure if I'm being overly harsh or if I'm looking for the food to taste the same as RB but I just didn't ""love"" their food. Everyone in our table had an issue with the seasoning of their food. The food was overtly salty. It seems that this restaurant caters to Non Korean palate. 

We ordered the Jjampong, Dolsot Bibimbap, Donkatsu and the Seolleongtang (Ox Bone Soup). In other traditional Korean restaurants, the seasoning for the Seolleongtang is done at the table to suit personal tastes, so they bring you salt, black ground pepper, red pepper, minced garlic and chopped spring onions. It wasn't the case here. The soup was seasoned already and it was salty. 

In terms of portions and service, the restaurant deserves the high praise. They were very generous with the food portions and service was very attentive. The place has been cleaned up and the layout has been changed slightly from before for the better. Also their menu is more extensive than RB. We found the price of the dishes to be reasonable.

On the other hand, all three ladies at the table ordered the frittata, which came with sweet potato fries and bread. They seemed to like it, but none of them raved about it. I did enjoy the lavender lemonade that I ordered, as it was very refreshing.

Well, I didn't expect much, and I was blown away.  The chicken was white meat only and it was super, super, super moist.  So good.  The tzatziki was so rich, and so creamy it made the pita that much better. 

We also ordered the eggplant dip as a starter and it was very creamy, very rich in flavour and I wished I could order it to go in a tub.  Only downside was that for a small portion is was kinda pricy at $8 or so.  

Desserts were a pass for me-ordered the lemon curd dessert and it just wasn't that good.  It had random lumps in it and I didn't finish it.  We also tested the chocolate baklava and the chocolate cake.  Baklava was uber nutty, and uber sweet-so if that's your thing, do try it.  Chocolate cake was good but just like any other chocolate cake.

If hot dogs are good enough for Betty, they're good enough for me.  She's the classiest!  Review is for the Sonoran dog, the only thing I ate.

I'm a sucker for a good Sonoran.  What's not to love?  At La Pasadita's, they do things a little different.  The Sonoran features house-made bread, bacon [of course bacon!], beans, grilled onions, jalapeños, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, mustard, and guacamole.  I can't say I've ever had a Sonoran with ketchup and I don't think their dog really needs it but it was still all very tasty.  It's a bit on the small side and I think I should have ordered two to be happy.

Not the best Sonoran in the valley but definitely delicious!  I would like to try their other dogs like the Chihuahua or the Sinaloa.  All the more reason to be back.  I wish I saw the pictures beforehand too.  Seems like there's a dog topped with Ruffles and cheese.

The quality is a huge factor- non-GMO and organic when possible, a large variety of textures and herbs, everything from sauces to spreads made in-house daily, and everything so fresh they don't even have a freezer. Not only is everything delicious, but add in their stellar service, Stubborn sodas, house teas, and movie wall decor? I can't NOT love this place. 

I started with a bowl- the classic hummus and baba are both good picks for your base, combine your greens however you wish, pick or combine lentils and herbed rice for your carbs, and you're already looking at a hefty portion before you get to the protein and toppings! Their falafel is vegan perfection, but they also have seasonal veggies as another option. Carnivores have a huge variety and the lamb will be my next pick. Then go hog-wild with colorful and textually diverse toppings from herbed feta to cherry tomatoes, marinated onions, fresh mint, pomegranate seeds, and roasted chickpeas. If that's not enough flavor for you, add sauce- the harissa has a nice savory heat and the tzatziki is nicely cooling  but the classic garlic is my fave.

Pros:
Very good bowl of ramen
Excellent customer service

Cons:
Portions are smaller

I love myself a good bowl of ramen.  Aside from the usual suspects located downtown, there aren't too many good places for ramen uptown.  When I heard of a Chinese run ramen place, I wasn't exactly jumping for joy.  Koi Sakana proved me wrong completely.

Koi Sakana is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's hidden within a small plaza so if you're not looking for it, you'll miss it.  Once you walk in, you notice this place is nothing fancy.  Simplistic, yet gets the job done.  The place only has a couple of ramen bowls to pick from, but there's enough variety to satisfy any ramen lover.

My GF and I both order the House Tonkatsu ramen.  It's nice to know that the ramen automatically comes with toppings like a whole egg, corn, fish cake, black fungus and seaweed included in the price. The broth was better than I expected.  Not as rich as places like Santosei, but very good nonetheless.  The noodles were very good.  I don't like non Japanese ramen places like Kenzo and Sonoya as much because I feel the noodles don't match up to their Japanese counterparts.  The noodles here were very good.  Just enough bite to them.  My only gripe is the portions are smaller than other places.  If you're a big eater you'll need to add extra noodles and cha siu for sure.  Even after adding them, it still feels smaller than a regular bowl of ramen anywhere else.  

The waitress there was super nice and friendly.  She saw we had out little one, and got out separate bowls and utensils for her.  Our cups of water were refilled without asking and napkins given to us whenever we ran out all as well.  She would come over and make sure all was well a couple of times as well.  Out little one is usually shy around strangers but even she was able to laugh with the waitress too.

All in all, this is a wonderful place to get ramen that's not located downtown.  It won't replace Santosei as my fav, but it's definitely my fav uptown as of right now.  If you're in the area and craving ramen, definitely give this place a try!",2015-06-24 11:45:41

The service is always stellar, but it's the Ritz, so it ought to be.  The food is all quite good.  It's not the most romantic or fanciest dining room... There are more fun & eclectic places to take a date but is a great place to take a client or colleague for a bite.  i think of the Bistro as more of a lunch place than a dinner spot, but it certainly goes either way. 

If you are looking to try the Bistro but are on a bit of a budget, i would try one of these two little tips:
1.  Check out Friday Night Grill... its about 35 per person and all you can eat.  They have steak freshly cooked on the grill outside and a variety of sushi and salads inside.  The desert table is decadent.  For less than you'd spend on a steak next door at Morton's, you'll get a ton of high quality delicious food.
2.  Happy Hour is at 5pm.  Their appetizers and many drinks (including draft beer) are half off.  Get a Firestone Pale Ale or Double Brown Ale for just $3.  One of my favorite appetizers is the Ratatouille Pizza. (Only $7 during happy hour!). It's delicious and eats like a meal.

Last night was my first time trying Wingstop and I must admit that their chicken is in fact better than Buffalo Wild Wings and Hooters! Yes, do not try and argue with me on this one. I also think that Wingstop is a bit cheaper too! They have great value deals!

Visited this new location with my family on a Friday night around 9 o'clock and it was a bit busy. We wanted our wings, we were willing to wait, no problem. As soon as the cashiers were done taking the other guests orders, one of the employees called my mom and I up to the register to take our order. Since it was my first time, I still needed a second to look at the menu and decide what I want. The cashier, Beth, seemed annoyed by this. We ordered the 24 piece family meal, half bone-in and half boneless. My mom had a few questions about the different flavor sauces offered and she seemed even more annoyed that she was asking questions. There was barely any eye contact made and it was as if she just couldn't wait until we were done placing our order. Anyways, we placed our order and sat down at a table that we were lucky enough to grab. 

We originally placed our order for dine-in, but ended up getting it to-go instead. After waiting for about 15 minutes or so, our meal was given to us in a brown paper bag and you could tell by how hot it was that the food was made fresh. The chicken was great, both bone-in and boneless. It was fried to the point where the crisp remained after being doused in all the sauce. Nobody likes soggy wings, am I right? My favorite was of course the Lemon Pepper. Garlic Parmesan was delicious as well, there was just the right amount of garlic. Hickory Smoked BBQ was nice and sweet! I'm not sure if I'm a complete fan of the fries... They tasted a little sweet. Wingstop's ranch dip is so good! Why can't I ever find that kind of ranch in stores?

Anyways, I probably would've given this location a higher rating had it not been for the employee who took our order because the food was delicious!

Honey Pig is slightly different than the other KBBQ places in town. Unlike the other spots, the Pig has huge cast iron dome. They grill most of the side dishes and still leave space for the meats if you order AYCE.

The AYCE has alot of catches. The menu doesn't indicate it, but you can only have one order of the rib-eye, which sucks cause that is usually my favorite dish. I found it odd because pretty much every other AYCE KBBQ joints has unlimited portions of Kalbi. The AYCE is limited to pretty much from 5pm - 10pm. So look to Sura, Woo-che, or Tofu for a light night fix. I found the Bulgogi to be incredibly sweet, seemed like it was over marinated. The spicy pork and beef tongue were on point.

BF is a huge prime rib fan, and when I stumbled across this place i thought I'd struck gold and found a Monday night that fit our schedules to bring him in for a surprise date night. And my carefully-laid plans bombed.

Placed his order for the prime rib special with mashed potatoes, bummed to hear it does not come with a vegetable despite many mentions in other reviews and pictures here of a veggie side. Waitress told us a side would set us back $2- for bar veggies? No thanks. My order was for the 10oz NY, which did come with a veggie, mashed potatoes as a side as well. Both of us added on a side salad for $1 extra, with bleu cheese dressing.

Now, if the first element of your meal is a side salad, and you are unable to finish it, that's probably a bad sign. The salad itself was fine and decently fresh but the dressing had seen better days- it neither smelled nor tasted like and bleu cheese dressing I've ever had in my life, and we couldn't put our finger on whether it was supposed to be a yogurt-based ranch dressing, or if it was spoiled.
Waitress cleared our still-full salad bowls in confusion, and when we mentioned that the dressing was off/funky, all she had to say was, ""Well it came straight from the bottle."" Um, then maybe check the expiration date on that bottle.

Then our entrees were brought out. BF's rare prime rib was medium rare only in the middle, and easily 1/3rd of it was fat while another 1/3rd of it appeared to be brown in color and possibly spoiled.  It tasted like more of a roast than any prime rib I've ever had.
My steak also had a good 1/3rd of the meat consisting of fat, and not even just around the edges of the steak itself but globs of fat within the middle of the steak- very, very low quality meat. I know my expectations for bar food are low, but come on ...

For a $30 meal, we literally ate about 1/5 of his prime rib (we were put off by the rest of it), and maybe 2/3rd of my steak, plus the broccoli and potatoes. Not really the value it's advertised as.
On top of that, we barely made it to the car before our stomachs started hurting.

To end on a positive note, our waitress was super friendly and sweet, though I'm a little perturbed that she didn't offer a solution or even begin to address the quality issues with our meal. That being said, she's a server and not a manager or in charge of who is selected as a supplier, so she's not really the one to discuss those matters with any way. Considering we had maybe five bites of our salads, I expected them to be removed from our bill- even if it was only a measley $2.

I've come here twice and they no longer have a punch card for buy 9 and get one free.  Drat.  But, that's okay.  They have an overwhelming selection of flavors of teas, snows, and other drinks.  

My first time I had a honeydew snow and it was so good.  I ordered the supersized one, but that's really more like a small at some places or the size of a regular drink at McDonald's.  That's under $4.

You can add boba, or other jelly concoctions to your drink at an additional charge, which I don't know what that is, but it's under $0.50, so less than it would be at a yogurt shop.

My son got a lychee milk tea and it was a cold drink with the boba being hot.  Which, for him recovering from Thrush, was the perfect combination.  My daughter is addicted to horchata and was able to get a Horchata drink with a Coffee Jelly and she loved that.  This time I got a Coconut Papaya Snow Boba and it was fabulous.

My mechanic got a Papaya Milk Tea Boba and his helper got a Coconut Yogurt Boba.  They liked those, too.  

Anyway, it's a bit far from where I live, but only a mile from my kids' school, so maybe as an afternoon treat sometimes, we can come here and try more flavors.  They have good service and are quick.",2014-12-18 22:16:23

This is the real deal, high class all the way around. The sushi is fresh and tasty and most importantly plentiful. There is a wide array of different types of sushi from nigiri, handrolls, and regular rolls. Some of the specialty rolls are actually named after cars which is unique and a nice spin on things. They have red tuna sashimi when I went, which lots of AYCE sushi places don't have it and was happy when they did. I ordered tons of that.

I would highly recommend Kintaro to anyone who loves sushi. I also heard the hot pot isn't bad either maybe next time I'll try that but after having the sushi it'll be difficult to divert from that.

There is really nothing that makes them better or worse than all the other gyms.  Relatively the same equipment, fees, classes, contracts, etc. as you would find anywhere else.  Sure the place may look different and the sales guy will point out the stupid leather on the machines or make it sound like their $20/month deal is going away because they are losing money or something stupid like that; but its all the same stuff.

$1 to join (I'm not sure what that is but it is literally idiotic) plus some other $39 fee that they charge you every year for god knows what.  I gave them the wrong phone number when I signed up so they wouldn't constantly call me to press their personal training or sell me other junk.  My wife wasn't so smart and it has been a comedy of errors for her to set up her ""free"" session.

Anyway, the 20 bucks I pay every month is well worth it.  The place is never busy, the hours are good, the classes fit my needs, and the equipment is excellent.

The last time I let a professional cut my hair, she cut 6 inches off, saying that my split ends justified that length. I don't know about you, but I've never seen a split end even close to as long as the length of my pinky nail, let alone 6 inches. I was ticked. I've let my sister trim my hair, but again, she had cut off 4 inches & I was not happy. I wanted a micro trim & I wasn't about to let another lazy stylist chop all of my hair off. 

I've had expensive cuts & free cuts, & I can honestly say, I had one of the best hair experiences yesterday (3/2/12) at Aspen. I started by calling to make an appointment, as directed by Groupon, prior to purchase. I believe Paul answered the phone & told me that they'd honor the Groupon Now special, without me purchasing a Groupon. I scheduled my appointment for a few hours later, at 1:30 PM.

At my appointment, I wasn't sure who was supposed to be working on me. The receptionist told me the girl that would work on me was finishing somebody else up & would be with me shortly. Eventually a different girl, a blonde girl (24, forgot her name) led me to the sinks for a deep condition. She was totally friendly & we had a nice chat. Afterward, she set me under a hair dryer for half an hour. My hair was very wet & it probably could have used a good squeeze because it was pretty drippy in the hair dryer. Regardless, this was not in any way a deal breaker.  

Afterward, Chirin told me she'd be working on my haircut. She was awesome & totally understood how I felt about not getting my hair chopped to bits. I asked for a micro trim & a few long layers. My hair tangles like nobody's business. Chirin started to brush my hair wet & it tangled! She switched brushes & told me that she wanted to cut my hair dry to be more precise because my hair was tangling . She blow dried & flat ironed it & gave me exactly what I wanted. Although she's almost 22, she'd been doing hair for 3 years & did a great job. I walked out with super shiny, soft SPLIT END free LONG hair! 

The Groupon deal was $20 for a conditioning treatment, cut & style. I couldn't have been more happy. I used my debit card & paid $25 (including tip.) I saw that they had a sign for $40 facials for first time clients. Because I had to be at work in an hour, I asked if I could schedule for tomorrow (3/3/12)  I was told to leave my number & somebody would call me to schedule. About 45 minutes later, Cati called & scheduled me for 2:30 on 3/3/12 (I didn't know Cati was the skin care specialist.) 

I showed up today (3/3/12) for my appointment. I said I didn't know who I was scheduled with. Chirin was at the front desk & a man said I was probably with Julie but he had to check. I was actually with Cati, which was fine by me. A guy in the waiting room was RAVING about the service here & about Cati's facials. He told me he & his wife travel from Milwaukee to their 2nd home here in Vegas, just to get worked on at Aspen & that Cati was amazing. 

I've never had a facial or any spa treatment, for that matter, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was awesome. First I was led to a little room to change into a wrap, & then had my hands dipped into lavender paraffin wax, bundled up & put under comfy blankets. The room was dark & there was nice music on as Cati examined my skin & told me I had extremely dry skin. 

My problem area is my chin & neck. Cati told me I was having allergic reactions to my makeup & that I needed to get something organic, preferably mineral makeup ASAP, along with some OTC eczema cream for a spot that had reacted to my foundation. She told me I needed to stop using Clinique, Covergirl & RImmel because it was causing my current reactions. She also told me that the pharmaceuticals I've taken could easily be the culprit for some of my skin issues that she told me absolutely could not have been brought on by the use of topical product. She told me I needed more vitamin B in my diet, less scrubbing & to make sure my face was free of processed makeup. Along with a zillion other helpful tips, she did some extractions on my face. I'll be honest, I wish she had done a bit more extractions on my nose, but that's neither here nor there.

After 90 minutes of having my face steamed, extracted, cleaned with glycolic acid, then massaged (from my scalp to my arms!) & another mask, my treatment was over. I felt great! I was nervous when Cati said she was an independent contractor & that she took cash or check only because I had only brought my debit card. She ended up letting me use my debit card, with a $3 processing fee which brought my total to $53 for the facial (including $10 tip & fee.) I wish somebody would have mentioned her cash only policy when I scheduled as the policy wasn't the same for my hair cut the day before. I would have brought my checkbook. Regardless, I'm pretty sure that I'll be back for another facial & trim in a month.",2012-03-04 07:11:49

The lobby and hallways were beautifully decorated. The entire hotel was neat and clean. The smell of smoke from the casino was barely noticeable. 
The room was the icing on the cake. The perfect size for 2 people. A comfortable king size bed and fluffy pillows. The bathroom was so awesome with the garden tub and connecting shower. A very nice place to relax. I can't get over the fact that there was NO outside noises that could be heard while in the room.

My family has been taking their cats here since I was a preteen- back when Krista (I think that's her name) was running the place. So, when I moved back to Arizona this is the first vet I decided to take my cat to see.

My cat has IBS and has for years and lately her symptoms have worsened and have been causing her severe pain. The new vet at Larkspur cat clinic saw my cat and he recommended two medications to ease her pain and inflammation.

Now, when he gave me these medications he didn't mention any cautions or side effects. Didn't say to watch out for anything in particular- he just told me that they would help relax and ease the pain. So, I went home and I gave these medications to my cat. Within a couple hours she looked drugged up and out of it. She was acting quite strange and after 2 days she was very constipated and straining to the point that she was crying in pain. 

I decided to look up the medications prescribed and every single website I went to (and I went to a bunch) said that both medications are used in dogs- one of the dog medications was commonly administered to dogs in 17-23mg dosages- which my cat's dosage was 43mg (seems a bit high for a 6 pound feline), and the other medication had repeated warnings that it was controversial for cats and I read several times that is should NEVER be used on cats because it can cause constipation and blockages that can lead to disease and death, or something to that effect.

At this point I called the clinic and I explained my cats odd behavior and the constipation and straining. I also mentioned the medication and told them that I understand if there was a reason that the cat was given this type of medication, but was concerned because I read that there were side effects associated with this drug in cats and my cat was straining a lot and seemed out of it. 

The woman told me the doctor was busy and couldn't take my call. So, I asked if he could please call me back before 4PM that day because I was very concerned about my cat (it was 9 AM when I called), . The woman literally... LITERALLY, snickered out loud, condescendingly, and snorted that the doctor was very busy and she'll 'see'... ~click~

Anyhow, the vet NEVER called. Surprise!

I have found a new vet- that so far has been very good to my cat. They follow up and check in and make sure my cat's symptoms aren't getting worse. I showed the new vet and the nurses the medication that I was given to administer to my cat. They were all shocked. First, one of the medications are these huge capsules- they are people sized. The first comment I heard was, ""I've never seen medication in that format... for a cat"". The other medication I was given were broken pills. Again- everyone was shocked by the format of the medication alone.

The new vet said she was unfamiliar with using the 2 medications on cats. I could tell she didn't want to say anything negative, so instead she told me to give  her a couple days to research the drugs and she'd let me know whether or not it was safe to give to my cat.

A day and a half later I get a call from her. She says one of the meds is probably ok, but if the cat hasn't gotten better from it- don't give it to her. The other one- she said she didn't feel comfortable with me giving it to the cat and asked me not to. 

I will NEVER go back to Larkspur Cat Clinic. From giving me dangerous drugs (it seems like they buy what's on sale and give it out generically even if it's canine medication) that could kill my cat, no warning to the many possible side effects and complications to the dangerous dog medicine prescribed for my cat, then the horrific service- (Who condescendingly laughs at you when you are calling to say that your cat is having a bad reaction to the medication your doctor recently prescribed?) and then the fact that they NEVER called back- not to return my call, not to follow up, not to give further direction. I can't believe I paid $100 for this! They charged me almost $40 for the bad meds as well. 

I'm actually filing a complaint with the state board, and I told my family about what happened and we are all switching vets. I don't know what happened to this place, but it's not what it used to be.",2012-06-30 19:37:53

We came to the Hotel to meet some friends on Friday June 19TH. My wife and I sat down at the Del Mar Lounge Bar. It took 5 minutes before we were acknowledged, despite the fact that there were several individuals working behind the bar. The eventual greeting was curt and there were no smiles!

I began to play the machine at the bar and it was sticky and dirty. The buttons on the machine were sticking. I told the bartender about it and he proceeded to dunk a rag into warm water, wring it out and he passed it over the bar for me to wipe down the area myself. Ridiculous. In the meantime, the other bartender watched me wipe down the bar as he stood there and talked to an individual, that appeared to be a regular. The bartender was telling him how excited he was to be attending the EDC event on Saturday! No effort was made to accommodate us and we had to ask every time our drinks ran dry for another.

We also noticed that the cocktail waitresses had to wait several minutes to even be acknowledged when they were waiting for the bartenders. And thus, their guests had to wait a long time for their drinks! 

When I asked ""Chris"" about the lounge, he was rude and non responsive.

Best sushi rolls, for the value, in Charlotte and not many places come close. I have been coming to Ru San's pretty regularly for about 4 years now and it feels like it's only gotten better. 

Ru San's vibe is no frills, fast and casual, loud, great sushi. Items from the grill (hibachi chicken, rice, etc...) are also notably good, but Ru San's really shines with their specialty rolls that can get pretty interesting. I've tried several and haven't had a bad one yet. The quality of the fish has never been in question. Just because Ru San's prices are stellar, doesn't mean you suffer on fish quality. Try the nigiri and see for yourself (salmon is amazing). 

Service is consistently on point, fun, and friendly. The employees share a collective mood of ""we're having a good time, are you?"". Ru San's Achilles heel could be its extensive menu selection. They don't do everything great, but it's a sushi restaurant that offers interesting, fun, and delicious specialty rolls as well as sashimi and nigiri. 

Ru Sans hasn't let me down yet and I recommend it to everyone. 4.5/5, rounded up for awesomeness.",2017-05-16 20:34:32

A lot of people keep repeating that the service here is bad. I guess I can see where they are coming from if you're a pretty high strung person who is used to being in and out of a restaurant and fed as soon as you sit down. The Coca Cafe is not this place and it's really obvious. It's a pretty small cafe and you're going to have to deal with a little bit of waiting. The owner, or at least what I thought was a manager of some sort did not seat a group of two while we were waiting because the rest of their party was not there. This is a simple rule and it allows people who are ready and on time to get a seat. In a place as small as Coca Cafe you can't afford to seat half of a party while they wait however long for the rest of their people. This might be considered ""rude"" to people but it's born of necessity. The ""customer is always right"" mantra is not universally accepted at every establishment you patronize.

Anyway, with that out of the way. We were seated in less than 10 minutes and ordered two omelets. I had the wild mushroom omelet (shiitake and portabello) with Jarlsberg cheese, a side of grilled potatoes, and pumpernickel toast. My girlfriend had the tomato, feta, and pesto omelet. I got an orange juice with my water which was definitely freshly squeezed and delicious.

After a little bit of a wait (see my earlier rant) we got our food which was amazing. The omelets were full and incredibly hardy. The mushrooms were fresh and springy with a tiny bit of crunch to them. The Jarlsberg cheese was so mild that I forgot it was in there at first; you can choose from two different cheeses so next time I think I'll try the other cheese to see if it is less subtle. The egg was cooked just right, a little crispy brownness on the edges and fluffy everywhere else. Nowhere in the omelet did I find raw yolk which I absolutely hate. The potatoes were cooked through and crispy on the outside, seasoned to perfection.",2011-02-16 20:15:05

Property is beautiful. The lobby and ground floor are decorated with the highest of elegance.
Guest services attendants are very well trained, professional and courteous.
Rooms are decent sized, clean and well appointed.
5 Stars: After staying at many other hotels while traveling on business in 2015, I've decided to upgrade the Trump Las Vegas to five stars based on the level of service received from the hotel attendants staff and concierge.

Considerations
Parking: only valet parking is offered. One of the reasons I stay off the strip when traveling on business is it's can take up to 25 minutes to get your car out of valet. Not often, but sometimes.
If you self park, you may have a bit of a walk but at least you can get your car when you need it.
Update: Today valet only took five minutes at 7:33 AM

Room view: request a strip view (which is facing south) Love the 58th floor view up Las Vegas Blvd. The view from the 50th floor is pretty good too.

Location: Car access to the hotel is not easy to figure out. I know the streets in Las Vegas pretty well.

Once you're inside none of these are issues

I visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.

I did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: ""These two things should never be on a menu together."" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.

Cocolini's has 2 locations within the Venetian casino/Venetian shops. One location is in the middle of San Marco square in the Venetian Grand Canal Shops (where i went) and the other is in the food court of the Venetian casino itself. 

After a nice dinner at Enoteca, we strolled toward Cocolini and was immediately enticed visually by the gorgeous mounds of different colored gelato so we had to get some. The straticella was great with delicious chocolate flakes in vanilla base. The bacio was pretty good, esp if you like hazelnut and chocolate. The mint choc chip was also tasty since I'm a Baskin Robbin's mint choc chip guy. 

One note: don't expect this gelato to be as good as in Italy. For U.S. standards it seemed very decent but definitely not as creamy and smooth as the gelato you get in Italian.

We got the usual standbys - fried tofu, pork-belly buns, steamed fish, mock duck - all were pretty good.  We tried the braised beef tendons and brisket with turnips - this was also pretty good.  The only bad thing we had were the Shanghai rice cakes with pork - bland and too much gravy.  For dessert, we tried the steamed buns with sweet black sesame filling - pretty good.

We Chinese are pretty close to the vest with compliments so I would say this place is ""pretty good!""",2015-08-21 03:45:27

Overall experience: you get what you pay for, presentation was poor, food was served late and cold (due to the high volume of people) steak was prepared to my liking (medium rare) and dessert was the highlight of the whole meal. The suggested wine pairings were good.

I had higher expectations for this place for an old Port location - won't come back. On top of that they canceled my open table reservation when I showed up!!

Our lunch was such a disappointment, that could easily been avoided. Did they change owners? Chefs? If they did. The poor quality showed in our meals. 
The hostess, was polite but little to no enthusiasm. 
Our waiter.. Poor service. He did not speak clear, was often in a rush(the restaurant had only  six tables with average of 2-3 people per table. This is at 12:30pm, while the restaurant has well over 20 tables. 
My steak salad was simply unacceptable! The steak was incredibly salty, over cooked, dried and tough! Did not taste fresh at all. I understand meat is not their specialty, but if you put it on your limited lunch menu. Learn how to properly cook it please! 
Due to my poorly lack of taste salad, I was offer to choose something else on the menu instead. Which I did. 
I choose a Caesar salad. Which I've been informed of being delicious. I guess not! 
It was a simple mix of lettuce, a few overly salty croutons with two Parmesan shavings. While all this was drenched in a store bought overpowering taste of garlic salad dressing. I chose to add mozzarella Fior di latte(Fresh mozzarella) $5.00 for just two slices?!  
May I add that my meal included a vegetable and barley soup. Thank you for the generous amounts of vegetables. Yet I again did not appreciate how salty it was! Salty should be used to bring out the flavour of something, not to make it taste simply like salt. Again something as simple as soup, was disappointing! 
My friend's salad which was suppose to have mixed greens, oranges etc. It had very little of everything and freshness was not there at all either. Did they use a mix of greens that come in a bag already premix?! In every salad, freshness and taste is key! It simply was not there.
Yes, the cost of my meal was taken care by the restaurant. Great! Thank you. Yet, where is the apology from the waiter? Who simply took the dish away. Disappointing yet again.
Yes, the tip we left was low, when the bill was only $12.00. The waiter never said thank you or goodbye upon my friend and I leaving the restaurant. What happen to manners?

Don't get me wrong i LOVE BBQ it probably one of my favorite foods but just not from Famous Daves.

This review actually covers the 2 regrettable times I came in.

I stopped by tocheck out FD with a couple of friends not too long ago. Walking in I thought the place looked horrendous, like a couple hill-billies had designed the place. But I know interior decor really is subjective so I don't really put too much thought on it but in my opinion this place is ugly.

We ordered what I thought would be safe bets, beef brisket, ribs, pulled pork. The usual fare at bbq restaurants. What we got when food arrived could be be described as an insult to the BBQ gods. The brisket was dry, almost complete devoid of flavor other than a smoky/charcoal taste to it. The ribs should have been fall of the bone tender but instead had to be ripped from the bone. the pulled pork was good once completely drenched in their BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce itself was another problem, I don't know what they use as their base (it doesn't taste like tomato) but its like water. I felt like I was squirting watered down store-brand BBQ sauce on my food. Not even the cornbread was good enough to garner another star here.

The service was completely lacking again. I hate having to waive down servers to get refills, condiments, or the check. They should be making routine stops to your table make sure everything is as it should be.

But I am not done yet...

I came in about 2 months later to pick up a large take out order from work. (thankfully i was not paying for it) The food order was ready when I got there and the server (or whatever you call the to-go order people) was nice enough to throw in some extra corn bread and condiments. I guess it was to make up for the disaster that I was soon to uncover.

 I brought the food back to work, popped open the boxes and there was a collective ""WTF"" like response when everyone saw what was inside. The meat was burned. I am not saying over cooked, but i was burned. About 40% of each piece of meat was just pure tar and black ash. It couldn't even been eaten. I don't understand why a cook would do this! Its just plain mean! Our manager called FD back and totally bitched them out. I think she got her money back or a discount but seriously... I could probably get better BBQ at Albertsons.

The important thing was the bread, That bread, all baked fresh by Ike's, is superb. The ""world-famous"" Dutch crunch is more chew than crunch, the first half of the Dutch Crunch was good but began to be too much,  Other bread options are French, sourdough, whole wheat and gluten-free.Will try the sourdough next time.

The menu is huge and the worker helped decide what to order and recommend.

The Tempe location is small with about 6 tables but the kitchen is massive, it took a little longer than expected to make the sandwiches.

I ordered the Cain Velasquez,which had bacon pastrami and swiss, the meat was generous and the sandwich was loaded. I could only eat half the sandwich.

The vibrant red, gold, and orange decor pops against the overflowing plants. We went during peak lunch hours on a Saturday and found a table right away. 

We shared two pork egg rolls and chicken satay as apps. The egg rolls are so unassuming! I didn't expect the soft vermicelli noodles to add so much to the bit. The chicken satay was tender, but we would have liked the cucumber salad to been a little sweeter. 

I ordered the pork wonton soup, which was so fresh! The wontons quickly fell apart though, but over wise the flavor and texture combo was superb. 

The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is firstly because the spice levels are too conservative in comparison to similar places in Madison. But it throws you off by saying the hottest spice level is ""Native Laotian."" MY mom was timid to order anything above the ""adventurous"" level, so she ordered ""careful"" with her pineapple curry. It was extremely mild, and the coconut overpowered any semblance of spice. We thought the curry was just kind of bland in general, but luckily the pineapple thrown in added a flavor element.

I had a 10:00 appointment on 9/11/2017. I was a new patient so I had to fill out a ream of paperwork. I arrived at 9:20 and filled out paperwork that was so redundant I was ready to scream!!!!  50 minutes!!!!  It took me 50 minutes to fill it all out!!!  Finally got to the room only to be asked the same questions by a med student that I had just spent the morning putting on the papers!!!  My reason for the appointment was start up care and to get prescriptions for my maintenance drugs. One of which my insurance no longer covers so I'd need a replacement. Very routine. Everything went well with the doctor he said he would call in the prescriptions. No problem. 

By 9/13 I still did not have my scripts and when I checked with the pharmacy the hadn't even been called in. I called the office only to be told that my doctor, Dr Weismiller was out of town. The person on the phone who didn't identify themselves said she would send the doctor a message.  

On 9/15 I still didn't have my scripts so I called the office again. I was told they would call in my blood pressure medicine because my doctor was still out of town. 

On 9/18 I still had no meds so I called the pharmacy and then the office again. I was told it would be taken care of.  I got a call from the pharmacy at around noon saying they needed more info. My sister who is the one that recommended this doctors office was furious and called them and gave them hell. Around 4 I finally get an automated message from the pharmacy that my prescription is ready. Great.  I go pick it up and it's only half of the meds I need. I didn't get any of my COPD meds. 

9/19 after calling the pharmacy to check if anything had been called in and being told no again I called my insurance to get the replacement they recommended for one of my COPD meds. I got 3 names of medicine. I called the doctors office again.  I thanked them profusely for at least getting me half of my meds but I was still missing my COPD meds. She said she'd message the doctor. I told her I called my insurance and got the names for one of the replacement meds. She didn't want to hear it. She said she'd message the doctor!!!!!!

Today is 9/20 and I still don't have my COPD meds. I don't know what more I can do other than to warn others to steer clear of this place. It's like a black hole!!!

Let's start with the pasty that one of the diners had. I can't comment truthfully on this because the pasties that I've had all my life living in Michigan are made differently but these were still good. So I'm just partial to the different way of making them.  Have to admit they were large and well-made with a generous amount of mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Forgot to mention we started with a cup of their incredibly delicious creamed cabbage and Stilton soup. Wow! 

The rest of us had their much touted fish and chips and that I can tell you I've had many,many times in many,  many places but these were exceptionally good.
One very large,  thick piece of perfectly done, fresh Icelandic cod lightly breaded-and one was enough. One diner and I substituted the fries for onion rings which we both loved.  The fish and chips come with a generous portion of peas... Very English indeed.
Service was outstanding from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. Our waitress Jessica was not only very friendly and outgoing but treated us like guests in her home.  We definitely will go back and we hope we get Jessica again.

I ordered a large Chicken on the Rocks to go and although the bag felt a little lighter than usual,  I didn't think much of it- until I returned home and went to eat it. I was so disappointed when I opened it up at home.  The quality and quantity is significantly different from the original location.  The chicken was dry and stringy and some part even mushy.  Weird texture.  The hot sauce (I ordered hot) was gritty? 

There are so many better places to get a shawarma plate or wrap than this place.  Scarborough has an abundance of authentic Middle Eastern take out joints so I am confused as to why Osmow's in Scarborough would not at least be on par with the other places.

Perhaps it was an off day so I will try it once more just to be sure before I write it completely off.  If not,  I can always go to Lawrence Ave East to find plentiful good shawarma places for less $$ and way better quality.

Our server was eager to get this party going, but we were not in any rush.. in fact, we took in Europeanly slow. 

The drinks was very pretentious, and very good. I usually prefer less pretentiousness but when in Rome.. We had a talk to the sommelier regarding the wine choice for all even if we all ordered different dishes. After short debate we made our choice, and it was great. We wanted an Arizona wine, but they were out so we retreated back to a French concoction that we enjoyed in the mannerisms of true cognoscenti.

Strange things are that they have linens on the table, but paper covering the linen. I must say that this does give the unnecessarily cheap impression. Odd for an establishment that take so much pride in the rest of its appearance. The service is good, but a little hovering for my own preference. I was surprised how mixed the makeup of the patrons were. Thoroughly eclectic and heterogeneous, which is never a bad thing. 

It is a bit loud in here. Our party could still talk, but strangely loud for such a nice place.. and to top it off we had a party next to us with one amazingly loud woman. It's one of those things that you cannot blame the establishment for - and yet, it affects the overall fermata of the ambiance impression.

However, just this year, Reyna Foods opened a basement restaurant, something that may have been seen as inevitable to local patrons considering that a popular taco stand has been operating in the front of the business for some time now. 

Facile to overlook during a ride down Penn Avenue, the subterranean eatery Reyna houses is a Mexican Wonderland, and the other evening, Kay and I willingly leaped into the rabbit-hole to celebrate that which is edible and of the Land of the Hot Sun. 

Decorated to look like a cantina from yesteryear, aged wood, beer barrels, vibrant murals, and vintage photographs command the scenery.

Luis, dashing and deft, led us on a journey, playing the role of a Latin Cheshire Cat. 

""I'd like the Anchos Rellenos. Did I say that right? I had some Spanish in school,"" I said to Luis.

""Not bad,"" Luis replied. ""Can you say this?"" Luis pointed to something on the bill of fare called Tamal Oaxaqueno. 

""Oh boy,"" I let out, much to the amusement of Luis who provided service of the highest caliber and with the utmost class. 

A blackened shroud of an ancho chile pepper was buried in a bloody coat of a smoky mole poblano and stuffed with ground beef, pork, potatoes, and onions. Rice and refried beans were served on the side. Funereal, dark flavors usurped my tongue, the dish's spices smoldering like a pyre yet failing to overwhelm the starches and proteins. The rice was immaterial, but the refried beans, something I'm usually averse to, were pure comfort on the palate, surprising me with their flavorsome. chili-like quality. 

A Salsa Sampler with Reyna's housemade corn chips and some guacamole began the ceremony of the senses. Served in a faux newspaper cone, the chips were extraordinary in their kettle-cooked texture and were more than tasty enough naked. Kay chose one salsa, and I another. Kay's Sweet Mango was a treat fit for stuffing fruit pies or topping globs of ice cream. Quiet notes of cilantro and onion could be heard amidst the glorious sugary, citrusy din made by not only pureed mango but peaches as well. My Casera salsa was also a success albeit a lesser one. Blended tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and jalapenos mingled together in what was a sublime slow burn of a party in its own right, yet I kept going back to that Sweet Mango. 

The guacamole was a buttery, chunky tribute to that exquisite yet humble superfood with green chiles, tomatoes, onions, crema, cilantro, and lime making it sparkle. 

The dessert known as Tequilamisu nearly intoxicated me with its alcohol content. This Mexican take on tiramisu was a sinister seducer of a confection, its strawberries bulbous, its creamy innards indulgently soft and saccharine...

Thankfully, Kay couldn't finish her kinder and more delicate Chocolate Tres Leche cake, a much milder angel of a pastry than rescued me from the corruption of a strumpet with hard liquor in her veins and bad intentions on her mind.

Casa Reyna takes a cuisine that is humble and turns it into something bold and gourmet without sacrificing its soul. When next you find yourself in the Strip District, willfully fall into Reyna's merry underworld and experience everything Mexican food can be.",2013-11-17 00:18:01

Each time I have visited the service has been great; the waiters check on you frequently and are attentive, but are not clingy or overbearing like some other locations. They also know a lot about the menu, so they are a great help.

The burgers are outstanding. The premade burgers are good, custom burgers are good, all  of them. They routinely have non-menu specials that are a great choice. All of the ingredients are top notch, from the bread and toppings to extras. I haven't had one I don't like. 

The sides are good; the fries are especially good. Truffle and Gorgonzola fries will change your life. My only complaint is heat level; things marked as spicy are decidedly not so. The milkshakes are unbelievable; the Caramel Pretzel and the Coffee and Donuts are generously portioned with great, unique flavors. 

I only have one real complaint: the wait. If you go on the night of a sporting event it is a wait; if you go on Friday or Saturday night, expect a 2 hour wait. There are cool places to shop at nearby, but the wait can get onerous. But with good food, that is bound to happen.",2013-03-20 07:14:42

This girl responds back saying once she's given me the bag, she can't take it back anymore, like it was my problem & a big hassle to Just give me a different flavor. She eventually gave me the one I wanted after she discussed it with her manager. Now, I normally wouldn't even write a review about such a small thing, BUT once I got home and opened the bag, my cake pop was smushed! LOL!! Such a petty thing to do, actually pretty hilarious. Because of Emily I will never go back here. Be warned there are bitter teenagers that work here, please go somewhere else who will serve you better!",2017-11-21 22:46:20

Parking is small and often harder to find. Entering in, they have beautiful fresh produce, some I believe are imported from Korea. Ah, the culture in this supermarket is amazing. I saw them selling two engraved ginormous peaches for $10. Expensive, but kind of wanted to try it. 

I love coming to purchase the meats for hot pot because their meat is usually tender and soft and slightly chewy to bite for $8.99 a box. However, when I went yesterday, the meat was a little tough. Usually it's not like this though, so hopefully, it's just a miss kind of day.

I also love their sashimi. It's fresh and really delicious!

The snacks are one of my favourites. They have Korean chips that are delicious and cute. Whenever I come here, I make sure I hoard - people look at me like I just came out from a breakup. 

They have beauty products on the end, many Korean ones. It's a little expensive however, I would rather go elsewhere for it. The bakery has cute bread as well, these are also on the expensive side. 

There are little shops and a food court after the cash registers that you can feel free to check out after. I occassionally visit their food court for the combo meals!",2015-12-08 00:48:53

From the outside, it looks like your normal donut shot, but from the inside, it is very, very different.  I noticed the bamboo-like counter and stainless steel first.  It's not your typical set up for donuts.  Inside, the ceilings are high and the decor is very modern, yet minimalistic.  The floors are concrete, which adds as nice touch.

The donuts here are what I came here for, so lets get started.  First off, my eyes were immediately drawn the the cereal topped donuts.  I saw fruity pebbles, captain crunch, cocoa puffs, fruit loops, lucky charms, cinnamon toast crunch, and from the looks of it, this is genius, mixing breakfast cereals with donuts.  A win-win situation.  I had the fruity pebbles donut and it was delicious.  The donut itself wasn't sweet at all and what I noticed about all the raised donuts is that they are considerable raised higher than other donut shops.  This can only mean they use quality ingredients in their donuts.

I also appreciate the fact that the owner was able to help me decide on what donuts to get and didn't rush me.  They also have apple fritters that I will hopefully try next time and an array of other donut classics and some that are a twist to your typical fare.  There is much more planned for this donut shop and I can't wait to see what happens.  

They also have smoothies, coffee, and croissants.  This shop just opened as well, and wishing them a lot of success in the future.  By the way, it's right next to Kyoto Bowl.",2016-07-05 04:44:26

I'm no huge expert on Korean, but I am a connoisseur of dolsot bibimbap and banchan, and they do those pretty well.  It's a little weird to find one of the best Korean places in town so far out, but it's worth a detour.  (Convenient stop on a trip out to Moon to the drive-in, too.)

Went out on a Friday around 7, and we were seated right away.  It wasn't packed, but it was relatively busy.  We had dolsot bibimbap, veggie and beef, with sushi appetizer.  Sushi was good but not great - seemed fresh, but it was a little loosely packed.  Bibimbap ingredients were excellent, but it was a little cool - the mix itself and the bowl, so it didn't get that nice crusty rice that I so look forward to with bibimbap.  (Could've use a bit more gochujang - the spicy, ketchup-looking sauce - too, and it was about the mildest I've ever had.  I like a bit more kick.)  Banchan - the little appetizer/side dishes - were some of the best I've ever had, definitely the best in Pittsburgh.  Every single one was good.

Service was very attentive - maybe too much so, to the point of being intrusive.  Decor was a little trendy for my taste and a little cold (big tile, stainless tabletops).  The space seemed a bit cavernous, and it was loud given the relatively small crowd - a product of all the hard surfaces.  I don't need kitschy fake Korean, but I guess I think of it as comfort food and want something a little more intimate and warm.  Biggest ding on the space is the siting in a box store strip mall that seems to be on the way downhill.  

This place would be a giant winner in town, so it's worth the drive out if you're craving good Korean food.",2012-05-01 15:41:40

We were a few weeks away from the grand gala but we still had questions as to how to plan this event with out any hick ups.  Most of the staff did not seem to have the confidence to answer the questions we had about how an event could take place here.  I kept being referred to the printed card or call and schedule with so and so with and questions.  Umm....OK.  There was one young women who seemed to be the key holder of the property who was able to assist.  however we still were directed to contact another person.

We decided with some hesitation to run with the plan of having the party here and make the best of it regardless.  We booked on line which made it simple.  we were also able to complete our waiver if we were to be injured during our experience.  This was convenient because we could send this link out to all party attendees so they could complete this prior to arrival, which can save you considerable time and will not impact your jumping time. 

The party package included  one hour of jump time and 45 minutes in the party room.  We were able to bring in our own food and beverages in to the party room prior an set up decorations if we wanted.  Gravady provided all the paper products like napkins,plates and cups setup in a colorful pattern.  Gravady even provided a host to help with clean up as the party came to a close.  This was really helpful and no additional cost.  

The Birthday party went off with out any mishaps.  The one hour jump time was sufficient enough to wear out all the kids who attended.  I am sure the parents were happy that night because all the kids fell asleep right away I sure.

I digress, I tend to enjoy ice cold milk with oreos or chocolate chip cookies as a snack or dessert. However, this place has something special going on.

The flavors have all been perfected with the right amount of sweetness, flavor, and texture. I really can't find any flaw in their frozen yogurt. My personal favorites are acai berry, cookies and cream (surprise), and new york cheesecake. My girlfriend will be upset if I didn't mention red velvet, its her favorite. Even though I hate the idea of eating taro, even the taro isn't a bad flavor. If you need some fruits to make it more nutritious you can add those too.

I seriously can't stress how unique the flavors are and how immaculate the taste is. The pricing is pretty reasonable as well. For about $3 my GF and I seem to be able to satisfy our sweet tooth. If we're near ASU we usually top off a dinner or lunch with Yogurtland.

I'm not a big fan of frozen yogurt. It seems to be the trending dessert these days along with red velvet. I'm sure both frozen yogurt and red velvet have existed for years, its only recently that I've seen both these things EVERYWHERE.

It does not, at least to my eye, look anything like William Shatner.  Though it is allegedly a fountain, it does not always have water running, which can probably make it look a bit different - a head in a pond is different than a head in a fountain, right?

What possessed Paychex (or whatever company before them) to put a monstrous, rotating metal head in front of the building, I will never know, but it is cool.  Even better is the fact that the head is made up of bunches of little platters.  Unfortunately, what looks like perhaps fifty tiny platters do not spin - only the larger ""bundles"" of platters (four or five of them).

This means that the forehead and the nose can be pointing in different directions at times.  It seems to happen - roughly - every fifteen minutes or so, and the head points generally in compass points in relation to the building behind it, but it does not necessarily go around those points, stopping at each in order (like dealing a deck of cards).

Instead, it seems to follow you.  We had an impromptu picnic, and the head pointed away from the building.  But when we were sitting on the steps, it turned to look at us, in a disjointed way.  Then we went to the side and it reconfigured (to its normal state) and looked in that direction.  Then we went back to the steps and it turned that way.

If I wasn't so hungry, I would have walked out after the first plate. Everything tasted mushy and all the same. Little to no flavor and nothing was labelled, so you had no idea what you were eating, even though all the rolls tasted about the same. There were some tempura items, but again, with the batter, you had no idea what is was since there were no labels. Only labels said: ""Out at 11am, Take away by 3pm"". Eww, let's hope it hasn't been sitting out since 11! Some tasted old, some tasted fresher. Nothing tasted especially good at all. I will never waste another dollar on the buffet here, but might give them a chance on dinner ala carte sushi. I hear good things about the sushi here, but I just did not get anything good. I wouldn't rate anything I got over a 4-5, on a scale of 1-10. Wish I had just skipped this place. $11 for that buffet food was a rip-off.

After one look at the menu, they fell silent, faces scrunched in determination, attempting to narrow down the plethora of options before them. To make matters worse (but actually better), breakfast was served all day, so between the lunch, specials, juices, smoothies, baked goods, and breakfast... the selection seemed virtually endless. Our cashier/server was polite and incredibly patient as we asked a large number of unnecessary questions, frantically attempting to rationalize our menu-oriented decisions. 

After about 10 minutes had passed, I was still torn between the french toast and the BLT, so we agreed to order the french toast as an appetizer for the table. Thank the flying spaghetti monster we did. This may win the 'best classic french toast that ever was' award, vegan or not. It tastes like a cross between brioche and challah (butter bread and egg bread?), so I'm rather befuddled in regards to how they achieved that consistency, sans butter or eggs. Whatever, it's probably best I just stuff my mouth full of fresh fruit and warm, maple-y french toast and don't ask questions, anyway.

The BLT ended up being satisfactory, but from what I read online, I was expecting more. I don't remember tasting onions, avocado, cucumber, or aioli, so if it was there somewhere... I missed it. My friend disliked her tofu breakfast burrito, and I found it somewhat bland myself, but we brought it home and my boyfriend ate the entire thing in five minutes flat. However, quinoa tabooli was delicious, as was the tikka masala we received after our meal (thanks, Sasha, you rock!). Ethnic food is definitely a go at 24 Carrots.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate cake doughnut. It didn't stay together like a real cake doughnut, but it was much better than one... more like a ring of dense, chocolate cake. We also had the pleasure of trying an experimental raw cheesecake. It tasted a lot like chia seed-y, vanilla bean panna cotta with a bottom layer of delicious crust. Needless to say, everyone loved it (thanks, Daniel, you rock!) We also may have donated a dollar to charity in exchange for a mini chocolate cupcake. All worth it.

On the whole, unless you LOVE tofu, I recommend the sweet breakfast options. The one thing that's disappointing about this menu is that the entire savory selection of breakfast is tofu-based. However, with options like homemade granola, french toast, and maca oatmeal, I think I'll survive. Top that off with an awesome, relaxed atmosphere and the most amiable staff around, and you've got an all-around pleasant experience. I'll definitely have try 24 Carrots again... something tells me I won't get a full feel for the place until maybe my 35th visit, which I have no problem with.",2012-04-02 22:37:22

Olivier is as charming and caring about real, healthy, whole food options as ever. His parents work side-by-side with him: I LOVE that. I'd not been back since their early September holiday and even the cashier remembered the size and addition of ginger to my Green Juice. 

Yesterday was my Dad's first visit, though we have brought him take away before. He was enamored with the Proscuitto sandwich  with salami, fresh mozzarella greens, nuts and bleu cheese. As a Sicilian, he is very picky about his charcuterie and loved it. Olivier's Mom kindly explained to Dad that Proscuitto does not fare well with panini (heat press) and she was right; it tends to dry out the delicate meat. He also enjoyed Virgil's Zero Cola with Stevia: another testament to Olivier's belief in healthy, organic, non GMO product. As an 80%er in Clean Eats, his breads are the perfect spot to blow that 20% carb wad; reminds me of Baguettes you pick up at market in Paris, perfect combination of crunchy, light and chewy. Who could ask for more?

On previous visits and in correspondence, he had suggested and espoused the virtues of Coconut Oil in treating Alzheimer's. He was delighted to hear the folks are using it, and gave advice about other uses and types to incorporate into wellness lifestyle.  Was also not surprised he met two couples I know the day before; and remembered where they sat outside and their names! 

He truly cares for and remembers each and every customer, and trains his employees the same. This is why only recently he has decided to follow his dream of a wine Bistro in an adjacent store which will have extended hours. He does not want to expand and lose the personal touch they impart into every customer interaction. 

Chef always makes two soups daily and one is vegan. The offices, hospital and local Doctors offices order frequently en masse. Yet despite my pleas, he doesn't have a website, printed menu or even a business card. Food, family and healthy living are his passions. Maybe someday we will talk PR seriously, but humility is part of his charm. There is currently a spot on their Facebook page to vote for them in Chase's $250K neighborhood business grant program. Can't think of a more worthy choice. 

As we left yesterday, he was introducing a new client to the menu as he always does; but he stopped me and handed me a Financier that was indescribably perfect. Looks like a mini pound cake, but lighter than air, almond flour based and not too sweet. Mom the chocoholic LOVES the chocolate tart, as I do because he uses 80% cacao, giving it a dark chocolate and not cloyingly sweet taste. Every special item he has presented from his pastry offerings have been nothing short of perfect and worthy of extra cardio :) He follows Yelp and always thanks you for patronage and feedback. 

I drive far to enjoy his creations and dedication and am happy to have turned friends on to this delightful spot. Again, every menu item can be modified for any dietary concerns and be delicious. It is not for ""Super Size"" it folks. But, as in France, you get just enough of everything to be sated and not sporting a Food Baby. 

Merci Beaucoup, Olivier for being a wonderful person, Chef and advocate for fabulous food health, social responsibility and animal rights. See you soon!

I always believe those are the pillars to a good restaurant experience and Brews Brothers hits the mark on all three.  I've been there several times over the last six months and each visit was a pleasant time.

They have an excellent selection of tap beers, with a good 5-10 of each variety and they change them often.  I recommend getting one of their flights; they're only $10 for four reasonably sized beers.  From chocolate porters, to dogfish ipas, to belgian ales, you'll find your favorites and probably enjoy sampling stuff outside of your comfort zone.  They have a brews brothers loyalty program too so you can get points towards freebies down the road.

The food choices desperately need to be expanded and improved upon, but I will give them credit in a few areas.  The potato chips are freshly skinned and seasoned, giving them a nice mixture of chewiness and crunchiness as you work your way through the basket.  The burgers are delicious, they use fresh meat from Knoche's which is a local butcher shop that has been in Madison since I was a kid and is well known for their quality.  I like that Brews Brothers gets creative here, with offerings such as jalapenos and cream cheese, cajun seasonings, slaw and bbq, and various forms of scrumptious bacon.  I think if you're getting some food, I'd recommend the burgers most of all.  Besides that, there isn't much else you even can get, aside from the pub grub which is popular but not my favorite.  It's chips with a ton of extras thrown haphazardly in the mix, almost like a loaded nachos plate.  But don't take my qualms into it if that's usually your jam, as I seem to be alone in that opinion.

Our service has routinely been friendly, welcoming us as we walk in and all happy smiles.  We've had several long conversations with staff and bartenders and they made us feel right at home with a nice down to earth attitude.  That's huge to me, I don't think you can get that kind of service at many places and it's one of the reasons Brews Brothers has quickly grown to be one of my frequent kick-back spots in Madison.  Just a great place to have a few beers, TVs to watch sports or shows, etc.  Prices are incredibly reasonable too for just about anything on the menu, usually $10 or less.

My only gripes are the menu selections I mentioned, the atmosphere, and the newer servers.  We went once or twice where the person serving didn't seem to be too aware of what was available or attentative, but it was very busy with a big sports game going on and I think the server was both new and overwhelmed.  Easily something that will improve over time and far from the norm.  The atmosphere is just a big room with TVs and tables, not a lot of decor or things to look at.  Almost feels like a spruced up room in a house somewhere.  But, where they lack in that area they make up for it everywhere else and I imagine as they get on their feet this will also improve.

Highly recommend a visit.  Just think of that long work day where you need a cold one after and some relaxation time and Brews Brothers (Mr. Brews) has got you covered",2014-10-28 02:26:31

Food, quality, service, atmosphere - all set to exceed expectations. 

The old Bestellen, this place has really been transformed. The interior's designed by the guys who did Buca, so you're left with clean and industrial, with touches of wood to give you a real retro, romantic and city feel to the space.

Service wise, these guys just get it. Staff are dressed crisp, and behave in a warm yet extremely professional manner. There's pride in this location, and you can see it in the way servers talk about food and the recommendations they make. The place does tend to get packed up and service does slow down slightly as a result, but it's not in an unacceptable manner.

The added touches of free sparkling or flat water really show that the restaurant is customer focused, and not focused on the ego of the chef. They're full and drawing in customers because they clearly get the sustainability of that model. Menu wise, Chef Rob Rossi is knocking it out of the park with a traditional yet sophisticated Italian menu. 

Stand out dishes include the octopus, the seafood pasta, the goat and almost all the contorni. What's really impressive is the price to quality ratio. For example, I'm not sure where else in the city I can get a whole small octopus for $20, or an entire plateful of mushrooms for $12.

The first time I ordered the West Coast Chicken.  Everything about it was tasty -- nice size chicken piece, the bun, havarti cheese, tomato, and avocado. I appreciated that the avocado slices were covered by the melted cheese, so didn't slip out whenever I took a bite. 

Zinburger is part of the Fox Concept group of local restaurants, and every one is a winner.  However, it is pricey.  Zinburger specializes in burgers and no sides come with it.  The $5-$7 sides are good-sized, and include loaded fires, green chili fries, and sweet potato fries (my favorite), as well as onion rings and mac-cheese.  There are also shakes and malts, a little costly for the size.  

But the burgers are worth the price.  The meat is so fresh, so noticeably different from run-of-the-mill burgers.  On the second visit, my friend liked the combination in the West Coast Chicken sandwich, but wanted a burger.  The server didn't hesitate to make that substitution. I ordered a small wedge salad and was slightly disappointed that it wasn't really a wedge, but served as a chopped salad.  But everything was good and my friend raved about her burger.

The seating area is open and energetic. The bar is fun because, when weather permits, one side is open to the outdoors, so seating is almost all around the bar.

On the one hand, this is where my department orders the departmental breakfasts, but on the other hand, this place is a wee bit pricey.  The price for coffees/teas is reasonably. Sadly, there is no almond milk as alternative to regular milk & cream.  But the prices for the food buffet are too much because it's by the pound and it adds up immediately.

I do like that they have chocolates, crisps, yogurts, fruits, cheese for that mid-day snack attack, particularly yogurts.

The menu is really fun, where the items are either named after a movie character or movie line.  Every time we go, and with different people, it's fun to guess the movie or character.
The food and service are both good, and the menu options are decent.  The first couple of times, I ordered tacos, and this time I went with a Burrito the ""Clarence Beeks""  -- Cilantro Marinated Steak, Jasmine Red Rice, Black Beans, Jack Cheese, Sour Cream, Pico De Gallo, Topped with Queso Blanco.  The burrito was very large and was delicious. I couldn't eat the whole thing.

Both were neither too spicy, which is good for my friend. She doesn't like things too spicy, unless it's me. :-)
The only pet peeve, and never really noticed before, is they charge you for chips and salsa.  Most places, as soon as you walk in, they are complimentary and always plentiful.  Not this place.  So i ordered chips and asked if it came with salsa, to which, I also had to order the salsa.

Well... cant get it right all the time. 

Therefore, as fellow Elite member Kat B has gone about, here is another REAL review to help decide whether you should make a stop at this wonderful boba shop.

Still in the early stages of their soft opening, Tea Space has gone through a few road bumps. On my first visit, the boba was warm, melting the ice in my drink and watering down the taste. However, as I visited again in attempts to give this place another shot, it was a pleasant surprise to see the boba much softer, much smoother, and all around more fitting of a well established tea shop. 

After having a few drinks as of now, I've noticed that the tea here seems stronger on the tea side, leaving more flavor to come forward and impact on the body a lot more effecting. Drinks have the taste of real ingredients and not raw powder. Always a plus in these types of establishments! I recommend their sea salt drinks and thai tea. Two thumbs up.

I always appreciate businesses who really listen to customer feedback and try to improve the quality of their product. I think it's also safe to say that the staff members are very personable. Extremely friendly and welcoming, I even ended up having a 10 minute conversation with a man I believe to be the manager of the store. Very pleasant. This is customer service rarely ever found in these grab-and-go type spots.

With a rocking collection of pop art, good location, staff, and the drive to become better, I can tell that this will be an amazing spot to hang out especially when they're at their best and officially ready to have their grand opening. Give it a shot, fellow Yelpers. :)",2017-08-29 21:31:00

When my plate arrived, I was happy that I felt a slight burning sensation in my tongue. That is how I know it is indeed spicy to my level. I also ordered a Thai iced tea and it was deliciously refreshing.

The owner is the only one providing service so as more people come in, the service becomes slow but definitely worth it.  This place is definitely a hidden gem!

The place looks pretty run down and you will sink in the booth when you sit down.

I didn't come here to critique the area.. but to critique the food and boy oh boy! My palate is definitely satisfied!!

We ordered the number 1 appetizer which was the fried egg rolls and you can tell it was homemade.  You could actually see the meat and vegetables inside the wrap.

The iced coffee is definitely better here compared to what we are used to. Not too sweet and you can actually taste the coffee.

Now for the main course!!! I had the number 30 pho! When I had my first taste of the broth I was in love!!! It was clear unlike the broths I was used to and it tasted so absolutely amazing!! It's basically the cat's meow! The broth really didn't need anything to it since the broth was already full of flavor!  Basically I was already full but kept drinking the broth because it is that good!! There was a generous portion of noodles but not that much meat.  The cost of the meals were very reasonable and delicious!

Menu is small, and you have your choice of thin or thick noodles. Makes ordering easy for someone as indecisive as I am. Chose the tomato ramen because 1. I've never had it before and 2. It comes with scallop! The ramen came out really quick. Almost too quick. But the broth was nice. The bowl was a bit smaller than I remember but it was the perfect amount for me personally. The egg was cooked perfectly, and you get a whole egg unlike it's competitors. The tomato ramen comes with a nice full scallop (which I saved for last), and juicy little mushrooms. One thin slice of pork was the only complaint I had. Skimped out on the meat. 

Decor is minimalist but very clean. The servers were extremely friendly. They repeat the order back to you so there's no confusion and greet you when you go in and out the main doors. Great spot to get your ramen fix.",2015-09-24 21:48:05

But to be honest, I've stayed in Hamptons and Marriotts that had a lot nicer and cleaner rooms than this place. It also took 45 minutes to check in. Two people were checking people in and the line was so long. Finally more people came after a half hour. 

The bathroom was gross. Not very clean. I definitely didn't want to touch the shower curtain. The tub was rusty and the faucet and shower head leaked the whole time. The sink had rust and chips all over it, too. 

The beds and pillows are hard, you will wake up with a sore back. Our one lamp was out and the other had rips all through the shade. 

The elevators are old and a lot of the buttons don't even light up. I didn't trust them! The carpet is also super outdated. 

I know they have renovated rooms but why not do ALL of them?! I know this is an old hotel but come on! If you can upgrade half of your rooms, why not do them all? 

The pool was nice. But it sucks that you can't bring your own drinks. Of course they want you to spend an exorbitant amount of money on their drinks. I suppose that's at every hotel, though.  

When booking the room, it said my view was the High Roller Strip view, so I paid extra. Yeah, there was no Strip in my view. Just the high roller, and parking lots. Also, I don't like that you have to check in at 4pm and check out at 11am or get charged. Next time I come to Vegas, I will definitely stay at a different hotel.

Coming from the east coast, Boston, I'm always on the lookout for east coast style pizzerias. When I think east coast pizza I think of Boston's and New York's thin, flavorful style. This pizza was more inline with what you expect from Pizza Hut. Thick, boring dough, and bland sauce. While eating we had to add dried basil to our slices because there seem to be a local lack of seasoning in the sauce or cheese.

We started out with the clams corona. They were pretty good, that's a recipe I""m sooo stealing. They steamed the clams in corona, garlic and pico de gallo. They were served with crusty bread topped with jalapeno cilantro pesto, yummmm.

I tried to get the short rib tacos, but sadly they were out of teh short ribs. I opted for the duck breast tacos, cooked rare. My tacos were good, but they put too much of the juice from the pico on there so the tortialls ended up being soggy. No biggie, I used wifey's extra tortilla that she had with her combo platter. 

Her combo platter had a beef taco, cheese enchilada, rice, beans and a nice size piece of the best flavored most tender skirt steak I've ever had in my entire life. No joke, I was literally thinking about that carne asada the entire night!  (insert comical ""he's dreaming about meat"" joke here)

The first was one of the first HOT days in May.  I was job hunting, and decided a happy hour cocktail and bite was in order.  Three words""  TAKE BETHANY HOME!  It's the first on the list of ""vignature"" cocktails...and one of my new favorite drinks.  Julia was behind the bar, and had enough time to exchange a dirty joke with me to make me feel like a regular.  Two drinks and the happy hour sliders...YUM!  My only complaint...and this is the kind of complaint I am sure the owners love...there was too much food!  I am a big girl, and I can put away the chow...but two drinks and an appetizer and I was uncomfortably full!  Didn't even finish the fries - which were great, but I was too full!
Second time was happy hour with a girlfriend.  We sat on the patio, shared a couple cocktails (I am stuck on Take Bethany Home, she tried the Moscow Mule...which was also great.)  We split the artichoke dip and the flatbread pizza.  Both were great...but once again - same issue.  Two women who are not afraid to eat - two cocktails and two appetizers...and there were leftovers!
Another solo happy hour - I think I have it mastered...the wings are the right amount for one person and two drinks!
Was in last night for the ribeye dinner special with my mom and her husband.  (YAY for industry and facebook fan discounts...I fit both categories!)  Mom and I had Take Bethany Home, her hubby had a couple Juan Gambinos.  For a man who only drinks scotch and water, I was impressed he left his comfort zone...and as he ordered a second, it must have been damn good!  All three of us had the special.  The ribeye was well cooked and flavorful, the corn on the cob was a bit plain, but that's A-OK with me.  The potato salad was super fresh, very cold and quite tasty.  Then there were the baked beans.  WOW!  I could make a meal of these alone!  (Gonna ask for the recipe, for sure!)  Mom ordered the brownie a la mode for dessert for the three of us to share.  Personally, I was so full, i would have gladly skipped - but good thing I didn't!  The ice cream, caramel and chocolate sauces were good - but the brownie itself was perfect!

I complain about the portion sizes only because it limits what I can try on one visit.  If there for happy hour, one app per person makes sense - more than that is too much food.  If for dinner, and all members of the party are getting entrees, best to skip apps completely.  Really - one dessert should not have put three people over the edge of too full!

Service has always been prompt and professional and I will be back again and again as long as they keep up this level of service and quality!

A groupon brought me here the first time, so I made a reservation for 5:30, right after work. The place was a ghost town when we got there, so that was a little scary, since a lack of customers might mean the place is horrible. The host was frantic for some reason and urged us to sit outside, which was nice, but the table was cramped, wobbly, and we were accompanied by a loud and obnoxious bored valet who apparently knew everyone that walked by. 

We got drinks that were tasty, but didn't seem to include much alcohol. The edamame was good and there certainly was plenty of it--no complaints there! Between the two times I've been here, we tried the Dynamite, Supernova, Volcano Maki, and Dancing Girl rolls. They were all very tasty and I'd definitely order them again. Disappointment: we wanted to try sea urchin and they didn't have it both times we came--the first time, we got a replacement suggestion, the second time, the guy just walked away on a mission to check if they had it and never said another word. Unagi sashimi is delicious (one of my favorites!) and the octopus was meh...not really a huge fan of it. 

The real problem here is the service and hibachi. Our second endeavor was with the goal of getting a group of people together for a nice night out. Everything was fine, but our hibachi cook didn't interact with us, was very serious, and didn't do any of the classic hibachi tricks for us. To me, a gigantic pile of rice and generically sauced veggies is NOT worth hibachi price if you aren't going to get a show with it...that's the whole point of it. Major disappointment there. Our waiter was also pretty lame. He kept forgetting orders, getting things wrong, and assuming certain people were ordering particular things right off the bat.

Trash Disposal: can't assign stars, not sure what to make of it; there are normal trash containers at the door of the theater as you exit, but there's a long bank of them against a wall where patrons I guess are supposed to empty the leftover liquids from their glasses into a sink, a separate bin for plastic, separate for paper, etc. Most people just used the one right at their door as far as I could tell.

I really enjoyed all of the chicken and chicken tenders as well as all of the sides! I am going to be coming back and taking more people with me! 

All of the chicken tasted fresh and moist, not dried out or over battered like the other places I've been to (hence why I am not a fan). But I really tasted a lot of flavour that was in the chicken. Parmesan and pepper was my favourite seasoning on the chicken tenders. So crispy and actual chicken (big ones too)! The mac and cheese & the potato salad was my favourite side. As well as my first time trying corn bread, was really good and not super spicy.

So in conclusion, I would recommend the regular chicken (white meat or dark meat you specify) OR the chicken tenders with the parmesan flavour. My favourite sides would be the mac n cheese and potato salad. =)

FlipSide has an extensive menu and something for almost everyone, but trust me - the only burger you'll ever need is the FlipSide Burger. It includes everything I love on a burger: aged cheddar cheese, thick Applewood smoked bacon, grilled red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a house-made barbecue sauce that is to die for. The barbecue sauce is both sweet and salty, and is a perfect complement to the sharpness of the cheddar cheese. I would eat this sauce with a spoon; it is so addictive! I've tried other burgers on the menu, but I always return to this one. The beef at FlipSide is locally sourced from Ohio-raised cattle, and you can really taste the difference in terms of freshness. I can't say enough good things about FlipSide's burgers. An easy five stars.

The French fries are also delicious, as the rosemary on top provides a unique flavor. The shakes are fantastic as well (if you have room for one after your meal - hah!).

People in Pittsburgh think that Burgatory or BRGR have great burgers, but clearly they have never been to a FlipSide. All other burgers are now entirely unsatisfactory to me. Thank you, FlipSide, for sending my burger expectations through the roof and prohibiting me from enjoying them almost anywhere else!",2016-03-31 18:15:06

On my first visit I ordered a Beef Kabob plate. I really liked the beef kabob and I liked the saffron rice as well. The veggies on the side were good too. The only thing missing was maybe a small hummus or cucumber sauce side for dipping the pita bread. 

My second experience was ordering takeout for a work lunch. Placing an order for 10 was easy and ready in 25-30 minutes. They have many reasonably priced meals which made it easy to stay within T&E limits for our lunch. All of our orders were correct and everyone enjoyed their meals. The only room for improvement was on the way they packaged some of the to go orders. There were large skewers stabbed through the takeout boxes from top to bottom. When we removed them to separate the to go containers we ended up with leaking juices due to the holes in the bottom of the containers.

The Shredded Chicken Wrap was my choice for my work lunch. I liked the variety in this meal. It included a yummy grape leaf, hummus, and sauce for the wrap. The flavor on the chicken was good and I liked the flavor of the chicken and sauce together. It was very messy though.

b9APzuV34fAMRnNFDE4A3g,EyYVD9n7PlYYLTSEQ5t14w,Ck6zHE15TuWTaNJ2YNawZA,4,1,1,1,"When I think of liquid nitrogen, I think about science experiments and how balloons placed in it contract but then re-expand once taken out of the liquid form of this gaseous element. Science geek factoids aside, I thought what a cool concept to have ice cream made before your eyes with the help of liquid nitrogen! 

When you walk into the shop, you can't help but notice the massive tanks of liquid nitrogen behind the counter. There were several flavours of ice cream to choose from, which I understand change periodically. Popular flavours include their mango pop ice (described to us to be like Dippin Dots) which is served with chunks of mango. 

Being a chocoholic myself, I was drawn to the chocolate brownie ice cream. The flavour was decent-- not the best or creamiest ice cream I've ever had but far from the worst. The chocolate flavour was boosted by the one bite brownie topping as well as the toasted marshmallow (which my niece devoured). Because they use milk rather than cream, the texture and relative creaminess are not unlike a more frozen version of soft serve. My brother got the creme brûlée which did taste a bit like the popular dessert, but he compared it to tasting like an an electrical fire with perhaps a little too much overly brûléed sugar on top. 

We tried the Frozen Breath, which is basically Cheetos placed in a container with liquid nitrogen, which was a funny experience for (slightly older) children and adults to have liquid nitrogen gases escaping through their noses and mouths. 

At $5.75 for a medium cup, or nearly $8 for a large, Cool N2 serves up rather expensive ice cream relative to the quality of the ice cream itself. I recommend going for the experience. Personally I prefer the quality full fat ice cream and gelato found at other popular ice cream purveyors. 3.5 stars for my chocolate brownie ice cream, 0.5 stars for the experience.",2016-10-01 15:17:52

At 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon, we were allowed to order off the lunch menu, which meant that a serving of vegetarian pad thai was $6.50 - and the portion was big enough that I took about half of it home.  It was one of the best pad thai's I've ever had - not too saucy, the egg was cooked well, it wasn't too peanutty or too bland... all the flavors were perfectly balanced.

I thought the tofu summer rolls were a little bland, but I think that's the case everywhere and is not a complaint about Green Mango.  My boyfriend said his pineapple curry was worthy of four stars, a little spicier than expected but not overwhelmingly so.  My dad got the shrimp tom yum soup, which he also said was quite spicy, and the ginger chicken, which went over well.

They also sell yearly passes that I believe are selling for 30.00 now. It is cash or check only. This is a pain as I never carry cash. They also sell a pass that is I believe around 75.00 and that will get you into all or most of the National Parks. That is great deal if you plan on traveling during the year. Anyway, the passes are nice just because the money goes to helping the upkeep of the parks. 

They also have great hiking for all ages. Just be careful and stay on the trails. I hate when I hear all the sirens going out there. I know something bad happened. People fall all the time. There are also snakes in the summer so do not put your little paws in the snake holes and keep your eyes open on he trails.

Bottom level of this restaurant is catered toward a more casual crowd, and the top level serves a more formal crowd (but not much in terms of upscaled ambiance).  Initially, I was disappointed with the sparse menu selection...as there are literally less than half a dozen items on the main menu.  Since not too thrilled with the skimpy main selection (with surprisingly snobby pricing), I ordered their specialty soup and two appetizers (and dessert) in its place.  The appetizers, Beef Tartare and Mac 'n Cheese, were good...but not great.  However, I was very impressed with the She Crab soup and the Creme Brûlée, which came in a cute, TRI-medley presentation.  I came with a group, and some of the entrees that others ordered looked quite delicious, so I might have written off their entrees too soon.  Also, the service was very friendly and down-to-earth...just what you'd expect in a restaurant situated in this quaint, little area of town.

We go on a Saturday at 1:30pm, which I figured was a good time since it SHOULD be just after lunch. But not at the Diamond as it was wall to wall crowded!

So we get seated in under 10 minutes, and we both decide to get the burgers since it was our first time here. I've been in Charlotte 2 years now, and have had some pretty good burgers, but I wanted to see if this was ""the mecca"" for Burgers. 

A week before, I decided to check out the Penguin and I admit that their Burgers were damn good! So I thought, No way can the Diamond's be any better. Boy was I wrong! I got the double and my buddy went for the Full Hemi (3 patties for a full pound)! We both ordered it Medium and they both came that way. Always worry about that especially when a Restaurant is super busy like the Diamond.

So bottom line - the Burgers were cooked to PERFECTION! Super juicy deliciousness (fatty beef content for FLAVOR) and their Fries were home cut and made quite well. 

Oh, we started the meal with the Fried Pickles as my buddy never had a GOOD version of this dish. And man did we both love them! Crispy with good seasoning (some Cheyenne?) served with Ranch! Oh so yummy!

Back to the burgers.....so after asking for many additional Napkins (which is a GREAT sign at a burger joint because you know it's super juicy), we both stated out loud that this is the BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! Penguin was a close second, only edged out by the Diamond because they cooked my burger to a PERFECT MEDIUM with a nice red/pink center. 

So it's a 1 - 2 race, with the Diamond in a close lead!

Overall, a DELICIOUS lunch with a prompt and friendly staff, despite the crowd (another good sign when people literally line up out the door).

Can't wait to come back! If you're craving a GREAT burger, come here!

Also, i thought the bulk spice selection was in a weird place. Why are you hiding it on an endcap. Either put it with the spices, or with the bulk foods, but not on an endcap somewhat spice-adjacent. And for crying out loud, is my home Sprouts the only place in the universe that carries Ceylon cinnamon?

Tonight it was cold out and the venue decided to keep all the doors wide open and the temperature indoors was just as COLD.  The seating is HORRID, they are very small in width and there is NO leg room from your chair and the seat directly in front of you, we had to stand up multiple times throughout the show to have those pass through the aisle way back to their seat and back.  Fully staffed personnel/security and while they monitored the NO audio, NO recording, NO flash policy they lacked in enforcing the DRUNK, LOUD and ANNOYing to keep their talk down throughout the performance. It was difficult to enjoy the full show, until I finally had to ask them to keep it down several notches and they where a few rows behind.  Drinks/beverages are priced HIGH:  water $4, 6oz of house wine $8, beer $15.  These prices are stadium prices like that of Chase Field.  This venue is a disappointment and run down.  However, this venue is great for concerts that the performer is center of the venue on the stage that rotates a full 360 degrees and regardless of where you sit, you have a decent view.  Unsure, if I can recommend this venue or if I would return unless it is one of my favorite bands.",2014-02-07 06:39:07

First we looked up movie times as we always do on Flixster, got there, and were told that their times are never correct on Flixster, Movie Phone, any of those so it's best to only check AMC. I have never had an issue with Flixster, it's one of the largest apps for theatres, why aren't you better connected?! So we had to wait another hour for the movie. 

The Concessions stand people were slow and we had to repeat multiple times what we wanted as if they were not paying attention. My friend used his AMC rewards card in order to use his points to get a popcorn, but they kid scanned his card and then still charged us full price because we were supposed to TELL him we wanted to use the points. We don't know your system, and maybe that was OUR bad, but maybe you guys should be more engaged with your guests and ask. 

We walked over to the theater and people were standing outside the doors and said the cleaning crew told them to wait to enter as it was being cleaned. It was 15 minutes before the movie was scheduled to start - seriously? They said that the crew left but didn't tell them it was okay to go and sit. We walked in anyway, no one was around and the theater was still a mess. 

The theater was also hot and the seats are uncomfortable, as if their reclining position is upright, and their upright position is leaning forward.

Of course I ordered palak paneer, rice and naan; what else is new. I opted for take out and was pleasantly surprised with how hot the dish stayed during my 'road trip' home. I got lost, filled up on gas, did some dishes and pretty much just lolligagged for about 15 minutes thereafter. I did find it odd that the take out is in a vacuum sealed package. I immediately regretted spending $13 on what looked like a frozen tv dinner.

After I opened the package, I couldn't resist but to dive in. Unfortunately, I'm that girl that will eat anything, regardless how it looks. I was extremely happy to find the meal was fresh made and sooo yummy. I got mild but am thinking the next time I go I'll get medium. There are plenty of paneer chunks too. The naan bread is bigger than my head. 

I've been eating for about 25 minutes and am stuffed. Looking at my plate, I've eaten exactly half the portion they gave which is remarkable since I am a bottomless pit.

The smoked meat was flavourful without being overly salty (a common complaint with smoked meat), the pickles were crunchy and fresh, the potato salad was creamy without being heavy, and the vinegar-based coleslaw was fresh and thin sliced.

I know, I know.  Completely my fault, I wish I could've waken up earlier.  Anyway, if it wasn't for getting lost (going East instead of West, like the directions said, whaaat?), I believe we would've arrived sooner.  By the time we got there, the sun was setting, so I urged my family to stop at a point a little after the entrance of the 13-mile loop in the canyon to take photos before it got completely dark and impossible to take a photo.

The photos came out beautifully, and I wish we could've actually stopped inside the loop of the canyon, (but since it was my first time I didn't even know about the loop) instead of taking them in the parking lot near the exit of the loop.

By the time we finished, it was 5:00 pm and already getting pretty dark.  We decided to go up to the Visitor Center on a whim and realized that was the entrance to the 13-mile loop!  Normally you have to pay a $5 vehicle entrance fee, but since they close at 5:00 pm (and I assume the person collecting the $ long had gone home), we drove through the loop for free.  Cool, right?  Yeah!  Except we couldn't see anything 'cause it was pitch-black dark, hahaha.  The loop also has plenty of overlooks for you to stop and take photos, or hike the trails.

I'll be sure to go visit again when I'm in Las Vegas 'cause it definitely seems to be worth going to at an earlier time!

We previously ordered take out and I wanted to wait until we tried dine in to review. Overall I think it's just a little pricy for the dim-sum dishes and the quality of food we received was OK. Some dishes were hit or miss, others just average. It also would've been nice to have some complimentary tea. Service was good, we did not have problems others previously wrote about. Although it was around 115pm on a cold rainy day.

I love dim-sum and it's great Madison has this option now. I've frequented dim-sum places since I was a child. My favorites are are the rice crepes; shrimp and BBQ pork. The rice noodles of the ones at Nani are a little to thick for my preference. They also came out luke warm, still tasty though. I skipped the shrimp dumplings on this visit. We got them in our take out order a while back and I thought they were too big and not delicate tasting enough to pay $4.95 for 4. We also had the baked BBQ buns. Again not very warm and they weren't brown and caramelized on top how I am used to but the taste was very good and there was enough filling. These I would eat and order again. We also ordered the sticky rice, not hot enough and pretty bland. The fried pork dumplings were nice and hot but a little too doughy. 

We also ordered a lunch special to share, kung Pao chicken. This was probably the best part about our meal also the best deal. It was $9 for a plate of chicken and rice, a big bowl of hot and sour soup and a taro roll. The taro roll was delicious and we could've eaten several more. The chicken had a nice spice to it and I appreciate that they used dark meat chicken. The soup was really good and a large serving, just spicy enough and hot.

It was drenched in vinegar & so layered with hummus that the thing didn't stand a chance as a hand held food...tragic. I just couldn't eat it though because the whole place was disgustingly dirty! Rather than wipe a table the kids hung out in the back, eating, discussing who invited Lauren the other night. At least three different kids walked into the dining area to refill their beverage while we were there (and we were the only people there so no excuse about waiting for customers to clear out). Man, if I were management I'd hold an employee meeting, introduce the term inventory and cleanliness....we'll see. Actually scratch that: I wouldn't return nor recommend the place even if I won a contest that gave me free food for life. Nope.",2015-10-18 00:06:53

Located at NE corner of Bay Street / Gerrard Street West, Labothéry is a laboratory-themed tea café where YOU are in control of what goes into your bubble tea drink!

Labothéry does not have a menu, so you can create your own concoction with a wide selection of flavours and toppings. The options are truly endless! So ""get ready to unleash your inner chemist"" :D

The coolest part of the experience was picking out the ingredients, where they are packaged in the forms of test tubes, syringes, petri dishes! Gets me all excited lol.

The 'lab scientists' working there were very friendly and will give you advice on which flavours or toppings would go well together in your drink. 

You can create your own milk tea, fresh tea or slush once you have your base flavours, sweetness level, and toppings in your tray. The 'lab' barista will 'mix' them together, and will address you by Dr. (insert your name here) when your drink is ready ^^

I instantly fell in love with my creation! I made a cold drink (there is only one size for cups) with Guava and Lychee syrup, green tea, no extra added sugar, plus aloe and tapioca!

My partner made an ambitious hot creation with banana powder, black tea, 10ml sugar, evaporated milk, and tapioca lol. That was a fun mix ^^ It turns out not that bad actually, but maybe just needs another syringe of sugar OR perhaps another test tube of white chocolate would definitely do the trick! #innerchemistcomesout lol

Congratulations again on your Grand Opening yesterday! Thank you so much for the VIP card and starting me on the stamp card. Keep up the great work :) I will be back to DIY more creations!",2018-03-05 04:14:59

Poor girl was running in and out serving tables and apologizing left and right.

Came here on two occasions both in attempt to catch Pokemons (not gonna lie) bu also wanted to stay out of people's way (i.e. crowding the streets) so found this perfectly located bar between three pokestops. Pro: they have Delerium on tap. Con: Food sucks. We ordered the popcorn chicken (a whopping $12 for a handful of popcorn chicken) and lamb skewers ($7 for 3 skewers). Both were lacking flavours - where is the 5 spice flavours? I asked for hot sauce but the waitress told me it's a dollar and I told her it's fine but her coming back with a teaspoon of Sirracha - c'mon seriously? If the food wasn't so bland, I wouldn't need hot sauce. Second time we came by, my friend wanted popcorn chicken, I advised him otherwise but he wanted it so bad. Okay, fine, he ordered it and hot sauce as well but she didn't charge him for it. But one thing in common is their popcorn chicken sucks. 

Service is also quite bad. Stood in the front for about 10-15 minutes to finally have someone greet us. Found our own table and waited another 10 minutes for water then 5 minutes for the menu. After ordering drinks, it came 15 minutes later and she said ""You're drinks are finally ready"" - uh... we ordered three bottled beer and another on tap. What were you doing? Growing the hops?

This place could have had a lot of potential. I hope they read this and fix the minor issues because it'll definitely improve in the long run. Once this Pokemon phase is over (if ever) patrons may not return knowing the quality of service and food.",2016-07-26 17:51:40

The food was blah all around - lacking flavor, spice or anything nice. I would rather go to Chipotle if forced to find Mexican in the Matthews area. 

I tried the fajita salad, the salad part was ""fine"" but the avocado ranch was really just ranch and the accoutrements (pico de gallo, guac) were bland like everything else. 

The chicken was super meh - like it was full of preservatives or something. Not a piece of fresh chicken breast like I would expect...more like fast food chicken.

The dish was served on the frying pan itself and the food stayed hot during the entire time I was there. It looks like a lot of cheese on the pictures, it's actually a quite thin layer. Fried rice was ok - a few kimchi here and there, rice fried with kimchi sauce - the overall dish was okay - not as yummy as I thought it would be and not worth the price.

It is good that they close at midnight as a lot of time we have dinner after 10pm but don't wanna eat in China Town. We like the environment of the restaurant, the food, and the service. The price is acceptable, cheaper than the Chinese restaurants in other hotels on the strip. 

We ordered a Mongolian beef, beef fried noodle and sauteed baby bak choy. They all tasted great. The Mongolian beef is really better than any other Mongolian beef I had tasted else where. The seasoning profile of this one has more depth than those using too much black pepper, garlic and soya sauce. The Mongolian beef here is really outstanding, it tasted so good without having anything overpowering, well balanced.

The sauteed baby bak choy is well done, the veggie is just right, not under or overcooked. It is not garlicy as we asked for simple sauteed, so it is simply refreshing. The baby bak  choy is fresh, and good quality, they are well cleaned too so no sandy taste when chewing on them. They smartly cut the baby bak  choy into quarters vertically so they could be thoroughly cleaned.

The beef fried noodle is good, just no surprise, which is expected. I like that they don't use the very thin yellow noodle. 

We were offered a small complimentary spicy veggie plate as appetizer. It smelled really good but too spicy for us that we kept coughing. If you can handle picy, you will like it. 

I like Chinese food having the real Chinese flavor, meaning that I always compared it with what I had tasted when I was in northern China for an exchange program. I like food having depth but not overpowering by only black pepper or garlic That means I don't like americanized Chinese food. So far, with the 3 dishes that I tried, they tasted Chinese without Americanization. There was also no MSG. I hate MSG. I always think that only those chefs who can't cook well need to use MSG. So big kudo for here not using any. I hope they won't change on this aspect in the future. I can't speak for other dishes yet, but will update in the future after I tried something new there.

Prior to leaving I checked out the menu and the reviews and decided to try something new for me, Charleston Shrimp & Grits. I'm not a southerner but it sounded worth a try. First we were greeted warmly and offered a choice between a booth and a table, we chose the table. Our server was prompt, very friendly and pleasant. I found other items of interest but stuck with my decision and ordered the Charleston Shrimp & Grit while my wife ordered the fruity waffle. After a couple of minutes the manager came to our table to inform me that they only had one grit cake left and would I like an order of grits on the side as a substitute. I told no that was fine, one was all I would have probably eaten anyway. Our dinners arrived and I was correct; I never would have finished two grit cakes. My shrimp were plentiful, tasted fresh and were delicious as was the grit cake. I probably could have done with less sauce but who's complaining? No one made me finish it. My wife loved the waffles with fresh fruit. At first she said it was too much but she did finish most of it. I tried a taste of her dish and the waffles were flavorful, light, crisp on the outside but nice and tender on the inside. When our server brought the check I saw that the manager had discounted my dinner by 50%. This was totally unexpected but appreciated nonetheless. I'm sure they'll make it back in all the good comments I make to my friends who eat out fairly regularly. The food was delicious, the service excellent and the restaurant hospitable and very clean looking.

This year they invited me to join their feast, and I happily obliged. Even though the crowd and noise was almost overwhelming, the delicious seafood tower and flavorful steaks were highlights of the meal and couldn't be hidden.

Our party of five was seated promptly at the 7 PM reservation time to a clean, classy restaurant with a vibrant atmosphere. Our server Brandon greeted us and he and his team were on top of everything throughout the meal. To start, the table indulged in the Seafood Jumbo Jackpot consisting of Maine lobster, shrimp, oysters, colossal lump crab, Jonah claws, and king crab. Everything in the tower was absolutely delicious from the sweet crab claw to the plump shrimp. The oysters were from Washington (Cold Creek, I believe) and were snatched up so quick that I only got to taste one. And the amount of lump crab meat and king crab meat alone was enough to make the $75 price tag worth it. If you're into the chilled seafood thing, I would definitely recommend the tower.

This was my first opportunity to try the filet from 7x Beef in Colorado for my entree. This beef goes beyond the standards for American wagyu by being 100% from one breed of Japanese cattle instead of the minimum 25% Japanese to be classified as American Wagyu. Could I taste the difference? Yes, it was more tender, juicy, and flavorful than its Angus cousin. My brother in law and his buddy got the Kansas City Strip and 22 oz bone-in rib eye respectively, and they both devoured their steaks.

The sides were standard, with the nice selection of earthy mushrooms being my favorite. The warm butter cake, which the entire cake was eaten by me, was an excellent finish along with a snifter of Remy Martin. There was an unusually long wait after the first course. So long, that I was too hungry to pause and take a picture of my filet. Our three course meal took right around two and a half hours. Pricing was just under a $100/person, but this was expected as we all kind of splurged to start the Christmas week.

When my food was late, granted I had a big party, but it was so late that he promised a discount. When I asked for my bill the discount was it was long and I had to inquire about it. He looked at me and was like, ""oh. Really?"" And when the credit card machine came, he took my card then walked off which was highly alarming since he shouldn't be going anywhere with my card. 

Then when he finally came back, he swore out loud when the machine didn't work then walked away again. I don't mind swearing, but I expected more professional behaviour.

Their food is very good and reasonably priced for the most part, and they have great cocktails - a lot of them. The atmosphere is very relaxed and I've only ever had wonderful service. The decor is beautiful, and the facilities very clean.

The Monday night Fried Chicken Dinner is a pretty good deal, and the veggie pairing is always on point. The food is standard American fare with good flavors and presentation. But! A warning to the vegetarians, the Windsor's offerings are frustrating. The veggie burger (made of beans and wheat) is more expensive than any of the sandwiches with only one meat, and only a few dollars less than the Crab Cake BLT (made of an animal you pull from the ocean floor with a net and send to Phoenix on a refrigerated airplane hangar; jk it's a freezer patty, but still). 

For the price, the salads are probably your best bet, or the soup and salad duo if they happen to have a veggie-friendly soup. The Veggie Stack is tempting, and it's perfectly filling, but it's expensive for what it is (pita, hummus, quinoa, veggies) and feels very much like a labored attempt at vegetarian American food. You can also play it safe getting a smattering of their admittedly great sides. 

My final word on the Windsor would be that the french fries are really very good. If you aren't a ketchup fan, they have sriracha you can mix with your ketchup, or order them with a side of sambal mayo.

tl;dr I like this place as a neighborhood happy hour spot or a chill evening over drinks. Their food is not worth it for me. I say that as someone who only rarely eats meat, but I also mean it. The french fries are good. Amen.",2015-07-29 21:35:06

I personally don't like this place as much, the foods were so-so but I can't say anything very negative about it either. I have been to this place few times, not because I crave for a good Chinese food or because I love one specific dish, but simply because there wren't many other choices around Madison. That is, when I feel like Chinese foods but don't want to go to Fugu or HK Wok. 
I prefer to go to a restaurant specialized in one type of cuisine, and I'm always confused what to order in restaurants like Nam's because they have Thai, Chinese, Viet, etc. Why would they do that? I think it's because they don't have any special dish that is their forte. For this particular place, however, always gofor the Chinese and go someplace else for Thai and Viets. The Chinese dishes are decent in general, but the Viet and Thai dishes are mostly dissapointing.

So, to end this indecisive reviews, here are my reccomendations on what to order:
Singaporean Vermicelli (is this a Chinese dish? I beg to differ), egg drop soup, congees, fried rice, tofu and vegetable hotpot,.. and.. that's all I can think of! Also, try to go for lunch, coz' it's cheaper and more worth it!",2010-03-20 03:59:01

I finally got to enter the forbidden city, only thanks to a wonderful friend who gave us guest passes. We had an early morning domestic flight, and so this lounge was perfect for us to relax after a hectic morning getting to the airport. We enjoyed the breakfast, which was a mixture of hot and cold items, such as breakfast sausages, eggs, oatmeal, yoghurt, and fruits. Standard food quality... but the fruit salad tasted weird (I think it was a day old). Anyway, the lounge was spacious. Although it was crowded, we found seats to relax in. It was quiet so we could get some work done. The people were courteous... I guess cause they were mainly business people getting their early morning flight to their next high powered meetings. A few things to mention here. First, depending on your boarding time, there are some ""rush hour"" passenger traffic. If departure times are clumped together, then there is a huge line for the elevators, and you may end up missing your flight! So, take that into consideration. Second, they ran out of newspapers! But if you like fashion or gardening, there were plenty of those magazines around. Finally, although we had guest passes, the value of the lounge is not there. I probably would not pay for the access to the lounge. You are better off saving that money and buying better food at the food court/restaurants. Anyway, safe travels people.",2015-02-25 18:23:38

The girl at the counter was very friendly and helped me pick from the huge menu.  I wanted a cold-cut sandwich as opposed to a steak or chicken, and she suggested the Tony Soprano (ham, salami, turkey, provolone, italian dressing).  It was happy hour so I got a free drink and chips.  When they brought out the sandwich my first thought was that it was HUGE...but that didn't stop me from eating the whole darn thing!  :)  That dirty sauce on the bread (which tastes like a twist on tzatziki sauce to me) was awesome.  Looking forward to trying other menu items.  I wish there was closer location to my area in NW Valley, but I'll definitely stop by whenever I make a trip to Ikea or other shopping/events in the area.  I must say that I felt it was a tad over-priced considering it was a  $10 sandwich (which normally does not include the drink and chips), but the people, atmosphere, and taste of that sandwich make it worth the visit, especially during happy hour.

As many of you may know, I do not normally give a restaurant or bar less than 3 stars. I must give this place 3 stars because their beer selection is very limited and boring. 

The lemon drop martini that I ordered was prepared pretty well, but did not blow my hair back like at some other places. 

Lastly, the food... Well, as a foodie that loves to cook and explore in the kitchen, I was underwhelmed by the tasteless dough that they use for their flatbread pizzas. I have made better pizza at home than this place. I have never had such lackluster pizza in my life; I ordered the vegetarian pizza, which they claim has garlic, spinach, onion, tomatoes, etc without the ""special topping."" I requested that the ""special topping"" be placed on the side. The pizza came out and I asked the bartender, where is the garlic, she said that the garlic is only found in the ""special topping."" The ""special topping"" consist of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. How tacky and unappealing. Where are the real pieces of garlic? Also the other veggies present were scarce and lacked in flavor as well.

I needed to wash down the nasty pizza and ordered a pumpkin pie vodka drink and that was yummy. But, no one could go wrong with this since it only consisted of pumpkin pie vodka, ice, and seltzer water.

The live jazz band made the experience tolerable but I will never good back. I was initially excited since I had never been here prior to that night.

Yikes!",2014-10-12 22:28:31

It's quite the hidden gem that you would probably miss if you blinked, because the bulk of the space is below ground level.  The entry level has a tasting bar that looks lovely (I haven't visited it specifically), but it's when you descend into the basement and get a good waft of Malbec-scented air that you feel the real magic.  The space is very large, and opposite the stairs and wine bar is a nice soundstage where they regularly feature local bands.  Barrels line the room, and yes, they are choc full of wine.  That's why you can smell it as soon as you walk through the space.  I've been here for a few Yelp events and one live music performance, and each time I'm simply transported by the atmosphere, which is romantic and intimate for being such a big room because the lighting is nice and low.  They don't sell food, so most occasions are BYO.  Occasionally they will have a vendor bring munchies in, but you'd do well to bring along some takeout or snacks if you're going to a public event.  I specify public event because they also offer private events, like the aforementioned Yelp, but are also available for engagement parties, rehearsal dinners, receptions, etc.  It's an incredible venue that I highly recommend visiting if you get the chance.",2016-11-22 15:21:33

Let's start with the food, because... obviously. I ordered Julie's Tabbouleh Falafel sandwich. Tender, perfectly made falafel folded in a warm, wheat pita with zingy tahini sauce, peppers, sprouts, tomatoes, hummus and tabbouleh salad. It had great crunch from the peppers, but was a great balance of texture and flavor. So many restaurants serve dried out pita, but this was perfect. The portion was more than enough for lunch-  they don't skimp here!

I was also pleased to have a delicious pickle spear and that they served fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea! The café is rather small, but has simple, trendy décor and colors. I loved that there was a drink station and condiments available so you could really get the best out of your meal. Everything was clean and orderly.

Now we can talk about the service! I was greeted immediately by two friendly faces. I told them it was my first time there and the man walked me through the menu and made recommendations. (Julie's Tabbouleh is a popular choice). I chatted with another girl, too, about their upcoming Yelp event!
My food was prepared expertly and quickly and they brought it right out. I was happy with the price too. I had a nice healthy, filling meal for less than $10!!

After about 2 days of deciding, we finally chose this spot since it was on our way home from work. It's your typical bar with another section designated for non smoking diners. We decided to sit on that side since it was much more quiet and we wanted to catch up over food and drinks. 

My friend orders a screwdriver, which you can't really mess up. I order a vodka (Tito's) and water with lime. I get my drink and it had a lemon instead. No biggie. I take a sip, it's ALL water. I let my friend taste it to make sure I wasn't just being a raging alcoholic since I'm used to stronger drinks. She agreed that it had almost no alcohol. Our waitress was super sweet and had the bartender add more Tito's. 

We order our food and I opt for the fish and chips with coleslaw. My friend had the salmon, which she said was good. Mine on the other hand was just eh. The fish had good texture and was moist but the breading just came right off. It was so much breading too that I just ended up with a thin strip of fish. The French fries were undercooked and soggy. The coleslaw was soggy from the beginning, probably because  it was pre-made and had way too much mayo. For dessert, we opted for bread pudding with caramel sauce. This was delicious. It was soft, but not too soggy and wet. And the caramel sauce added just the right amount of sweetness. 

The owner came around a few times to make sure that everything was well. He was this sweet older man and I appreciated the gesture. Our waitress was sweet as well, always coming by to check on us. You could tell this is a favorite spot for locals because the employees knew a lot of customers' names when they walked in.

MIA was the whipped cream. Oh how my heart sank when the server showed me that white, shiny, fire extinguisher-sized whipped cream dispenser only to discover the hard way that they were out of the stuff for the evening. 

No matter, for the trio of flavors coated with that liquefied candy bar might have been tamed too much by the inclusion of the foamy, dairy cloud. The Pittsburgh Pride, one of those flavors I knew would be amazing upon first glance, was my favorite of the three as it tasted like a frozen, goodie-filled birthday cake sans icing, containing crunchy texture and gooey, Milk Dud mouthfeel for days. The Salted Caramel was a bit understated at first, until the sea salt plugged an amplifier into the sweet caramel after it sat in my mouth and melted for a few seconds. The Apple Pie ice cream contained real chunks of caramelized apple and baked crust along with strong notes of cinnamon to awaken the palate. 

Betsy, all is forgiven, sweetheart. Just make sure you have that canister full of whipped cream at the ready when next we visit, 'cause the lady and I got ourselves another go-to for the frozen moo moo.",2014-10-14 01:35:46

Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent.  Everything Guy described and more.  The same goes for Chino Bandido in Phoenix, it's just as he described.  I tried Roberto's at the gas station that was also highlighted on DDD.  It's slightly better than Los Taquitos.  First off, Los Taquitos had no fountain soda, it was out of order. I ordered the 3 taco plate because the atmosphere was questionable.  The place wasn't as clean as I would like so I wanted to order safe.  My husband ordered the relleno plate.  My taco shells were burnt.  His relleno was soggy.  The only good part was the rice and beans.  I didn't see any chips and salsa on the menu either.  The bathroom was pretty bad too.  The floor was filthy and there was a hole in the wall that was stuffed with t.p. Don't get me wrong, I can slum it for some great authentic food but I don't see the appeal of Los Taquitos.

qy6smwygWDronMUqWfpvCA,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,OzcVyb1JudLFjZ9lfGSN3w,4,6,2,6,"My second year of Devour in the books.  My stomach is ready to pop & I've napped more in the last two days than I can ever remember.  This also marks Devour's first year at a new venue.  Devour was stationed for years at the Phoenix Art Museum.  I was among those sad to see the event move away from the Art Museum (partly because it was walking distance to my apartment, but also) because the venue was both aesthetically pleasing & contained to a relatively small intimate space.  That said, I agree with Kimber Lanning that Devour had outgrown the Art Museum.  The event needed a bigger space to accommodate more vendors, more foodie patrons, & more space for people to move around in general.  On paper, the Desert Botanical Gardens make a lot of sense as a new venue.  Its more spread out, has more parking, & the gardens themselves are one of Phoenix's most iconic venues.  So how did year one at the Gardens go?

I should note that like last year I went both Saturday & Sunday.  Just as with last year, Saturday & Sunday have a completely different lineup of food vendors (though the beer, wine, and spirits vendors are largely the same both days).  Also just as with last year, the best day in terms of the quality & selection of foods is Sunday.  Don't get me wrong, Saturday has a great selection too, but the quality of Sunday's food is best.  If you can only go one day during the weekend, go on Sunday.  And as with last year, each restaurant was offering anywhere from 1 to 4 different items to taste from.  And the food by in large is still awesome with each restaurant giving you taster sized bites in an effort to showcase what makes them great.  For the record, my three favorite dishes this year (in order) were:  1) Gallo Blanco's pancake dessert taco, 2) Clever Koi's mango duck in banana leaf and 3) Worth Takeaway's pork sandwich.

Let's point out some of the differences this year.  For starters, there were three levels of admission.  The cheapest (and the one I got) was the Taster admission for $115 per person per day.  The second level was the Conoisseiur admission which gets you into some exclusive food and beverage areas.  And the top level is the VIP admission.  Both the Conoisseiur and VIP admissions get you in an hour earlier than the Taster admission folks, but the VIP admission gets you anywhere at the event at any time.  I actually went with a couple that had VIP passes this go around.  While they certainly were able to sample items I didn't have access to, it seemed like the biggest benefit for those upper level admissions was an abundance of seating and tables for those folks.  The biggest difference however was the setup at the Gardens.  Whereas the Art Museum setup relegated the event to an enclosed courtyard & a couple of breakout rooms on the perimeter, Devour (mostly) made use of the entire Gardens park.  There were a total of ten separate zones doling out different items, but each zone had at least a few food vendors.

So how did it go?  Well, mixed.  I've seen some of the negative Yelp reviews from some of this year's Devour patrons.  While I don't agree with all of their criticisms, I think some of their critiques have a point.  Some people didn't like having to walk so much versus years past so that'll just take getting used to.  But I will say that some of the criticisms about the overcrowding in certain zones has merit.  Zone 2 at the Boppart Courtyard was too packed in.  Which is a shame because that also featured some of the state's most popular restaurants.  I realize keeping the lines moving is partly the responsibility of the vendors themselves, but next year they should cut the number of vendor booths in half at that location to leave more room to maneuver.  Additionally, there were open & available spaces at the Gardens that were largely unused.  The northwest quadrant in particular got no usage.  I understand some of the park contains sensitive horticultural areas but I saw plenty of dirt areas where booths could've easily been stationed.  Bottomline, spread the vendors more evenly throughout the park.  Lastly, trim down the number of VIP/Conoisseiur spots.  I get that Devour is an expensive event to put on & they need to make money, but the restricted access areas were almost abandoned for much of the day both days.  I'd recommend having just one VIP area & make the rest available to everyone next year.

All that said, I still highly recommend this event to anyone who loves great food, great drinks, a beautiful backdrop, & supporting local businesses.  The new location will have some kinks to work out, but so did the Art Museum location years ago.  I trust Kimber & the Local First AZ crew to get this right going forward.  This year wasn't quite as magical for me as when it was at the Art Museum in 2017, but Devour is still the ultimate bucket list culinary event for food lovers here in AZ or visiting from out of state.

First off, the oysters are awesome! My favorite was the blue point which were about $1.50. We decided to order the blue soleil ($2.50) and personally didn't care for them. The wasabi cocktail and pickled pepper & habanero sauces are great. The waffle fries were good, but I feel like i can get that at any other place, but I still ordered it. Crispy and delicious, but not sure if it was worth the price. The cavier and French toast ($19) was way overrated. I felt like the French toast was way too thick for the amount of cavier they put on there. It felt like I was just eating toast and couldn't taste the cavier. What a waste of cavier. I would have just eaten the cavier with a cracker and been happy, or a thinner piece of bread or add more cavier on it? You can get decent cavier of 10g for about $30. The blue crab and jalapeño hush puppies were okay. I love blue crab, but maybe having it hush puppy style wasn't my thing. The Pork belly kimchee was not that great. I don't eat Pork, but I ate the rice. The kimchee was really sour and from what my guests have said about the Pork belly was not that special. It was tough and chewy. Maybe dry?

The fella and I went out with some friends after work on a Friday evening, and we all managed to get there at different times. If I were the waitress, this would've seriously annoyed me, but our waitress was so nice and accommodating!  We sat on the bar side at a table, and all the doors were open since it was so nice outside.  Throw in a little reggae music and a margarita, and how can you go wrong?

We ordered the Baja Shrimp & Crab Dip and guacamole to start.  The pita for the dip is fried... YUM.  It was warm and buttery, and the guacamole was solid.  (As much as I love avocados, it's hard to focus on them when there's fried bread.)  I got the carne asada tacos for dinner.  The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned, and the peppers and onions balanced out the southwest mayo.  I wish I could tell you what everyone else got, but I was a little too focused on my own food to nicely ask how everyone else's food tasted.  Oops.

By the time we left, the place was slammed and we heard them mention a 40 minute wait.

If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. My sister and I go to wing stop often and we have never had a bad expeirence.

The wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat, served to order piping hot.  The wings are crispy, moist, and of descent size. The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious and happen to be my two of my favorites. The Hawaiian styles wing have just the right amount of tangy sweetness and parmesan cheese adds just the right finishing touch. 

What I like best about Wing Stop is that  you are allowed to Mix and match your orders. You can combine regular wings and boneless wings together. Usually, I order a combination of both.  However, bone in traditional is my favorite. I could have ate a few dozen by myself but decided I probably should share.

Everytime I go to Wing Stop I order the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily. The fries are crispy and golden brown and very tasty.  My sister isnt a fan of fries but enjoys the homemade potato salad, and fresh baked rolls. The rolls are fresh, hot, buttery, and absolutely delicious.

The first time, pretty much everything was perfect. They had a delicious scallop special that was right up my alley and kept me stuffed for HOURS. The only downside was the hummus appetizer my friend and I split--I thought it was pretty good. Some nice roasted red pepper flavors and some unique zing, but it was a way to spicy for her. Might be useful to indicate on the menu that it's spicy because while I thought it was tasty, it was definitely very different from what I was expecting.

The second time was... less excellent. The server was still very nice but service was very slow and the restaurant was totally out of bread. Every type of bread. Hamburger buns, rolls, sandwich stuff, you name it. Which meant we didn't get bread as a nibble when we were seated and half of the food was no longer an option. I understand that their delivery truck was late, but Heinen's is right down the road. How can you seriously be out of bread? My pizza was good--a little oily--but good. I just wish they had had bread!

For being mostly an Akron based chain, Swensons should definitely enter into contention. The bun is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The patty is not enormous, but packs a lot of flavor, similar to Shake Shack and In N Out. What makes Swensons' Galley Boy different from the other two, though, is their sauce - Swensons special sauce is a combination of tartar and barbecue sauce (as far as I can tell), yet has its own uniqueness to it. In a world where most ""special sauces"" are just some variation of thousand island dressing, Swensons puts a unique spin on things.

I paid $22 for 6 cupcakes.  If I wasn't out of town for a week, I would have brought them back and asked for a refund.  I think it says a lot when you have a dinner party and still have 5 of 6 cupcakes left over at the end of the night.

The cake portion wasn't as good as a box cake mix.  I can't remember the time I've had a (cup)cake that was that lackluster.  It wasn't notably moist, didn't have a distinct texture, and most importantly had zero flavor.  I ordered 3 different varieties and all tasted exactly the same.

The frosting was equally disappointing.  Again, none had much flavor other than ""sweet.""  Truly, funfetti icing tastes far better.

Although taste is most important, I also feel the presentation was lacking quite a bit for cupcakes that cost nearly $4 a piece.  There was no design, the frosting was kind of just thrown on top, nothing fancy in terms of bags or boxes... and what I thought was kind of funny... each cupcake had this hand-made, tacky sign stuck into it (think piece of scrap paper, hand-written flavor, taped to a tooth pick - tacky grandma's house style).

My parents are frequent eaters here aka they never miss the perk of eating here for free on their birthdays. Where else would my mom plan my dad's big 65th birthday celebration?  Why here of course!  My mom made a reservation for 25 at 11:30 am on a Saturday morning.  I decided (as did everyone else) to forego breakfast.  OBVIOUSLY.  But seriously, ew to having such a heavy meals(sss) so damn early.

I totally forgot to take any pictures of my plates and the restaurant.  The restaurant is huge by the way and surprisingly really busy already at 11:30am. I had no idea what I was doing with the stir-fry section but luckily my friend had been before, so I followed her lead.  You basically load your plate with all sorts of raw items and give it to the chefs at the stir-fry station.  You then pick a sauce and they toss it all together for you. Simple!  They do this all in like 5 minutes so I never saw huge line-ups.  I got the black bean sauce, which is usually what I like in restaurants.  It was pretty good.  I wish I got more stir-fry but I didn't want to fill up on it.  I then got a plate of green beans, bbq pork, beef stew, general tao chicken and a piece of ""bbq"" chicken.  Vito everything except the beef stew. Ugh, I'm regretting it now.  I should've got a whole plate of beef stew with white rice.  Dammit.  The beef was so tender and full of flavour.  Think beef brisket. Oh god, yes. Anyways, I wasn't too interested with any of the dessert.  I'm glad they had an assortment of ice cream flavours and they even had my fave, cappuccino!  I would've liked to get a waffle while it was piping hot, but they stock pile them under a heating lamp.  Carrot cake was dryer than cardboard so avoid this.  Japanese strawberry cheesecake was no uncle tetsu's, but edible.

I'd never come here on my own terms but I wouldn't mind if I had to come for a party.  This place is just whatever.  OH, before I forget to mention, I do love that they have a fridge of unlimited spring water.  *thumbs up",2017-01-16 16:55:36

I ordered the wedding soup to start. It took awhile for it to come but I was very pleased with it. It was wedding soup but the flavor took it to another level. There were small meatballs, bits of chicken, tiny pasta, spinach and a few other things. It was hearty. 
I shared the Beans and Greens appetizer with friends. It had white beans and greens and they were delicious. There was a bit of heat which added even more to the dish. Once we were eating it there was not one bean or green left. 
For my entree I ordered the Meatball dish served with herbed pasta. It's one of the dishes they are known for. When it was served it was 3 huge meatballs with a small nest of pasta in the center. The meatballs were some of the best I have ever had. They are house made and I would love to know the ingredients. The meatballs had a lot of flavor melded together. I didn't have much expectation for the pasta but I was completely surprised. It was fresh made with a very light Alfredo type sauce with fresh herbs on top. There were several layers of flavor. They were delicious by themselves. I could have had just the pasta and I would have been happy.  
The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service wasn't up to par. Our server was nice but there would be long periods of time between check ins. 
We will definitely go back to try more dishes. One of my friends got Chicken Marsala and raved about how good it was. One of my other friends had a veal dish and she couldn't say enough about how much she enjoyed it. It ALL looked fabulous.",2015-10-09 16:52:24

The fish is reasonably fresh here, and you get a good variety/amount in some of the combo sushi/sashimi plates. This more of a take-out place-only two tables and sushi is their specialty althought there are a few cooked items on their menu. I had the sashimi plate-good cuts of fish, about 20 pieces for 17.95. Also tried the dragon roll-very tasty and tightly rolled. I would stick with the sashmi or maki as a personal preference because the sushi rice can be a little mushy sometimes.

But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. 
In regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment.

Used books, movies, games, etc brought in by fellow book, movie, and game lovers so you can then purchase them at a lower price. Its the execution that needs a lot of work. I used to come in here a lot. And two years ago I probably would have rated it a lot higher than I am rating it today. I heard about this place from a family member and how you can bring in books you don't want anymore and get either store credit or cash. OMG! That is the best idea ever. Getting rid of something you don't want and then picking something out that you do! What a concept! I did this I think three or four times a few years back and was always happy with the return from books I had. I would check out the store while they were evaluating my selection and then come back with a handful of new books to buy after they told me what they would give me for mine. 

The last time I came in here I brought in easily $100 worth of brand new cookbooks that I don't use anymore since becoming vegetarian. They were new cookbooks so I thought I was going to get a great deal. They wanted almost all of them, and then wanted to give me $4. Yes... $4. Umm... are these people on crack?!!? So I said, hell no and walked out with my books and then went and sold them on Amazon for almost $75. 

The selection in this store is also really crappy. I looked at the cookbook section the last time I was in here, and I had never even heard of most of the books they had here. And trust me, I know what I am talking about. I am the girl you see in Barnes and Noble sitting in the cookbook section for four hours on the weekends.

She was condescending and rude toward our table. She essentially treated us as kids.

Because the server's performance at the front will overall affect the restaurant's reputation. 

She promised to provide us the menu of the tasting menu, however after multiple follow ups, it has been more than 1 month and no menu provided. 

The bill & payment issue was a mess. For example: the bill was $100, my friend paid $150 cash. The server gave my friend $150 with the $50 bill broken down... How does that even make any sense? She explained that she didn't want to assume tips.

My dining  partner and I decided to share four appetizers to get the full Terra experience. Our meal began with complimentary bruschetta which was the freshest bruschetta I have ever tasted. I can not even put my finger on what made it so amazing but I wanted ten more. The bread was crusty and fairly standard. I had a great dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (sigh) and my dining partner was recommended a glass of wine which surprising was only $9 when the check came. Not bad for such a ritzy place.

Very smoky and decadent. The smokey flavor of the duck breast was a bit much for me but he loved it. We also shared:

Large and varied- some soft, others semi-soft. Olives, pickles- etc.

This is Charlotte's second Smashburger. The first is out in the Stonecrest Shopping Center in Ballantyne. So excited to have one near me. 

My current favorite burger is the truffle mushroom swiss. The barbecue, bacon and cheddar bacon a close second. There is even a regional burger: the Carolina chili. Warning: get extra napkins. You can also create your own burger and have the option to pick whichever bun style you want on existing menu items.

Don't do burgers? Get a chicken sandwich. They smash those, too!! The spinach, cucumber, goat cheese and the avocado club are both delicious. Refuse to eat something that use to have a face? Go with the avocado ranch black bean burger. Interesting texture and flavor. The salads are HUGE. 

I recommend going here with a friend(s) so you can share sides. The smashfries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. You can't go wrong with that. Haystick onions are delicious. SECRET MENU SIDE ITEM ALERT: fried pickles.

I had visited one time before for an event, but this was my first ""sit down"" meal at the restaurant. We had a 9:00 reservation and were seated right away at arrival. 

The dining room is modern and unique, with a nice bar, some loungy couch seating beside some wingback chairs and coffee tables, and a typical dining area. The chairs are mismatched which would usually drive me nuts but worked in the space. The chandeliers are rope-y (presumably as a nod to the Southwest) The music was loud when we arrived but chilled out a bit once the DJ started at 10 - this surprised me! The crowd was pretty eclectic, running the gamut from a group of bachelorettes (Who couldn't seem to stay seated at their table) to a dinner party of septegenarians in expensive pantsuits. 

Our server stopped by pretty promptly to take our drink order, and a runner brought our drinks to the table shortly thereafter - he set them down along with an order of their Cheese Puffers (they reminded me a bit of the Cheesy biscuits at Red Lobster, which might seem like a backhanded compliment but seriously, those are the only things that can get me into a Red Lobster, and they a freaking addictive, so it is actually high praise) 

Then... we didn't see our server for awhile. Like, at all. Nowhere to be seen in the whole dining room. It got to a point where I began to get anxious when Matteo, a floor manager, popped by the table to check in and make sure that everything was good. I briefly mentioned that we were just waiting for our server to come to take our order and he immediately apologized and offered to go ahead and take the order from us. He was kind and hospitable and got us completely taken care of - I mentioned that we planned to order several appetizers ""tapas style"" and he handled that with aplomb, suggesting that since our table was so small, he would course out the items to leave us enough space to dine. This was a perfect solution and was greatly appreciated. 

We ordered a variety of items:
Steak Tartare with Taro Chips and Quail Egg - YUM! Super flavorful and a perfect portion size. It was a bit on the salty side, but I think that this just enhanced the beef instead of overpowering it. 
Bacon + Eggs - Pork Belly, toast, and a perfectly poached egg... this was really good! I love me some breakfast for dinner, so this was my kind of dish. 
Farmbird Meatballs with Snake Bite Sauce and Blue Cheese Fondue - I had these on my first visit and they're what brought me back - amazing! Their version of Buffalo chicken, the combination of flavors is just perfect. The sauce on the meatballs definitely has a kick which is perfectly neutralized by the blue cheese fondue. The portion is nice - 5 good sized meatballs. Tons of flavor - absolutely recommend these.
Chicken + Waffle - yet more breakfast for dinner, just my style! Nice combo of salty/sweet. The chicken was moist, the waffle was tasty. 

Dessert - We shared the King sundae, which included peanutbutter cup icecream, bacon caramel, whipped cream, and bruleed bananas. Hubby was in seventh heaven. 

The service during the remainder of our meal was perfectly timed - the runner who took care of our drinks was well spoken and attentive and our server checked in with us a few times to be sure all was good.

The flavor profile of the apple and parsnip soup with julienned pear covered with crispy bacon was truly divine. Needless to say, it was devoured within seconds. 

The #24 Salad must be sent by the Herbivore God.  The amazingly competent dish is comprised of the following: buckwheat soba noodles tossed with sesame oil, toasted unsweetened coconut, black sesame seeds, pickled daïkon and carrots, fried shallots, roasted marinated tofu, fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro), peas, fenugreek sprouts, red cabbage, cucumber, strips of kale, mixed sprouted beans, and mix seeds and nuts (small pieces of roasted unsalted cashew).

The equally marvelous dressing consisted of rice wine vinegar, fresh ginger, organic cashew butter, some spicy chili sauce, sautéed onion, garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, fresh coriander and fresh lime juice.

Today, 3 members of my group had to wait a whole 2 minutes because the other 2 people in the party hadn't arrived yet. Then, when we (the late arrivers, by 2 minutes) finally showed up, we were immediately given a booth. I thought this place was supposed to be good. So good that you had to wait for seating. Well, with the opening of the Champaign location, the Urbana location is now sort of a forgotten wasteland (I guess like the rest of Urbana). 
We were immediately informed that they were out of Burnt Ends. WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIVING?!?!? Did you know you can get a burnt ends burrito on Thursdays? WELL TODAY YOU COULDN'T!!  Had to settle for the regular delicious pulled pork burrito. As did 2 others in the group. Another ordered a burger (people, don't you know you are only supposed to order a burger when ALL the other menu items are 86'd) and another got a brisket sandwich. 
I ordered a mountain dew, while another person at the table started hitting on me. He called me Sweetie. Which apparently was a mistake on my part when I started rubbing his leg and he informed me that actually he had ordered ""sweet tea"". Oops. 
The food came out very quickly. I didn't even have time to complain about not having the time to eat my burnt ends appetizer which I didn't get to order. Oh, we got there at 11:30, they had been open for 30 minutes and didn't have burnt ends. I blame the guys that were sitting at the table closest to the bar! There were 4 of them and 3 of them smugly ate those delicious burnt ends as we sat there, envious, with only a pulled pork burrito to fill the void that was left by not having burnt ends. 
They had the chex mix today. Which is a first, because in all the other times I've been there, there was no chex mix. But today there was. I would sacrifice all the chex mix in the world for just one more chance at a burnt ends appetizer. 
The price was reasonable. My bill (which was presented on one of those new fangled tablet pc thingies) was 13. Which covered the burrito, a side of the potato salad, and the soda. I don't consider that excessive. 
The staff was (and always is) friendly. Except for that guy with a beard and a Mohawk, what kind of an idiot would have that kind of look. He wasn't there today.

They're usually pretty much on point but my most recent visit was a real bummer. 

I detest the drive thru because it seems to be the dumping ground for cold fries and incorrect sandwich orders.

Sadly, my experience last week fell along these lines.

I ordered a double filet meal without tartar sauce and another meal for my daughter.

It's a good thing I checked my purchase before I exited the parking lot. The double filet I paid for had morphed into a single filet with no cheese.

Which meant I had to get out of my car and go into the place, defeating the purpose of the drive thru and pretty much ensuring cold fries by the time I reached my destination.

The only thing that could have ticked me off more would have been to find the single filet upon arriving home.

So I went in with the filet AND the fries and asked for hot fries to accompany my new sandwich. While I waited, I observed the workers. 

I saw one young lady accidentally knock a bag (from the stack of new bags), onto the floor. 

When I saw her pick it up and place it back on top of the clean bags (Can anyone say ""cross contamination""?), I called a manager over and told him.

He was curt but he found the offending bag and put it in the trash.

However, the bag beneath it should have been tossed as well because the bag that had fallen on the floor was placed dirty side down onto it.

And in keeping with my notion of good sanitation, both people who touched the dirty bag should have washed their hands after.

To her credit, another manager asked what was going on and she reprimanded the young lady firmly but nicely.

But still, I didn't see anyone wash their hands.

I had the ~$16 burger which pales in comparison to the much pricier options of steak, etc. But for an 'expensive' burger it was well worth the ambience, service, portion size and taste.

For starters, the establishment is really nice and very clean. It seemed as if the employees were always active and cleaning as they moved around the restaurant.  It took me a few minutes to acclimate myself with the menu but the with some assistance from the employee at the register I made the right decision for my dinner. I ended up choosing the surf and turf burrito for myself and a happy hour taco for my son and a 2 taco plate for my fiancé. The burrito was big, along with the shrimp in it. The steak in the burrito was tasty too. My son skipped the taco because he was full on candy but my fiancé couldn't say enough good things about the 2 taco plate. One thing I wanted to highlight again is that employees are very friendly and extra helpful for the indecisive like me. They took their time out to greet me and explain the menu. And it made my visit easy and enjoyable. I'll visit one more time before giving a 5th star! Keep up the great work. We'll see you soon",2018-04-18 06:27:40

I'll start out by saying that this place is pretty clean and visually appealing. There's an abundance of booths and they can also accommodate large groups. I came here with a party of 10 and we were very comfortably seated in the restaurant. 

Now, onto the deal breaker: the food. The AYCE menu was pretty deep- so much so that it was almost very overwhelming. I do like a lot of choices, but not too many that I'm spending about 15 minutes trying to decide what I should get. Here's where they failed to deliver:
-The rolls were very loosely packed and kept falling apart 
-The rice was still a little too warm to be served on a cold piece of fish 
-They ran out of tuna and failed to say anything to us until we kept asking about our order of tuna sashimi
-The amount of avocado used to compensate for the very small amount of fish in a roll was massive (and mushy)
I did, however, enjoy the tai very much. It seemed to be the freshest of all the fish that we ordered that day.

The service here was alright. I have no complaints, but I don't have any major compliments either.

For one thing, the quality of their ingredients is suspect right from the beginning.  The shredded lettuce that they use was soggy and limp and slightly yellow, the tomato was discolored and had to be dissected and removed from my burger.  The condiments are all off-brand.  The fries seemed not done enough and lukewarm on my first visit, overdone and solid pieces of molten rock the second time.

That being said, my new discovery at Malee's is Chef Hot, which is double Thai hot. WOW. Talk about eye-watering satisfaction. I tried it with the crispy basil chicken, but I think next time I'll try it with something that has more of a sauce--like the red curry (Arizona Heatwave). 

I've tried the drunken dragon noodles, the aforementioned Arizona heatwave and crispy basil chicken, the roasted duck, the beef-with-some-sort-of-garlic sauce, and the Thai chow mein. My favorite is the crispy basil chicken, but the red curry is the best I've had. It's got a subtle smokiness I just love.

Malee's takes reservations, which is great for the weekends and crowds. I usually for with at least four other people for dinner, so I definitely give Malee's a holler before.

i HEART this place!!! it is AWESOME!!! 

I had my reservations with the crazy, colorful decor... but after i stepped inside i learned to quickly appreciate how nice, modern, and unique it was ....and classy too! Not to mention most of the food was OoO soo goood!! 

You def have to make reservations to eat here on the weekends! 
The staff is pretty attentive.  When you walk in, they're waiting along the sidelines, greeting you!  

They serve you bread -- a basket with jalapeno cheddar, cornbread muffin, and raisin bread... soo yummy! beware, and don't get full off the bread!

We tried the prix fix menu that came with the:

*APPETIZER: Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - This was addictingly good.  The corn cilantro sauce complemented the tamale really well.  The shrimp & tamale together was pretty flavorful.

*ENTREE: New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin w/ bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale - I don't know why, but this dish didn't impress me.  Nice presentation.  The pork was really tender, and had the chile sauce flavor to it... but the dish lacked any kick to it.  It also wasn't served very hot. The tamale was good though!

*DESERT: Profiteroles Cornflake Crunch Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Warm Mexican chocolate sauce - Unimpressive.  It came with cream puffs, that did not taste very fresh.  As for the warm chocolate sauce, I'm not sure how that can be called warm? It was pretty cold to me.

Also tried the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla appetizer with white bean hummus and white truffle oil.  This wasn't very good to me either.  The waiter said it wasn't very oily compared to other quesadillas since it wasn't fried, but it still seemed pretty greasy to me.

The 5 STARS comes when you try the GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS w/ cranberry roasted jalapeno sauce, pumpkin tamale, and all spice butter.  This was DELICIOUS!! The lamb chops were very tender and cooked to order. The dark cranberry sauce complemented the lamb extremely well.  The flavor of the sauce filled with cranberries provided a great contrast to the warm pumpkin tamale... YUM!!!

I came here to order a cake for delivery to my husband's office for his birthday.  I was greeted with smiles and the girl helped me through all the details of choosing my cake, giving me much appreciated suggestions along the way (flavor, decorations, size, etc.)  I told her I'd never had one before and she suggested I try a sample.  They had marble with their signature frosting and it was delicious!  So moist and the cream cheese frosting was heavenly!  I decided to take home two bundtlets (marble & red velvet - 3.99 a piece) to enjoy for dessert!  

The service and product are absolutely incredible and the shop's decor is so pretty.  But I subtracted a star for price.  The cakes are costly but they are so good they might just be worth the pretty penny they sell for.  It cost me an arm and a leg to have the cake delivered five miles (15 bucks).  I could have shipped a Junior's cheesecake from NY for less than that, lol.  But just knowing how much it'll make my hubby smile when he receives it was worth it (and I know his coworkers will get to enjoy it too!).  

If your mouth is watering just reading about this cake now then... good, it should be!  And if you're all, ""I want to try it but what am I going to do with a whole cake?"" then fear not!  They have bundtinis (bite sized bundts) and bundtlets (single serve bundts).  Also, don't be afraid to take some home for later in the week - the girl told me they stay moist and fresh for 5 days.

Picanha Steak Truck is a new truck from the owner of the Street Dogs truck. I saw him multiple times at Great American Foodie Fest and spoke with him briefly, and I also noticed him at Sunset Park'd yesterday. Bearing in mind that the old Venezuelan street food truck was one of my favorite food trucks and that pretty much none of the items survived their rebranding, I had huge expectations.

The menu is simple: unless you want the shrimp option for some dishes, you're going to be eating a Brazilian-named cut of beef, which is available in 4 levels of cooking temperature from rare all the way to ""f***ing ruined,"" a colorful sentiment with which most meat lovers can surely agree. The options include sandwich, plate, and salad, but I went with...

Tacos ($10 for 3): easily shared with friends. The medium-rare beef is tender but doesn't compare in flavor to the picanha cut at Brazilian BBQ restaurants. I suppose the veggies and green sauce were fine, but nothing special either. I'm tired of seeing tortillas not treated in any way by food trucks when any hole in the wall taqueria cooks them in oil, and those tortillas are here again. The upside is that the price is pretty good for a food truck.

Fried Green Plantains ($5): nothing like the sweet plantains found in Venezuelan cuisine. They were crispy outside and soft inside, and minimal or no batter was needed for that texture, but it was hard to detect any plantain flavor. I think they needed to salt the mashed plantains before and not after cooking. The sauce contributed nothing and I had to go back for Sriracha and ketchup, both of which add more flavor.

I may try Picanha Steak Truck's sandwiches or plates, but only if I see them at another local food truck gathering or if they otherwise come to Henderson again. For now, it looks like the magic is gone and the bird is dead.",2016-11-13 17:57:35

I'm not saying that this is best gelato that I ever had, but it's pretty good.  One thing about gelato's is how every restaurant presents it.  All the nice beautiful flavors stuck behind glass.  You might not be in the mood for gelato and end up buying scoop anyway.  Well, that's exactly what I did. Every time I come here, I see nothing but huge lines.  To my surprise, zero people in line. I wasn't in the mood, but didn't want to lose my chance at Cocolini's gelato with no line.  Or, that's just my excuse to break my diet.  

On my visit to Rome years ago, I was once given a tip to always get two flavors that are on the complete opposite taste from each other.  For an example, get a light flavor combined with a very bold flavor.  And when you eat it, taste the stronger flavor first followed by the lighter flavor.  Wow..no wonder everyone loves gelato.  There's actually a way to eat it.  I usually do this, but didn't on this visit. I wanted something light combined with something lighter.  So, I ended up with their caramel sea salt and butter pecan.  Both were good, but to be honest, I regret not doing the strong flavor with the light flavor suggestion.

We ordered Deep Fried Turkey Legs and it was pretty good as the meat was tender and juicy. Our next appetizer was Peking Duck Bun, I would say this was my favorite dish with everything we ordered. The bun was soft which it should be, the sauce that came with dipped with the bun and the meat brought out the flavor and was so tasteful. The next three dishes we ordered were Kimchi Fried Rice, some Ramen Soup, and Chicken Katsu (spelling??) they were all too blend. I usually eat pretty blend but these have no flavor. For Kimchi Fried Rice I didn't taste any Kimchi flavor. The soup for the Ramen was just soy sauce and water no soup base.

PlayLV gaming did a good job of hiring pleasant dealers, but they need to upgrade the cocktail girls.    I wasn't too happy with them, but there still learning the curve so I'm letting them off the hook on this visit.

As far as table games, the usual blackjack, craps, liberal 21, roulette, and I'm not sure on Pai Gow, but it could be there.

The sportsbook didn't change much, but Lucky sportsbook usually have pretty good odds. 

The catch to this casino will be it restaurants which are opening on Wednesday.   One of them is Hash House a GoGo, and the other is a Las Vegas Hawaiian favorite, Island Sushi and deli; both of these restaurants have a very good following with the local crowd in Las Vegas, and if they serve the same amount of food as the other locations....this casino doesn't need a buffet, but extra take out boxes.    Hash house is known for  huge size plates, and and Island Sushi is known for that too, but also known for their Sunday made to order AYCE brunch.     I have a feeling the guest over at California Hotel will make their way to this Hotel on Sunday morning and early afternoons.      There is a Subway in operation next the lobby, but that's just subway.

For downtown, the Casino area isn't up to the level of the Golden Nugget, but I have a feeling the Plaza's hotel room many exceed the Golden Nugget because of upgrades from Fountainblu.    I only seen the picture of the rooms, so I can't really tell you if it's a fact on that statement, but from what I'm hearing about rack price for each room, that's catch for the plaza. 

I only hope the owners and management can promote this hotel, and start at the grassroot levels of making into something special; that way  we can be proud say this hotel is the picture of downtown Las Vegas.",2011-08-29 07:26:41

Made a reservation on 5/31/17 at 7:45 PM for two weeks in advance and specifically requested a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains to celebrate our anniversary. There's no point in going to this restaurant and paying the upcharge on their steaks that you can get at other steakhouses as the only distinct thing about it is the view of the fountains.

Take a wild guess what happened.

We arrived and were seated in the back of the restaurant.

When I mentioned it to the server, I was told this table was ""just as good."" Requested to speak to a manager and was assured we would be moved to the first available table with a view. I watched as a table came and went as another party with a later reservation was seated ahead of us.

Be aware: based on observations and if you read the other negative reviews of this restaurant, you'll notice a racial trend about which parties Prime accommodates with views of the Bellagio fountain and which they shove in the back of the restaurant. If you're a POC or appear young, you'll have a very tough time convincing the staff that your request and your money hold just as much value as someone who looks like a 50+ WASP banker from the Hamptons.

They give you a number that you take to your table, then deliver the food a short while later (came out fast).

Bae enjoyed the meats, saying they were a-ok but nothing to write home about (ie not the best he'd ever had). I love love love mac n cheese and found this version to be sort of bland. Felt like it needed salt? Beans were good but our batch was super spicy and I don't mind heat. For the coleslaw, they do a vinegar based version.

This review is long overdue, but I needed to stress this is not a place to go if you want high end tea service.

My group expected great service and amazing food because of the location inside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, but was very disappointed as it failed to deliver for a reputable luxury establishment.

The decor was very modern and relaxed, like you were at a friend's livingroom which was nice.  Plus they even had a lovely fireplace in the main room.  Service  was friendly, but was very slow  despite not being very  busy and at times service was non-existent.   We were waiting for a friend who was late for our 2pm reservation, but in the end couldn't make it after we waited for 35-40 minutes.

During the wait, the server didn't offer us the tea selection, but only water.  And then, to our surprise the server said they had to charge the amount for our friend not showing up because they had ""pre-made"" the food. 

The tea selections from Sloan Fine Tea Merchants was displayed in a nice wooden box and the server explained the various popular teas, then left for about 10 minutes before returning to take our tea selections.  To our dismay, the tea took another 20-25 minutes to be served to us.  

The mini quiches came out before our teas and what a disappointment because it was not even served lukewarm, but we were all very hungry and just ate it as is. 

Next was the savoury selection which was presented nicely on a unique tiered serving display, but we were very disappointed with all the sandwiches.  There was definitely a good selection of  assorted sandwiches, but all the bread was crusty and stale tasting, plus all the fillings and toppings were bland tasting. We were all hungry so just ate the sandwiches, but not all of us finished every sandwich.  

When the server said pre-made, when exactly was it made?  Even if it was the morning or night before the bread shouldn't have been this crunchy.  Even the 5 year old in our party said it was awful and didn't finish her portion.  She had the classic tea selection like the rest of us which was served on an individual platter for her. 

The sweet selection was a lot better as it was tasty and had a great variety of different pastries and mini desserts.  The sweets were not overly sweet that you had to take several sips of tea.  For the most part the sweets were definitely more enjoyable than the savoury selection. Bonus for the unique display than the ordinary tiered platter service.

The scones were edible to our surprise because it was fluffy and buttery in texture.  We wondered if this was even made in house or bought at the local bakery.  Jams and clotted cream that accompanied the scones were a delight and enhanced the flavour of the scones.

During the tea service, I had to ask the server for a hot water refill for the teapot which was complied, but the rest of my party were not asked if they needed a hot water refill. The server left rather quickly before we can even tell her, but we definitely asked when she returned.

For tea service this was highly unacceptable to our liking because the whole premise of afternoon tea is actually having tea readily available.  I guess we were used to other afternoon tea services where the servers automatically comes with hot water to refill the teapots or at least offer if we needed more hot water on several occasions. 

Overall, it was definitely not a very enjoyable afternoon tea experience, so my advice is save the $40 and go elsewhere.  Many other places in the area that offers better afternoon tea service.

Note:  The server was definitely quick to produce the bill when we asked for it.",2015-03-05 17:23:20

After looking around, I ended up sitting in the bar area, since that's where all of the patrons were hanging out.  I debated about sitting at a table, but realized that I'd probably get faster service by sitting at the bar.  It seemed to be a pretty happening place for lunchtime--roughly 12 people and one friendly bartender.  The majority of the patrons were playing on the video poker/blackjack machines, drinking, smoking, or watching tv, while there was only one other person eating something. 

It took me a few minutes to figure out what to get, but I finally decided to go with the fish tacos.  They were three tiny ones, made of cod, with a salsa and other sauce drizzled on top, sitting on a bed of greens and flour tortillas.  Pretty tasty and the sauce wasn't too overpowering and they seemed to put just the right amount on the tacos.  Next time, though, I'm gonna have to get the steak or ceviche...decisions, decisions.  To be honest, for the prices that they offered and the selection/variety (given the type of establishment), I was pretty impressed.

I've yet to find a place that bears any resemblance to Cheers (""where everybody knows your name""), and this place seems to be it.  I think that I was one of two people that the bartender didn't know on a first-name basis.  There are quite a few regulars that come here, and I must say that if I find myself in the area again, I'm definitely willing to try out more of their menu.  

The only reason that I had to deduct a star was due to the service.  I would have given this place 3.5 stars, but unfortunately can't give a 1/2 star, so I rounded up.  Yes, I realize that I didn't walk into a restaurant (it's a bar/pub), but then again I do appreciate good service--not being ignored and attentiveness.",2011-12-01 05:53:04

Alas, if you find yourself christened as a Vegas local and in a a car accident, you need to get yourself situated. Billboards of lawyers, tons of chiropractors, insurance companies confusing you - it's hard to know who to trust. 

After I was involved in a car accident, urgent care said they could not see me and had to refer me out. They had a list of ""Core Rehab"" facilities they recommended - Southern NV Chiropractic being one of them. I was hesitant to go to anyone, but then my husband's colleague also recommended this office as a trustworthy place. Scheduling a same-day appointment was easy. Dr. Reiss isn't practicing as much as he used to (although I was adjusted by him once, he was great!), so Dr. Perl was taking care of me. Dr. Perl was personable and a professional at all times. She took time to get to know me on a personal level, as did her wonderful staff, and I truly felt taken care of. My regular adjustments really helped me get back into feeling like my normal self post-accident. Billing and handling the insurance claim was also easy and painless after my treatments concluded. Their facility is much cleaner and equipment much newer compared to other offices I have been to. The office staff is very friendly and patient, especially with the kids who just won't sit still. Please do them a favor and keep your own kids in check during your visits, they aren't babysitters.

First, had two rooms reserved - one with a king for wife and I and one with two doubles for our teenage boys.  At check on they put us in two king rooms.  They claimed that was what our reservation was for so our fault and that they were sold out of doubles so couldn't change it.  My suspicion: just oversold the doubles and screw you to whoever checks in later in the day.  Not real excited about that but they assured us if the king didn't work for us they'd bring up a roll away.  King didn't work for my teenage boys so when we called down for a roll away - NOPE. against fire code we were told.  What could they do for us to fix the situation - we could move to the presidential suite for $2700.  I don't know if the woman on the phone was being serious or trying to be funny, but what an obnoxious response.  We ended up having extra bedding brought up and one of my kids slept in the chair.   So it was a very disappointing start to the stay. 

Second, rooms are very modern, which is fine.  But the shower in our Spectacular King room had a translucent window in it with no window cover.  That would have been fine if there was a bathroom door - but there wasn't.  Just a couple sliding panels with translucent windows in them.  The shower door was a big piece of translucent glass that lit up quite brightly starting at sunrise.  So much for a nice dark room and sleeping in late on a Sunday morning. It was like a floor to ceiling night light glowing blue starting at dawn. See picture below.  This was January so sunrise was later in the morning but I couldn't imagine it with a 5:00 am sunrise in June. That would really suck.  

The highlight of the hotel was the million dollar cars in the entry driveway for a DuPont Registry party that was there Friday night. We were there Barrett Jackson weekend which was the reason for the cars and party. 

The pool was nice.  Pool food and service was good.  Pool view is of an electrical substation which is oddly ugly for such a ""high class"" hotel.  The hotel lobby and public spaces were nice. The lobby bar had live music on Saturday night which was nice. The front desk staff was worthless. 

The only reason I would consider recommending this hotel would be for someone who really really (I mean REALLY) wants to be in walking distance access to downtown Scottsdale nightlife. Otherwise I would recommend the Phoenician, Royal Palms or Sanctuary on Camelback for actual class and sophistication or Westin Kierland for a hotel with dining and shopping within walking distance over this hotel to anyone visiting the Scottsdale area. 

I am giving it two stars not because it is a two star hotel-obviously it isn't. I'm giving it two stars because it fell so far short of it what pretends to be, so far short of what a guest should be able to expect from it, for the attitude we received from the front desk staff and my overall guest experience.",2015-01-19 18:08:29

I thought that it would be perfect to do my 100th review Anthony Bourdain style. I came here with a few of my favorite yelp-izzles. LiLy D, Elnino F, and Angela H made this dinner hella damn fun!

Our server Michael, was awesome. He had the specials memorized and kept us entertained with jokes throughout the night.

What I ordered:

Salmon Rillettes $17.50
Steak Frites $36.50
Sauteed Spinach $7.50
1 Bottle of Cabernet - France 2007 $48

There are no bread plates, so you just eat off the table. The bread comes out warm and was very good. They also give you some warm pistachios. 

The Salmon Rillettes were my favorite dish of the night. It is fresh & smoked salmon served with toasted croutons. I think LiLy might have liked that dish more than me. I also had some of LiLy's Onion Soup and I like that too. I have a bite of Elnino's Endive Salad. 

The Steak Frites was cooked to perfection. It is a pan-seared prime flatiron steak with caramelized shallots, maitre d'hotel butter & french fries. I originally asked for my steak cooked rare, but changed it to medium-rare as suggested by our server. Great suggestion Michael! The Sauteed Spinach was good too. I had a few pieces of LiLy's lamb. It was a little salty, but still good. I had a piece of Elnino's scallop, which was yummy. I also had a bite of Angela's chicken, which was also yummy!

The wine was a good choice. Nice pick LiLy!!

The food is decent... mostly standard pub-fare. I say skip the menu and go on Monday nights for Kegs & Legs.

Two important notes: Make a reservation and be sure to make it early. It does fill up quickly. Wait times can be an excess over an hour.

One negative of this place is the parking situation. Kennedy's lot is tiny. The neighboring lots all threaten to tow. Truth or empty threat? I'm not sure. I've parked in several of them and survived, so I would say park at your own risk.

-Super fast security line. Every time. To the point where I get to the airport only an hour before my flight and never once break a sweat.
-Plenty of nearby parking with options to get you right to the terminal (Brookpark RTA station, anyone?)
-Free wifI (if you're lucky...)
-Decent food court options for the size of the airport

Cons:
-Terminals can be a bit of a walk, and by that I mean terminal D. Not really more than other airports, I suppose, but I guess I've gotten spoiled!
-Wifi is spotty, often have trouble connecting
-Under going renovations

Since the place is new its in good condition and customer service is decent. The regular Asian food was ok with some of the dishes being warm, but most were cold. The sushi selection was good for a place like this including the standard nigiri but rolls were a bit scarce when you wanted  something that wasn't stuffed with raw fish. 

They had plenty of desserts but they did not taste very good but looked nice in the presentation. They also had ice cream albeit not self serve. Had to wait for someone to come by to scoop some for me.

Fionn MacCool's and their brand of pubs, like the Firkin brands are all trying to rejuvenate and up the ante on their food.  I had dined here previously as part of a media preview for the launch of their new summer menu and then had the occasion to eat there for lunch.

Tip: Do not come here on Thursdays around lunch time as every Thursday they cater to a bus tour.  It means slower service.

The food is actually quite decent.  2/3 of us ordered the club sandwich with cranberry mayo (you can actually get them in half portions, which is plenty for lunch) and it comes with your choice of soup or salad.  For $7 you can't really go wrong.

As I still was nearing the end of a flu, I opted for the cup of seafood chowder with pretzel roll and salad for $8.  The soup was quite chunky and hearty though it literally was a cup of soup.

Inside the place was packed. There wasn't any additional seats, they were booked to capacity. When we checked in with the hostess we were asked if we would be willing to be seated with other people. We said no problem but when our name was called we ended up with just the two of us at the table.

The dim sum experience is not for everyone.  Those not accustomed to the noise and crowds should stay away. The place was Jam packed with Chinese families which was a good indication of how the food would be.  

All the carts came around frequently. Service was standard for a Dim Sum restaurant. Nothing much to complain about or compliment.  This place was really crowded. It was a bit uncomfortable because the tables are really close to each other, and the aisle aren't hat wide. With the carts going around the place it can get super cramped and uncomfortable. Oh, it was also super noisy, but that shouldn't be a surprise for such a crowded establishment. The servers pushing the carts around were hard to understand so I have no idea what we had or what was in the food but I can tell you we enjoyed all the dishes we picked.

None of the dishes really stand out. The food was good, not spectacular, but Just your standard dim sum fare. With the exception of drink refills because no one came around to refill our beverages.

FOOD: The menu is standard Dim Sum. PRICE: Expensive -This accounts for why I rated the place only a three. My wife and I spent $30.00 on lunch and didn't really have that much food. I can't imagine what families must spend here on a big meal.   ABIANCE: Nothing fancy but you don't come here for the ambiance you come here or the food. SERVICE: . CONCLUSION:  The food was decent and the price was high for what you get. The décor was non existent and all tables/chairs were all covered and not the most comfortable. However the Great Wall managed to satisfy that dim sum craving but was not even close to the best I've ever had. The search continues. RETURN  FACTOR: 90- 95%

I decided that I wanted to savor life, and enjoy each and every waking moment, which meant one thing of course: to visit a little oasis in the midst of the desert that is aptly named ""Sin City."" Last year, I decided to pay a visit to this gem of a town not once, not twice, but a whopping THREE times.

My friend from California decided to visit me in Arizona, and since he exudes innocence, I decided that I should corrupt him with epileptic lights, and casinos that reek of cigarettes and regret. However, I decided to mix in a little spontaneity and instead of booking directly on a casino website, I decided to gamble on Hotwire and see what hotel I would get as a result. After careful sleuthing, especially with the disclaimer that it indeed was NOT a casino, I knew we were going to be spending one luxurious night at the Trump. I was ecstatic, and so was my friend. After gently prodding my roommate to accompany us, we were ready to proceed with our whirlwind trip.

Five hours later, we arrived. We had a bellhop generously help us with our luggage, and had our doors held for us as we entered. Strangely enough, I felt like Kevin Mcallister when he entered the Plaza Hotel. After being offered an upgrade for an additional fifty dollar charge, we kindly rejected the offer and went up to our room. And my, what a room it was! It was like our own mini studio apartment. The bathroom was to die for. There was a shower for some sexy time, a bath tub with jets, and a mandatory toilet for....well, you know. After playing some sleazy drinking games, we decided to head towards the strip. The whole night was a blur. I vaguely remember my friend saying that he was sleepy so he decided to end the night early, and I decided to drink celebratory shots for no apparent reason with my roommate. At two in the morning, we briefly ate and then spent our night soaking our hurting feet in the tub.

The next morning is when all the trouble began. I was extremely hungover, and my friends were hungry so we utilized the free shuttle to Caesar's palace, and ate. My stomach was churning, my head was throbbing, so I didn't savor my food so I left my friends there and took the shuttle back. Thankfully, I didn't have to wait long. The next couple of hours were sheer agony for me. I was indebted with gratitude that they let me do a late check-out, and by the time I actually could function, it was  four thirty in the afternoon. They did not try to charge us, or reject my plea for late checkout.

All in all, I loooooved this hotel. I will stay again. You do get what you pay for. Fortunately, I didn't have to cleanse my life savings out of my wallet out for a night's stay due to Hotwire! I will stay again. However, my liver has thoroughly suffered my Vegas craze of 2011, so I will not be paying another visit for quite some time. Hopefully the world doesn't end by then.

Whether you're there for the volleyball league during the week nights, or there on the weekend to enjoy the sun and gorgeous North Coast View, this place is a must visit  to grab some libations.  They have a full bar, and buckets of beers at a rather reasonable price.  Best part - they allow you to bring your own snacks to enjoy at the picnic tables, as long as you're buying alcohol.  That's a change from last year!  

The restaurant has the indoor space with a bar, plus the outdoor patio with 15+ large picnic tables with table service.  The patio is right on the marina and is a beautiful view.

I've been here four or five times, and never felt bothered to review it due to the sheer volume of reviews already submitted.  Echoing what others have said, what do I have to add?  LeBron James is good at basketball, Austin Texas is hip, there's a drought in California, and the Greenhouse Tavern makes good food, yada yada.  

But, browsing recent reviews and seeing a flurry of whiny accusations of overratedness and angry 1-star tantrums over a single bad experience, I feel the need to say something.

As a said, I've been here four of five times, and sure, there was an off night sandwiched in those visits, and a few items that missed their mark.  But please - to condemn an establishment based on an occasional shortcoming reminds me of the American who spends two nights in Paris on a guided tour, and then announces to his or her friends at home that the entire country of France sucks and that the French are awful.  The Greenhouse is Paris; it has a great reputation that is well-earned, but remember that Paris still has ghettos, mean people, traffic and bad food.

Anyway, here's my schtick: there's a bar on the right when you walk in that is staffed by very knowledgable bar people who execute their drinks perfectly, and seem proud to be working on the cutting edge of gastronomic culture.   They will talk the Cleveland food scene with you, tell you what to order, and tell you where to go next.  You'll get everything you need here in the bar;  don't bother with the restaurant part, and certainly don't book your 20-person birthday party here.  The finer things in life are enjoyed in small, intimate, concentrated doses.

The food is all about the wings; everything else flows from there.   Simply describing them as ""the best chicken wings ever"" won't do. To give you a better idea, they are good because they undergo a slow, low-temp oven-roast that allows the wings to cook in their own rendered fat.  This ""confit"" method is almost always though of as a duck thing, but as a chicken thing, it shines and delights.   There is no sauciness about the wings, either.  That would take too much attention away from the perfectly cooked meat.  Instead they are tossed in a little lime juice, fresh cilantro, and minced garlic (I think), to add a fresh and tangy accent.  These wings are so succulent and thoroughly roasted that you can actually eat the bones.  

Lobster in Maine, salmon in Seattle, barbecue in Memphis, confit wings in Cleveland.  That's the territory you are entering into here.  Ride this wing high into the rest of the menu, and let me know what else you find; I haven't gotten that far very often.",2015-05-29 16:47:05

I had their Santa Maria sandwich and Big Yard green smoothie drink.  Both were wonderful and actually the smoothie filled me up enough that I was able to save my sandwich until dinner.  Even hours later it still tasted fantastically amazing.

The place is really easy to find right on the corner with plenty of parking and plenty of seating outside.  On the inside it seems to be a bit cramped but that's okay.

Everything is slightly over priced but I tended to notice that when you're wanting something fresh or healthy for you in general it's more expensive.  The cheaper it gets the more it's filled with chemicals and artificial everything to the point you're not even eating real fruits, veggies, and meats.  So I'm pretty okay with the price.  It's like healthy fast food almost.

I liked the cashier also and the vibe of all the staff. Everyone one was kind and friendly, and there was an atmosphere in the air that felt like everyone knew everyone. Very friendly. It's like Cheers bar on tv, but everything good for you instead of bad.

I'll be going here again and again. Loved it!",2014-06-29 00:40:08

Darci was wonderful to work with, she made multiple changes for us and answered every question with a clear and quick response. We attended several tastings with them, leaving each time more impressed.

The food was delicious and plentiful! The presentation was elegant and when it came time to invite guests to eat, the servers were wonderful and friendly. All of my guests were delighted with the meal of apricot mango chicken, beef brisket au jus, mashed potatoes and salad. The brisket and the mashed potatoes were the stars- our guests were raving about them! 

The servers were professional in both appearance and conduct and worked quietly and efficiently. After we intially cut the cake, they had it served up in no time and offered the guests all that they liked. The venue itself had some snafus but Fat Freddy's went above their jobs and did extra things to make things run smoothly, I appreciated that they did these things even though it wasn't their job.

Fat Freddy's doesn't just provide delicious food; they are also thoughtful and caring. I loved that the servers whipped up two huge to-go boxes for my husband and I to take for the honeymoon and had them ready without having to ask. It was a surprising and wonderful touch.

Service was rather lacking and slow. They seemed to be understaffed, with only 2 servers catering to the 15 or so tables during lunch hour. 

The menu was interesting, with loads of familiar Vietnamese dishes ranging from noodles to rice dishes, and Chinese stir-fried dishes. 

As recommended by fellow Yelpers, I went ahead and ordered Vietnamese favorite - Pho with meatballs. I got a large bowl, which was a dollar more expensive than the regular, hoping to go home with leftovers for another meal (which is what happens at Ha Long Bay and Saigon noodles). Sadly, for $9, I got noodles only enough for one meal, and 3 half meatballs. The soup was tasty, but I wouldn't say it was better than Ha Long Bay and Saigon noodles. Definitely I would lean towards the rice dishes next time.

Also, I'm excited to hear they would be serving Dim Sum, which is horribly lacking in Madison. Noticing that there were cantonese among the servers gives me a spark of hope that this would be a reasonable place to assuage my hunger for Dim Sum in Madison!",2014-02-27 03:09:25

Like the crust is too hard and the sauce and toppings don't integrate well. I'm o.k. with it, just wonder what the deal is. The pizza is fine, although I will say it does not re-heat well. I do have to complain on the packing of the leftover pizza. If they're not going to put it in a pizza box, then they need to put either paper or foil between the layers.

ev_ktgVaMSnUCl0r32NAbw,WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A,4,3,3,4,"Bouchon is a beautiful bistro, decked out in handsome dark wood decor and a buzzing atmosphere to match.  The service is fairly formal but friendly.  Dinner at Bouchon is a casual affair but rich with a vibrant Vegas feel and some excellent food.

My dinner at Bouchon was with my family of five, and we indulged in a manner befitting a meal in Sin City.  We started by ripping into the epic epi bread placed directly on our table along with good butter and a little jar of mustard.  The bread looked like a well-sprouted branch, and the little yeasted knobs that came off of it were delicious with a satisfying crust.

We ordered an array of appetizers and passed them around like a good Asian family.  The table favorite was the salmon rillettes, which were presented in a sealed mason jar opened at our table.  The rillettes were superb, with plenty of salmon character along with lots of fat and moisture.  We spread them on crunchy baguettes.  We also got the small assortment of shellfish, which came with a few varieties of oysters along with shrimp and lobster.  Everything was great - the oysters were fresh and briny, the shrimp sweet and snappy, and the lobster plump and meaty.  The assortment came with cocktail sauce, dijonnaise, and a shallot sauce, all of which were put to good use.  For something green, we ordered an heirloom tomato salad with pesto.  This was simple and lovely with bright, refreshing flavors and some gorgeous tomatoes.  The only appetizer I didn't especially care for was the escargot.  I don't mind eating snails, but these snails were a little bit boring.  They were served with little puff pastries and garlic butter, but somehow the result was unexciting.

The main courses were on the whole less impressive than the appetizers, but they were still very solid.  I ordered the braised beef short ribs special, which came with sweet carrots, potato confit, roasted bone marrow, and sauce bordelaise.  The beef was very good, tender and tasty, and I loved the softened carrots as well.  The bone marrow was fantastic smeared on everything, adding smooth velvet to each bite.  The sauce, though, was kind of overwhelming, deep but rather sweet.  The steak frites was a great, simple dish.  My brother ordered his steak medium and it was a nice even pink, with plenty of juice, and garlic butter on top.  The fries were spectacular, thin cut and crispy on the outside.  My other brother's croque madame and mom's mussels also came with these fries.  The croque madame was delicious but very decadent and hard to eat more than a couple bites of.  This was a fried egg and ham and cheese on toasted brioche, and would have been just right but for a smothering dose of mornay sauce.  The fried egg was a thing of beauty.  The mussels were the only item that I actively disliked.  The broth was fine but the mussels themselves tasted like that overwhelming garbage-like smell that mussels can sometimes have.  My dad's roasted chicken was a high point.  It was moist and juicy, served with caramelized figs, chanterelle mushrooms, pickled ramps, and chicken jus.

For dessert we split the vanilla creme brulee and the ""bouchon,"" which was three little brownies with coconut sorbet, butter pecan, and peanut butter chip ice cream.  The creme brulee was decent, though fairly standard, with a pleasant crackly sugar crust.  The ""bouchon"" was also straightforward but had a lot more sparkle.  The brownies were delicious, with a little bit of crumble but nice dark chocolate density.  The accompanying sorbet and ice creams were also great.

When the meal was over, we were stuffed, with plenty of good food as well as a nice bottle of wine in our systems.  Overall I would say that I wasn't blown away by Bouchon, but I enjoyed our meal and might go back again.  The food wasn't fancy or innovative especially given the price point, but almost everything was precisely executed.  There's a Bouchon where I live and if I'm craving a classic bistro meal, I'll probably check it out.",2010-08-27 23:31:46

Ambience: 70s hip rock 'n roll vibe, lots of teak and green. There's mostly rock that plays on the radio, however it doesn't detract from conversation or your meal. For seating, there's patio seating, table seating, and booth seating. Oh, and the bar.

Service: honestly, I could dock a star for service. The last time we were here, our waitress was a bit cold. She seemed more interested in herself than her job or our lunch. This place is heavily frequented and staffed by your typical Scottsdale snobbery. She neglected to tell us that happy hour is all day on Sundays, and we only found out because we overheard it at the table next to ours. She also removed our chicken lettuce wraps from the table before we finished. That being said, I did notice that the waiter at the table next to us was very helpful, polite and friendly. So perhaps we just got a bad egg.

Food: both times that I've been to Geisha, I've had the pleasure of enjoying their happy hour prices. For appetizers, I would recommend the chicken lettuce wrap, the short ribs, or the tempura. I've tried all three and can say that I would happily order all three again. As for the rolls, I would recommend the spicy yellowtail roll. We've ordered other rolls in the past, and remember them being just as good and fresh.

Price: I can't say when their happy hour is midweek, but I can tell you that happy hour is all day on Sundays! Happy hour includes half off all appetizers, house rolls, draft beers, and other things that I can't remember at this time. The normal price of their roles is comparable to any other sushi establishment in the valley, but their happy hour prices are definitely something to go in for. The normal price on appetizers is a bit steep for my taste, but definitely worth their value on happy hour. 

And so, to sum: Geisha has fantastic happy hours on Sundays and I wouldn't miss it if I was in the area.",2014-09-12 05:01:50

What attracted me here was the fact that this restaurant was classified as a breakfast and brunch place but unfortunately, brunch is only served on weekends so we were a little disappointed. I got the risotto and it was pretty good and the portion was huge! I barely finished half of it and had to pack the rest.

They also seemed a bit understaffed as there was 1 waitress managing our entire section so service was really slow.. Took us 30 mins to get our food.

We walked in and were very kindly greeted.  Then we were handed a menu and a card.  Ummm... okay.  The hostess then explained that you go to a personal chef station and he will put your order on the card, which you then bring back when you are done to check out.  Interesting...

The space is huge.  Wide open and very airy with apparently 100 year old olive trees and herb plants in terra cotta pots scattered about.  The furniture is very mod yet natural feeling for the space as well.

There are several lines form at the long kitchen and they are designated with their specialty (pizza, antipasta, salad, pasta) above on the chalkboard mural.

To quote Tom Petty, ""the waiting is the hardest part.""  If you find yourself behind someone in the pasta line, as I did, you can expect to stand there for at least fifteen minutes.  But in the waiting, you realize that this isn't just someone with a vat of noodles and a big pot of sauce.

You can see into a back room just passed the kitchen that they make all their pasta in house, which they put into serving size containers that they personal chef then cooks.  And you have your choice of pasta.

I chose my sauce, sausage e verdure, to add to penne.  My friend has scampi e spinach with tagliatelle.  I thought it was neat that the pasta was put into an almost timed deep frier (only with boiling water) set up to cook.

We were able to stand and converse as our food cooked, occassionally answering ingredient questions.  A little garlic, throw in some spice, et cetera.  Our personal chefs were personable and quite capable.

This was gourmet pasta at its best.  The vegetables and sausage were delicious and the pasta was perfect.  Jen is a what I would consider a foodie, and we were both thoroughly impressed.  They also give you some delicious bread with oils on each of the tables.

Getting drinks wasn't inherently clear as far as the process.  But they have a full bar at the front which looks well appointed and is surrounded by inviting lounge seating between the bar and kitchen.

It's a rustic bbq joint trying to dress up and be all fancy w/ tall stemmed wine glasses - kinda weird in my opinion.

 ribs, corn salsa, and potatoes slices. Comes out to be just under $100 for two people after tax and tip. Everything comes on a nice wooden plank. The ribs were the tastiest of all the meats. The ribs were not dry, fall off the bone, and their bbq sauce was really good. 2nd best would be the beef ribs (we dipped beef ribs into their rib bbq sauce which made it taste better). Chorizo was salty. Italian sausage was better than chorizo. Corn salsa was ok, no wow factor. Potato medallions were just fried slices of potatoe w skin on but it came w this tasty creamy dill dipping sauce. Asides from the ribs -  no wow factor in terms of flavour.

My first time here was at Yelp Community Event, where we were able to have a tasting menu of 4 different sandwiches. This was perfect for first timers as there's so many options to choose from. I chose from an experimental tasting menu, and my husband had the spicy tasting menu, so we were able to taste 8 different sandwiches all together. Every sandwich we tried was delicious. It's really hard to pick a favorite, the highlights were a buffalo chicken style sandwich, the Mozzarella's Big Cheese which had chicken and honey on it, the Carne Asada fries sandwich (which included just that) and the dessert sandwich of nutella and marshmallow fluff.

There are always 20 micro brews on tap and they rotate seasonally. Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. 

The bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.

D's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced. For some reason I have trouble spending $5 for a hot dog. I've tried their wings and fries too, both good standard bar food, but again a tad overpriced. My friend and I drank beers (a good amount) and ordered food and our tab was $100.

The grease floats on top of the coffee and looks gross to me.  Anyway, I spent some years in Virginia Beach, VA where Dunking Donuts and Krispy Kreme  are deep fried food icons. KK was good especially hot, but otherwise tastes the same no matter what flavor.  The variety (about 25 types) and freshness of Dunkin' Donuts there made them my favorite. They used to sell about 6-7 types of filled donuts alone...blueberry, lemon, apple, Boston cream, strawberry, cherry, and chocolate, etc. etc. but that was then, and this is now. 

I come to this Dunkin Donuts every time I'm in town visiting relatives - usually every month or so.  When they opened about two years ago, they had a decent variety.  But now, the selection of donuts has been reduced because they've added sandwiches and bagels.  And I honestly have gotten some donuts that weren't that fresh.  Sometimes I've seen them bring a new batch of donuts from the kitchen to the front. And that's often what I order.  I don't like that you can't see them making the donuts, like you can at most mom and pop shops and Krispy Kreme.  They don't sell turnovers, but there is plenty of employee turnover.  I never see the same face in any two consecutive months.  

What I like though, is that this is a drive through.  And the times it was too wet, too hot, too windy, or too cold to step out and walk 30 ft to get inside, it is great to sit in your car and order.   The coffee has never been stale here either.  So if I sound blah, it's cuz this place ain't bad, the selection and taste, compared to most mom and pop donuts are just blah. So this is rated  3""blah"" with one exception.  To end on a sweet note, I like the red velvet donut. It's not enough to give it four stars, but props to them for creating this beautiful tasty high caloric treat.

I went here one night with some friends to have some drinks and play some video poker at the bar.  The smell of the casino (all the smoke) gave me a migraine.  Also, the drinks were horrible.  I'm assuming since they are free (because we were gambling), they put more juice and little to no alcohol.  So I decided to order something that is pretty much straight alcohol, hoping it would taste a little more like an alcoholic beverage than juice, so I ordered a Long Island.  Unfortunately it tasted like an amaretto sour, with lots of SOUR, little amaretto.  It tasted nothing like a long island iced tea.  Where's the tons of alcohol with a SPLASH of coke?  Definitely not in this drink!  Even when another bartender made it, it tasted the same.  All the sweetness from these drinks gave me the worst stomach ache EVER.

As with all the other Big Burrito restaurants, I'm definitely a fan of the upscale and unique spin on an ethnic cuisine (in this case Mediterranean).

The fiancee and I's first venture here left us with some of the best scallops we've had in Pittsburgh and a Jamison Farm's lamb shank that was to die for.  I wish I could remember the waiter's name, but all I can say is, he definitely deserved the 40% tip we laid down.

Take two, brunch.  We sat this time out in the covered and heated patio up front.  While the food was great (I got my obligatory fat kid french toast variation), a rushed server caught her arm on the back of my chair towards the end of our meal and dumped an entire pitcher of ice water on my shoulder and lap.

While I'm completely sympathetic when it comes to legitimate mistakes (and the server was obviously extremely embarrassed about the situation), I was surprised when no follow-up occurred.  The server apologized and ran immediately to the back of the house, leaving two of the surrounding tables to come to my rescue with their napkins.  The server brought us our check, but despite the public scene it caused, not a single manager stopped by to verify that everything was alright.

After writing to Casbah, the manager did respond quickly and offer to rectify the situation, so I'll give them a pass assuming it was just bad timing and an issue where the server was too embarrassed to do anything.",2013-05-29 20:38:23

I started off with the Agnes which had a nice hibiscus base and the husband got the Beryl which had a really nice balance of apricot, bourbon and absinthe. 

We shared various plates - 

Yuzu chicken wings - these were 4 huge pieces. Really crispy and good flavor. I wasnt getting ""yuzu"" from it though, had more of a sweet and spicy gojuchang sauce and some diced onions and cilantro on top. 

Shrimp and jalapeno hushpuppies - this was a small plate of bite sized bits. Decent flavor, but was least favorite item. 

Pork Belly Kimchi Rice - this came in a hot pot so it can get some crisp bits. This was pretty solid of a rice, tender pork belly. 

Amberjack crudo - very good flavor, but smaller than most servings you get of a crudo/sashimi type plate at a Japanese spot. Still, worth ordering as it was a fresh and bright dish.

Asparagus tempura - came with 2 sauces and had a nice light crisp coating to it. Simple, but very good. 


The star for me was the oysters. $1- $2 depending on the type. The plus is there's various interesting sauces for it but my 2 favorites were the rosemary mignonette and the pickled peppers and habanero. 

My husband has been here before, but this was my first impression was positive.

However, everything went downhill as soon as we arrived for lunch. First off, there's no iPad ordering. You have to wait until a server stops by with their own iPad to take your order (literally the worst ordering system you can have for an AYCE style restaurant). This meant a lot of waiting since there was only 1 or 2 of them working the entire restaurant (which was about 80% full). We arrived at noon and an hour later, we were still starving. Food came out at an abysmally slow pace. By 1 PM, we got 5 or 6 dishes of the 15 we ordered. In total, of the 22 items we ordered, 9 never showed up. We put in our orders (4-5 items each time) 5 times and started to make bets about what would come out and which one they'd miss. We were also given wrong dishes as well. 

It came to around $72 for two people but what was crazy was that the menu is also quite misleading. There are some items (such as the duck) that are not available for lunch, only dinner. However, you're still being charged the SAME PRICE regardless of when you go! Most places have a cheaper lunch menu since they don't offer everything, but Kaka is charging you full price regardless. The menu doesn't note which items are ""dinner only,"" and it was only after ordering the duck twice that the server finally went to ask the kitchen and was told it's not available for lunch. Some items were also not available, such as the sushi pizza and the Kaka ice cream. You're paying full priced for a stripped down menu.

Overall, the food ranges from decent to great, but it's so not worth the waiting, ordering issues, and being charged full price for a limited menu. Save your money and go elsewhere - there's no shortage of solid AYCE options in Toronto. Sadly after two hours, we left frustrated and still hungry.

P.S. Once you order dessert, they consider it ""final call"" and you won't be able to order anything else. This system is a bit strange and nonsensical, especially if you're with others and only one person wants dessert.",2018-03-24 19:09:08

Yogurtland is the bees knees, and now that I let the cat out of the bag, everyone's gonna wanna go to Yogurtland. I should have just kept my mouth shut. :-/

While Yogurtland isn't exactly my normal stop for yogurt, I just can't be 'in the area' without a quick stop in, they're definitely my favorite, best tasting froyo around the Phoenix area. I think my favorite here is peanut butter, but it's rare to see that flavor. There's generally always a new and different flavor and no one around here asks questions when you need to 'sample' all the flavors to land on the one you want to fill your cup with. :-)

If you thought the little known fact was that Yogurtland is the best in town, you'd only be half right, check out studentinsider (*) com and you'll find a discount for not just yogurtland, but also a handful of different spots around the Tempe area. Just pop it open on your mobile phone and bam, you're in business.

Ella got the ""Carne de las costillas cortas"" oven braised beef short ribs in white wine with potatoes and carrots, topped with a natural al jus and served with sautéed green beans. The braised beef was incredibly soft and pulled apart with the greatest of ease. What we loved most about this dish was the combination of bold colors on the plate and the the balance of fresh veggies with the braised short ribs.

The couple sitting next to us was so intrigued with all of the photos I had been taking of our food that they offered their food up for the photo spotlight. I never got a chance to taste their dish (Vieiras Chilindron Sautéed scallops topped with fresh tomatoes and peppers sauce, served with seasoned white rice) but it looked gorgeous.

I ordered the Diavola (pizza with a tomato based sauce, spicy salami and mozarella). It took a while to get our pizzas since we were such a big group. The appetizers came pretty quickly though so we still had quite a bit of food.

The pizza was Neapolitan style. It tasted delicious but had a thick crust on the rims and was scarce on the salami. This seemed to be the case with all the other pizzas ordered by our group. I would rate the food 3.5 for this reason.

The Warhol section of the museum was really interesting.  I didn't know that Warhol did so much with the Polaroid and it was good to look at the photos on the wall of celebrities that he and photographed.

Our guide was well versed in all things Polaroid and was able to answer any of the questions put to him by members of the group.

I looked at some of the items for sale on the first floor but there was nothing that particularly caught my eye so I left having had a good time learning more about Edwin Land and his vision for the company.

Food

1. Fish Fillet in Bean Paste: This was one of my favorite dish from this place although I'm confused by the name of this dish. I did not taste any bean flavor in there. To me, it taste more like garlic sauce. Fish (white fish) is deep fried and soaked in this yummy sauce of theirs. 

2. Spicy Fire Pot with Pork Intestine: This dish comes with intestine and tofu.I like this dish very much as well. Only thing lacking in this dish is the pig blood cake/duck blood cake. Other than that, it has an pretty authentic taste. 

3. Chicken in Garlic Sauce: It comes with chicken, woodears, and a special type of potato that I don't know what it is called. Chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful. 

4. Squid in three cup sauce: This dish was just okay to me because I like a lot of basil in the three cup sauce. I did not taste too much of basil in there. 

5. Braised Eggplant with Garlic Sauce: Flavor was great and eggplant was cooked just right. 

6. Rice with meat sauce: The meat sauce it self was yummy but I didn't like their steam rice. It was not moist but rather dry. Hopefully they will change to different brand of rice. 

7. Chinese meatballs (Lion Heads): It was not too flavorful. It was the least favorite among of our group. 

8. Roast Pork Hocks: It was flavorful but the meat was not that fresh that day. I can taste the ""piggy smell"" lol. It was also not our favorite among of our group. 

9. Glass noodle with spicy minced pork: This dish is okay for me as well. I like the sauce and the spiciness but the noodle was bit under cooked in my opinion. 

10. Beef Noodle Soup: Beef was tender but soup was not flavorful enough and I didn't like the yellow noodle that they put in there. 

I also like the complementary side dishes that we got the other day. We had cucumbers, seaweed salad, peanuts and bean spouts. 

Service was decent and attentive. I have been going twice since last weekend and plan on going back again this week. I will keep trying other entrees and keep you all posted!",2014-08-14 03:18:50

I had wanted to go for a long time with one of my best restaurant companions, but I wound up going with four of my girlfriends from high school during a 'summer kick-off resort weekend' (yes, we actually did that...wow, that's hilarious to type) in Scottsdale. 

Anyway...as I said, I liked it.  I don't think my friends were as in love.  Not all of them drink (so they weren't impressed by the awesome wine selection--I had a glass of a delicious White Knight), and not all of them quite understood the concept of tapas...to order lots of little dishes to create a full meal.  The four of them were very frustrated with how little food they could get for their dollar.  One girl ordered a salad which turned out to be essentially three leaves of lettuce. To be fair to these girls, the tapas were particularly small...really really yummy, but very small.

Ultimately, it would have been better for us to go somewhere else, but I would completely want to go back to Tapino and experience it with some wine lovers and some people that understand the tapas concept...and some other friends who are willing to expand their restaurant horizons beyond Applebees.

I would especially love to sit on all white couches on the all white tented patio, it looked so relaxing.

However, one complaint.  I frown on tapas restaurants that use their status as such as excuse of having way way way too small food portions...while the rest was delicious and adequate (the corn dogs were especially savory), the three leaf salad had Tapino walking that line...so I'm definitely putting it on warning for this near infraction.",2008-12-20 08:45:56

Unfortunately she always wants to go to some buffet for as she puts it ""where there is always something for everyone.""  This statement is simply not true.  But again her call and I went along with it.  I really have a dislike for almost every buffet place I have ever eaten, especially one that is so cheap, you know the quality goes down with the price.  Over the years I have come to know what BUFFET actually stands for, The B is for bunch, and the E & T are eating together... Message me if you want to know what the UFF stands for:)

So after Easter service we left Mass for the masses of people flocking to the Corral.  I really see no need to rip this place apart, I mean it is what it is.  You can't go here and expect grade A food, it just doesn't work like that for 11.99 a person all you can eat.  The employees for the most part seemed to be hard at work stocking plates, cups, bowls, and whatnot.  There were some waits on things which is ok.  I was disappointed with their steak.  Again I am aware this isn't Morton's or anything but the med rare steaks were more medium well, tough, and ¾ of fat encased whatever meat in there that was edible.  I ended up getting three of them because off one you could only get one or two bits then you have to pitch the rest of the fatty beast.  I really liked the mushrooms though, and sadly they were the best part of the meal... Ah maybe that isn't that sad... Again it is what it is.

Clearly this place is great to go if you have a big family on a budget, love to overeat, or just don't care what things taste like.  I really wish Mom would have opted to cook this year!

I had time to look because it takes between 35-40 minutes to make and cook one of these crusts. There are 2 TVs, both on sports channels. Parking and access is easy off 40th Street or Bell Rd. The place is actually North of Bell Rd on 40th St. next to Walgreen's. It's across the street from the high school.

There were 3 empty tip jars on the counter and a place to tip on the receipt, but I only tip if there is wait service at the table, but if I have to walk to get a refill of my drink and walk to the counter to ask for a to-go box, that is not waiter service, and therefore no tipping. Sorry. Tipping here would be like tipping at burger king.

There is no nutrition information online or at the store, so if you are on a diet like I am, then I would assume the worst possible scenario.

Food quality was passing. It's a big cut above school cafeteria food, perhaps better than the cheap pizza chains like Domino's. But as a former Chicago resident and still a pizza snob, it's in the lower levels of compatibility with true Chicago Style. (In my opinion the standard for ""Chicago style"" is from Pizzaria Uno or Due)

I lived in/near Chicago in the 1960s-70s and never heard of this chain. My brother has lived there all his life and told me he has been there and most of the people he knows would rate the chain a 4 on the 10 scale. So this place is like the Ponderosa of pizza chains. Somewhere above fast food but significantly below places like Pizzaria Uno or Malnati's.

Bad sign: I arrived there at 12:15pm and there was only one other person in the store, during the lunch rush hour. They may do a really good delivery business with the hospital across the street.

It cost me $21.06 for a small drink and one small pizza.

King fish is located in the Total Wine/Ashley Furniture shopping center off of WT Harris. It's located at the top, right near Jimmy John's.  It's got a very sleek, modern feel with not too many tables crammed in there. The menu is displayed on large screens right above the prep station. 

This is another Chipotle-style, choose your own ingredients. You can start off with either a salad, bowl (with either brown or white sushi-style rice), or burrito. For my first visit, I chose a regular-size poke bowl with sushi rice. You are then given a choice of two scoops of protein: shrimp, salmon, tuna, or chicken, tofu.

I went with two scoops of tuna and then proceeded to have my bowl topped with cucumber slices, matchstick carrots, diced green onion, edamame, red cabbage, jalapeno. You are then able to pick which sauce you would like added, I went with gochujang because I love heat. I asked for it on the side but, normally, they would throw into the bowl to make sure all ingredients are coated. Their gochu is/was delicious. I will happily have them douse my poke bowl with that sauce on my next visit.

There are also extra additions you can have added to your bowl/burrito, etc such as avocado ($1.25 extra), ginger slices, wasabi, shredded nori, and so on.

If you're not in the mood to make that many decisions, you can choose one of their pre-made combinations that are listed on their menu. For as much as you get, the price is VERY reasonable. Total for my poke bowl came to $9.60.

THE MINUSES: 

1. The food: It was o-kay. Not amazing as I expect a ""Gastropub"" would be. If it were just a ""pub,"" now that would be one thing, and that would be fine. But when you put the adjective ""gastro"" in front of ""pub,"" we are expecting something a little more than the ordinary. And beyond the ordinary is in terms of flavor, execution, and presentation...not just the clever and the ""out of the box."" 

The flavor and execution on the chicken lettuce wraps I ordered were just not there. The chicken was really, really salty. I would have sent it back but I was not going to make my guest feel uncomfortable. But really, it was nearly inedible. I really felt as though I had dined at the ocean's floor, and I worried about my blood pressure.  The presentation was also very uninspired. Just cups of lettuce with chicken inside. That does not bother me, except the chef or whomever decided to be extra clever and put it on a wooden cutting board. (?!)  But why in the world would you need to serve chicken lettuce wraps on a CUTTING BOARD? There is nothing that needs cutting.  It is not a cheese course, either. Bizarre.

The deep fried devil's eggs were delicious. No doubt about that. (Also contributing to the restaurant's relatively high score for me). But they are a bit stingy with the order. I'd prefer to pay more and get more of them in an order, or allow for a large or small appetizer option.  (On the negative, it is still not presented very well. As I recall, the eggs are kind of lumped on the plate).

2. The atmosphere/and other elements: Aside from our awesome waitress, the guy who brought our food and drinks was really weird.

The atmosphere is not bad. It's a bit noisy, and not conducive to a conversation. It is a little touristy, so not a good ""power lunch"" spot for locals. It's hard to say what category it should fall in.  I don't hate it, but I would not return.",2017-12-19 23:19:05

It feels like a high end restaurant so not a bad place for a date as the tables have candles and there a nice ambient atmosphere. The menu is pretty simplistic with prices for entrees ranging from 18 to 30. While the cocktails were priced around 15, there is a happy hour special until 7 for beer ($5) and wine ($8). Service at the restaurant was great, and our food came our within a reasonable amount of time.

Food service was generally slow, ranging from 30-40 minutes before anything hit the table, which is not ideal during weekday lunch service. The food is decent, if you're willing to wait. They will ask you if you want to add things, pretty much for every item on the menu, which defeats the $5 meal. The chicken quesadilla was  a decently sized portion. The salads were a hit.

Lose a star for the restaurant layout.  It can get hectic in this little closet on Tryon during peak times.  You have to go upstairs to get one of the few tables they offer, and the one soda fountain is tucked in the same corner that everyone stands in to wait for their order...throwin' bows for my Pepsi isn't fun.

Also, the main reason you get hibachi is for the fried rice and white sauce (who's with me on this??)!!!!  This place gives a TINYYY little cup o' the spicy mayo, and then charges $0.25 for each additional TINNYY cup.  If complaining about an extra 25 cents makes me a cheapskate, so-be-it.  I just know most express hibachi restaurants have this stuff sitting at your table like maple syrup at IHOP.  It'll run you $.25 again if you want any chili sauce.

Inconsistent quantity for the price.  Sometimes I get a big heaping pile of hibachi steak...other times, I get a TON of the steamed cabbage and broccoli (which by the way, is nothing more than a box-filler...adds no flavor whatsoever), and hardly any meat!  Can make the value hard to judge.

*joined some friends who were on the patio dining and when the server came around multiple times, she didn't even acknowledge us. Even when I started acting childish and saying I'm so thirsty as a hint. I did this because when I tried to flag her down before, she straight up walked away.

""eventually you found us!  Your mom should be proud."" 
What does my mom have to do with anything? What are you trying to imply? Your restaurant was extremely difficult to find. Maybe you should get a BIGGER sign up because as you can read, MANY yelpers have gotten lost/ or stated that couldn't find this place.

The soup did lack quite a bit of flavor. It was BLAND. It was actually a bland version of a wannabe Vietnamese soup my MOM could make at home. The soup came out way before the dish. Sorry your butt-hurt because I don't like your bland wannabe Vietnamese soup. I said it, what are you gonna do about it? 

Few meats on a stick, a bowl of rice, vegetables, and a bland soup for 8 bucks is expensive. I really DID feel jipped. I didn't expect Cambodian food to be this ""pricey,"" especially being in Central Phoenix. My bad, I AM comparing your prices to other asian restaurant in the area. Then again it was my first time actually at a cambodian restaurant and I wasn't satisfied. Again, don't be butt-hurt. 

About your sandwich, I can in fact get it somewhere else for cheaper. There are loads of Vietnamese restaurants in Central Phoenix that don't make their bread and also sell it for 2.00 plus tax. I don't know why you are still calling your sandwiches ""Cambodian sandwiches,"" It may be called differently since it was sold at a Cambodian Restaurant but it's the exact same thing as a Banh Mi sold at a Vietnamese restaurant (my bad because I didn't call it whatever you named it on your menu) but except yours is over-sauced and very stingy on the meat. 

Why would I have to complain about my sandwich to you when I was there? Shouldn't the staff know how to prepare the sandwich? Am I a criminal for stating my opinion and experience on yelp? YOU make me feel like I am a criminal for yelping three stars which means ""A-okay"". What did you want? five stars? The food wasn't ""As good as it gets.""
If you would reply saying ""sorry for being cheap and stingy on the meats."" Then maybe I would want to actually return. 

ATTENTION YELPERS:
Do not yelp lower than 4 stars or the Sekong By Night Nazi will come and get you.
Again, this is sarcasm. Don't get butt-hurt.

We started off with their calamari and spring rolls, calamari batter was super flaky and crispy but not heavy, just like I like it, I thought the pickled veggies and orange on the plate added some nice color to it, their dipping sauce could have been a tad bit spicier, it was a bit bland since the calamari batter didn't seem to be seasoned either. Spring rolls seemed pretty fresh, possibly house made? They were   yummy! For our main course, we both got Pad Thai, one was Seafood pad thai and the other was Chicken and shrimp then we also got their Chon Thai Seafood Special to go.
Both pad thai were delicious, only thing that caught me off gaurd was they use thinner noodles than what I'm use to, but it doesn't really matter or make a difference when it's so delicious, and portion size was perfect!

It was the better the first time I went for lunch, but then again, I ordered different (maybe the wrong) stuff.  This time 'round, I ordered SD9, a variety of maki as opposed to nigiri + a coupla smaller rolls of maki (lunch).

I've never had sashimi from Sushi House, so I can't comment on that.  Nigiri and smaller maki rolls are good.

Service:  At first, I thought that they should implement a buzzer system, as they have some rooms to one side of the restaurant...which are probably easy to miss.  However, the waitresses did come to check-in on us every so often.  Waitresses were nice 'n sweet and provided everything that I requested.

What I wasn't impressed with this time were their larger maki rolls, re:  Dynamite, Spider.  They weren't rolled tight enough, pieces of rice would crumble off, and the soft shell crab looked double-fried (very dark brown), and it tasted fishy.  I'd say that the Spider was the least favourite roll that I ordered.

But the dancing.... all I can say is *WOW*. I was floored.

Leading lady, Karine Plantadite is probably one of the best actors in town - and she never speaks in the show. She communicates all of her passion, joy, anger, and hot sensuality through her dance. I've never seen anyone like her.

there's a clip of one of her numbers from the show here (minus the band, lights and set of the actual show)

If you like this, you'll love the show.

FOOD: I tried the custom pizza (unlimited toppings for $14), but this pizza is really a double ended sword. To get your money's worth, you would want to load up on toppings but this decreases the quality of the pizza. Too many toppings makes the crust lose its weight and become soggy. Less toppings (especially less of the watery toppings) make the pizza taste better, but not worth the price. One thing I did like is the wide range of cheeses - from mozzarella, cheddar, feta to smoked provolone and fior di latte. 

ATMOSPHERE: The interior was more of a fast food looking restaurant where you can choose your own table once you order your food. HOWEVER, the winner of the atmosphere is their pie oven. This oven is a cute stoned dome shape and makes the business look a lot more authentic compared to its competitors.

I have heard a lot about Barrio from friends who live in and have visited Cleveland. I was super excited to see that they had a brunch menu that look pretty unique! 

When we arrived right at 11, the place was almost empty other than 5 or 6 other people who were seated by us. This décor is very cool inside and different from Mexican places in Pittsburgh. Immediately, we were greeted by our super nice waitress with a serving of fresh tortilla chips & homemade salsa. Yes! The chips were amazing and the salsa was even better! I could not get enough of it. Another thing I couldn't get enough of was the blood orange Mimosa- perfect hair of the dog! Chris ordered the Bloody Maria (made with tequila instead of vodka)- which he said was a bit too ""peppery"" for his liking of Bloody Marys.  I am a fan of their menu at Barrio- the ""build your own"" style. The brunch menu was a bit more set but I think it's a cool & fun idea to fill out your own menu. We decided on ordering a few things and splitting them between the two of us.

We both agreed that the biscuits + gravy was our favorite thing that we ordered. It was made with jalapeno biscuits and had a chorizo gravy with a fried egg on top. The gravy was amazing- it would be even better if they were more generous with the gravy! We also ordered 3 tacos: Machaca con Huevos, Huevos Rancehros, and Chicken & Waffle and last but not least- a side of bacon. The tacos were all just OK- they seemed to be lacking a little bit of flavor for how unique they sounded on paper. I am giving Barrio a 3-star for now...

I think these attractions are a bit overhyped. It was certainly cool to be 120 feet in the air above the tree line, and the view was all the way to the lake, but the experience did not add much value. The Canopy Walk was even more overrated in my opinion. Certainly worth $4, but you won't miss anything by not doing this and this isn't something to do every time you go. 

My highlight was the Holden Butterfly Garden. This grass pathed garden was simply gorgeous. It had two bridges, benches, two ponds and was simply beautiful. To get to this area walk through the Visitor Center. 

My two biggest cons were lack of shade and poor signage. There were signs everywhere, but they didn't directly relate to the map I was given and it wasn't always clear what trail I was on as compared to the map.

Owned by one of the nicest and very successful local business owner.

Anyway, after watching a great Saints vs. Lions game, I decided I was going to drop by for some pho (saw Lily's quick tip), but saw the grand opening banner for Woonam Jung. (Opened since Thursday, January 5, 2012)

Wow, what a pleasant surprise after some many years!  So I had to come check it out, even though I am not that hungry.

The hostess showed me to a table in the front of the restaurant.  And I was greeted by probably all of the wait staff, or at least three of them, a few minutes apart ready to take my order (in Korean).

I tried a Galbi stew the last time I ate at a Korean restaurant, so I picked something similar to try here.  The Ugeoji Galbitang (Beef Rib Stew w/ Dried Cabbage) was flavorful and not too spicy.  The portion is large, easily sharable with 2 or more friends.  And it was served with steam rice mixed with some purple rice.

While I was having my dinner, the owner spoke to my after he was done with a business meeting with a member of the local Chinese newspaper.  I learned that besides the newly opened Woonam Jung Korean Cuisine restaurant, he also owns the Koreantown Plaza, the food courts in Greenland Market, Lee's Travel Agency, as well as, (and you can probably guess if I ask you what other business) Lee's Discount Liquor.

Mr. Hae Un Lee, is a first class and all around nice and engaging man, who told me a brief history of how he came to Las Vegas 33 years ago; opened his first Lee's Discount Liquor store 30 years ago and grew it into the massive business empire it is today.  The conversation is like a big cherry to top dessert treat for me.

Anyway, I will be back to try the Korean BBQ part of the menu in the next few days.  

--Update--

Came back for the Korean BBQ. Our group went with the seafood combination, which consisted of lobster tails, giant shrimps, calamari, and scallops.  If it is indeed 1 portion worth, instead of the 2x portion that we suspected it to be, then it is well worth it.

The non-prime marinated Galbi was delicious.  The most tender piece of galbi I have ever had the pleasure of eating, and it is thicker than what is typically served at other restaurants or what you can buy from Korean markets.  

Service was not as great as my first visit, but they were not slammed by the crowd of CES attendees using up their per diem.  Plus they were just wrapping up their first week of grand opening.  But I will still be back for more of the Galbi and seafood combination.

Service:  4.5/5  Very attentive. If you are Asian, you will likely be mistaken for Korean.  But their English is fairly good, so if your Korean conversation skills is nil, you will still get great service.

Food:  4.5/5  Definitely going up against the other well-established local Korean restaurants.  The food was tasty and the default spiciness level is very mild, and can be dialed up as requested.

Decor/Ambiance:  4.5/5.  Well lit, tastefully decorated.

Parking:  5/5  There are a lot of spaces on the side of Koreatown Plaza where Woonam Jung is located (between Pho Saigon and Tiffany's Coffee).

Actually when I went in there and asked if they were open it was actually near past their closing time, but the owner said it was okay and our group of 10 people went in for dinner after watching a play.

We ordered 6 dishes off the menu based on the pictures

Onion pancake
Cold cuts (tofu, drunken chicken, meat+rice noodle with peanut sauce)
2 orders of siaw long pao (since there were 10 of us)
fish topped with egg
Shang Hai style pig belly
Meat and seafood with rice patties (not really on the picture, the one on the picture didn't have meat)

Though the order of the food was a little messed up, considering that it was late and they were kind to let us have our meal, I didn't factor it in.

Overall the food quality was good, the only problem is I didn't check the price, which may be why this is 5-stars.  However, presuming we paid $25 per person, I would say this was good quality.  The only thing left over was a couple of untouched bowls of steam rice.

The onion pancake was normal, nothing special.

The cold cuts were dishes I haven't really tried before, I just chose them by pictures and all of them tasted really good hard to say which one was my favorite.

The siaw long pao was good, so nothing special considering this is a Shang Hai place.  Granted if you're a Shang Hai place and you can't do this right you might as well shut down or get yourself franchised like Asian Legend.

They had a fish topped with egg dish.  Originally I was going to order something else, because I didn't think people would like this dish, but apparently it was someone's favorite so AWESOME and I like it too.  All I can say was it was good.

The Shang Hai style pig belly was okay, but the fat was a bit ""yucky oily"" though not as much as other places.  I ate this with the meat and sea food rice patties so it was a good mix.

Most people didn't have room for dessert so we skipped it.  Though I am thinking I want to try their rice dessert next time I go there.

However, the staff waiting on us was friendly and I would definitely come here again recommend it to other people.  I may stop recommending Legend in the area if I find out the price is good as well.",2012-12-12 06:15:41

Not a huge fan of their salads and have only tried their Ultimate Grilled Cheese panini sandwich, as I'm vegetarian and there aren't many veggie sandwich options.  It's a pretty good grilled cheese; I like that it comes with tomatoes, several different cheeses, and pesto spread.  There are usually a good range of vegetarian soups to choose from.  I really like the Wild Mushroom Bisque (really flavorful!) and the Tomato Basil (they add orzo pasta on top if you ask for it).  The only one I've tried that I really disliked was the Tuscan White Bean and Vegetable -- salty and very un-flavorful.  :/

If you get a meal, it also comes with a roll (not the best bread I've ever had -- I usually feed mine to my hubby or the birds outside) and chocolate-dipped strawberry (yum!).  You can get a drink for a little extra -- they have a station with Italian soda flavorings to spice up your soda selection (no cream though).  They also provide two kinds of crackers for your soup.

I ordered a half chicken salad sandwich. I should mention that I am really pleased that Togos posts nutrition facts and uses light mayo in their chicken and tuna salads. Regardless, the salad itself tasted just bad. The scoop was tiny, and overwhelmed by the doughy bread it was served on. There was more lettuce and tomatoes than chicken salad on my sandwich so it just completely tasted like a waste of any chicken salad at all. What I did get from the chicken was just the flavor of salty mayo.

I enjoyed the food. I like the concept of the brunch entrees that you order at the table and it comes out in small portions so you get the chance to try out the actual buffet. My boyfriend and I love the shrimp and grits. The grits is so creamy and the shrimps are actually really big. The sauce on top comes off a little too sweet for our liking but that doesn't stop us from ordering 4 more plates. $12 bottomless mimosas, can't beat that. No complaints there. 

Services wise.. Not so great. We were seated by the host and then ignored for the next 10 minutes. None of the servers came by but they all seem to notice we were sitting there. And keep in mind, it wasn't all that busy. Two servers finally came by and  asked for our drinks. Server brought out my boyfriend's drink order and then completely forgets about mine. The rest of our party arrives and none of the servers came by the take our orders. When we finally ordered, the server forgot the last half of our orders after he brought out our first half. And the two servers that were introduced to us, rarely checked up on us.


Ever had that ""damnit"" moment where you leave a hefty tip for the server and walked out thinking why the hell you tipped that much because they didn't really deserve it. No? Just me? Okay..",2015-09-10 23:23:39

I ordered the one pound stuffed burger with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, and cheddar. It comes with choice of sides I went with the mac and cheese.

Swear it workout all by itself. One of the best parts about it is so much going on juices and all expect hands get BIG time messy. I did. The mac and cheese. It was good.

It's a $30 value, so that's significant that I can't even make it a point to use it.  
Anyway, a friend and I randomly decided to go for happy hour.  That's probably the only other reason to go.  Their happy hour menu is decent, though you can still rack up a decent bill if you aren't careful.  Between the two of us we ordered the teriyaki wings, edamame, Philadelphia roll, fiery shrimp tempura, gyoza, and the chili shrimp roll.
Everything was just satisfactory. Nothing stood out at all.  I assume that the .50 cent difference between regular shrimp tempura and ""fiery"" was the generous drizzle of some sort of hot sauce. They could have kept that on the side because it could make the tempura soggy if left too long.
What's happy hour without drinks? I had a seasonal drink, the Pacific Ocean Cooler.  It was good, but not boozy enough for me.  I really enjoyed my Bene-tini though.  That's actually on the Happy Hour menu.  Still not boozy, but had a good flavor.
Service was decent, I don't usually have too big of a problem in the lounge area.  Though I'm relatively sure out waitress forgot to put in our sushi orders at first.

This place is the restaurant equivalence of a nineteen year old girl who just returned home from her Study Abroad program in Paris -- a little affected and confused in her attempt to appear continental, but somehow charming nonetheless.

Paris 66 has some things going for it: a convenient location, a solid, reasonably priced menu, and some reliably good dishes.

The onion soup is satisfying -- very hot, cheesy, with a strong flavored broth. The quiche is pretty good, according to my dining companion, as is the duck breast salad (decent quality greens; zippy deviled eggs, ok duck though a bit dry, could have used some dressing). I also liked their puff-pastrifization of the pizza -- a good idea that I'm going to steal and try doing it myself at home. I was not wild about my salmon and leek crepe (""La Champs Elysees"" [sic]); Crepes Parisiennes does its salmon crepes better. This version is too dry; and their preparation somehow made the tastes of the salmon and the leek mixture incompatible.  At least we ended on a good note with a tasty, flaky almond galette.

The service is friendly for the most part[*], but as other reviewers have pointed out, they tend to lay it on a bit thick with the ""bonjours."" Similarly, the interior decor is a Disney caricature of a Parisian cafe: popular fin-de-siecle posters; an art deco metro sign; vintage post cards; etc.  The affectation doesn't bother me very much; I find its inauthenticity endearing, kind of like a high school French club.

They took excellent care of my Bullmastiff when she had to have emergency pyrometra surgery as a puppy and we have seen them for other minor health events.  We love this vet.  They really love animals and they have 4 doctors so it is easy to get a seond opinion.  The doctors have each other to consult with and that makes me feel more confident in them because let's face it...doctors are human beings and they can't always know everything.   I have met with all 4 doctors and each one gave me a good feeling.

The cooked items is what is keeping this from a 3.5/4 star review. The steamed lobster was fine (you can't mess up steamed lobster, as long as it is fresh), we had a few fish plates that were ok. Their seafood paella was probably the weakest of all the dishes we tried. It was quite bland, which usually is ok if the seafood can balance it out, but the whole dish was just bland.

I've been here for: lunch, dinner, & late night.  

Food review:  I love the concept.  If I were going to open a restaurant (someday, hopefully) I would open a place similar to Local.  The sandwiches I've had were really good, but seriously, if you're going to use giant bread/buns, the middle (meat, veggie, etc) between the bread probably shouldn't fit entirely on 1/3 of sandwich.  Fill the bitch up, or use smaller bread...it's like a short guy buying Magnums...you're not fooling anyone.  

Beer review:  How do you have such a weak tap selection when you have a very solid bottle selection?  I don't get it.  Get better draft beers.

Night life:  On an attractiveness scale, the clientele is better than average.  Not mind-blowing, but hey, it's Pittsburgh.  As others have said, it can get a bit douchey.  Also, when I'm drinking at night, I like some mood lighting.  But upstairs, I feel like I'm under a spotlight...wayyyy too bright.  Turn down the lights, I'd rather be surprised at 2am that disappointed at midnight.  I do like the big-ass fan upstairs though.  Downstairs, I like the open windows...I wish more places had this ""feel.""

You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes. 

We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.

I liked that they had seats and also an open ground area for ppl to sit. But if I had known I would have bought a blanket to spread on the ground...

But I was so thirsty I bought a Budweiser beer for $16.50 and Purelife water for $5.00. *omgee* even the hotdog stands outside sold sausages for $7.00. And I bought two sundaes for $5 each.

We sat at a little rustic table and were greeted promptly by the server. There is a huge menu board with listed specials and all the desserts. The server went over everything with us... Pay special attention to that board, lots of good stuff on there! 

The menu isn't overly extensive but there are plenty of options for everyone. We ordered the Shishito peppers... Omg... Cauliflower with the peppers was utter perfection. It was a generous portion and we both couldn't get enough. We will be ordering this dish religiously from now on. I ordered a vegan avocado roll. I thought I had asked for asparagus but I'm positive it was only cucumber and avocado. It was a generous portion and pretty delicious. It wasn't the best roll I've ever eaten... But it was good enough to order again. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly Kim chi fried rice... It came out in a hot skillet... Still sizzling. Being vegan, I couldn't try it... But judging by his reaction and raving review... I can definitely say, he loved it! For dessert... We opted for the strawberry red wine sorbet... WowZa! For only two bucks, they make it in house and it was fresh and full of real fruit. The wine aroma carried throughout each bite. We will definitely be back to try the other sorbet options! 

I ordered a Prosecco with a strawberry as my cocktail. It never disappoints. My boy boyfriend ordered the Bessie cocktail. It started out well but ended pretty awful. We probably won't be ordering that one again. 

Our waters were always full and our server was very accommodating. She asked the proper questions to the kitchen to ensure my food came out vegan and properly. She also warned me about the shrimp paste in the rice:) nice touch!! The prices are fair and the environment is perfect for a friendly lunch or a romantic date night!

Finally get called about 10:35 am, more than an hour later.  Leticia, counter 5, was to help me.  She was very ordinary - neither rude nor friendly.  I was doing a title change.  She got a new license plate and I did not like the number and asked if I could have another license plate.  She went to go check with someone and that person said she could not.  She said the only way I could get a different number was to get back in line.  Are you kidding me?

Honestly, I don't know how the people working there can stand the voice over the intercom calling out the numbers.  However, it did help that I had stuff to listen to on my phone and earbuds.  Thank God for that.

I realized Leticia was just doing her job and it wasn't her call to give me a different license plate.  She HAS TO GO IN ORDER.  Okay.  Guess that's their policy and she couldn't trade plates with another counter.  I would give Leticia a 3 star because she was just average and didn't go out of her way to do her job or give beyond her job customer service.  

As I looked at the LONG line to get numbers and all the people at the DMV, I reluctantly said I would get back in line.  Great.  The process of the lines is ridiculous.  I wish you could check in online and get a number and then there is a count down as to when you're like 15 minutes from the counter that you'd get a text or email telling you they are 15 minutes out before your time, etc.  That would be so much more efficient than the current process.  The current process, I give it a 1 star.

It's now 10:40 am and I'm back in line.  Finally my number was called and it was now about noon.  I get Connie at Window 10.  Wasn't going to take out my frustration on Connie.  She was SUPER pleasant.  She was very friendly, very personable.  I wish all the DMV people were as nice as she was.  She made me feel like a person, which I did not really feel like it with Leticia.  I give Connie a 5 star.

So between the 3 stars I would have given regarding my DMV experience, it averages to a 3 star.  Look for Connie, the blonde lady with a fantastic smile and hope you get her.  I left about 12:10 pm - 12:15 pm, so I was there for nearly 3 hrs.  Fun stuff.

I have been to this establishment previously and enjoyed the atmosphere and dinning experience.
I noticed that the Irish breakfast was no longer on the menu. I asked our server,  Stephanie, about it and was informed by her, after she looked for it, that they had a new executive chef and must have removed it from the menu.
Okay no big deal, I have eaten at plenty of Irish restaurants that did not have it on the menu. I found the bangers and mash. The menu stated it came with colcannon, mash potatoes with cabbage in it for those not familiar with the dish. It also had some kind of apple thing. When it arrived  the apples were all over it so as to not be able to taste the dish without tasting the apples, I hope this wasn't an effort to mask sub pare bangers or possibly just an ordinary sausage. I tried the colcannon only to find not a single piece of cabbage.
My dinner was very disappointing to say the least.

I was lured in by Thai Pepper's lunch specials and dragged my husband in, who was against coming in period (he said he had bad vibes about the place). Bad vibes be damned because I wanted a Thai lunch special for under $10!

Walking in, the place was decently packed and was staffed by only waiter. The waiter immediately seated us but then cautioned, ""We're really busy right now so it might be a little while"". Uh oh. I have a Con to get to, man! Right about now is when we realized that is was uncomfortably warm in the restaurant. I look at the thermostat - 82 degrees. Not the business. 

10 minutes go by. The waiter drops off waters and takes off in a hurry. Btw, the water tasted really bad. Another 10 minutes go by. I start getting antsy and my husband is glaring at me because he's hangry. We realize it's going to take FOREVER (in the Sandlot voice) to get our food and get outta there. We decided to leave and go elsewhere because time is precious. I felt bad for leaving while the waiter sadly watched us walk out, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

Worth a return visit?
Probably not. Don't come here for lunch if you're on a tight schedule!

I also like how they break down what ingredients are in the veggie burgers. I chose the vegan burger an my bfriend the double cheeseburger, along with yam fries. 
The staff were super friendly and chatty, so they would get 5 stars for service alone. 
When the burgers came out, they kindly separated our yam fries on to each plate. The fries were kind of floppy, not crispy like I'm used to having them. They come with skin on, which makes me think they are healthier than they probably are. Didn't think the portion size was worth the $4. 
My vegan burger was decent. Didn't have too much flavour, but it was my fault for not asking for enough sauce. The bun was nice and fresh and the sautéed mushrooms tasty, but I would have liked a few more on there seeing as its a topping you pay extra for. My bf enjoyed his burger. He also felt though that it was a tiny bit over priced for the portion size. I definitely would go back to Flippin' when I'm in the area again, and craving a  burger, simply for the fact that they use hormone free meat.

I ordered a waffle sandwich which was basically a waffle with apple jam inside folded in half.  It cost about $6.  Regular drinks were good and typical of any bubble tea place. I ordered a caramel macchiato though which tasted great and had a lovely design on it.

Facility: I loved the ambiance of the cafe.  It is very cozy, dimly lit and girly.  Despite this were were SEVERAL groups of only boy/guys/men hanging out here. Location is small, decor is nice.  Even when there is a lot of customers, it was never too loud. Music was slightly too loud (probably why everyone else was quiet). We stayed there for quite a bit and noticed the music looping constantly. Washroom isn't good, useable, but not good. The unit is located upstairs to another store (hard to find/or see). There is street parking which is good if you can get it, or paid Green P parking in the back. 

Service: Service was okay. They did their job but certainly didn't go above or beyond.

Overall: Cafe Princess is exactly what it sounds like. Girly, romantic, and warm. The food and drinks are not enough to attract me again but the ambiance is good for ""catching up with the girls"".

Really kind of dig the bar (physically) and the overall feel of the place.  Bunch of TVs, and not everything was sports (hey, sometimes it's fun to ad-lib for muted movies! - I don't care for sports in a bar generally, but some people will see that a plus).

Could do without the lack of tap selection; pretty weak overall.  Also, the gin selection is odd.  Many liquors seem to have 6-10 brands/bottles, while gin has 3 brands, 4 types (can't knock them for that though, just odd, being a gin drinker).",2011-10-30 01:36:43

After a few search from fellow yelpers I decided that Mantra Masala is exactly where I need to be.  Luckily I managed to kidnap 2 buddies of mine to help me ""experiment"" a little bit more since this was my second time ever having Indian food. 

Both my friends were new to Indian food as well I figured I'd order the Mantra's Mixed Grill which consist of most of their specialties for everyone to share; Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka, Bazari Chicken, and Barah Kabab (lamb).  All of which were pretty tender and spiced really well.  

Our server looked at us if like that wasn't enough, so I asked him to recommend us another dish to which he concluded that we should try the Chicken Tikka Masala. OMGggg this stuff was amazing!!  I didn't know this, but this is exactly what i've been looking for!! Not Curry! Spiced, boneless chicken roasted in clay oven, cooked in creamy tomato sauce.  I wanted to call my mom and cry because it was so darn good! ;(
There were plenty of sauce left that we dipped our Garlic Nan (leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic) into it, poured some over rice, and also dipped some of the Mantra's Mixed Grilled stuff into it as well :X

I could see why he wanted us to order the 2nd dishes because the portion were not that big at all.  Just enough which is perfect because we don't need to stuff ourselves with too much goodness.  A tad bit pricier, BUT over at Mantra Masala it's clear that they implement the philosophy's ""quality over quantity.""

We took a chance on The Flamingo last year because there weren't a ton of options within our budget for the 4th of July weekend.  I'd read the reviews so had a pretty good idea of what to expect.  My reasoning was that we wouldn't be spending a lot of time in the hotel room anyway, and for the price, the center-strip location would be hard to beat.

I should preface this by explaining I am not a prissy kind of girl, nor am I a germaphobe.  We've stayed in some pretty seedy hotels before...and survived to tell about it.  That being said, this was one of our more cringe-inducing experiences.  

Before going up to our room (which was one of the standard, outdated ones...not a modernized Go room, or whatever they're called), we asked whether we had any upgrade options, but were told that because of the holiday weekend, everything was booked.  We had very low expectations so made our way up to the room with hopeful optimism.  What greeted us in the hallway right outside our door was a pile of garbage and used tampons.  Yes, tampons.  Used.  But I reasoned that maybe housekeeping had had an unfortunate trash bin overflow or something.  Who knows.  Anyway.  Then we went into our room and found it to be just sort of smelly and gross.  My husband pointed out the mystery stains all over the carpet, but that really didn't faze me.  What did turn my stomach was what looked to be (excuse me while I gag...) poop smears above the headboard and on the ceiling above the bed.  Alright, so admittedly we didn't conduct a smell test or whip out our chemical analysis kit and therefore can't say with a hundred percent certainty that it was, in fact, poop.  But it was suspiciously disgusting.  After being told there weren't any other available rooms, we had little choice but to tough it out and just keep from touching...well, anything.  Our plan was to dump our stuff and just get the heck out of there.  As I freshened up in the bathroom, my gaze cautiously made its way up to the ceiling overhead, but by that point I wasn't all that surprised to see it was covered (covered!) with what looked like pubic hairs.  Ewwwww.  Again, I can't say for sure that my untrained eye would be able to discern the difference between leg hair, armpit hair, chest hair, or whatever...but you get the idea.  It was grotesque.  Not to mention puzzling. 

Our stay wasn't all bad.  My husband took it upon himself to talk to management and ended up getting us moved to a mini-suite, which was far from luxurious but a definite step up.  Clean, at least.  And spacious.  (Interesting that they were able to find a room when they had been ""completely booked"" earlier...but I digress.)  In both rooms, you could hear the music from the pool really loudly.  I'd suggest earplugs if you plan to sleep in past 9 or 10am.  The 21-and-over pool was awesome, we spent a lot of hours there.  We don't gamble so I can't say whether the casino was good or bad.  There weren't a ton of restaurant options within the hotel, so for meals and clubs, we ventured elsewhere.  As I recall, there wasn't a resort fee like at other hotels on the strip.  And parking was free.  Wi-fi was like $14 a day.

Would I stay here again?  Hmmmm.  The location really was convenient.  And the pool was almost good enough to persuade me, despite all the other negatives.  I don't know, maybe, we'll see.  I can't say I'd recommend this hotel, but if you do decide to stay here, it's probably worth the added expense to upgrade to a Go room.  Good luck...you may need it!",2012-07-02 00:28:30

The gnocchi is overrated. It sounds interesting that they do such fancy treatment to their pasta but if it doesn't make it taste better why bother?

We go to juice bars a lot.  Figured we would try a new one out.  On average I would say we wait 3 minutes for juice(2 of them) to be made once ordered, 5 minutes at most - and that is when it is busy.  In most juice bars there is 2, maybe 3 employees working.  Here, they had 4 and with no line it took somewhere between 10-15 minutes to get our juice.  During that time we got to watch one employee throw something that appeared to be food at another employee, one employee playing on a cell phone, and another dancing around with a garbage bag on her head.  All of which would honestly probably be okay if someone had just made our order in a somewhat timely manner.  When we did receive our juice, both were in mason jars.  Mine was sticky and hers was dripping beet juice from the bottom( a lot of it) which she luckily didn't get on her clothes(Ultimately what brought this down to one star).  We didn't exactly wait for perfection when it came to the juice.  Her Acai bowl came out quickly and she enjoyed it, but that was easily overshadowed by everything else.  

Nektar juice bar is 3 minutes from here, and The Juice Standard is 8 minutes from here.  With competitors that close that deliver the same product as good or better in a fraction of the time in containers that are easy to drink out of that aren't sticky or dripping, then why would we return here?  It sounds harsh, and it is harsh, but it is the reality of the situation.  

I would suggest looking into those competitors and what they are doing differently.",2015-03-19 21:35:43

I initially declined it because I'm being cautious about my caffeine intake, but the barista mentioned I could give it away to a coworker or a friend, so I ended up taking it and handed it off to the first person who responded in my office.
I was a bit weary of this location when it first opened up because I wasn't sure if the baristas will be as fast as the previous drive thru location I used to go to, and I didn't have any extra time on my morning schedule, but they've been quick and fast every morning so I get to work on time!",2016-12-21 17:50:42

Another 10 minutes for new fries. Here they come. Sriracha? Nope. Plain. Not going to send them back again. Granted, the fries, even plain were good fries. The chicken wings were delicious, got 3 flats, no drummettes. The mozzarella cheese sticks were delicious. Perfectly seasoned. Did not need any marinara. Stuffed fried raviolis were not good imo. I can't explain it just that the beef didn't taste like beef. Chicken fingers were good. Grilled cheese was good but the quesadillas were dissappointing. The potstickers were good in flavor but maybe need a little longer in the fryer as the inside was cool and mushy. The fish and chips were perfect. Wish they had tartar sauce or malt vinegar to go with but they don't. Our server brought us an aioli sauce that was pretty tasty with the fish. We ordered waffle fries to go with it but they were really hard. I recommend sticking with regular fries. Also, I want to point out that our server Courtnie was courteous and polite and when I sent back the parmesan fries, I asked her not to take the entire platter of apps back with her so we could start eating as we were starved. As we were asking for our bill, a large party of about 9 people were seated next to us. By the time we paid our check and we're leaving, maybe 15-20 minutes, they were already eating. Not sure why we were unlucky to have to wait so long. 

Games:
40% of the games we wanted to play were out of order. We played the Pacman air hockey game a few times and it was great fun but when we went back to play it again it was out of order. Sucks because my daughter is limited to what she can play due to being in a wheelchair. Lots of the games require you to transfer into a seat or are on a platform that isn't accessible and those that aren't were limited due to so many being out of order. I was happy to see Pinball machines and show my kids how to play it. I believe there were 6 machines but only 3 were working properly. We ended up leaving with 416 minutes of unlimited play still on our card.",2017-12-18 03:30:44

Our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.

Here's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? 

Additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.
 
On a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.

Final verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.",2013-06-02 20:40:01

Cheeseburger - pretty good but fries weren't fresh
Kids meal chicken - good size can't complain 
Lumpia - frozen but good
Musubi - too hot the rice and soggy because too much sauce (rice should be room temp not straight out the steamer or else for sure gonna be soggy)

zGeCNY9hmKtqtRYK_Yr45A,X2AiYF7z32_0Oitl4aYXwg,-WVF5DKZeEWlMK8Cucto-A,4,2,0,0,"I do love Savoy and all the class that it brings to the Strip District and Pittsburgh. I've had the opportunity to come here a few times now and never has it been a disappointment. 

The downstairs main dining area and bar, bringing back a ballroom classy vibe. With its elegant interior and absolutely excellent happy hour menu it's hard to not feel engulfed in a feeling of class and comfort. I look forward to being dressed nicely for this location, as you only should be. Savoy has a lovely mix of cocktails, fun, experimental martinis and naturally mixed drinks and a lovely wine selection. It's hard not to try them all. If you would like to, make sure to drop by happy hour when they are half off. 

If you are not here for dinner, make sure to stumble through their bar list. The peanut Satays are Pittsburgh award winning, the chocolate raviolis filled with butternut squash are to die for and back when they had their swirl mac n cheese I could not get enough of just comfort food happiness [I hope that comes back that's why it's on here]. I would suggest opting for the calamari over the fried chicken wings if you are looking for crunch, the calamari is fantastic. Naturally you can keep it light with the Chef's Cheese platter or the Pear and Gorgonzola salad.

For a dinner, we were a group of six for my birthday dinner and we were naturally a little of all over the place. The filet is to amazing with the asparagus and mushrooms. The pasta dishes are on the heavier and decadent side so opt for fish if you would like something a tad lighter. With the new menus they also offer gluten free items marked with a GF beside the item.

Upstairs, Savoy offers a lovely lounge to hand with your friends and an outdoor patio perfect for warm Friday summer nights. If you are still in the mood to snack, a smaller lounge menu is available as well. 

In case parking is too difficult for you, let the Valet take care of this before you meddle around with their parking lot. I personally bump into things all the time [this is without martinis]

All in All Savoy is an absolutely lovely establishment, well worth the visit on a classy, calm night out to catch up with a good girlfriend or a nice date with your significant other.

It might be because I've come here twice around closing time (e.g. 11pm on a weekday) despite the website saying they are 'open late.' The drinks have been good but the food has been mediocre. This is not the spot for a late night bite as the kitchen closes at 11pm on weeknights.

It was a Monday eveing/night and it was pretty full. They have 2 services so I took the 8pm one when I reserve online. We showed up an hour earlier sinxe it was nice out and they seemed to have a nice cocktail list, we thpught we'd just relax at the bar or whatever.
We were seated outside on the terrace and ended up staying there the whole night when we found out that the BBQ is only available for tables on the terrace ( Also the guests who reserved the table outside actually liked the inside so everything worked out perfectly for everyone)
The place is very cute. The terrace a little cramped when all the tables are filled but we managed. The inside is very cute as well, would be nice for a date. The staff is very nice, polite and helpful. We could tell it was very hot as they were sweaty but they never lost their smiles and enthusiasm.

We had a few cocktails to start with and they were all very good. Then we had dumplings & 3 salads: crispy spicy duck, mango and green papaya and all were delicious. My fav is the duck. The we had the small BBQ which was more than enough for 4 of us and had 3 desserts: pandan tapioca, pandan creme caramel & mango & sticky rice, all yummy.

I would come back here to try the other dishes in the menu :)",2018-08-15 03:09:41

Fortunately/unfortunately, that ""something new"" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!

Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?

As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol.
 
Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the ""Free margarita with the purchase of an entrée"" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!

Ugh, what did I do to you chick, I just wanted some extra toast!

The place was almost empty when we arrived on a Friday night, and we were quickly shown to a nice table by the window. Shortly after placing our order, however, a party of three and a baby were seated at the table right next to ours -- despite the fact that there were many, many other empty tables in the joint.

Now, here's what I've struggled with. Do I make this review all about our experience next to this table of inconsiderate diners? Or do I focus on the food alone? I've decided to go with the former, since the staff felt it was okay to place a small infant at a table *right next to another one* despite ample space in the restaurant.

My appetizer, the Chicken Ginger Tikka (Chicken breast marinated in lemon juice, crushed ginger & garlic, cooked over charcoal), was actually pretty good and I did enjoy it quite a bit. It was only after I'd finished eating it that the aforementioned baby really started to express its displeasure at being out of the house.

The baby wailed for a solid half hour (and probably kept going long after we'd left). Nobody at the table made any effort to shut the baby up, and in fact, they all just started talking louder. The staff not only didn't do anything about this, but basically ignored our table for the rest of our meal. I would've ordered another alcoholic beverage, but nobody asked if I wanted one. Worse still, our water stayed empty right up until it was time to pay the bill.

My main was the Shrimp Masala (Tiger shrimp sautéed with peppers & garlic in tomato & onion masala) and my dessert was the Gulab Jamun (Dumplings cooked in light syrup with saffron & pistachios), but because of the absolutely intolerable ambiance, I was forced to wolf them down in an attempt to get the hell out of there. (I should note, however, that the shrimps were not peeled. The laziness of the chef meant that I was forced to spend a few minutes attempting to peel each of the four or five shrimps, with the endeavor made all-the-more difficult by the sauce that they were soaked in.)

All in all, this was one of the worst, most annoying meals I've had in a very, very long time. Neither of us enjoyed our meals, since we raced through the entree and dessert portions. The fact that we paid about $100 for such an experience is something I won't forget for a long, long time.",2016-07-16 12:10:59

My wife ordered the chocolate pancakes and she barely made a dent in it. Now this is a woman who will bathe in chocolate if she could, but she didn't care much for it. I had scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon and hash browns. It was pretty average.

It's honestly great for a cheap meal - the food isn't particularly outstanding, but it fills you up and it feels good going down. You can get a huge margarita or beer for about $5 (or less - I can't remember the exact price), and you have to try one of their signature beer-ritas at least once (they stick a mini bottle of Corona upside down into your margarita)! The Sun Devil beer-rita is my favorite - the mango flavor is awesome. 

There's a little bit of inconsistency with how the tacos are made - I've gone some times when they've been very dry and light on toppings, other times when they've been so overflowing that I literally can't pick them up, and others when they've been just right. You can't complain too much for what you're paying. Taco Tuesday is discounted tacos - be ready to wait 10-15 minutes in line! Ample seating, though, so don't worry about getting a table.

I eat fish almost daily, and I for one hate going out and blowing big bucks on fish I can easily prepare at home. For less than 1/2 the price, I can do what most places do. BUT (major but) there are a handful of spots out there that get it right and I am willing to eat fish at.... Cuttlefish is one of them.

~Fud/Drinks~
So the one kicker about this place which I found out during an Elite event the owner took part in, is that the majority of the seafare comes in fresh caught that same day. Ownership prides themselves on responsibly sourced food that tastes great and is great for you. I have had the opportunity to enjoy a bevvy of options, and can attest to the quality of the sauces and ingredients. As a fish lover, something as simple as Petra Sole can be exquisitely and masterfully cooked. No single dish lacks quality, even appetizers are fresh made. When you come in and sit down, you immediately see a really nice oyster bar. I highly suggest coming during Happy Hour (3pm-7pm EACH day) and trying some discounted oysters from this place. Really high quality stuff. On Wednesdays specifically, its 1/2 price oysters and champagne..can't beat it. Drinks by the way, are magnificent here. I enjoyed the Sake To Me cocktail primarily made up of coconut sake and tequila. It was delectable. My partner in crime enjoyed a couple cocktails, one with white cranberry's that have been soaking for 2 weeks! Holy infusion Batman! She was hankering for a 3rd before we bowed out. The bill was well worth it. We both agreed that the drinks alone were worth a drive back here....

~Atmosphere/Service~
Service is superior to most basic restaurants, and on par with what you would expect at a high-level restaurant like this. The waiter offered up suggestions from the wine list and was personable, attentive, and kept us satisfied with solid service. Atmosphere is a hit and miss, it is very busy during happy hours, however dead hours are just that...dead. It is not Red Lobster, folks...Not everyone is eating here daily. With lightly decorations, lower lighting and an inviting bar area with marble counter-top, the restaurant has a sleek look you would expect once again from a nice Scottsdale Corridor restaurant.

~The Downlow~
Overall, 4 stars goes out to Cuttlefish for the freshness and quality of fish, solid service, and superb happy hour options. As I come back more, they will probably earn that extra star...In time, as I say. If you are anywhere in the East Valley, you will be hard-pressed to find anything offering as fresh of fish as they do here. It is imperative you try Cuttlefish, to taste the difference and experience the quality for yourself. A great date option, it is Jefe approved gents!

VIBE 
Club impresario Charles Kabouth is behind this operation so it's going to be a scene here --starting with its clandestine location behind Weslodge (oh, surprise! we couldn't get in there). The interiors are gorgeous and obviously a lot of detail went into it.  I'm a fan of the bar and the bar seats are quite comfortable! You'll definitely want to stay a while. 

 The hostess was a bit of a snot. We were just coming into the bar and she didn't even greet us - she just kind of waved us over to the bar. Another thing: I've had friends trying to call to get a reservation before and he had quite a bit of trouble doing so. The bar staff were much more receptive. And surprise! Everyone working here looks like a model.

Sangria. It's expensive, yes but it's boozy and you need to take your time with it. It was very good Sangria. Kind of reminds me of what Nyood was doing a few years ago. Average cocktail prices here are $15.

Good sangria. I'm not sure about paying $30 for imported iberico ham (from what I've seen/heard). It's overpriced. That said,  I'm curious to try to their tapas. But if you want to impress and be part of the ""scene,"" then this is a good place to do so.",2012-12-09 04:37:11

So the Lougheed Lunch is $25 and it comes with a soup or salad, an braised entrée or fish and a dessert or fruit salad. 

I picked the soup, braised entrée and the chocolate brownie.

The soup was fantastic. I don't know all the ingredients in it but it had potatoe, bacon chives, etc and its a crème based soup. Delicious. It was an eye opener. The braised croquette is  basically a braised beef with a nice croquette batter. I remember something about chipotle sauce and that was about it. Yes she did listed the ingredients in the dishes but there were so many that we just don't remember.

Vermicelli

Create a hotpot from this.  The only thing that I would recommend to Mekong Palace for the hot pot area, which you cook yourself at your table, is that they provide some recommended combinations on the hot pot menu based upon what they see being ordered.

All the trails range in difficulty levels. My personal favorite is Ice Box Canyon.

What I love about Dolce is there rainbow of flavours. They have all the bases covered from fruity, chocolaty, savory, sweet, sour, and some crazy flavours for the adventurous.
Not only do they have a massive gelato selection but they also sell a ton of other Italian desserts, cookies, pastries, cakes, tea/coffee drinks, as well as alcoholic beverages.

After pacing back and forth infront of the glorious display of gelato I finally decided on my selection. I went with a Medium cup which lets you get two flavours for $5.50. 

Royal Pistachio - pistachio gelato with pieces of candied pistachio, tiny pieces lemon-lime chewy italian gummies, and regular bits of roasted pistachios
I absolutely adored the combination of sweet & salty of the pistachios plus the textures of smooth gelato with crunchy and chewy bits. Definitely a different but delightful play on your ordinary pistachio gelato

Reese's Peanut Butter - My absolutely favourite chocolate turned into gelato
It tasted exactly like a reese's peanut butter cup with pieces of the chocolate chopped up inside to add some texture. I loved every bit!

We were celebrating 2 people in the group and had let one of the servers know that their meals/drinks were to be covered by the rest of the group.

Our servers were great, very knowledgeable and quite accommodating.  We had underestimated the number of people who would be attending and they easily added a couple more tables to our already large area. It was a busy Thursday evening so, it was no easy task.

While I cannot speak for everyone in the group, the 7 people in my area quite enjoyed their meals...not a single complaint.  We had a person with a severe seafood allergy and they were able to pinpoint which dishes were safe for her to order without any back and forth between the kitchen.

If you go, make sure to order the mango sushi rolls and beef skewers. Be careful of the sushi pizza because it's either a hit or a miss, the first time we ordered it was okay but the second time it tasted oddly sweet/sugary. Also be careful if you order ramen because it tastes just like making instant noodles at home ((except more bland)).

I found that the ordering process was very confusing. If you don't specify how many sushi rolls or (for example) pieces of sushi pizza you want, they only give you one. The menu doesn't say how many pieces come with your order, so you would assume that they'll give you a bunch ... but no. You have to tell them exactly how many pieces you want.

We also found that the kitchen would get our orders mixed up sometimes and not give us enough of something and we would have to request more.",2015-08-07 06:30:09

I ordered a delicious Reisling and linguine pescatora. Spicy but really good! Had plenty to take home for leftovers too wooo! Got a cheese and meat platter for an appetizer to share - the candied onions and bell peppers on it were phenomenal! The presentation of that dish was kind of ugly but flavors were good! Also got the cucomber and tomato salad as a starter and the dressing on it was perfect.  

I definitely plan to come back! It is also the perfect spot for a romantic date!

UPDATE: Bought the Groupon for that date idea and came for a weekday lunch. Waiter barely seemed to care about us once he found out we had a Groupon. He gave us regular menus and saiid we could pick anything for the Groupon. Then he came back after we were ready to order (and excited!!!!) and told us we actually had to use the special Groupon menu. The Groupon menu only had about 6 entree courses and three appetizers - compared to a HUGE regular menu. Most of the Groupon items were sandwichs...little french influence. We were pretty bummed.

I ended up redeeming for two slices of pizza and a bottle of diet coke for $15. I got the Gotham and the Margherita - both were good, but nothing I'd clamor to return for.

For appetizers, our party of three split the barley salad with baby artichokes and the duck confit.  The salad was interesting - interesting texture similar to rice but with a good amount of acidity from the tomatoes.  The duck is basically a leg quarter that's cooked to a super juicy consistency with a crispy skin on the outside.  It's served on a bed of buttery polenta.  This dish will make you a fan of duck!

For main course, I always get the roast chicken - basically Bouchon elevates this dish like no other.  It's roasted to perfect consistency and like the duck has a crisp, buttery skin.  They offer some roasted potatoes and Brussels sprouts too.  The chicken meat is perfectly cooked and the sauce is amazing too.

My wife had the mussels in saffron broth with truffle fries, which were generous portions.  Our 14-yr old niece had the grilled ham and cheese (topped with a fried egg) with fries.  It looked pretty tasty since she scarfed it all down.  Note that Bouchon is fairly generous in portion size - so no need to order extra sides of fries.

For desserts, it's hard to do better than the chocolate bouchons (3 brownies per order) with peppermint ice cream.  Sweet balanced by minty refreshing flavor.  The other dessert was the eggnog pot a Creme, with two shortbread cookies.  This was also amazing - similar to a panna cotta with a unique flavor.",2013-01-05 13:31:17

Ribs and chicken or chicken and catfish or any combination with ribs and pulled pork or even chicken wings.

The tone of this place is scary.  Sure, it is a chain and the neighbourhood is pretty good.  But, when you look closer, it seems that either some bad shit has gone down or they are preparing for some bad shit to go down.

The tip jar...its filled with water.  My guess is to stop, or prevent, people from stealing the tips.  The bathroom, disgusting.  There was no lid on the tank of the toilet.  When I flushed, it spat.  Thankfully I was not standing within firing range.  No paper towels.  It was a hover, quickly wash hands, wipe them on pants, get out and use your hand sanitizer.

The barista took my order but stared at me until I gave her money.  I saw some friends walking by and waved at them, I guess I did not dip into my wallet as quickly as she would have liked.

The Annex is not the kind of neighbourhood that I feel unsafe in.  In this Lettieri - I did not feel safe.  I felt like a drug bust was going to go down or a rowdy group was about to enter.

Went there on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed and chaotic in there. Service was decent and someone would come around frequently to change the grill plates if needed.

Being familiar with Korean cuisine, I was able to recognize most of it but my friend was very confused about what many items were. There is a decent selection of meats, but none looked very fresh. And the conditions were a bit unsanitary as tongs were haphazardly thrown around and covered with meat juices. We tried a bit of everything, some beef, chicken, and pork. They tasted fine for the most part, but nothing to rave about or go back for seconds.

We checked this place out on Saturday. We were dressed up because we were attending a reception for a wedding later on and we were just trying to kill time. There weren't too many people in there and majority of the TVs were focused on the Pitt game with a few other games sprinkled throughout. 

First win: PUMKING! I am seriously in love with that stuff. The bartender was incredibly nice and funny and social, which is how I like my bartenders. I mean, shouldn't they all be like that? Customer service is pretty much your job, but I digress ...

We didn't eat anything, as I said, we were heading to a reception afterwards, but we got to enjoy some beers and watch a bit of the Penn State and FSU games, my two favorite teams, so that was nice. The TV setup was in such a way that no matter where you were sitting you could see the game, a feature most sports bars in this town seem to be lacking. Prices and selection seemed on point and the bartender hooked it up! :) All in all I was super satisfied.",2012-09-17 21:02:43

Found this place back in March only because we parked on the north end of Town and Country to get to Pizza Bianco. Saw it, figured it was worth a shot as it was happy hour.

Worst thing you can hear when walking into any restaurant is ""Have you been here before"" and/or ""do you know how it works."" 

If the answer is anything other than ""sit your ass down, we'll take your order and bring you food and drink like every other normal restaurant,"" then chances are you're in a pretentious hipster hellhole and are going to have a bad time. Take a wild guess which realm Hopdoddy falls into... As if the douchetacular name isn't enough of an indication. 

Thankfully, you can dodge this off-putting bullet by sitting at the bar, which we did. Normal service here. 

First time, ordered the Buffalo Bill (medium) and fries, along with a beer and some sort of cocktail with a hip and ""clever"" name. Burger was surprisingly solid, one of the best I've had in restaurant. I rarely ever order burgers because they always disappoint compared to what I make on the grille. This one was great, and came cooked as asked. Fries were ultra-salty, and over seasoned. Pass on these, especially since they are an upcharge. 

Beer list is typical AZ swill; nothing really good, but goes with their mission of being hip by sourcing local crap. 

Service was pretty good on the first visit. Attentive bartender that was friendly.

Second visit, not so much. Place was practically dead during Friday happy hour, a far cry from how busy it was a few months prior. Sat at the bar, and had to deal with one of the worst bartenders ever. Aside from the fact that she looked like she just woke up seconds before we walked in, she was the polar opposite of the guy I had on my first visit. 

And the burger this time was horrible. It was something made out of prime rib, ordered medium. Showed up closer to rare than medium rare. Bun was sopping wet with juice, sure sign that these are not cooked at a high enough temp, made far ahead of time, and likely frozen. No bueno. 

The happy hour isn't anything special, and if the service and food are this hit and miss, then why bother? Plenty of other places that do it right and do it better.",2016-06-14 14:26:56

Arriving around 5:30pm, our group of 4 adults and 2 stinkies had the choice of any table in the joint. They offered high chairs which we readily accepted, if only to cage in the toddlers.

Menu was pretty simple.  We ordered the fish & chips (one piece -$12), burger ($15) and kids mini-burger ($7).  Decent beer selection so we went with tall boys of the Farmer's Daughter's Ale ($6.50) and a scotch for the little one - er, I mean milk.

Service was swift and our order was out in good time.  The batter on the fish was pretty amazing - light, fluffy, not overly greasy.  But it was the burger that really stood out - perfectly cooked, juicy and flavourful!  I didn't get too many fries with my portion of fish & chips so I had to steal in on the fries that came with the burger.  The kids meal mini-burger came with veggies and dip as a side.

Farmer's Daughter has some really great specials including a beer/burger combo for $19 and buck-a-shuck but it's for the bar seats only, and they are really rigid in their rules.  I can see this for the weekend or at peak times but when it's Wednesday night and there is only 1 table occupied, I'd suggest maybe being a bit more lax on the rules to make the customers happy.

After watching Top Chef: Las Vegas for the first time ever, it got me wanting to explore and learn more about the culinary world. Then in my multi-task mode I went looking for places to eat in Las Vegas for my recent trip there. The words ""Thomas Keller"" and ""Michelin rated"" came up and so I was sold on Bouchon. 

With more than 600 reviews I'll just add some nice things for when someone else is on a similar search for nice places to eat in Vegas in hopes that a Yelp review will steer them in the right direction especially if you're not feeling eating buffets all the time...this is a nice change of pace. 

Brunch is excellent here. It's relaxed but at the same time you're experiencing some fine dining. I've had people tell me after I went, that every time they come to Vegas with their family, they go to Bouchon.  

I like pastries and with so many choices I just decided to go with an assortment of four pastries in the Bouchon Pastry Basket. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=mHIby3_tPU4T_b9Jubc7fg
They're all good but filling. Another instance where I was eating with my eyes and not with my stomach.

I had the Chicken and Waffles and they were the best. Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is great too but Bouchon delivers it like no other. 

The Croque Madame was as good as advertised and the pommes frites were delicious. Leave it to the French to make great French Fries. 

It was all so filling that I couldn't possibly fit dessert. But then I saw the table across from me all come in just to eat dessert and I cried a little bit when I saw the various dessert options. Then they proceeded to savor every bit as if to rub it in my face. I tried to focus on the fact that we had a table overlooking the pool in the Venetian or that our waiter had been especially helpful in providing an excellent dining experience but none of that puts amazing looking profiteroles in my stomach. 

I guess I'll just have to wait until they open the Bouchon in Beverly Hills later this year. But if you're in Vegas and want a great place to eat for anytime in the day then Bouchon is a can't-miss restaurant.",2009-10-22 20:13:01

The tenders were also pretty good but not much different than anywhere else. The mac n cheese was bad, took one bite and ditched it. The chicken breast and rolls on the other hand were amazing. I'd honestly say both were better than anything I've had at any fast food restaurant, ever. I'd make a trip back just to get the breasts and rolls, they're that good. 

They do have the new business awkwardness with the employees, but I'm sure that will work out with time.

The bartender I dealt with, Michael, was pretty cool.  I came in here with a coworker around 10pm on a Sunday night (both in town for meetings) and it was a decent experience.  The bar was clean.  Drinks were a bit pricey, but I tend to tip a little on the high side when I am drinking so I can't knock them here.  The atmosphere was a bit lacking.  No music, no ESPN or other TV noise... Kinda.. just conversation.

I am a vodka guy so I did not pay attention to much else.  They seem to be very heavily loaded on middle shelf, but not many top shelf.  I opted for Skyy, can't go wrong there.  There was a significant selection of draft beers if that is your thing...

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place.  It isn't overly impressive by any means though.  The service was good, but in essence it is the bartenders job to be responsive and cool.

At this point rivaling many of the industry's biggest names in terms of styles, awards and distribution, a total of over thirty Lagers, Stouts, Pilsners and Ales including their eponymous IPA and 312 Urban Wheat commonly found at Bars, Grocers and Liquor Stores across the globe, fans of Goose Island Beer Company are a devout group frequently encountered in the MidWest and although the company sold to Anheuser-Busch in 2011 most will say the quality has not diminished, the only real change being an improvement in the products' previous scarcity.

Founded by John Hall in 1988 and growing the brand out of a small Chicago brewery into an empire of Pubs spanning seven cities including Las Vegas as of June 2016, one could say that Goose Island was one of the first American Craft Beer manufacturers to really strike it big, the 3,500 square foot location inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino playing host to two for lunch during the first Saturday of College Football in 2017.

Formerly home to The Ainsworth, a shadowy Sports Lounge across from Vinyl that had never seemed particularly hospitable, Goose Island Pub picks up where the former tenant left off by retaining its dual ports of entry but by opening one up and redecorating with blonde woods, better lights and more televisions the space instantly feels more welcoming, a recent tweak by Hard Rock Executive Chef Bradley Manchester seeing the space ditch Pretzels, Pizzas and Tots in favor of a menu built around the Windy City and several classic American Sandwiches.

Not especially fond of Beer and dining with a total teetotaler, the obvious focus thus on Food and the scene with a particularly brisk Iced Tea refreshing palates between bites, it was after greetings from a well-inked Bartender soon joined by a blonde female server in short-shorts that the menu was perused, the eventual order including a half-dozen items including three Sandwiches with everything sent out at a leisurely pace across three courses.

Largely familiar with the company and its first BrewPub, a favorite of family during their time in Chicago though the food had never technically been tasted, it was with Oregon State playing across several Televisions while the Yankees occupied others that conversation carried on beneath Rock music, the first round featuring a metal bucket of Crispy Bacon and Peanuts with a Spicy Maple Glaze alongside thin slices of garlicky Pita and a skillet of stewed Tomatoes, Pepperoni, Basil and bubbling Mozzarella.

Not the sort of place to cut corners, the spicy Giardiniera, Sweet & Sour Peppers, Pico de Gallo and Buns all made in-house daily, it was with the last few bites of Relish finished off that two sandwiches arrived in white wrapping, the presentation doing no justice to the package's actual contents as both the juicy roast Beef and Pork were as good as what one will find in Chicago or Philadelphia, the former served with plenty of Peppers on a toasted Hoagie capable of standing up to its contents even after a dip in Jus while the later could make fans of Tommy DiNic's do a double take.

Equally presenting classics alongside novelties, platters of hand-cut Fries offered plain or with any number of toppings including Hot Sauce or Chili, it was a bit of a shock that the other man at the table stated he'd ""never had *real* Poutine"" when a platter slathered in melted Curds and rich Beef Gravy arrived, the bastardization of the dish largely due to the Québécoise themselves but Manchester's version true to the real thing while the Green  Chili Pork channeled the Southwest with tender roasted Butt spiced up by Cayenne and Black Peppers even before the smoky Green stuff was added along with Pepper Jack, Onions and Tomatoes plus a Sunny-Side Egg on a fluffy Kaiser Roll.

***1/2:  Thus far not really capturing the hearts of Las Vegans or Tourists, the fact that much of the Hard Rock's clientele comes from Los Angeles as opposed to Chicago at least partly at play, Goose Island is a very strong entry amongst the city's best places to catch a game, though in order to truly stand out the presentation of Sandwiches could stand to be a little more creative while game-sounds as opposed to music from the Casino floor would also be much appreciated.",2017-08-30 11:08:00

This review combines the 2 experiences I have had here. First off, the atmosphere is drab. Maybe it's me.. and this may seem snobby to you, but the appearance and decor at a sushi joint really means a lot in my book. I love a sleek setting with the right lighting for sushi. It adds to the experience. Hon Machi looks dated. The odor when entering was not appetizing, and on the second visit during the day, I did notice some small flies inside the restaurant. On trip #1 (a Friday night), we sat at a table. The place was dead, but service was still very slow. The food wasn't terrible, but nowhere near what some of my preferred places do. Maybe they had an off night, so I gave it another shot here recently. Trip #2 sealed the deal for me. The rolls were all falling apart. Nothing seemed fresh. The owner even apologized to us for how bad the sushi was as she delivered it to us from the chef's station. Crazy right?. Flies, stank, slow service, and sub par sushi.. Truly a disappointment-",2014-12-01 19:48:04

Although B&B is decent, I was somewhat deflated after the experience and hoped for just a touch better.  First, their menu is pretty enticing.  I've never tried short ribs stuffed into a burger before, so I went for it.  I even ordered a Cesar salad and some fried risotto to start.  My other half ordered the classic burger and we shared some parmesan fries.  First off, the cesar was just a salad, nothing special, something bottled, so we weren't impressed.  Next, the fried risotto balls were okay, but they weren't something I'd go nuts over or dream about.

Here's the kicker.

I was hoping that my first short rib stuffed burger experience would be great.  Unfortunately, it was just okay. I think if they mixed the short ribs in to the burger patty, it would've been a better result.  In the end it was okay, but not something I'd come back for over and over again.

We decided to try the soda fountain, so we ordered an old fashioned soda.  It came in a bottle.  I was somewhat confused because I assumed the soda counter had the club soda and the syrups to mix by order, but I guess not.  Oh well.

Baguette is a quaint breakfast/lunch spot that caters not just to the surrounding office community but to savvy locals who want good food and a great ambiance.
Olivier is welcoming and greets every guest like an old friend. The pastry chef moves about the kitchen bringing out scrumptious treats like tarts, muffins and the fresh baked croissants. These croissants will completely spoil you forever. It would have been a sin not to have one. The warm buttery aroma wafts through the air like a warm blanket for your olfactory senses. Close your eyes, sit at a table bathed in morning sunlight, drink a fresh mango orange juice, then take a bite of heaven.
The Croissant & egg omelette was incredible. The omelette is prepared to outstanding culinary standards, the croissant is light, flaky with a thin layer of buttery soft dough that almost melts in your mouth as you take a bite, there is a light tomato basil sauce that elevates it above all other breakfast croissants and it is served with a small house salad so you can have a serving of greens.
I am elated to have finally experienced Baguette Cafe and will make this a regular morning ritual at least once a week. ""Bon Appetite!""",2015-03-06 17:15:22

I was definitely disappointed with this establishment. My boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant out for our anniversary dinner and made a reservation earlier in the day. The person that took our phone call even asked if it was for a special occasion and we told her we were celebrating our anniversary. 

We get to the restaurant and asked the hostess if it was alright for us to purchase some drinks at the bar and then sit for our dinner. She said it wouldn't be a problem at all so we decided to wander around the resort with drinks in hand. About 15 minutes later, we came back to the hostess stand to find a new hostess. She walked us to our table and we were greeted by our server. He wasn't exactly very friendly or warm. We ask him a few questions about the menu and then decided to take a few minutes to look it over. About ten minutes go by before we see him again.

We both ordered the filet. A side of the mushrooms, crab cakes, potato gratin and a few sauces. The meal also came with complimentary popovers and a taste of some sort of liver pate. The only thing I was impressed with was the popovers. Nothing else stood out. The service was mediocre. Our server checked on us when the food arrived and after we had a few bites. When I said he wasn't very warm or friendly, I really meant to say he had a cold demeanor. I understand that you didn't expect to take this career path at the age of 45 or whatever but you could at least try to smile. 

Do not order the mushrooms. The crab cakes were edible - they tried to create a southwestern version that ultimately failed. The potato gratin - nothing special. I could have bought frozen potato gratin from Costco that would have been ten times better. 

How was the dessert? I wouldn't know and that is pretty upsetting because I have the biggest sweet tooth. Our server never brought it up after we had our leftover steak boxed up. I wanted dessert but felt that it would be a burden to have him take my order so we just gave up on this place, paid our tab and left. It was the most disappointed I have ever been with a steakhouse. I'm not sure if I will give it another try. Spending $200+ on a disappointing meal is not very attractive. It was our anniversary on top of it all. We should have just gone to Ocean Club like we originally planned. This is what we get for trying out a new place that had decent reviews. 

I think I would have less negative feelings if the staff recognized that it was also our anniversary. I mean, why bother asking when we made the reservation when no one would acknowledge it when we were there. 

I'm giving this place two stars instead of one only because I enjoyed the popovers and the steak was okay. Second chance? I'm really not sure.",2016-02-01 01:23:46

Captain's Boil has opened its third location at York Mills and Don Mills, which is more accessible than the other two locations if you're driving. There's ample parking here as well since you're sharing the lot with three other very busy restaurants.

In terms of the three locations, this one easily has the biggest restaurant space, and IMO has the most unique design. The lobster painted on the wall was very well done, and there's lots of TVs around so it feels like a sports bar (no, it's not a sports bar).

I came here on a Saturday night with my family and the place was full seated, but there was no lineup. Considering the lack of advertising for this place (found out thru someone who works here) that's actually pretty good. Having been to Captain's Boil before I have a good idea of the menu, although there are some items here that are exclusive, at least from what I remember, such as chicken slices.

I ordered the usual pounds of clams, one with captain's boil sauce and the other with garlic sauce. I also decided to try some of their exclusive items, such as chicken slices and red sausage. Their clams are a lot bigger and juicier than the Yonge/Finch location, which was quite nice. However, what really surprised me were the chicken slices. They were really juicy! I didn't really have much expectations as I thought they were just normal chicken slices, but nope...definitely some of the best I had. The red sausage was also very good as well.

The sauce itself was similar to the other locations, so I assume the same formula was used. However the cajun sauce is a little oily for what it is.

Service was excellent, which was impressive considering this place just opened. I was told the workers here had training in the other locations before they were moved, which was really smart of management.

I definitely recommend this location if you're coming from the highway, and for those who haven't tried Captain's Boil because of location...give it a try now!",2016-05-08 18:30:30

Delivery was sooner than what I expected!  Good!

My first bite into the scallops dish that I ordered had that sharp, metallic flavor that scallops can sometimes have, which was an immediate turnoff and a little scary....but I kept eating it.  The sharp taste was only in the first one.  Also, I guess i should remember that scallops are somewhat 'porous"" and will absorb flavors and colors from dishes in which they are combined so my scallops adopted a somewhat brownish cast.....tasted fine; looked funny.

The Mongolian Beef was delicious.  I love the beef used in Chinese food, and theirs was perhaps the best I've ever tasted in the Valley, and certainly the most tender.

The eggrolls are good sized and tasty....I hate it when egg rolls are so small they might be mistaken for someone's finger!  These were closer to what I was used to back home.

Also it is best not to confuse this establishment with Cafe Medina across the street. Situated on 1st Street SW in between 10th and 11th Avenue. The general area is a little sketchy but I think it adds character to the experience itself.

Quick Tip: Twist the door handle to enter or you might find yourself standing there like a fool for a few minutes until you figure that out.

I haven't been to Cafe Med in a really long time actually so I thought it was a perfect excuse to visit and see what experiences I will have this time around with the Yelp crew.

Cafe Med has a very traditional interior with its basically reddish color scheme. Low benches and seats with pillows randomly placed everywhere. There is one or two tv's if thats your ting. One thing I could do without is the extremely loud music, it was so loud at times I thought I might be at some concert, front row, totally rocking out - you know? Or perhaps in an extreme belly dancing class who knows.

I ordered a Peach Italian Soda like I always do, it is actually quite delicious! You just need to remember to really mix up the syrup or you will have espresso shots of syrup each time you sip.

For food, I ordered the BBQ Schwarma Pizza which I thought was delicious. I would like to try out all the different kinds. I like the crust and how the pizza is made as well. I did feel guilty eating it like Tiffany and Sarah Louise were secretly judging me (probably were, just kidding, care bear stare!)

We also ordered two Sheesha pipes as well, can't recall which flavors but I did enjoy them both and I thought it was cool that servers came around with fresh coals all the time. I hate changing the coals myself, feel like I'm gonna cause some kinda disturbance.

Lastly, my one suggestion for Cafe Med is pay better attention to their patrons. My friends are regulars there, I know what's up with everything and it doesn't matter who you are the level of service should be the same. Perhaps I'm spoiled with people always tending to me. Really though, when people pay separately you should keep track or else Angelo would have paid for a pipe that didn't exist. Also it would be fantastic to remember to bring back teapots with more hot water if you said you would take away them to replenish them. Aside from that I don't mind asking them again for people either. I want my friends to have a good experience as well.

The place was already packed with people enjoying their selection of meats but we were lucky enough to only wait around 5 min as a table was leaving.

The overall seating space in the restaurant is small and there are only around 10-11 tables. The stools can be used as storage as well to put your coats/purses (just open the top of the stool!). The restaurant has no ventilation so you will definitely leave smelling like Korean BBQ.

When you order meat, it comes with a variety of side dishes (kimchi, radish, lettuce, etc.), a steamed egg (which was delicious!), and bean sprout soup. We also got a makgeolli to share. The meat is definitely of higher quality than other KBBQ places I have tried. Overall, portion wise, what we ordered was enough for the both of us.

My sister ordered the bratwurst with the toasted white bun (hot dog style) topped with jalapeños and cold sauerkraut. Meanwhile, I got the elk sausage with sauerkraut and sweet peppers.

The bratwurst tasted good, and was loaded with toppings. However, my sister's comment was that the toppings overpowered the taste of the sausage - in particular, the jalapeños were super spicy. Be forewarned: it can get really messy trying to eat this hot dog with all its toppings (my sister really struggled).

I really did enjoy my elk, and found it to be very rich and smoky in flavour. It was on the salty side, but went really well with the sweet peppers, ketchup, and Dijon mustard with whole mustard seeds. That said, the meat was extremely crumbly and fell out of the casing very easily, making it likewise difficult to cut / eat.

That said, I really did find the sausages to be overpriced and not worth the associated $10 tag. If I really want sausages next time, I may just go to Otto's Bierhalle and get the large platters.",2018-03-18 01:25:17

The line is ridiculous, BUT it's not so much the length of the line as it is how inefficient they are. I am disappointed at how long it takes them to make something that they make hundreds of times a day, but I would still wait an hour in their ridiculously slow moving line because it's that good. I would have given them five stars if they could be more efficient. 
On to the gyro: It's hyuge. I was only able to finish 1/3 of it. The meat is extremely flavorful ( a tad on the salty side, but I like it that way). The home made sauce is also delicious and the perfect compliment to the gyro. 
Final note: the line is long. It sucks. Get in line early (I think they open at 10ish?). At 12, the line is 2 hours. Don't get in line later than 3, they might run out!

For my first experience with Tryst, I normally would have given a meal of this caliber only two stars, but I'm cutting them a break since my food was to-go. My service was great, my meal was completed in a timely manner, but the food was just okay. 

For our lunch, we ordered the portobello sandwich with a side of black beans and the grilled cheese with french fries. The concept of each sandwich was decent, but they were both lacking in execution. I really liked the idea of putting both tomato and avocado on the grilled cheese, but there was so much cheese and avocado slathered on that the flavors overpowered the sandwich. Too much cheese always equals too much grease and that's coming from a serious cheese-lover. The portobello sandwich was average...nothing really to rave about. 

I do have to say that the main part of the problem with our meal may have been the fact that we took the food to-go. Everything was packaged neatly, but after a short drive to my husband's workplace, our food was mostly soggy and not quite what I would expect if it was served on a plate in the restaurant. My one suggestion would be to not place the sandwiches on top of the french fries. My fries were partially undercooked, but the grease from the grilled cheese and the condensation from the heat made for some seriously soggy fries and bread. Not good. They did put my husband's black beans in a separate container which was thoughtful; I wish they would have done the same for my fries. 

All in all, we didn't hate our meal, but the to-go food was not nearly as appetizing as we would have hoped. And the prices are a bit steep for the quality of the meal that we received. I would be open to trying the actual restaurant if someone suggested it, but if it were up to me, I'd rather go next door to Humble Pie.",2012-05-31 23:58:54

The Cranberry Walnut bread makes killer french toast or even bread pudding... on occasion I've even turned a loaf into stuffing.

1. There is another bar (Toca) which is right near the entrance, but you will immediately see that it is not as cozy nor intimate as DEQ and is substantially smaller (almost situated in some corner room).
2. To get to DEQ, walk straight past the entrance. Outdoor patio seating is very hard to come by and there are no reservations allowed, except for weekend tea service. When you arrive, you can tell the bar hostess you would like to be put on a waiting list for outdoor tables.  

Intro. This was my first time at the Ritz and already I am very impressed. I will have to agree with Jennifer M. on many things, including the STELLAR service. I had my door opened by the doorman with a smile and I was led by a hostess to where DEQ was. Then, the DEQ hostess, who immediately greeted me regretted to inform that there was a 10 table waiting list for outdoor patio, but I could choose a very comfortable booth chair for privacy. Total LOVE for the Ritz. 

Food. I unfortunately came here hungry so the menu is definitely not for dinner, but rather, plates for sharing. The greedy eater I was, I ordered two plates that would normally count for sharing all for myself *shame*: The Cheese Boutique and the Salmon Salad. Both were great and our wonderful server explained everything in detail. My other girl friends had flat breads and both said were absolutely delicious. 

I am a champagne girl so I had my Veuve, but the wine list carries a broad selection of whites and reds and at a reasonable price. Towards the end the night, I felt something sweet like a Moscato and asked our server if they had a good one she could suggest. She then brought out a lovely Moscato d'Asti (lightly frizzante which is the best way to end your meal) and even gave me the option of sampling before she poured a full glass. 

It bears to mention again that the service was great, great, andddd great. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about wine and food (none of this I don't know followed by awkward stare and silence). Service was never intrusive but every time my friends or I wanted to order, it was as if she could read our minds and there she was!!! Then, a gentleman in suit (the head manager of the bar?) came over to thank us as we were paying our bill and to say that he looked forward to having us again.

Ambiance. DEQ bar is very cozy. They have a fireplace with love chairs and at the other end of the room, tables for two and four. Although we could not sit outside, the patio is very nice and large. Definitely coming back (earlier) to try and snag a coveted patio seat. Guests inside the bar were a mix of young and old. Hard to explain; Not a snobby crowd, but guests who clearly had money to order glasses and glasses of champagne. Understated elegance.

I already have plans to come back to DEQ with my mom soon. We want to try out the spa so will do a spa and lunch date - stay tuned for that review. All in all, DEQ is a wonderful change to the bar scene. The management for the Ritz Toronto location have done a superb job in training staff to deliver the Ritz brand of service. If you have time to pop by for drinks before or after any engagement, let DEQ be your next destination. You will NOT be disappointed.",2011-07-04 13:35:46

You may have to pay more for Apple products, but the customer service is second to none. Let me explain through my story as briefly as I can.... 

My girlfriend's iPhone 3GS died. It worked fine at 3:30pm Friday afternoon, but when we got home and she took it out of pocket at 8:00pm it was dead. She called AT&T to look into what she could. She argued with a customer service person (they were worthless since her contract wasn't up for renewal for 10 more days.. she pointed out that it would be cheaper to cancel her plan and get a new iPhone 4 through Verizon, and they still wouldn't budge). They even blamed Apple for not being able to be more flexible, but we soon learned that was simply passing the buck. 

The next morning we called Apple. Even being on hold with Apple is a better experience. The music is a pleasant mix, mostly from the 60's and 70's (a lot of Beatles!), and a recording consistently told you the exact number of calls ahead of us. We spoke to someone who arranged an appointment at the Genius bar, told us they'd look at it for free and find a solution even though the phone was past its warranty and she didn't purchase AppleCare. We even ended up running late, and it turns out it's really easy to schedule and reschedule appointments on the store's web site. 

At the bar, we happened to get the same guy we spoke to on the phone. He was obviously one of the better people in the store (I wish I could remember his name because he deserves high praise), because other Geniuses kept asking him questions to help their customers. He found that there was nothing he could do for the phone, so he called it a battery swap, gave my girlfriend a brand new iPhone 3GS, and swapped out the SIM Card, so we wouldn't have to renew her contract. That was just $80 (vs the hundreds that AT&T wanted to charge). 

In addition to this, I walked around the store and enjoyed looking at all the products, and talking to several employees about them. The place was slammed but there were dozens of employees standing around, each of them either showing a group how to use something, or just striking up random conversations with customers. All of them look genuinely happy to be working there (unlike most retail stores), and none of them pressured you into doing anything else other than browsing. 

With the exception of an old iPod, I don't actually own any Apple products at this time. But I've been looking into getting a new laptop, and now I know I'm getting a MacBook.",2011-05-31 00:03:24

Their pressed Cubano. Of course if it's your first time here, you have to try their classic cubano sandwich. Then you can work your way into the other dishes too. The cubano came out freshly grilled and therefore had the crunch I was looking for. The gruyere was melted to the way I liked it with the right amount of ham in between two rye bread slices. I would try the yuca fries next time and their main platters. The price is reasonable for the portion sizes you get and I love the atmosphere in the restaurant. It's cozy and reminds me of a 80s diner with the old school signs up and the retro tiles. I also enjoyed the Cuban music they played in the background. From modern world outside, you step into a restaurant that can offer you a retro atmosphere. Pretty cool!

Last tip?

Don't be disappointed to find the restaurant small because there's more spots in the back and you got to try the beer here too. Cuban beer but brewed locally! Pretty awesome!",2017-06-18 14:27:25

It was about 1:45 pm so the lunch crowd was gone and the place was empty so we had the restaurant all to ourselves.  Our server, Bora, was so pleasant and friendly.

Everything was delicious.  The place is so clean and their meats are fresh and tasty.  Although the brisket doesn't have any taste to it,  dipping it in salt/pepper and sesame oil is really good.  The kalbi meat is marinated in soy sauce and other condiments.  The flavors are so tasty.  We also had the boneless short ribs (my least fave).  It was good but not as great as the kalbi or brisket.  The desert we had was amazing.  It's a must-try dessert.  It's flavored shaved ice dusted with cocoa powder and drizzled with condense milk.  Yummy!!! Overall, we were not disappointed.

When the platter arrived it was easily enough for 4 people. Various pieces of meat on a bed of Potatoe wedges and vegetables. None of the cuts of meat were that great. I've had better, and I don't eat out at steak/meat places often.

I like their location within the shopping center. The parking lot behind the shop is usually easy to get in and out of and spots are always available. It's nice to have a fun shop that is easy to access. 

The merchandise in the store is really fun stuff to browse. They carry home décor, cute kitchen items, gifts, jewelry, baby gifts, candles, and more. There are certain items that they carry all year like the candles, jewelry, baby gifts, and wedding gifts. Then the rest of the store rotates seasonally which is why I can come in often. I can always count on finding something fun for myself and for others when I stop in. 

It's also a good store to bring my husband for gift ideas for me. He just follows and takes photos of what I like. Then he returns on his own and buys what he took photos of while I shopped. Shopping made easy.

It's a nice spacious restaurant with ample parking behind it (who knew?).  It just sits at a very crowded traffic signal, and many times I've seen lines out the door.  Literally.  Out the door.  

Since there was no line, we were able to order pretty quickly at the counter and grab a booth to wait for our food to be delivered to us.  

Smashburger is a chain restaurant, yet its burgers (thankfully!) taste nothing like your typical fast food burger joints.  Yes, I'm calling you out McDonald's, Burger King, etc. with your pseudo-burgers.  The burgers are big, flavorful, and, yes, real.  I also like that they offer ""gourmet"" burger toppings, as I like some variety.  I opted for the Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger.  It wasn't super spicy (at least not for me), but it did have a kick, was juicy, and had lots and lots of flavor, both the toppings and the smashed burger itself.  The skinny fries have some great spices and herbs on them, too.  

The prices are a bit high for fast food, but I guess compared to the ""competitors,"" you get what you pay for, so it's worth it.   I've always thought Five Guys was pricey, too, but I think Smashburger has them beat in both taste and atmosphere (although no free peanuts!).

We started at the bar where I abandoned my usual libations and ordered The Enabler, which is described as hickory-infused 12 year old whisky, grilled lemon juice, lapsang maple syrup and burlesque bitters. It was so good that I had another. 

For dinner, the four of us decided to just order a ton of stuff and share family style. Armed with our chopsticks, we were reminiscent of a family dinner in which the fastest eaters get to, well, eat. You snooze, you lose! Luckily we ordered in phases, so we continually had food coming. We thought at first we were insane for ordering so much, but we managed to pretty much polish our plates.

Here's what we had:

5 stars -- The beet salad with mizuna, shaved cucumber, pickled ginger, tempura bean curd and lemongrass vinaigrette.  

5 stars -- The salt and pepper shrimp with scallops and XO sauce.

5 stars -- The long beans with crispy duck tongue and XO aioli.

Steamed Bun: Schreiner's lop chong with daikon slaw and spicy Japanese mustard (can't star it because I didn't get a bite!!)

5 stars -- Smoked ""pig face"" dumplings with kimchi and pickled peppers.

5 stars -- Kimchi duck fried rice

5 stars -- Massaman udon noodles with red curry, roasted duck, fingerling potatoes, pickled peppers, peanuts and crispy cilantro.  (MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT!!)

5 stars -- Ramen with roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and soft-boiled egg.

The ONLY thing we had that we didn't love was the ""Mission Chinese"" Kung Pao Pastrami. It just didn't do it for us, and everything else was SO out of this world, that it paled in comparison.

Full disclosure: If you are vegetarian, vegan, halal only.. this is not the place for you. If you do not enjoy eating meat, this is not the place for you.

I went for my second visit during Winterlicious. They were having the full meat buffet for $35 per person. The downside was that we, a group of 4, went on Saturday. On the website it says they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more on Fridays and Saturdays. I'm not sure if they made an exception for Winterlicious, because I wasn't able to get through by phone and they never called me back.

We got there for 6:30, put our names down on the walk-in list, and had to wait 3 hours. We decided to go next door to Philthy McNasty's. When we got back, we saw the dance and drum performance from the sidelines, and then finally we were seated. The wait is definitely long, but the food is just too good.

There are so many different meat dishes. The servers come around and ask you if you want some, they slice it off and then return the rest to the kitchen for more grilling. My favourites were the Salmon, Parmesan Chicken, Beef Ribs, Chimichurri Steak and Roasted Pineapple. There's also standard sides to go with the travelling meats that you can go and serve yourself.

There are plenty of big screen TVs with music blasting from the speakers, adding to your good time with friends.  I've only been to Bowlero on Tuesday nights for their specials. On Tuesdays after 8pm they only charge $3.33 (including shoes) per game.  $3.33 that's less than $5 a game.  Can't beat that!  The food is pretty good too.  I've tried the pizza, flatbread, chicken tenders, fries, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings.  Good greasy, fried eats :)

I could be a little wrong with the pricing but the cheese and pepperoni flatbread cost about 5 or 6 dollars. There's only maybe a 50 cents difference in price for the pepperoni.  However, the cost of a veggie flatbread could easily run you TWICE the price of a cheese flatbread.  A few months back I ordered the veggie flatbread.  The waitress asked, what kind of veggies would you like.  I said onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. The waitress DID NOT tell me that there would be an individual cost for each individual vegetable.  I'm sure the cost of the vegetables is way cheaper than pepperoni, or obviously not!  When I received my bill, it totaled almost 11 dollars for a veggie flatbread.  A whole pizza pie cost $13 so the cost was ridiculous.  Just an FYI ... 

Also, there's regular classic fries (delicious) and there's also a variety of flavored fries.  There's salt and vinegar fries, garlic parmesan, and sour cream and onion.  I've tried the classic, garlic parm and salt and vinegar.  I love vinegar on my fries, especially when they're home style cut but the salt and vinegar flavor on their fries is soooooo overwhelming.  We couldn't finish the serving.  Overall, Bowlero is an awesome time, especially on a Tuesday night.  Just think twice before ordering the flavored fries and do not order the veggie flatbread.

You might be able to park on the side street beside it, but not 100% sure if you risk getting a ticket.  That would be the only con for me for this location.  There is actually plenty of space inside, as it seems like they took over 2 units.  I didn't go to the other room, but saw some chairs/tables.

It had been a while since I had been to a Burrito Boyz. I was looking at the toppings on the menu and saying what I wanted as I went along, when the lady making it asked me if I wanted cheese/beans/rice. I guess I forgot those go first lol.

Be aware that you may have to chase one of the servers down to order your food if you want something beside the dim sum. You don't actually have one server, the servers help whoever they want. So, you must be aggressive and maybe even rude to get what you want. The dim sum carts take a long time coming around, because the restaurant is always busy, especially on Christmas day. The food, again, is good overall. Prices are very inexpensive, but it does add up. While waiting for the dim sum carts to come around, you should grab one of their paper menus and order something from there.

So I'm going to judge the restaurant.  It's actually cute.  It has a large, covered, internal patio.  Which unfortunately is always full, I gotta aks if they take reservations.  But the ambience is nice, and the staff is friendly.  I disagree with other posters that it's expensive...it's average, and really, you get huge portions.  Ok, so they have large portions at Filiberto's too, but here you pay for the service and the ambiance.  So I didn't think it was that pricey.  I also like that it can accommodate large parties...restaurants like these are always hard to find.  Where do you take the grandparents, greatgrandparents, grandchildren, parents....?  here.

This place smells very fragrant when you walk in but I found it a little strange but ok. We were seated and we waited for someone to greet us and after a while the gentleman that sat us just tells us to go help ourselves at the buffet because it's a buffet.

Most of the food I tried was tasty. Nothing was too salty or too oily. All the chicken I tried was moist and tasty and even the fish was fresh enough so I could eat it. 

Currently a grade ""A"" Maricopa inspection is posted.

The buffet line started with a savory donut that seemed fresh made and wasn't oily at all. Next came a few vegetable soups. I thought the rasam (tamarind based) one had much more flavor than the sambar but both soups were very light with vegetables. The rice dishes were made from long grain rice and were very fluffy. They had dum aloo (baby potato curry), channa palgk (spinach & chickpeas), Fresh plain naan bread, They offered 5 meat dishes and one egg dish and offered three desserts and some beverages.

I found that many of the vegetable dishes ran spicier than the meat dishes. Most tasted good to me. I didn't care for two dishes that I tried due to they were just too foreign to me and they might not really be bad but dhal tadka looked fun but lentil dumplings in yogurt I couldn't get down and the upma vegetarian dish looked like potatoes to me but it was porridge with vegetables that I also couldn't get down.

2 of the three desserts were interesting. The gulab jamun was like tiny donuts that were soaked in something fragrant and sweet and the halwa was a vegetable packed carrot pudding.

Compared to other buffets I've been this one is a smaller buffet but it seemed well taken care of on my visit and plates were cleared quickly.

The decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy.  An appeal of an ""upscale"" eerhem ""overpriced"" pizza place.  There is seating inside or out depending on your preference and of course availability.

Service was cordial initially with the hostess but when we were seated our server really wasn't all that welcoming.  Constantly approaching our table asking if we were ready when we literally picked up the menu.  I did have an issue with nuts being in the pizza and asked if I could substitute that with spinach instead.  Server asked the manager and approved of my request. 

They don't provide bread but give out these measly pocky-like bread sticks. 

The menu has two kinds of pizza.  White garlic based and the standard marinara.  We opted for the marinara pepperoni and spinach pizza.  The pizza was so mediocre.  Honestly the pizza tasted just like s'barros but with a $18 price tag.  I also ordered some clam appetizer with breading which came with 6 clams I believe but were so tiny.

The big hype item is the ice cream taco, which of course we tried. It was actually quite affordable at I believe $7~. It came with the taco waffle and 3 large scoops of ice cream. The ice cream is from Kawartha, so we were pretty familiar with the the flavours and knew it was good ice cream. This also serves as a love/hate point because it was nothing new. Mocha never let me down though. The taco was decent but very messy to eat. I also suggest sharing with someone because it is quite large! Service was also very nice and worked at a good pace.

My wife and I hit several Ross, TJ Maxx and Marshall's stores but this store is somewhat unique. The store itself is pretty typical of other Ross stores; large store, good selection, looks like a war zone on the weekends. It's not particularly clean (most Ross stores aren't for some reason) but it isn't so dirty that you're going to be put off. What makes this store different is the socio-economics of the neighborhood. Because the area is slightly lower income (I can make this statement because I've been in this area for most of my 50 years in Vegas) most of the higher end products sit on the shelf for a long time. This may not seem like a big deal until you realize that those higher end items get put on the clearance aisle in greater numbers than they do at let's say the Summerlin location. This being the case my wife and I have scored a lot of great stuff at the Decatur Ross.

However, when they first opened up (before the District was built), I was here all the time.  In those 10+ years, my opinion about GVR has changed. GVR is still one of those quiet casinos that's still a nice one, but must air must not be circulated correctly because for a luxury looking Station Casino, it sure smelled like an old Fremont type casino.  In other words, the stench of smoke is all over the place.  I use to think GVR was huge, but now think it's just average.  I was recently here to play a little poker and the games weren't as good as they are at Red Rock.  Games weren't even as good as the Golden Nugget.  Even the buffet has slipped in the last couple of years.  

I love the Station Casinos because they love their locals.  But when it comes to the Green Valley Ranch, I never seem to get any deals (i.e. comps, free rooms, free meals, etc) like I do at the other Station Casinos.  Maybe it's because I don't play here and spend enough money here.  All I know is that it's doesn't have that luster it first had when they opened 10+ years ago.  Overall, GVR is just okay.

Since then they have added a second location on Queen St. One Saturday night, I had dinner at their original location which was just a short walk away from where I was that night. My favorite seafood of all time has to be lobsters with mussels (being a close second). The menu is a simple one-pager with several lobsters (and seafood) dishes, and another page for drinks.

The Rock Lobster Roll ($14) was served with Yukon chips and a slice of McClure's dill pickle. I have had a couple of different lobster rolls throughout the years, and this one is on the top of my list of favorites. I liked that there was a generous portion of fresh lobster. Additionally, the topped sauce was creamy and the toasty bun made it even better.

The Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese ($14) [fresh lobster, aged Canadian cheddar, and panko crust] was a comforting dish. This dish wasn't a personal favorite of the night but it's good if you have a craving for some mac and cheese with an added seafood twist. There was an okay amount of shredded lobster but you have to dig deep into the cheese to get some. Overall, it was a decent dish and I did like the crispy texture of the panko crust.

Lastly, we got the Lobster Supper ($39) [fresh Nova Scotia lobster, butter, creamed spinach, mashed potato and bread roll]. The steamed lobster was a decent size, as there wasn't that much meat inside of it. However, it tasted pretty good when dipped with the accompanied hot butter. The bread roll was also fresh and buttery. They do have a special on Sunday where it's only $25, which I think is a fairer price for the size of the lobster in comparison to its regular price.

Overall, the dimly lit Ossington Avenue space offers a warming dining experience. If you like lobsters, then this place is pretty good for it.",2015-12-06 23:40:21

Service: There were more of us than expected. So many, in fact, our clique had taken up almost every seat! Although staff initially looked overwhelmed, they busted their butts and had everything ready in a reasonable amount of time. All of this a mere two hours before closing. Splendid! 

Menu: There are several dozen entrees, and they're all flexible. You can choose a red curry, for example, but then determine which protein you'd like. Some entrees give a choice between beef, chicken, pork, or tofu (they're hella veg friendly). Others expand these options into fish, shrimp, mussels, or even octopus! I have never seen so many ways to eat these in one place! Mathematically, there's like a zillion different things you should try, so keep coming back. 

Food: I went with the garlic beef, and enjoyed it very much. The beef had a great grilled flavor, like it was fresh from a barbecue. The minced garlic was plentiful, as were the sides. I thought it needed more spice, so I took advantage of the generous condiment selection, and know I'll really crank up the heat with something else next time. 

Also, get the Thai tea. Get it! 

Value: This is inexpensive AF. Even if the entree didn't blow my mind, the prices did. A good dinner and beverage for less than 15 bucks? Groovy. It's hard to find a deal like this around Melrose.

Carne Asada burrito: size was good. I could not finish all of it. The meat itself was good in flavor and tenderness but the burrito was dry. I was surprised that there was no sauce on or in it.

Carne Asada chimichanga: It's a good amount of food, my wife couldn't even finish half of it. She liked it. It came with sour cream and guacamole on it.

I really like the decoration, the booth seatings and the high ceiling! The theme colour of Green does give the restaurant a nice and sedating feel.

The sushi and the sashimi were all fresh and tasty. I like how they did not try to put a lot of rice in their hand rolls and sushi like other AYCE restaurant.

However, their cooked dishes do have room for improvement. I found them really salty. I did mention to the waitress, she said there is only 1 person in the kitchen so that's why the quality control of the food sometimes can be off.

The ramen is quite tasty though.. I ate 2 bowels of that.. :)

Don't try to order Seasame ice cream! They don't have it! I ask why not? They said since no one is ordering it so they are not going to stock that.. GEE, no seasame ice cream?? However I do recommend the coconut ice cream, It is really tasty with big chunks of real coconut inside!

The soft drinks are not fountain drinks! They are reallly can drinks! I though not drinking pop anymore, but I found canned ones are so much better than the one from the fountain!

The food might arrive slowly because there are only 1 sushi chef and 1 cook and 2 wait staffs.

Went on a Wednesday night at around 8pm and it was surprisingly busy, when we got there.  Fortunately, the long line of people were mostly waiting to pick up take-out.  We were shown a table for two which had just been vacated and cleaned (the seats were still warm!).

Usually when we come to Asian Legend, we go all out on dumplings.  I would rate most of their dumplings and appetizers at 3-stars.  But we changed plans this time, and ordered some main courses, and a noodle dish.

The dry-fried rice noodle with beef was very disappointing.  The beef pieces had waaaay too much tenderizer to the point that you can't distinguish the beef's soft texture from the rice noodles, and the taste of the tenderizer was very overpowering.  Thankfully, there was not a lot of beef pieces in the dish (normally this would be a complaint, but this time, a blessing in disguise.)  And the rice noodles were gooey and stuck together.  This is a fairly  standard noodle dish at any Chinese restaurant and this may be the worst I've ever had.  Ugh.  Rating:  1 star.

Salty spice pork chop was very good!  A bit on the greasy side though, but the pork remained relatively most.  Rating: 3 stars.

Ma po tofu:  Boyfriend had been craving this dish (which led us to Asian Legend this night) and said it's the usual quality.   Not quite spicy enough, and not quite enough minced meat in the dish.  But for ~$10, it'll do in a pinch.  Rating:  3 stars.

Pork and chive dumplings (pan fried) saved the meal!  Asian Legend does do dumplings well, and this was no exception.  The dumplings had plenty of filling, and the wrap was not too thick.  When you take that first bit, you get hit with the ""juice"", which is delicious.  They serve this with vinegar, but we like our dumplings plain.  Rating:  3 stars

Although we didn't order more at this meal, we typically order several kinds of dumplings (steamed as well as pan-fried); their deep fried tofu;  and their beef pancake wrap;  (most dishes from their appeitzer page) and if hungry, their salty-spice pork chop.  And we usually leave satisfied.  Too bad we strayed off of our usual course this time, leading us to a 2.5 star, rather than the usual 3 star experience.

Overall, Asian Legend is cheap and cheerful.  The servers speak English, the service is efficient, the decor is up to date, and the restaurant is overall relatively clean (in the context of Chinatown).  We will return, and order our ""usual"" next time!",2016-05-21 02:37:01

I think this was mainly server dependent and because they have become more flexible on modifications to the menu.

As far as menus go this one doesn't have a whole lot of vegetarian options. It is a diner menu and very meat dominant with a lot of pulled pork and the like. The first time around I tried the souffle omelet with a mixed berry salad and the second time a modified eggs Benny that the chef did for me with arugula and caramelized onions. Both were fairly solid but not the most mind blowing I've ever had. Also the brunch potatoes were only ok.

Since my first visit they have conceded to get almond milk (after tons of requests I'm sure). Their unsweetened iced almond milk latte was very enjoyable. My friend got hers sweetened and it was way too much and she couldn't drink it. When they made it again they brought out the sweetener on the side, it was basically sugar syrup. Tip: do this and add your own coz I guarantee you only need a quarter of it.

I like that they take reservations for brunch because it eases my reluctance to drag people over that way without a guaranteed seat. Especially because the queue inducing Patois is a few doors down and there is bound to be spill over for people who can't get in there.

I'd be interested to see what this place is like later at night (since it is 24 hours). It's a lot classier looking than its Lakeview counterpart and hopefully lacks the line and bouncer with God complex. Seems like a nice late night option in comparison and has more of a vibe than the Thompson Diner. I'd happily go back for brunch but I'm not ride or die.",2015-12-06 23:49:36

Pros: The best sweet tea I've ever tasted! 

Besides the sweet tea, there isn't too much I can say about this place. I ordered a 2 piece chicken meal on my first visit but I thought the chicken was pretty bland and nothing spectacular. No sauce was given or offered and no seasoning packets like I see in other posts. I have yet to try their liver or gizzards. 

I've only been to Bush's twice now and the second time was only for their sweet tea.

As here you will find some of the best shucked Oysters, varieties hailing from New Zealand and BC, East Coast and West Coast, briny or salty, sweet and petite.

On my recent visit, I sampled all of the 7 varieties.
Kumamotos from Humboldt Bay, Coromandels from New Zealand, Eld Inlets from Washington, Misty Points from Virginia, Kumiais from California, Miyagis from Puget Sounds, and Kaiparas from New Zealand.  A more eclectic and delightful combination of oysters I have never had.  They were perfect with W&P's cocktail sauce and shaved horseradish.

The spicy tuna tartare was pure heaven, nestled on a spicy citrus avocado mousse, and for $8 it was a fantastic price. 

The oysters varieties vary in price, but during Happy Hour they are $1 and $2.  I believe hours are Mon-Thurs 3-6 - and the occasional Friday night when there is an overabundance of these beauties.

This will be my destination for oysters forevermore!!!! Finally, the ocean feels a bit closer.

Be aware that there is only bar seating at this cozy oyster bar, and raw seafood can only be consumed at the bar. So timing here is everything :)",2015-09-11 23:17:02

Also, the inside is crammed!  Table are jam packed next to each other and I had to squeeeeeze in to get to my seat.  Yikes, you won't want to come here if you're claustrophobic and pretty sure the arrangement of their tables breaks some kind of fire code bc if I had wanted to get out of there fast, I couldn't have.

My first visit was for the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE, (kudos to Metro for hosting and giving us a sampling of many of your fine French menu items).  We had fun that night... highlights in my eyes were the the Gin Fizz cocktail that Ty L ordered - he allowed many of us to sample it and it was delicious!  (I'm not even a gin drinker).  I also enjoyed the flatbread and fried oysters.  Great wine selection too!

After the UYE, a few of us stayed for dinner - while I really enjoyed the vegetable salad, the cod was not amazing (maybe it was the preparation with the leeks that I was not a fan of, but so be it - I know not to order that next time!)  I will say a major standout for all of us was the beignets - OMG!  Served warm with dipping sauce, these are a must order when you visit Metro!

I returned for brunch the following Sunday, and let me tell you - brunch is the way to go!  Between Jared and I, we had three menu items.  I went with the egg white omelette (served with mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and gruyere cheese) - I chose grits as my side and they were even better than the grits I remember eating when I lived in the South!  He had steak and eggs and the quiche.  We both cleaned our plates.  Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee also made appearances at our table.  Both were great, but a tip to Metro - I prefer my grapefruit juice without ice next time!

Jason was our server for brunch, Chad was our server for dinner, and GM Bill was friendly and helpful as always...  I like the shirts that the waiters wear - go check 'em out!  I know I'll be returning for brunch again real soon.  Maybe I'll see you there!",2008-12-15 16:38:25

Got there, we didn't make reservations, and sat in the bar area. The lady that took care of us was friendly. I ordered the pork rib chop and my friend ordered the lamb gnocchi.

Service was great where servers were polite, friendly and regularly checked up on us. The atmosphere is loud and packed with people and you must make a reservation. I found it interesting how the chefs and servers all yell in unison to welcome people entering and thanking customers together when leaving. With that being said, the environment was clean. The only downfall would be the table size. We kind of wanted to try a whole bunch of things and were seated near the window for two people. The table was small and very crowded once the food came out. Other than that, the food exploded with flavour! Portions are perfect with lots of flavour. I highly recommend the oysters and the Atlantic salmon sushi (i think its a sushi)! I will most definitely come back for more and my goal is to try everything on the menu eventually.

He definitely made the night even if the food didn't. 

The food was great. It came about a little longer than half an hour after we ordered which was amazing considering we had 19 people in our party. I ordered the chicken pot pie (one of their favorite items on the menu) and I absolutely loved it. It came with simple mashed potatoes with gravy. Once I dug my spoon into the pot pie, I smelled the delicious-ness in the food they delivered.

There were about 7 different kinds of rolls thy were mediocre including spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and a lobster roll. I don't think I'll come back for sushi, but I'll continue to go back for crab legs.

Food was okay actually. My boyfriend had their number 29 which was Hot and Spicy Pork Feet, he wanted to add Shrimps to it as well. He said it was just okay. Nothing spectacular that he has to go back for more, nothing bad to stay away from. I had their number 30 - Bun Rieu. I love Bun Rieu. The server condescendingly asked me ""The one with the shrimp meatball? Are you sure??"" I was thinking Do I need to be Vietnamese to be ""sure"" that I wanted the number 30?!  Anyway food arrived after 10 minutes, we were starving. The bowls were decently sized and flavored. I wish i didn't order spring rolls beforehand since my #30 filled me up in a snap. My Bun Rieu was good but Hue for me has still better flavor and better homemade shrimp balls. Though pho number one's Bun Rieu doesn't have pork ribs which I liked. After a few minutes, another server asked with a serious face ""Everything okay?!"" I don't know if he wanted to start a fight or was just not in the mood to serve. 

For To Go, i ordered number 28 which is the Pho Combination and it was just okay as well. 

All in all, sure i'll be back. Mostly for To Go. There are just so many pho restaurants out there with much more outstanding service that I just might not be back soon enough at this place. Definitely not the number one Pho place contradictory to their name.",2014-01-21 02:33:30

He brought us Andes mints with my to go box, as well as with the check! Love those things! We also got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. We have yet to eat it, but I'm sure it will be tasty. The biggest downfall of Olive Garden is it can be kind of noisy since there's usually a lot of people there with their families. Tonight there was a child screeching at the top of his/her lungs that we could hear from across the restaurant. But did the parents ever take him/her outside? No, of course not!

UPDATE: I have to revise my review after heating up my leftovers. Something was wrong with the chicken parm... The meat was tough to cut and when I took a bite, I spit it out. It was inedible.

I really wanted somewhere with assigned seating because I am so over the whole get there early and stand in line for hours to get a good seat thing. I was surprised that the IMAX theater now has assigned seats and there were a bunch of open seats for the 7:45 show. We went ahead and bought the tickets hoping for the best. 
The positive:
Location. There was a lot going on for Christmas- a lot of which was free. Music, carriage rides and snow! There is also ice skating, lots of lights and several restaurants. 
The IMAX screen-the quality of the show is still there although the Cine Capri at Harkins May be a little better. 

The negatives:
The theater is just not clean. Popcorn all over the floor the trash cans were overflowing. The drink machines were either out of ice or not working so there were long lines. 
The ""assigned"" seats were the same old crappy seats with numbers on them. 

Bottom line it works in a pinch but next time I will make sure to buy tickets in advance so I can go to a more comfortable clean theater to enjoy my movie.",2017-12-17 20:43:06

pW3Yo4u3EEyqV9EG_2G7wg,jwctwzboGhQmtC50Juxa9A,E7Heu5iT3D1WsfxlFROgEA,1,17,6,3,"Meet Fresh is a Taiwanese dessert restaurant that has now expanded to Toronto!  I remember hearing about the news sometime last year when Sweven Media was working on bringing them here.

This past weekend (Jan 19, 20, and 21), Meet Fresh had their opening weekend.  In celebration of that, they had a ""Free Q Mochi Giveaway"" with this msg:  ""As appreciation for your patience and interest, we want to give you free Q Mochi!  The first 300 customers to arrive on the opening weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) will be given a Q Mochi set (8 pieces) for free on each day!  We open our doors at 11 am, so make sure to come early to get yours!""

I received that promo e-mail in my inbox from Sweven Media.

My bf also alerted me to this giveaway because there was a Facebook event where the title of the event was ""300 Free Q Mochi Sets each day, Meet Fresh Soft Opening"".  

So anyone reading these words would think that upon lining up at 11 am, the proposed Q Mochi Set would be free; right?  It only made sense that if you lined up that early in anticipation for their event that the mochi set would be free.  As a PR company or restaurant promoting itself, giving free items to campaign and hype themselves is a smart marketing idea.  When something is given for free, you have willing happy people who are going to line up for hours and provide free promotion for you.  It's win-win for both parties.

Thus, we arrived on Sunday, Jan 21 at exactly at 11 am where there was already a small line-up of about 10 to 15 people in line.  Once we queued ourselves up at the end of the line, the doors opened and everyone was able to go in.  

There was a menu of the items above the cashier and the line seemed to move slowly.  We overheard someone in the front of the line say that apparently the mochi sets weren't free but that they were free with purchase.  What?!  I thought this was a free giveaway.  ...  We were fine to purchase an item and receive the free mochi set since we were already there, but I immediately felt deceived and slighted by the campaign.

I knew the contact person for SM and messaged him right away to inquire.  He confirmed with me a few minutes later that indeed the ""free mochi set"" was only given if you made a purchase.  Thus, that's why they had deliberately used the word ""customer"" in their promotion. ...

I felt this was a very sneaky and deceptive marketing ploy and took advantage of people's inattentiveness by using the word ""customer"" and ""free"" in the same campaign and being vague about the giveaway criteria.  If it was the case that the mochi set wasn't going to be given for free (where the definition of ""free"" = no purchase), they should have stated in their campaign, ""BUY ONE GET ONE FREE"" instead.  That's what the campaign really was, NOT a free item.  It's so tacky to use just one word in the campaign to mislead their followers like that.  It's not right.

It gives a bad impression of MF before people even try the product.  It angers the consumer who shows up because they feel deceived.  I know I was and so was another friend who I ran into who was there as well.  Don't say something is ""free"" unless and until you actually don't have to pay to receive it.  Shame on you, MF and SM.

Anyway, it took a while (20 mins) to get to the front of the line to make an order with the cashier.  There was only one cashier which was why the line took so long to move up.

We ended up ordering the Meet Fresh Signature in order to receive the ""free mochi set"".  Ugh.

After placing the order, the cashier asked if we wanted the order to-go or to dine in.  I wanted to dine in.  The cashier told us to take a beeper and then head upstairs to the dining room to wait for our order.  I thought it was a little confusing since it wasn't clear from entering the restaurant at first that they had a dining room at all.  We finally found the staircase that led to the upstairs dining room.  The dining room was clean and modern with lots of seating.

The Q Mochi Set came in 8 pcs.  Their menu doesn't actually explain what it is other than it is ""Q Mochi"".  We liked the lighter colour mochi more.  It was very chewy and soft and I was impressed with the quality of the mochi! 

The Meet Fresh Signature contained pumpkin and taro mochi balls, grass jelly, and some shaved ice at at the bottom.  It wasn't until after we left and I had looked at some photos on social media that I realized that the staff completely forgot to give us the container of cream used to pour over the bowl when eating it.  Ugh.

The spherical mochi balls were chewy and not grainy.  However, the flavours of the pumpkin and taro weren't pronounced at all.  The grass jelly was good but didn't taste very fresh.  I've had better grass jelly and mochi balls before.",2018-01-23 04:59:05

It was very unique and different from anything I've had.. but I had a hard time finishing it with the mountain of the smokey bbq sauce slathered every where. I love their potatoes because they are seasoned well and full of flavor. I usually can't order country potatoes but they're so good here it's the one thing I can compliment. After 4 visits here, I don't think I'll be returning. I guess it lives up to the hype for some people, but for someone who loves breakfast I'd rather get it in a place with better customer service and friendlier helpful staff.",2017-03-18 00:14:36
HX5kEsPQYCbip9ZjO1Goeg,bhmJrMRVc2sbk8XP00ravw,jTnD_YpFIeUzhopfuvKpvA,2,12,9,5,"Wow. Major disappointment.

We used the free house wine offer, and gave it to my mom.

I ordered the ""crispy"" (deep fried) and ""sticky"" (covered in mozz cheese) balls (I guess they are trying to make the old ladies blush when they read the menu) in diablo hot. ($10) for two. I also ordered a Caesar salad. 

My guy asked the owner (who was our waiter, and parks his lambo on the sidewalk, in front of the place) what dish is their best, especially for first comers. His answer... Chicken Parm.... really? Chicken parm? He got the marsala.

We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was not crispy. It was flavorless. Seriously, needed salt and pepper.

My beef balls came (haha, they are suppose to be ""gourmet). The extra money you spend to have them ""crispy"" and ""sticky"" go to waste. There was no texture to these meat balls. They were pure mush. The sauce was pretty good though, and spicy.

When the marsala was delivered, I knew that the veggies on the side were either frozen, or out of a can. The carrots were the circles with the crinkle pattern on them, and the broccoli was just the stems, not the fluffy tops. The marsala sauce was overly sweet.

Overall, Meh. No thanks.",2013-10-26 05:10:11

I thought I made one months ago, but I guess I was wrong!!  Tonight I came by as I always tend to do when I'm ready to cheat and have a delicious meal that reminds me of back home.   This location, is literally a few blocks away from my house and super convenient...super bad combo if you're looking to lose weight!

This location is in a strip mall along with businesses like Thelma's, Rubios and GNC.  It's in the northeast part of the Sunset Station parking lot and across the street from Walmart.  When you enter the location, you feel like you've stepped back into a Hawaiian oasis.  Well, at least what outsiders envision Hawaii to be!  Thatched looking huts that drape over the tables, pictures of leaves and flora adorn the inside.  I actually like the details.  Really helps pull in the theme and type of food you're about to eat.  The staff is usually friendly and nice. I really enjoy Judith.  She's been behind the counter for years and always remembers my name.  She's super enjoyable to talk to and super attentive.  

For dinner, I got the Aloha plate for $7.99 and (2) spam musubis for $1.99 each.  As you may know, spam musubis are rectangular sushi cakes, rice and spam, wrapped in nori, or seaweed.  Aloha Kitchen dresses the spam up with teriyaki sauce.  The spam was fried perfectly, little crispy, the teriyaki sauce was sweet and tangy, bringing a pleasant and flavorful experience with each bite!  To me though, the rice tonight was a little too sticky which means they probably put too much water when cooking it.  I'd prefer my sticky rice a little dryer than what I tasted.  The glue that held this snack in was the nori, super crunchy and gave a little sea taste to the musubi.  Super good!  

The Aloha Plate comes with two scoops of rice, chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef.  I always enjoy this meal!  The chicken katsu is breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried:  super crunchy and flavorful!  The teriyaki chicken and beef were both excellent.  One thing though.  I think it might be too much teriyaki in one place.  I hope it evolves someday to include another type of dish to break up the teriyaki.  Could be a little overwhelming at times as of right now.  

All in all, I love this place.  The service is on point, fast and friendly.  The food for the most part is delicious and makes me wanting more!  It won't be too hard.  I live super close!  If you're in the area, go tell Judith Rockne says hi!  Then check out their delicious food.",2013-08-17 02:58:06

came In for some tacos de Carne Asada - the tacos were definitely not ASADA (grilled) they were covered in cooking oil. The meat was more fat then meat. Then the tacos aren't even fully stuffed. Each Taco is $2.50 and it's so not worth it, especially when you don't get what you asked for. The tacos are small, oily and look like they slapped some left over meat on the tortilla. 

Pretty disappointed because I thought this would be my taco joint- but after this it defiantly won't. 

An average person would have to eat a minimum of 6 tacos to get full, which would be $15! That's $15 for 6 half meat stuffed tacos!

Why?
3 seems kind of Harsh... 

Things I like about it:
It's great for lunch.
The pasta is the thing to get - its made from scratch on premise.
The price for the pasta (skipping the meat) is pretty good.
It's actually pretty fast.

Things I don't like:
The pizza... It takes too long and its not worth the cost or the wait.
The card system is a bit irritating.
The way they make you wait in line.

I would not recommend this place for dinner - unless its a weeknight and you know what you are buying.

Some facts about me:
I can't comment on the salad because I haven't tried it.
I have been here 3 times. 1st i tried the Pizza - then I switched to the pasta and haven't looked back.
I love home made pasta with any sort of fresh made from scratch sauce.

The Chick Tikka Masala is decent.  Vindaloo is not great, in fact most of their curries (like the Mantra Masala) taste alike just different heat levels.  Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and it was satisfactory.  The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup.  

Also, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.  But I always have to add salt to the entrees.

Neither of us had been here before but UB is located on 7th street/thomas so it was a good location for both of us. She got a nonfat latte, I got a cappuccino. I chose the larger size for something like .50 more. Holy huge mug. I'm not kidding- I could not fit my 2 hands around this mother. It had 4 shots of espresso and was more than impressive. I think it cost me $4.00 total. The coffee was good, but I preferred Lux & Lola back in the day for coffee. Anyway, my friend and I split some sort of chocolate hazelnut torte dessert. It was dry and poor tasting. The fresh raspberry sauce on the top gave it some redemption, but it was not worth the calories or money. Overall, our bill was $13.00 which was a little pricey for the quality & lack of freshness of the torte. The atmosphere was quite nice, however. Coming for the atmosphere alone would be worth it. I suspect the other desserts in the case were  better than the one I got based on other reviewers feedback. They also have a cute, cozy patio right out front with strings of lights, plants and nice seating. In nice weather, it would be a great hangout spot. I'll return and try a different treat next time. I enjoy supporting local business and this place is a cute keeper. 

Worthy to note- I also saw the workers there writing some sort of Happy Hour menu up on their big white board- something like 4-7 Monday thru Friday....? I have no idea what was on there but this place would be a great HH place to unwind with a few co-workers if you aren't into the bar scene.

Uni7Xqoixv8dAXieyAVl9g,E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,PzA5gbmpoNsEBArELDBXiQ,3,1,0,1,"Ovarium seemed so mysterious, I'd been dying to go for more than a year now. Well, thanks to a trusty Groupon, the mystery is no more! 

I had booked a Pulsar, Neurospa and flotation bath, in that order, for a total of 3 hours. First, I should say that it had been a very stressful day, add to that the fact that I was curious and unfamiliar with my surroundings, so I never really relaxed, but that's in no way related to Ovarium. I'm sure if I were to go back, I'd go with the flow a lot more.
I was worried about the Pulsar, having bright coloured lights flashing 1 inch in front of my eyes didn't seem fun, until I fell asleep, only to wake up super energized afterwards! The whole thing lasts about 30 minutes, which is ample time to relax and refuel. Afterwards, I was ushered into another section of the spa, for my Neurospa. You are lounging in an oversized chair, which emits deep vibrations to music. The goal is for your whole body to unwind over time. This sounds swell, and it is, but I could never let go of the fact that, ohmygod, I'm in a pram! It's a pram! It's an oversized adult pram, complete with overhead cap that the personnel unfolds over you. I found it all very funny, and the purpose was defeated slightly. In the end, this is a lot more relaxing than the Pulsar, and I was sleepy when my time was up.

The bath, as others have described, is egg-shaped but the door opens and closes, and the inside/outside lights up or not depending on your preference and comfort level. It's a whole procedure: you have to shower and wash your hair first, then descend into the egg, and float for a good hour. You can control both the egg's door/light/music from the inside! I chose to go for full silence/darkness, which I don't regret at all! It took me a while to get relaxed; if you're pint-sized like I am, you'll find it's totally easy to rotate in the pod, tour the pod, flip-flop around, and none of that is very meditative. Still, the sensation of floating is great, and the salts make your skin ridiculously smooth afterwards (but very slick during the bath, it's surreal). A soft carillon tells you your time is up, and off you go back into the shower.

My main gripe here is with the space itself: after any treatment, you are ushered back into a fairly public waiting area by the door, before being picked up and guided somewhere else, which undermined any relaxation for me. The biggest exemple is after the bath, you've taken your shower and shampooed your hair, aaaand...you have to walk the whole nine yards, and meet the whole waiting area to go and dry it in the vanity room. The staff accompanying you is ever changing, which makes it awkward i think, so you'll start a treatment with one person, and awake to someone new. Eh.  

Once again, I think my experience was altered by my own state of mind, so your mileage may vary. Regardless I'd love to be back, mainly for the baths and maybe try the massages..",2014-10-31 01:32:24

As I entered the restaurant, the atmosphere is small and cozy. Very traditional family style food. Pictures from the other reviewers are accurate.

Was served quickly by the waiter which is always nice. Went ahead and ordered the chicken curry with an extra order of chicken, came to $24 with tips. Was definitely more on the expensive side. Food came out in reasonable time. Only so much you can really do with curry when it comes to presentation but it could have definitely looked more appetizing. Curry was aromatic and looked more like a gravy for the katsu chicken. Curry tasted different from the usual Indian curry as it was more sweet and mild. Chicken was moist and the exterior was crunchy. Salad was very basic.

Expect to wait around 20minutes for a seat during lunchtime/dinner time. The bar tenders are really loud and obnoxious (could easily be heard telling patrons to shutup in a loud sarcastic manner) and the music they play just doesnt agree with my ears. Also the entire scene is just very loud and can get uncomfortable at times when youre just trying to enjoy your meal. They dont accept Interac-debit, forcing you to use their ATM that sucks more money out your account in the form of bank fees.

Pros: The food is good. The wait times for menu turnover are more than decent especially considering just how stacked they are for lunch/dinner. And the servers are friendly and on spot.

One thing to note: they have ""coffee"" listed as an item on their menu but actually dont serve any at all whatsoever. I found this peculiar especially after our server hinted that a large amount of customers request it on a daily basis (seems like lost profit to me). 

Also DONT let the menu prices fool you. The food items are cheaper than beverages. Order around 3-4 drinks and 2-3 plates and youve already racked up a sizeable bill that doesnt include tip or your trip to the ATM fee.

Id visit again but Im not overly eager to. Ill try a few more places before I settle on this one again. They really need to do something about the noise levels though. We wouldve ordered more drinks and dessert but left earlier because our ears started ringing.",2015-04-29 18:00:29

Why 1 star?  Convoluted menu.  Ordering qty and picking more than 1 flavor will cost you a pretty penny and you have to decipher the pay scale they provided, way too complex.  You also have to order in 3s per flavor - which is what our waiter told us.  On top of that, they don't split the flavors so it's a gamble as to what it's inside your pierogi.  We ordered plain and potato and cheddar, they all tasted exactly the same.  Flavorless.  They also tasted way too tough.  My first thought is - did they open one of their frozen bags and use those for our dinner?  These did not taste fresh.  We were provided one carafe of water that filled 4 glasses half way full.  Our waiter never brought us refills.  Of course, not entirely his fault as he was the only waiter in the restaurant, which was clearly understaffed.  Four tables filled with dirty dishes since there was no busser available to clean them.  Just a poor dining experience.  Maybe my expectations were too high from all the 5 star reviews...

They restructured their menu and it now includes only:

Tacos: beef, chicken, pork or tofu&egg,-  1- $2.78 or 2-$4.63
(not so) Fries- seasoned fries $1.16 so no more flavor options
Crazy Dough $1.16
Jumbo ""Nate"" Dog $2.78
12 oz Drinks $1

We got for ourselves, mom and grandma to share 4 pork tacos, 2 tofu&egg, 2 (not so) fries, and 2 crazy doughs. 

I'm going to be the first somewhat negative review, but seriously I came here excited for some ""Seoul"" Fusion tacos and it came up short. Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, ""bahn mi"" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). 

Even if I didn't have ""experience"" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the ""expert"" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a ""bowl"" instead of a taco. I think it needs a ""heavier"" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying ""I'm soo hungry"" in the car after we decided to skip ""lunch"" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. 

Fries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). 

I think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an ""event"" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed.

 I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them.

Grab and go home to snack in private (which is probably safest, anyway).

The service: Starbucks used to be the gold standard, but now it's Nothing Bundt Cakes. Without exception, I have always been greeted with warmth and an offer to help select--not the moment I walk in the door, that would be too forward, but the moment after I finish the aforementioned sample. 

The business model: community oriented. They did a mega fundraiser after the horrific tragedy here in Vegas, and when not aiding healing, they can be found at other events and charities around town. 

The cakes: a friend of mine who is not gluten-intolerant will ONLY get the GF cakes, she loves them that much. Me, I have everything but the GF because I love maximum gluten. The bundtlet is the perfect single-serving size for the possessive, territorial type. The summation, though? Everything is excellent, and that is due to the following equation:
PerfectCake = moist + delicate crumb + healthy ratio of cake to frosting + sweet-but-not-saccharine frosting + right complimentary flavor combination between cake&frosting

The signs leading you to the casino were a little confusing when you get off the elevators at the garage. We had to stop and ask a couple that were passing through of where to go.

Sam and Jas were careful with my belongings and wrapped all the fragile items in plenty of pads or shrink wrap.  They were definitely well-secured and professionally arranged in the truck.

849 W. University Drive
Tempe, AZ

I arrived with a party of 10 for dinner at 6:00. While large parties are a bit crowding for them, they cheerfully accommodated us.

If you have never had Ethiopian food, it is a whole new experience. To begin with, there is no silverware. You pick up a piece of Injera, a kind of very thin sourdough bread not unlike foam rubber, and use it to scoop up some of the food and then stuff it in your mouth. Yes, you're going to get your hands dirty, but it is so much fun, and it breaks up the stuffiness of more formal dining. Within minutes of being served we were all chatting and having a wonderful time, all the while eating with our fingers.

The restaurant prides itself on serving both meat and vegetarian dishes, so everyone was able to satisfy their cravings. Our party ordered a big assortment of meats and vegetarian dishes, but my party ordered the Lalibela Exclusive, which for $39.95 gives you a huge platter with an assortment of just about everything that the place serves. We all agreed that it was an excellent value for the money, and allowed us to taste each one of the dishes. Among the best dishes were the Yebeg Alicha (mild lamb stew), which was tender and succulent, the Doro Wat (spicy chicken stew) and the Alicha Seg Wat (mild beef stew). While there are all kinds of meats both mild and spicy on the tray, be sure to save room for the vegetarian dishes. The lentils are probably made in heaven, they are so tender and flavorful. Be sure to order some Ayeb (home made cheese) for a real treat. Traditionally, the food it served with a hard boiled egg, and they will gladly give you one if you ask for it. I found the egg really picked up a lot of the flavors from sitting with the stews, and was a real treat to eat.

They have the usual assortment of soft drinks as well as beers and very strong and good Ethiopian coffee. If you are going to have any alcohol with your meal, don't miss the Tej Honey Wine. It's like nothing you have ever had before.

The restaurant and rest rooms were totally clean, and the entire place and service shows pride of ownership. (This is a family owned and run restaurant.)

The buca bar experience helped expedite this I suppose. I didn't have much time to explore the main menu beforehand so spent a bit of time exploring while seated and waiting for the DC. There were some interesting options but the tasting menu seemed like the best value proposition. Unfortunately they wouldn't sub stuff on the tasting menu so ended up getting the vegetarian tasting with a wine pairing. 
Here goes: 
Fragole: Decent start but didn't wow IMO. 35 year balsamic should have been a stand out but I couldn't find it
Pamodor e Ricotta: just too sweet and would have even passed on as a healthy dessert (whatever that means)
Fromagi: Cheese course hmm another ho hum offering and wine choice was poor IMO sparkling red just didn't go with this course but does it go well with anything?
Gnocchi: Strong cheese with a good wine pairing and brown butter added to the body of this dish. 
Parmigiana Di Melanzane: Very good. I have been liking my egg plant dishes lately and this one fit the bill. Nice combo of tastes and textures (the crispness on the eggplant really stood out IMO) 
Amuse Dessert Granita with yogurt. Didn't have the tang one associates with Granita IMO
Ciambella di Pistachio: Good hefty dessert. Lots of pistachio flavor.
I would say 3.5 overall. Two of the wine pairings were decent while others were just OK to what the! (I guess its very hard to pair wine with vegetables) Service was decent though they need to improve a few things. They should have more lighting in the washroom area as one has to just wander in the dark to find the light switch.

The entire restaurant reminds me of a Las Vegas production.  From the time you park your car (don't bother with valet when there is a ton of street parking along the strip), you're greeted once by a greeter, then by a hostess, and then at some point by a manager.

Mostly a date crowd with clientele ranging from well-to-be businessmen to gents obviously stretching their pocket book to impress their gal.  Overall, it definitely wasn't a crowd I seemed to identify with.

Food is decent, except the fiancee got butter poached lobster that definitely didn't sit well with her.  My pork trio was tasty, but definitely nothing special.

Service is more or less where Savoy differentiates itself (each server has a business car they provide at the end of the meal).  BUT, the second time we went, where we decided we just wanted entrees and a glass of wine, the waitress was visible disappointing in our soon to be inferior check and consequentially glanced over us for the rest of the night.

Overall, probably won't go back, but I can see where this is a favorite of others.",2013-05-31 00:11:10

If you've never been then your first dining experience is best served during restaurant week. Afterwards go anytime and you'll be impressed. 

Kudos for holding our reservation for 15 minutes over. I believe 10 minutes is usually the max but I called while en route. 

Dined upstairs with a view of the realty office and I'm fine with that. 

The gauchos that were attentive and thoughtful enough recalled medium well red meat. 

Dined at 2:33p and it was a full house. Should have went for 4pm as it cleared out pretty decent.

The vegetable soup was more of a roux carrot base. Similar to baby food in a jar.

Our server assistants were nice but I noticed one ""fake"" fold a napkin to stare down a diner to see how much he'd tip. 

My server, Renzo, never brought out lemons for the water. 

Upon entry the seat was dirty. Idk how since they had only been opened 30 minutes -  cleaned it ourselves. White crumbs on a black seat... they stand out folks. 

The attendant that clears the dishes was adamant about taking all things. No worries take the dishes. But seconds later she, Joheny, returned to ask if I was finished with the bill & I was so I replied in a knee jerk automatic, yes. She proceeded to lift my purse off the check holder - this caught me off guard -  and took the check book. 

I don't know if tips are not being shared equally in this place. Or if someone has hurt their trust but apparently tipping/tips and the sorts is of urgent importance that service goes out the door along with manners. 

If it hadn't caught me off guard I would have addressed it. Instead, it sealed the day to teach me never again will I dine here during restaurant week. 

I genuinely hope no one has taught them these habits.

But you sucked. We ate dinner early on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar. There were about 8 other tables occupied. We had surly bar service. I got a filthy wine glass (and the waitress forgot my order--look, if you want to look cool and not write it down, that's fine, but you can't FORGET it). It took 35 minutes for a burger and a sandwich. The surly waitress half-apologized, if ""it's the cook's first day back"" is an apology. We thought the quality of food was atrocious for the price. The highlight was my burger--it was small, overcooked and under-seasoned, but the buffalo sauce with bleu cheese was delicious together. I subbed steamed broc for fries. They were hard and not seasoned. Hubby's steak sandwich was a sad little thing, mostly bread.

Having said all that, if you just want to get in and out for some fun drinks, this place might be great. It has a lively atmosphere at prime drinking hours. It's great for a drink before or after the movies, but even Cadillac Ranch has better food. Sad.",2013-04-12 21:09:56

Maybe I'm spoiled from having just completed a two week stat at a four seasons.  Or maybe this hotel simply isn't that good.  Check in was fine.  Check out was fine.  Room was fair.  Floors kind of dirty and sofa bed as well as king bed were uncomfortable.  Pillows honestly terrible.  Kind of funny when I checked in because front desk person told me I had 'strip view' room...laughable.  The strip is like 5 miles away.  Stratosphere tower looks like tiny miniature model from where the hotel is.  Funny.

Here's the main issue I had...first day we checked in I called and spoke to girl at front desk to request more towels and another bath mat.  She said 'I don't know if we have those.  I'll call you back.'....never called back.  Never got towels.  Don't know if she didn't know what a bath mat was but since there was one in the room, I know the hotel has them.  Anyhow...

Next morning, I left a decent $3 tip for housekeeping along with a note asking for more towels.  This is what I got....beds barely made, dirty floor not cleaned, sofa bed not made and a stack of 5 bath towels (room came with 4 originally) on the counter.  Not put away in proper location, no face towels, typical number of hand towels.  My $3 gone.

Didn't bother to tip after that.

Wifi sucked.  Other than not being able to sign into Hilton honor wifi and not getting any help from girl at front desk was the issue of getting kicked off every day.  Plus the embarrassingly slow speed of the connection when connected.  Girl at front desk told me to just sign into the regular complimentary wifi.  Said it was all the same.  Is it?  Don't know.  Seems redundant to have comp wifi for Hilton honors members if it's the same as the free wifi.  Oh well...

Only other issue for me was airplane noise.  All day.  All night.  Every 10 minutes.  Maybe less.  Location was bad.  Not near anything you'd want to see or do.  Neighborhood a little sketchy.  I certainly wouldn't walk anywhere from this location especially if I was a woman.

Being married to a Filipina we are always watching for good Filipino restaurants.  After visiting here we're still looking for one.  But their bakery is awesome!  So this review is mixed.

Pancit and rice came standard with the entree. Portions are filipino size (that is, similar to restaurants in the Philippines - a bit small), but not outrageous.

The food was very average.  The caldereta tasted like American beef stew, and it shouldn't have.  It wasn't bad, but if you know caldereta you know this was much too bland.  The sinigang was OK, as was the fresh lumpia (sariwa), and pinakbet.  Nothing special, though.  The staff made up for it a bit, being very nice and friendly.  The sago gulaman also was good.

So the restaurant is 2 stars.  Better than Jeepney Bistro, but that's not a very high bar to clear.

The bakery is a solid 4 stars.  They have cannoli (Italian), puto, leche flan, pan de sal, pan de leche, fruit tarts, mamon, bibinka, and more.  We tried their pan de sal and pan de leche, both were excellent.  Their ""chocolate mousse tower"" was fine.  The puto was very good.  We bought several more items that we haven't tried yet (like the ube cheese roll).  But so far the bakery items have NOT disappointed!!

Nothing has changed since the last time, which was about 5-7 years ago. Staff were still very friendly and courteous, which makes the evening that much better. Everything else is the same except the name change!

The reason for the 5 stars - Cirque Ziva. It was genuinely an amazing show! It was backbreaking, bone crunching, hands and feet sweating excitment.. I kid you not, you MUST go see them. The show started off at an easy pace with spinning ring. In fact, there was so much spinning throughout the night that I felt like vomiting lol. The Thousand Hands was also a show stopper off the night - 5 girls on the stage standing behind each other, waving their arms and shaking their hands so majestically.. On top of that, the costumes they used made it so much more intriguing to watch. I was captivated and mesmerized by their coordination and every single stroke flowed together. Vase/table juggling was also a sight to see. I have never seen anything like it! The last time I did that was when I was 10 and the table faceplanted on mine :) hehehe
I think the best act was when the lead performer balanced 7 chairs ON TOP OF EACH OTHER and became Spiderman! He was literally doing one arm handstands and splits! He even positioned the chair in weird angles and still managed to come out alive.. At one point the chairs in the middle started to wiggle, but somehow he managed to keep it balanced..
Hands and feet were sweating for him.. Jeez!

They got the coating done right. It's not too thick and not too crunchy that it leaves tiny cuts on the roof of your mouth. The fish is good. Moist and served in decent proportions.

One thing the fish lacks is flavour. It's actually quite bland. You add the salt and vinegar and it still tastes somewhat plain. The flavours don't meld well enough. The fish lacks salt and pepper. The chips are fine but tartar sauce should come free.

I get the Panera comparison that many people have brought up, but I think reviewers just go there because you can pick two items (salad and soup, half sandwich and salad, etc) at Zuppa's like you can at Panera.  Other than this ordering option, I'd never compare Zuppa's to anything else.  

When you first walk in, the menu is written on the wall just to your left.  There's a lot to take in on your first trip and the line gets long pretty quickly during lunch hour.  I felt the pressure in trying to decide that first time for sure.  But the friendly greetings from the staff help calm me down and narrow my choices.  The counter where food is prepared is not very big but they bust out the orders in an organized fashion.  Food is prepped, plated and brought to your table before you know it.  

I've tried a few of the sandwiches including the Meatloaf Panini, Tomato and Basil Panini and the Little Italy sandwich.  Having enjoyed them all greatly, I don't think Zuppa's makes a bad sandwich.  I've also tried the Caesar salad.  But my favorite menu item, hands down, by far is the Chicken Brushetta Salad.  The chicken is so beautifully cooked and sitting like a cloud on top of the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese.  It sounds simple enough but it's so wonderfully executed I've yet to taste its equal.

qXR5R6-vWuF6RPAe5cs3JQ,_VTEyUzzH92X3w-IpGaXVA,Jl-lJisnmsy8BCV0Pif4xg,4,2,0,0,"Christos reminds me of the ethnic restaurants you'd see throughout Europe or large American cities.  The owner or one of the staff is often outside encouraging patrons to check out the menu and come inside.  It may seem odd in Pittsburgh since most other places don't do that,  but it is fairly typical in other cities.

I've been to Christos several times now and been happy with each visit.  The biggest down side for me is that they can be very pushy, especially if the owner is waiting on you.  Also, they will ask if you want hummus and pita when you first sit down.  While it is absolutely worth getting (I love the flavor of the hummus) note that it is NOT a free item like getting bread at another restaurant might be.  Just be aware so you aren't surprised when you see it on your bill.

They have a red and a white house made wine.  They are both pretty sweet, but tasty.  I just wish the glasses were larger.  They are in pretty tiny glasses.

Try the Saganaki!  You can't go wrong with flaming, gooey tasty cheese.  Just be aware that when they bring it to your table, they will scream 'Opa!"" and either whistle or bang.  That really caught us by surprise.

The food is by no means gourmet, especially in presentation, but it is tasty and home made.  That has positives and negatives.  For example, I had the ground beef/noodle dish (can't remember the name and don't want to butcher it).  It was very tasty, but usually it has bechemel sauce over the top of it.  It was a little dry without it and I was told they don't have any to add on since it is baked right into the dish.   

Most meals come with soup or salad, rice and roasted veggies.  The salads have a nice mix of veggies (tomatoes, green and red peppers and cucumbers) olives and even apples.  There is feta cheese and a nice and light dressing.  A perfect way to start your meal.

Their ""famous"" dessert is the Jackie O.  My husband tried it and loved it but I wasn't overly impressed.  They do offer several dessert selections including the staple baklava.

If you are in the cultural district and enjoy greek/comfort food, I suggest a visit to Christos.",2014-02-27 21:23:48

I am usually apprehensive about buffets, and I guess it is wrong to assume that the food will be sub-par because of the volume that needs to be created. However, I was blown away by the quality of the food and the number of options we had to choose from at Olio. The spread included pastries, salads, breakfast potatoes, fruits, eggs Benedict, roast, waffles-the real kind-exactly like the ones you get in Belgium (I was in Belgium over the summer), seafood, among other things. I was specially impressed by the eggs Benny-I couldn't believe how perfectly cooked the eggs were.

Brunch is offered every Sunday from 11:30am-2:00pm. The price online says $17 for the buffet breakfast, but I don't know if this is the price for the Sunday brunch as well.

Though this was a private event, I really hope that the quantity and quality of the food at the event is what they would serve on a regular Sunday.  It always worries me that restaurants will be on their ""best behavior"" when trying to impress a bunch of bloggers and reviewers, though I have a feeling that Olio offers great food on a regular basis. I have read many reviews (on Yelp), and people seem to really enjoy dining here. I wish this location was not so inconvenient for me (I live downtown), or I would have returned for brunch already. If ever in the area, I will definitely give their regular menu a shot.

The Plaza is pretty much the same as it was before but new.  There is new carpeting, new slot machines, and new table game pit tables.  The layout is the same as before, but it has a fresher look.  They are also putting a nice scent into the air and the place wasn't smoky last night like it used to be.  The air flow must have been improved.

The new Insurgo Theatre Movement theatre is on the 3rd floor next to the bingo room.  The theatre was a cabaret from the looks of what I saw last night.  It's odd to go to a play and have a nicely dressed cocktail waitress delivering drinks while actors are delivering lines (well only once).  She was also sufficiently unclothed to be worthy of the title of a Las Vegas cocktail server.  She was also really pleasant.

The garage is still the awful thing it's always been.  The 2nd floor was mostly blocked off because this is Bikefest 2011 (motorcycles), so they had an area reserved for those noise makers.

There was a lot of security everywhere last night and Metro and they may be due to the Bikefest,

Now that I'm working in Mississauga again I have a chance to try this place again. They seemed to have changed owners. The place has been renovated too.

Our table ordered a bunch of fish and chips, and I had the seafood pasta. Frankly I can make better pasta than this chef. He either added too much wine and/or didn't reduce the wine down. The sauce lacked ""cream sauce"" taste. I can taste the wine, meaning the cook didn't add enough cream.

Service is never a factor to me. But based on food alone, if you can screw up cream pasta, I don't know what to say. My companions said the fish and chips was ok. It's hard to screw up fish and chips I guess. We also ordered coconut shrimp and calamri. Both were ok!

In terms of value, I know seafood is not cheap. Their prices are not terrible. My dish had a decent amount of seafood in it.

I went with friends for lunch and ordered a liver with sauteed onion entree with side seasonal vegetables and home-fries. The home-fries were quite yummy, and the liver wasn't bad, but there wasn't really anything incredible about the culinary side of things. I also ordered a vanilla milkshake, which was, by the way, MASSIVE. Think trenta in terms of Starbucks size. The milkshake was yummy though, so that bumped up my experience a bite (pun intended). If you are getting a milkshake though, either share with a friend (omg was the intention of a massive milkshake supposed to be romantic like in those retro movies? I ernno), or get a side of fries and have everything as a snack. I consider myself a big eater, and I struggled to finish the milkshake-- but it was too good to stop. 

Ambiance 4/5 (10% of final grade)
I totally dig the retro vibes! Unlike other places, Fran's does not go half-way in terms of the retro vibe. Stepping in felt as if I was stepping into the world of Hairspray or Grease. Coming here on a nice summer day would be awesome!

Service 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Nothing particularly notable about the service. No meanies but not employee-of-the-months either.

Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade)
For downtown core, the price itself was appropriate. $5 for a milkshake was a tad expensive, but $12 for an entree was quite agreeable. 

Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade)
For being open almost all the time.

Walking into Smeeks, you really cannot help but smile. (BTW, if Smeeks does not make you happy, you either torture cats, or have dismembered body parts in your freezer.)

The store is warmly lit, and really well thought out. As other reviewers have mentioned, the store is not 100% candy, it's more like 50/50 candy and novelty items. While some may view that as a negative, I thought it was great because you will find such fun items, that cannot be found elsewhere.

In addition to buying some of my beloved Zotz candy, I picked up a cool toast stamper, which you basically press this plastic form onto a piece of bread, then pop it in the toaster. When the bread pops up from the toaster, you have a piece of art, in this case- the Eiffel tower!

It's really just a fun store, with great selection. Because it is a boutique, the prices are higher than you would find at WallyWorld, but that is how things work. You will not be able to find much of the candy anywhere else, so things cost a bit more. Never fear, you can still purchase candy without refinancing your car and home.

Customer service is alive and well at Smeeks. When I went to check out, the employee was super friendly and answered my questions. She even offered to gift wrap Frenchie's gifts, and she did a great job, the gift looked like a movie prop when she was done.

Service - good!

Food - I'll start with the bad. They serve some pretty terrible bread as the starter. I mean, I get it's free, but you're an Italian restaurant, have some GOOD bread! It was stale, hard, and lacked flavour. Worse than day-old bread from grocery store!

I ordered the BUFALINA salad (roasted cherry tomatoes / balsamic reduction / bufala mozzarella arugola / basil / x-v oil $22) which was PARTLY disappointing. The bufala mozzarella was creamy, rich  & delicious, BUT it was served atop way too much arugula, which sat on top of MORE of that stale sliced bread! 

The entrees though, were SPECTACULAR. We were a group of 7 that ordered 4 pasta dishes, 2 pizzas, and 1 salmon entree that was on the daily special. We only disliked the one salmon dish which was bland, dry, and overcooked. But really, if you're going to an Italian restaurant, you really should be ordering pizza or pasta! Shame on them lol. 

All of the pasta dishes were delightful - perfectly executed and FULL of flavour. We ordered the FUNGOCREMA, COMMENDATORE and PUTTENESCA. All great, but the first 2 were stand out dishes. The 4th pasta dish was a lasagna from the daily special which was top notch too!

Their pizza is also done really well. The crust is airy, but chewy, and perfectly crisp.

All in all, I'd highly recommend Mangia & Bevi and will definitely be returning soon!",2018-02-13 19:14:27

We ordered 1 regular size jalapeño Baja, 1 large size jalapeño Baja and a smash fries. Simple enough right? Well, it took over 23 minutes to be served and both burgers arrived identical in size, despite the server announcing ""and the large is for who?"". After 23 minutes, we didn't care. Whatever. Then we noticed the buns had inexplicably shrunk in size. For some reason, the buns looked like slider buns with the meat protruding about 1-2 inches all around. Very skimpy and strange. Oh well... when you're hungry you overlook these things and start eating anyways.   Unfortunately though, the meat patties tasted like they had been coated in salt for a week. I've never tasted anything so salty in my life. It was my sodium allowance for the week in 1 bite. Unbelievable. We both couldn't finish our burgers they were so salty... and with those silly little mini-buns! What a disaster.

Anyways, I know it's fast food and we need to temper our expectations but nevertheless this was beyond bad. I never thought I would say this, but I would rather eat McDonalds. And that's saying a lot.

Where to begin... the service was amazing without being overbearing. I ordered a half bottle of wine. After pouring my first glass the remainder was tucked away invisibly elsewhere but somehow my glass managed to refill itself over the evening without ever remaining completely empty. I don't know if they have a magical wine hawk whose job it is to survey you as you finish your glass and all you see is a flash of a hand before it's filled again. 

As you leave the table the server even folds your napkin and puts it in place for your return.  The server is more like a wizard and less like a server. 

Food itself was delicious. I gave a five star review because of the overall experience but the food itself is comparable to other good dining in the city. Plates are small. Order everything at once and they will course it for you.

Fried eggplant - delicious smoky flavour and perfectly crispy. A tad on the salty side.

Avocado salad - creamy melty butter lettuce complements avocado and dressing perfectly

Shrimp (special) - fresh tasting, flavourful, pretty presentation (pictured below).

Sirloin - punchy paprika flavour, cooked medium rare to perfection.

Pan con tomate - homey and perfectly satisfying. 

Hazelnut mousse - light & airy with candied rose petals to make you feel supraordinarily decadent and regal. 

Also had a dessert liquer and wine with the meal. Booze was of a Spanish selection so I was not familiar with the varieties - had to google tasting notes (lol) but I was impressed by the offerings. Was on the expensive side.

Doesn't seem like much, and then you enter into this beautiful lavish 20's style restaurant covered in chandeliers and a dining room enclosed through hung lockets. 

They offer a wide range of tapas style dishes. Everything from oysters, to individual soup dumplings, to personal size strawberry shortcake bars and depending on your party size they custom order the amount so everyone gets their own (I just love that!) 

Beauty and Essex also does a partner server style. We had two servers for our table which made it easier to order cocktails faster and explain the dishes as they were coming out-the restaurant was super super busy (Ana and Apolo were both so knowledgeable and picked out some of their favorite dishes for us to try)  

Bottom line.....If your looking for a quiet romantic dinner skip this place, BUT if your going with a group of people and want some amazing cocktails and funky food options book Beauty and Essex! And request Ana and Apolo!! 

Favs: 
--walnut kale salad (and I hate kale!! It was so good!!!)
--tomato soup dumplings
--yellowtail sashimi
--lobster roll (super tiny! But delish)
--French onion soup dumplings 
--strawberry shortcake ice cream bars (just like your childhood remembers them)

Wouldn't order again:
--avacado toast (order the chicken caeser instead) 
--empanadas-just eh.....just basically fried dough

Nestled into The Bay at Queen and Bay - Bannock offers up delicious food at more than reasonable prices!

I brought William T. here for dinner prior to catching the opera, Rigoletto, at the Four Seasons Centre.

I love the wooden interior and the shelves, lined with pickled vegetables.  When you first enter you will see the take-out counter but just a few steps further will take you into the dine-in area.

We ordered a Caesar and an H&B cocktail. The best part of the Caesar is the piece of bacon at the end... Yes ladies and gentleman - bacon!  However I found the spiced rim was heavy on the salt!  The H&B was by far my favorite - it was a
peachy cocktail.

We ordered 3 entrees to share. The Roast Duck Poutine was amazingly good! If you order nothing else order this! The flavor was so intense that I think it sort of numbed my taste buds and decreased enjoyment of the other 2 dishes. The duck was a bit scant but the gravy made this pizza delicioso!  The crust was nice and thin and the pizza came out piping hot.

The Side Ribs Burger was also very savory though the pork was not as tender. It was served with yam crisps.

The Pork Shoulder braised in onions and topped with a pear comport was tender and the pork just came off the fork. It was served atop a bed of spaetzle and spinach.  The sweetness from the pears married well with the saltiness of the pork.

Unfortunately after having shared 3 mains we didn't have any room for dessert but after having experienced such great food I will definitely be back for some dessert!

The service here was excellent. The servers and wait staff were all very attentive and a ""so uppity it's scary"" kind of nice.

In two sections--food and service--I'll review Technique and for the food I'm using description directly from the menu.

The Food:

A basket of three rolls was brought--one multi-grain, one rye, and one regular roll.  The herbed butter served with them was very good!

Course 1:  I chose the Beef carpaccio with charred beef sirloin. Shaved Parmesan. Truffle oil. Balsamic reduction. Black pepper. Field greens.

The salad was very good.  The balsamic reduction dressing was very tasty and the field greens were fresh.  The problem here was with the prep.  The beef was placed on the salad plates some time before the salad was created.  It had then been refrigerated--nearly to freezing it seemed.  As a result, the thin beef slices stuck to the plate.  I can understand the need to avoid exposing the carpaccio to room temperatures, but this was really a cold plate.  The server asked me if I wanted freshly ground pepper and she used the peppermill.  Nice touch.

Course 2:  Pork tenderloin saltimbocca.  prosciutto, sage butter, asparagus, risotto, Marsala semi glacé.  The pork was cooked way too long making its name incorrect.  Instead of being tender, it was difficult to cut and much of the flavor was wrung from the pork.  The prosciutto on top was very good and the risotto was not bad considering it was made in advance and piped from a pastry bag and kept warm in some hit water.  There were two asparagus pieces, a little meager even given the reasonable price of the meal. The server asked about freshly ground pepper for the main course, too, which was welcome.

Course 3:  Chocolate lava cake. Peanut butter ganache and vanilla bean ice cream.  The problem with dessert was that the chocolate cake was very dry.  Either it was older or it was baked too much.  The peanut butter ganache was nice and the vanilla bean ice cream was good.

The service:

The woman who served my table greeted me when she came with the menu but did not identify herself by name and she did not tell me the soup of the day nor the catch of the day.  It was when I heard a different server at the table behind me introduce himself by name and then list the unpublished things on the menu that I knew they existed.

My server was attentive, came back during each course to see if everything was OK.  She refilled my iced tea without asking, but I had to request the sweetener a couple of minutes after she brought my glass of iced tea.

I'm not sure if it was the server or the school, but I would recommend not bringing the bill while I'm eating dessert.  Can't it wait?  Also, it really is best to clear the table of dirty dishes before bringing the bill back.  You do need to have some room to put the holder down and sign the charge without moving plates aside.  The removal of used sweetener packets was a fail.  

In spite of the things I found wrong with the dinner, I will be going back.  It was interesting watching the students prepare the dishes through the glass of the kitchen.  The food was passable, and hopefully the students and staff from Le Cordon Bleu read reviews and improve from the reviews.  I was told the menu changes every 3 to 4 months.  I'll give it some time and then I'll stop in again!

Food was ok too.  Loved the house salad.  My pizza kinda sucked, was suppose to be thick crust and was thin.  We had to ask three times for more dressing.  My mom ordered a wheat beer and she was brought ??? well it wasnt  wheat beer, so she ordered something else.  Ten minutes later, still no beer.

You can just drop in and start painting, no need for a reservation. I would highly suggest buying the groupon if you choose to do this, otherwise you'll be paying double.

Food is decent, minimum satisfactory met. But I feel the price in comparison to the quality is not so good,  fairly over priced.

This time we ordered a new house special, durian mochi, steamed milk and egg whites.

The mochi was soft and chewy. The filling inside had great flavors of durian which was good. The only downfall that made it a real turn off was that I tasted thin bits of ice inside the filling. Thus, it tells me that its not made fresh and was pulled out from the freezer. A big No No!

The steamed milk and egg whites was decent. It took way longer than the mochi so it didn't arrive at the table until we were almost done eating.

Sandwiches are about $2.50 to $3.00 a piece and if you want something really good, go for the more exotic ones. My favorite is their meatball which doesn't sound exotic at all but its a fresh french roll filled with Asian style meatballs, pickled vegetables, cilantro and fresh sliced jalapenos. So, so good! It's spicy though but it's one of the yummiest, cheapest things you'll ever eat (and as for the spicy, my toddler eats it so put on your big girl panties and quit complaining). 

The next best thing on the menu is their Lee's iced coffee. It's espresso and sweetened condensed milk served over ice. Sounds a little different, but it's heaven in a cup. The sweetened condensed milk balances out the bitterness of the espresso and the hot concoction melts the ice to the perfect viscosity for your libationary enjoyment. Hmmmm. I could go for one now.

Update: I had to use them again as there are no other cab companies.  They came, but only because they stalk E Carson St after 2 AM and not because they actually took down my request.  I know this because I lost a phone in the cab and the dispatcher couldn't find the request ever being recorded when I called in 5 minutes later to try to get it back.

On a positive note, they were helpful in returning my phone once it was found.  I really appreciated that the dispatcher went to check for it in the cashier station on a Sunday, when she could've told me to wait until Lost & Found officially opened the next day.",2011-09-30 18:22:05

We went on a Sunday evening, it was pretty quiet there compared to a lot of the surrounding bars in the area (which I liked). The place is gorgeous, I have to say that. The unique abstract table tops and the painting around the door on the outside was all done by hand (I watched the guy paint some of it a couple months ago). It's dark, but comfortable at the bar and it's an overall chill atmosphere. 

My boyfriend ordered a burger, I ordered a falafel sandwich as well as a BBQ chicken pizza to share. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and was happy that ""it didn't fall apart at all"" but it didn't blow him away. My falafel sandwich was good but again, nothing fantastic and not something that I would order again. They are known for their brick oven pizzas so I had high expectations. The BBQ chicken pizza was good- thin, crispy crust and topped with Caramelized onions, chicken, sweet BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese. The BBQ sauce was a little overwhelming and took away the flavors of the onions, cheddar cheese and chicken though. 

Their draft list wasn't bad at all, they have a pretty large selection of craft beers! 

It was an overall enjoyable dinner, but nothing noteworthy. I would like to return to try their wings, but I won't rush back.",2014-10-14 02:21:11

To begin, I wasn't impressed with our server. He forgot a few requests and when I asked if I could try another side sauce for my enchilada he failed to mention the extra 50 cent charge. That's a major pet peeve of mine- failing to mention you're going to up charge someone for something is a big no no. When I told him, he offered to take it off, which I declined because that's not the point. You need to let people know in advance if you're going to do that. 

The food also just wasn't great. This was the most bland guacamole I think I've ever had in my life. The three table salsas and chips were ok. Not one of my three different kinds of enchiladas were flavorful and they all seemed to be smothered in cheese. The kids meal beef taco was extremely greasy.

Louis!  After all they play a lot of sports and isn't skating a sport??

Well turns out that it was the wrong day for skating but a great day to find a neat little gem in this area.

I'm going to agree with some of the other reviewers on food.  The wings are wings.  Everyone has their preference on the type of wings they like but my preferences favour st. Louis wings in terms of meatiness (I don't think they are scrawny or too meaty (no growth hormones or turkey wings for me thank you).

This time I had the rib and wing platter and a couple pints of keiths.  The food was alright and hit the spot.  I am an addict for their sauce...it's normally served with the fries but I literally dip everything edible into it.  

What made this visit a good one and made me a fan and probable repeat customer was the owner, jimmy!  On entering it just happened that he was the person we flagged down.  With the other sports activities on, we didn't want to take a tv that someone else might want to watch (and I was embarrassed I won't lie).  Jimmy was awesome...he got us in an area where we could watch a specific tv, and because it was a relatively empty space he gave us freedom to pick the perfect viewing seats.  He even gave us the tv remote to find the skating (we settled on football once my friend realized she had the wrong date).  In staying there it was interesting to see Jimmy engage all the patrons as he did his rounds.

I think my only real complaint was that it did seem either understaffed or because we were in a separate space they didn't frequent us as much to check in on us (the staff I mean).

I often forget that even these franchises have owners who are working to make a living and make something of themselves.  I am a firm believer that it is these entrepreneurs that will bring us put of a recessionary time period and was definitely proud and happy to see the owner so engaged on a Friday night, supporting his staff and appreciating his customers.  

While st. Louis has the standard menu and decor, this time around the people really made the difference.

Will I be returning again, and soon?  A definite yes, thanks to jimmy.",2011-10-30 04:41:33

The person at the other end of the squawk box was friendly enough on both visits.  What makes this purely a three star experience (based on an average) was my experience today.  Everything was rolling smooth.  Upon paying for my order, I was asked if I wanted any sauce.  I appreciated this and asked for chili sauce.  My request was repeated back to me...thus acknowledging my request.  Transaction accomplished, I was off to a corner of an adjacent parking lot to enjoy my meal.  When I settled down, I realized my chili sauce had been replaced with soy sauce. WTF?!  I thought about driving back, but decided against it.  Maybe my pleasant server was clueless or maybe she decided to amuse herself and f*&$ with me.  Either way...I had no time for either.

Staff are really cool and helpful.

The coffee is delicious and strong. Nothing worse than a weak cup'o joe. I had a pot of their Orange Detox also, which wasn't terrible, but I could tell they used tap water.. I loathe tap water and can immediately tell a difference because I think the tap here tastes absolutely fucking disgusting. I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night.

Now, I came here with old colleagues for summerlicious and to catch up. We made reservations for 6pm. When we arrived, one of party was running late. But the server kept coming around to refill glasses and check up on us. When everyone was here, however, they tried to rush us into ordering a little. Eventually they stopped, to the point that we had to then call them over when we were all ready to order.

The excellent part is a lot of us were torn on what we wanted. They were really nice and offered us to somewhat combine dishes. They usually offer a substitution for the steak, instead of mashed potatoes and veggies you can get pasta. But the pasta is usually like penne. Thy graciously allowed us to have lobster ravioli as out pasta side. Two pieces of ravioli (the actually dish has 6 pieces) with our steak. We even got complimentary veggies to share amongst the four of us.

The downside to this great offer was that I ordered a medium steak and got something closer to medium-well. And the lobster ravioli wasn't that great. Although the sauce was amazing.
For our apps we had gotten calamari, meatballs and crab cake. The crab cake was a bit lonely, just one cake. The meatballs were good. But tiny and only four. The calamari was delicious!
The most pathetic part of our meal was the dessert. When put together it was pretty yummy, esp the ricotta gelato. The brownie was okay and the poached pear looked like tuna sashimi on the plate. It was yummy but two pieces of it was too much for the tiny dollop of gelato. I wish they hadn't presented it deconstructed on such a large plate.

So the food was hit and miss. My negative comments relate to the service. We were very pleased with the service until we finished dinner and dessert and no one came around for ages. Then they went to get four bills and did come back for another 15 mins. In the meantime I had to use the washroom. When I saw there was no toilet paper, I went back to notify one of the employees there. She said okay, but did not go to replace the roll. I had to borrow wet wipes from a friend to use their washroom ...... That is not good service. ESP in a restaurant. That isn't bustling with diners. Lastly, I paid in cash and it took another 15 mins before my change came around and we could finally leave.

This seems like a nice place, but it also seems like they won't be open for long. The food was okay, the service averages to okay. They weren't busy. I won't be going back. It's harsh to say it, but it definitely doesn't look like a business that will last.",2015-07-17 22:34:00

The main come with a salad which was decent. Hmm the quails were just bland. Devoid of taste and not very meaty. The sides of potato was OK and the rice was forgettable. 
I did try the saganaki as dc ordered it as well. Great to get attention though no my kind of cheese (way too salty). The wine list is off beat and had some interesting options.

I have an intense and passionate relationship with steak. I love it.  What's a girl to do then when her time is up in Toronto and she hasn't tried all the steakhouses.  Simple, she turns to her friends to help her narrow down the field.

Sidebar: Of the ones I have tried, I loved House of Chan.  I like Ruth's Chris  and I enjoy  mainstream joints like the Keg and Canyon Creek.  I'm not a fan of Morton's or Le Biftheque.

My shortlist was Jacobs, Ruby Watch Co, Barberians and Harbour Sixty.  I surveyed 100 Facebook friends and Harbour Sixty won the majority by 1 vote, Barberians was second and Jacobs was third.  I nixed the latter since most people raved about the table caesar.  Greens are secondary to me.

My friend Minnie and I headed to Harbour Sixty on my Final Friday (in Toronto), and it couldn't have been a more perfect finale.  I'd go back for an encore if I could.

It was one of the best meals I've had - starting with the impeccable service.  Comfortable, not stiff; polite, not awkward; attentive, not over-bearing; and professional, not pretentious.

It does come at a bit of a premium, but it served some of the best classic steakhouse sides I've had, and my ribeye (bone-in) was perfectly medium-rare.

The Golden Beet Salad was a nice twist on a classic.  Instead of just beets and goat cheese, they use a mould and create a trifle like salad.  

The Seared Ahi Tuna was fresh with a nice acidic bite.

We chose the broccolini, fries, and the mac-and-cheese.  The latter was a star.  I usually find mac-and-cheese overrated, but this one was bursting with flavour.

We paired dessert with coffee, and if presentation is any indication of the quality at Harbour Sixty, the coffee platter said it all.  Beautifully, impeccably laid out.  It's always about the details.

A perfect end to my Toronto adventure.  Be yelping from the other side...Vancouver that is.",2012-10-18 05:00:51

Parking is free which is a nice gesture and the tickets are reasonably priced, but as I've thought about it more, I think this is why the price for concessions is so ridiculously high.  $5 for cotton candy during Spring Training? Seriously? 


The field itself is absolutely beautiful. The seating is well done and the grass area is also well manicured and well maintained. 

The volunteers they have acting as ushers could be a little more diligent though. There was a kid who thought he could stand in the aisle talking to his buddy for as long as the rest of us would let him and not once did the usher come and remind him to take his seat. Fortunately, the kid had his name on his baseball glove that he was clutching so when I called his name and told him to SIT DOWN, he sat...mostly because he was scared that this strange lady knew his name! His mother didn't like it much but I reminded her that if I wanted to watch a game with a kid standing right in front of me the whole time, I'd go watch at home on TV. That got a chuckle from my fellow seatmates...and the kid kept his butt in the chair the rest of the time. :) This is not the first time I've experienced less than diligent ushers at this stadium and for this and the very expensive concessions, Surprise Stadium only gets 4 stars.",2009-03-17 15:58:29

We were lucky enough to have, what I can only assume, the restaurant manager and/or owner take care of our table. He created such a memorable experience for us, to which I am grateful, as we were celebrating a friends birthday. 

The food came out in a fantastic pace so as we were finishing one dish the next was just being placed on our table. Though I am not new to Spanish tapas, there were some ""firsts"" I experienced. The manager/owner ordered us a plate of liquid olives ""elBulli-style"" which is something I have never tried, nor, seen before - definitely a great experience. The croquettes are classically delicious, and I can honestly say I don't think there was one dish I didn't enjoy. Just make sure you save room for desert, the Buñuelo's are to die for!

Everyone do the poor wait staff a favor and stop making those puns. You don't think they've heard all of them? I wince when I see one of the poor staff fake a chuckle at the terrible wanna-be-comedy expressions produced by the patrons who have one too many boots for their own good.

Anyways, getting to the review, do you like beer? Do you like fresh oysters? Do you like a friendly atmosphere? Well you're in the right place. Wurst is a great place to go for dinner (upstairs) or just for drinks (downstairs). The food is generally really good with the exception of the schnitzel. I'm confused why a German inspired bar would have a poor quality German dish but unfortunately that is the case. The other German dishes, on the other hand, are really great quality. They even serve a pretty good steak considering they're in a city with a lot of competition in that area.

Also I hear many rumors and stories of the crazy party nights, but unfortunately I haven't been able to attend yet. I look forward to this experience in the future and will update my review after that time.

Hands down, it is the BEST middle eastern food around and the prices can't be beat.  We moved to Utah about 10 years ago and searched for food that was as tasty as it is here.  At the end of the meal, we would say, ""well, it was okay, but it's no Haji Baba.""  When we decided to move back to Arizona, the first place we went for lunch out was Haji Baba!  It continues to be delicious.

I also love the market that is inside.  I buy all of my feta here as well as greek olives.  They have awesome prices on the feta and olives as well as spices that can be hard to find elsewhere.  

There are several things worthy of complaining about, but the food is so good that it makes it all worth it.  This place is very popular, which makes it difficult to find a table during peak times.  Lunch is crazy busy!  The service in the restaurant leaves something to be desired.  It's pretty bare bones and definitely not at all like the nice chain greek restaurants (think My Big Fat Greek....)  We no longer eat in the restaurant, we now go for take out.  This place does a huge amount of take out so call your order in ahead of time.

We went on a Sunday and stopped unexpectedly for brunch without any expectations. I will say it's actually a bigger place than most other restaurants in the Strip District.

For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Sushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.

My bubble tea's were not made yet and my sandwiches weren't ready either. The gentlemen working their was very nice(young guy). He took my mop and I sat in the entrance as he made my tea's. He then told me the food would be just a little bit longer. All together I waited 10mins at the restaurant for my food. 

After I got home with the food:
I realized I am not a fan of bubble tea and I now know why I never ordered it in the past. The texture is bizarre and it was pure sugar. Had to try it once tho to find out. The bahn mi was fine. Not the best I've had but not the worst either.

Most of us are very familiar with Middle Eastern food so we had a pretty good idea of what to get and how things should taste. 

First, it's a small place, with tables sort of thrown into an add-on to a Mid-Eastern market, so larger parties may have an issue getting seated right away. It took them almost 20 minutes to seat us, but that's not entirely their fault. I mean, you have to work with what you've got, right? Just be prepared to wait if there's more than, say, 5 or so in your group.

The market is kind of nifty, so take the time to browse if you get there and are waiting for a table or for people to show up. Lots of spices, and you can ogle the half dozen different types of baklava they have up front. Yes, I said half a dozen. Pistachio, walnut, pecan, almond, and a couple others. They also have Bulgarian feta, which I haven't had since I left Bangkok, and I highly recommend if you're a fan of Greek feta. I'll be going back for a nice big chunk, this I can promise you. 

Now the food: My partner's two boys are two of the pickiest eaters I know, so we got them the chicken kebab sandwich. I didn't get to try it, but they both finished their plates, so I'll take that as a positive testimonial. My partner and I shared a variety of things: gyros, kebab, chicken shwarema, rice, hummus (which on the menu is spelled ""homos,"" much to the amusement of the kids), and tabouli, with homemade pita bread. My cousins both got the veggie platters and I honestly don't remember what my uncle got. :) The gyros and kebab were phenomenal, extremely flavourful, and the gyros was the best I'd had in a long time. I think the chicken shwarama was my favourite though. It almost melts in your mouth and the flavours are fantastic. The hummus was very good, especially with the homemade pita. (Definitely pay the extra for the ""real"" stuff. Store bought just doesn't cut it here.) I'm not really a huge fan of tabouli, but my partner seemed to like it well enough. One great little surprise for me were the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). A traditional Greek dish, I'm never really a fan. My dad makes these by the bucketful and freezes them. Usually, for me, they tend to be bitter and too bland, but I got to try one off of one of the veggie plates and it was actually REALLY good. I honestly think it may have been the best dolmades I've ever had. So I'd recommend it. 

To drink I took a risk and got the yogurt soda. Anyone familiar with Indian food will most likely have tried lassi at one point of another.... this is NOT lassi. This is definitely an acquired taste, but if you want to try something different, give it a shot. It is literally plain, unsweetened yogurt with soda water. No one else at my table liked it, but I thought it was different and in its own way, rather refreshing. 

We shared the pistachio and pecan baklava at the end of the meal. Fresh, homemade and soooooo good! 

I have lots of reasons to go back, one of which would be the bill at the end of the night. Keep in mind, there were 4 of us on our tab, 2 kebab sandwiches, 3 drinks, my yogurt soda, the chicken shwarama plate, a kebab, a gyros and 2 baklava and it all came up to about $35. You really can't beat that.",2011-12-02 23:16:45

Loved the ambience and the space.  Really gorgeous.  They had the door wide open, and a great breeze was blowing in.  As with all three restaurants, service was well-informed, efficient, friendly.....excellent.  No women servers here, all real-Italian men :)

We shared everything which I think is always the way to do.  We had the tuna and the soft shell crab to start.  Both were good, but we agreed it was the weakest course (we had a three course meal).   Second out was the nodini (GET THEM) and the vela heart tartar, which was really interesting and flavourful.  Then we split two pastas, both excellent - one was a duck one and the other was pork blood.  I hate spicy food, but the pork blood pasta had a perfect, delicate undernote of spice.  Tiramisu to finish, gotta share just one dessert because all those carbs fill you up.

Order your To Go rolls ahead of time on a busy Saturday night -
Hubby & I had a sushi roll craving and since I Love Sushi has a really nice selection, we perused the menu and ordered:  Kanpai Special - the yellowtail was so fresh and I love the delicate, fresh flavors and the tempura shrimp in this roll (my favorite); Burn in My Stomach - yep, includes jalapeños and it was so spicy good; XXX - soft-shell crab but it was hidden amongst the creamy special sauce.

We were both starving--which was good, considering the size of Roxy's offerings.  I had never been here before, but liked it instantly.  As advertised, it indeed reflected the ""50's with a Twist!""  And, the twist embraced really talented singing servers, some unusual sauces, and a dash of humor.  A strapping birthday boy had just turned 21 this night, and a female server, accompanied by patrons, serenaded him with the happy birthday song after he took a seat on the checkerboard floor in the center of the dining room.  Then she told him that as a present he could have a free glass of water!  And, the waitress just walked away. 

The singing of '50s hits was first rate--obviously a job requirement for all servers.  A new song was belted out about every 18 minutes.  And, there was even a lively duet.

A requested Vanilla Coke was quickly produced, and was very good.  Skin-on fries were not very hot and were hard and not very tasty.  But my half-pound Roxy's Ground Chuck Burger with Mushrooms and Swiss Cheese was medium rare as ordered and excellent.  To my own surprise, probably due to having had nothing to eat for over 9 hours, I had no trouble at all polishing off the large burger, that also contained a tomato slice, pickles, and lots of crunchy Iceberg Lettuce, in one fairly quick sitting.  But my burger looked diminutive compared to the huge 2-pound Rotunda Burger that I saw an optimistic diner try to consume at a neighboring booth.  He failed at the effort, because I saw him leave soon afterward with a to-go box.  I also enjoyed a side of creamy Cole Slaw, and some Chipotle Aioli along with tomato ketchup and mild mustard to dress up my burger. 

Diane's Hot Fudge Milkshake was pretty good but much thinner and not on the same plane as the superb shakes that had graced my lips at Steak 'n Shake inside South Point.  On the other hand, my burger this night was far superior to the medium-well, thin twin-pattied Original Double Steakburger with Cheese I had quickly gulped down at Steak 'n Shake.  

Although I really liked the restaurant's ambiance, and my singing server was proficient and ready to please, there were a couple of problems that we encountered.  Soon after I sat down I noticed that some hard gunk from a prior spilled milkshake was stuck to the edge of my table.  And, later on, the first plate brought to Diane also had a quite visible small piece of hard food on it until the plate was replaced at my request.  Silverware was brought to the table, but our server quickly snatched a knife back and replaced it before the utensils were handed to me.  I hope the uncleanliness problem gets resolved soon, because this is a cool '50s diner with good food.  And, I would like to revisit it in the near future.

The cones of The Ultimate Tower that contained not very hot Chicken Bites, Chicken Wings, Fried Cheese, and Popcorn Shrimp had a base of Onion Rings at the bottom, which made it appear like there were more morsels of chicken and shrimp, and more hunks of cheese, than there really were.  And, the thin battered Onion Rings were really more like Onion Straws.

Overall, our experience was positive, and at 1:30 a.m. my mate and I left Roxy's and headed for home, full and happy.    * * * 1/2 stars!",2012-04-01 14:28:20

1. Drinks - get the strawberry lemonade. If you need an adult beverage, get the strawberry lemonade with vodka in it. Do not miss out on this deliciousness. 
2. Dinner - on our table we had two orders of the pan fried pimento cheese chicken and one order of the chili salmon. Both were unbelievably good. And the horseradish mashed potatoes and collards (with smoked turkey instead of bacon for flavor) were also top notch. 
3. Dessert - we went for a trio of desserts to share. The peanut butter pie (creamy and delectable), the cobbler with ice cream (quite good), and the banana pudding. Now, I am not much of a banana pudding fan, but OH.MY.GOODNESS. was it good. By far the best dessert of the three. And I'm a huge peanut butter pie fan, so that's saying a lot.

I'm a fan of the Vancouver location and wanted to see how this place stacked up. We sat by the bar and unexpectedly recognized chef Yoshinaga as the sous chef from Kaji (he's the one with the ridiculously big smile...and the stylin' undercut and permed faux-hawk!)! We knew we were in for a treat and he didn't disappoint! The place is also bigger than most of the other izakayas in town, so hopefully there won't be ridiculous lines.

Kingyo is an izakaya in a loose sense but their dishes seem catered towards more high end offerings - the quality and presentation is clear from each of the dishes we ordered, undoubtedly inspired by Kaji.

The highlight of the night was easily the ABURI TORO & AVOCADO 2TONE BATTERA with its flame seared tuna boxed on top of layers of rice and avocado. It tasted amazing! The TAKO WASABI came with a lot of pieces of nori and had a good kick to it. I'd probably avoid the STONE BOWL MUSHROOM TOFU because it was rather plain (4 deep fried tofu with some sauce and enoki mushrooms) for $8. We ordered the staple FAMOUS ""O-SHO RESTAURANT"" KARAAGE WITH MAGIC POWDER - these deep friend chicken balls were ginormous and sublime! And finally, we ordered their PORK TANTAN RAMEN for $11, which had thicker and springy-er noodles (like the Chinese ""dam dam"" noodles) than the ramen shops around town, delicious spicy broth, but they skimped on the pork. We paired our dishes with BROWN TEA, which is excellent for sharing because they'll keep refilling your french press with hot water, and their FRESH GINGER HIGH BALL cocktail from their homemade ginger ale - tasty and sweet, but I couldn't taste the booze.

Their menu is huge and having had a front row seat of the preparation, it would appear that each dish, from those involving oysters, sashimi to even vegan dishes looked quite impressive. I'm definitely looking to coming back for more!

Their strength is everything. Just everything.

I really wanted to check out the hype and stopped by last Saturday around 10:30am. After reading a few reviews, I was under the assumption Cartel served some form of breakfast (sandwiches? Burritos?). When I asked the barista, he told me no and pointed to the display case of pastries. I was a little disappointed by this as I was starving.  Nothing in the pastry case really sparked my interest and I had two employees staring at me expectantly. Glancing up, I looked at the very simple menu and tried to gauge what I wanted. Feeling pressured, I ordered my standard go-to drink: a small vanilla latte. The latte was a tiny 8oz and $4 total. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. (One of my favorite coffee shops has 8oz as their small size, but they list the pricing/sizing on the menu so I can make an appropriate decision.) Taking my drink to go, I slowly sipped my drink. It was a good, decent latte. Definitely better than any chains and a few other local shops I've been to, but not something I'd drive out of my way for. 

A few weeks following my first experience, I decided to give Cartel another go. This time, I knew I wanted to try their iced coffee. I also ordered a large hot latte for a friend. After making the large latte, the barista poured my iced coffee and asked if I needed cream. I told him I definitely needed enough cream to make the drink a mellow khaki color. He then proceeded to take the left-over hot milk from the previous latte and pour it into my iced coffee. Two things. He asked if I wanted ""cream"" not milk. Second, he didn't give me an option to say no to hot milk being poured into my cold drink. Since I haven't been a barista for over 7 years, I decided to go with the flow and didn't say anything. He then handed me my drink and I proceed to add some simple syrup. (Next to the counter, there is a small area with sugar packets, lids, napkins, and simple syrup in a pump.) After adding some simple syrup, I took a tentative sip. I almost spit it out. The drink tasted like oranges. Strong, overpowering oranges. Oh god. I looked up at the barista, but he was already engaged with another customer. Not wanting a confrontation, I decided to take my paid-for drinks and go. I tried a few more sips of the drink, but just couldn't do it. It was horrible. I then drove down the street to another coffee shop (which coincidently served Cartel beans) and ordered a hot latte. 

The hype sucked me in and I'm glad I gave it a try. However, I will probably never be back. There are so many other good local coffee shops near me that I would not go out of my way to drive to Cartel.",2014-10-28 22:07:57

We were starving so we were a bit disappointed that it was a 30-45 minute wait but it was a friday night.  We perused the drink list (it is a bit confusing because it looks like a facebook page) but settled on a MOFOjito and a margarita.  The MOFOjito (mojito with pomegranate) and the marg were served in pint glasses which was a surprise but so was the $20 tab for both of them. My ""man-friend"" was appalled (he is normally an IC Light kinda guy).

After we waited by the very dimly lit bar for about 45 minutes the hostess sat us at a table in the downstairs portion of the restaurant (basically right next to where we were standing.) 

I started off with the veggie chili which was hearty and filling. It was topped with sour cream and served with a pita chip...delish.  I also ordered a spinach salad which the server explained to me is now different from what's on the menu.  Something about no strawberries, crumbled blue cheese, spiced pecans... It was definitely a change for the WORSE. The salad came out looking rather lonely with sliced almonds, 4 orange slices and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  It was sooooo bland. The dressing was just straight up balsamic vinegar.  Not only was it bland but it was tiny (almost looked like a side salad for $9.50). My date got the 'Salad a la pittsburgh' he wasn't thrilled by it either. His was much bigger than my salad and came with chicken (i think it was $1.00 more). 

We didn't get alcoholic drinks with dinner and our bill was $29.00 which isn't that much more than our bar tab for 2 drinks. 

Pros: Lively, fireplace when you walk in the door, a bunch of vegetarian options, big drink list, 

Cons: Pricey drinks, very dark inside, sub-par salads, ""funny"" menu ( you have to read the whole description to figure out each item, I understand how lazy that sounds but witty names are only good once in a while)

Overall: Might go go back and not get a salad.  The beer selection looked promising.",2011-01-15 22:07:52

It was a lovely day and luckily we were able to get a table on the patio. Service was quite attentive, although at times it was unclear just who exactly our server was. Once seated we were quickly given a sample of a new beer they had- I thought this was a nice idea and this actually led to our table getting an additional pitcher of this new beer, on top of the other pitchers that we ordered. 

Food came at a fairly reasonable pace considering the size of our group and how busy the restaurant was. Most people got their food around the same time and no one at the table was left to wait too long. The general consensus was that the food was good- most people got some kind of burger, sandwich or the fish and chips. I personally had the burger and thought that it was decent, though a bit dry. I did find it weird that not a single person who ordered a burger was asked how they wanted it cooked. 

Based on this experience, my team actually came back for a work lunch earlier this week. The group ordered about the same type of food as before but sadly, everyone said that their meal was not very good. Not sure if the kitchen staff has changed but our most recent visit left much to be desired. Our group was pretty disappointed.

We went there around 4-5 pm for a late lunch early dinner. It was empty at the time so the owner and the waitress were able to give us most of their time. The owner introduced her self right away and so did the waitress. She told us about their restaurant and how it's the first Portuguese restaurant in Las Vegas. They went through the menu with us since it was our first time there. I was surprised at how knowledgeable the waitress was about every item in the menu. 

There is a complimentary bread basket in the beginning. The basket had two types of bread. The first one was a cinnamon bread. It was very soft and slightly sweet. It went really well with the butter. The other bread was an herd bread with a caviar dipping sauce. It was really delicious. I wanted seconds but, I wanted to leave room for rest of the meal.

We ordered calamari, pig ears, and paella. The calamari was good. It has a very light flavor and I think it was intended to be that way. It was lemony and buttery so I enjoyed this one more than my boyfriend did. The pigs ear was really good! It was not tough where you would find yourself chewing excessively, but slightly chewy andy crunchy. It came with two sauces, a vinegar one and a spicy one. Both were very good. The paella was simply amazing. I did not know what the sauce was but this stuff was really good. I'd recommend everyone to try their paella. 

We also ordered their dessert of the day which was a mascarpone roll with ice cream and berry sauce. This was really good. I can describe the taste as a cookies and cream cheesecake. Though I would've thought that texture was going to be gritty from how it looked, it was the opposite. It was smooth and creamy. Definitely would love to have it again.

And the best thing about it all is that everything is homemade.",2014-09-28 17:59:38

We headed over from our hotel and found a 45 minute wait for a table, so we signed in and sat at the bar.  The bar had 4 employees behind the bar, but it still took them a while to get to us (hate to see them work a Vegas bar), our bartender asked if we would be eating at the bar, we replied NO just wanted drinks.  I asked him if they had any signature drinks that he would recommend, he looked at and said, ""we have them, but no one orders them"" then handed me a menu and said here look at these.  His lack of confidence in their signature drinks made me rethink them QUICKLY and I said, ""never mind, I'll order an old favorite of mine.  I'd like a Grey Goose martini, up with a lemon twist"".  Hubby had to throw his order in quick, because this boy was already turning away from us.  He poured me a shot of Goose with a lemon wedge and handed me the drink.  I looked at hubby and shrugged, hubby was handed his drink we cheered and I went to take a sip and realized my glass was VERY broken.  I flagged the bartender down and he actually gave me a side look with a FINGER (not that famous middle one) and told me to WAIT.  When he finally came up to me with ATTITUDE, I gave it right back to him with.  LOOK (as I lift the glass in line with his eyes) do YOU see a problem with THIS???  His face fell, attitude dropped, apologized under his breath and then grabbed the glass and was going to leave, when my husband decided to explain to him in step by step instructions on how to make a martini.  I finally received a martini with a lemon twist, so he did know what they were.  surprise surprise.  When my cousin arrived and sat with us he NEVER came to get her order, in fact he never even looked our way again.  This bartender needs a MINUS star review 

When our remote went off, hubby went and told the hostess that we couldn't get our bartender's attention and could she please forward our bar bill to the table.  We never got charged for our drinks, (his apology? or ?)  The restaurant has lots of space, I loved that they do not shove in as many tables as they can, and even though we were in the center of the room, we still felt private.  Our server was fast and very attentive.  They have a nice menu, but the food is neither traditional or fused enough to stand out.  It was an OK dinner, we enjoyed our company better.

We ordered the crab ragoons, they are very generous with the crab mixture, chili sauce tastes jarred.  Nachos, were not made well.  each ingredient was measured and placed on the plate, but nothing was spread over the entire area of wonton chips, became hard to eat and get that perfect bite.  Wonton chips were very thin and broke easily, you definitely need a fork for assistance.  Edamame, again, salted but only on top in a small area.  Uncle Fu's fried rice, it was ok and cousin loved her chicken rice soup, I think it was called Long Life.  

Biggest stand out for me, because this is VERY unusual, I had to order bottled water with my meal.  The tap water was so disgusting in flavor that even with the lemon wedge I could not power through it.  They brought their casino labeled bottled water, I wasn't given a choice.  All in all not one of my worst or favorite meal experiences.",2016-02-13 17:57:37

I've heard good things about Blue Martini from coworkers, but had never made my way over until now. It was Saturday afternoon and the weather was beautiful so obviously day drinking outside was the logical activity. We also needed new shoes from a store at Town Square so this was an obvious choice. 

We arrived around 5 on Saturday and the hostess told us that seating was open. Most of the seating available was at the bar or inside, but we were able to snag one of the few outdoor patio tables available. As soon as we sat down our friendly waitress greeted us and provided waters. She checked in several times while we were there and our waters continued to be filled. 

The drink menu was impressive. They offer plenty of different drinks ranging from martinis to mix drinks to white and red wines. It was one of the lengthier mixed drink menus I've seen lately. 

My Pomerita had more of a sweet taste than a boozy taste. It was light for a summer evening. My husband really enjoyed his Bombs Away.

For a divey bar, it was rather large in size with multiple rooms and a decent size back patio from what I saw.  We were in the upstairs area and what a sight it was.  Decor was very eclectic, literally a mish mash of everything.  The furniture reminded me of an antique shop or someone's kitschy home.  Although not quite homey like, it felt somewhat comforting.  It was a little bit of an eyesore, but also interesting at the same time. 

Also, there were photos and artifacts on the walls of anything and everything, no theme whatsoever.  Seemed like they just hung whatever they had up in no particular order and wherever it may fit. 

The best part of the room was the dumb-waiter.  How many places do you know where you place your orders down a chute?  Quite simple to use as instructions were on the blackboard.  There was a roll of paper provided along with pens on the side table, so we just needed to write our name and orders on a piece of paper, fold it in half, clip it to the zip line, and down the chute it goes.  Wait time between orders were very reasonable and sometimes drinks came up quicker than expected. 

Servers were very friendly and courteous, plus after a couple of orders, they remembered who we were and just brought the drinks right to us without calling our names.  Now that's service!  

Menu was quite varied and very reasonably priced.  Something for everyone and they even have gluten-free menu options and a daily specials menu.  Lots of beers on taps with specials listed on the blackboard.  Definitely a place for beer lovers.

I ordered the rainbow trout ($12.95) which came with salad and rice.  Fish was pan seared with lemon and pepper, tasted fresh and portion was good sized. Nice and simple meal that I finished easily  with nothing left on the plate.

We decided to skip entrees and order three appetizers, it was that kind of night. On our table was placed crab cakes, oysters Rockefeller and the Foie Gras. The presentation of all three were post card worthy... Hail the food art that was presented before us! The crab cakes were crispy and moist, the crab was fresh. The toppings of various vegetation that decorated the crab cakes were a fine compliment since it added texture and palate changes.

As for the oysters Rockafeller... Wow... Super fresh oysters. The oysters were large, perfectly cooked with a topping of spinach mix and hollandaise sauce. The oysters were presented on a plate of rock salt, a happy place for salt lickers! I highly recommend this appetizer.

Now the Foie Gras is pretty darn good.  I love ordering foie gras because different restaurants create various interpretations of this beloved ingredient. At Anthony's, it is seared and served with thick toasted bread. I really appreciated the thick bread because in all honesty... There was enough bread for the foie gras! Awesome!!

We also ordered the frozen peanut butter pie for dessert. Ummmm wow. This is definitely a shared dessert because what you get is a MASSIVE slice of frozen peanut butter pie on a chocolate cookie type crust and topped with nuts and chocolate. Super amazing!

Her husband had made reservations for 8:00pm. We got there and they said the table was not ready. We didn't get seated till around 8:20pm. I don't understand the concept of making a reservation when you still need to wait?

The restaurant was incredibly loud and you could barely hear what anyone is saying. We sat at a small round table. Our waiter was on the other side of the table talking and I couldn't catch anything he was saying so no idea what his name was either. The noise didn't bother us but for others who are looking for something more intimate, this isn't it. 

SERVICE - I felt like this was very poor last night. It took our waiter forever to come back to take our drink order. My two friends said ""I have not even seen our waiter again. Did he forget about us""? So after awhile, we ordered drinks. I would say took 15-20min for those to come out. Even when we ordered food, that didn't come out until 9:25pm. Sometimes when it takes awhile for your food to come, you don't notice it too much because though the wait is long...it's not THAT long. This was one of those waits where your entire table kind of has the realization of ""Wow they are slow. Our food is STILL not here"". And not to mention, we all got our food except for the main guest...our friend celebrating her birthday/graduation. After about 10min of waiting, we had to flag down our waiter to remind him that we were still waiting for her food! 

DRINKS - The drinks were not bad but not very strong either. 

FOOD
Short Rib Mac n Cheese - This was tasty and the flavor was good. Only thing missing was the short rib. We didn't find very many pieces of meat in this. 

Spaghettini - Our friend got this dish and he said it was ""too good to be true"" regarding the noodles being zucchini. He really liked this one. 

Garganelli - This wasn't as good as we hoped. It had a very strong tomato based sauce. 

Beauty & Essex Burger - This was a very juicy burger. The meat was not even close to dry so it was well cooked. Flavor wise, I wasn't crazy about it. It was a little bland in my opinion. 

BBQ Fries - This was the star of the night. Perfectly crisp fries seasoned w BBQ. 

Overall, it's a beautiful restaurant. Very hip and the ambiance was great. Service wasn't amazing. Food was okay.",2017-05-27 16:30:26

This place can get pretty busy.  I don't think I have been here when it hasn't been packed.  Witht that said however, the service is always great!  The bartenders and the servers are very polite.

I was here once on St. Patty's Day and of course there was a bit of a wait.  The wait was not that bad because they had a band playing.  When we finally got seated our server was very prompt and pleasant.  We ordered and were surpised by how quickly our food came.  They seemed to be very prepared for the rush of customers that they would receive on that day.  The food was good, no major complaints though I would have liked a bit more heat.

We were seated at a table that already almost full, we took the last 4 spots. They were a party of 6ish, and then us. So just two groups. The waitress came and took our drink orders quickly and just a few minutes later all of our soups and salads were being served. 

The soup is delish, and the mushrooms are large enough that I can easily remove them (I don't do mushrooms!). The salad is SO good. It has a ginger dressing on it that is just wonderful. I have had other versions of this ginger dressing at other hibachi places, this is the best I've had yet. 

Our chef came out while we were all still munching on our salads and started the show. He was hilarious! Charismatic, funny, attentive, and very entertaining! 

He cooked up several meats for the table, shrimp, chicken, steak, filet mignon. I personally only had the filet mignon in my dish. Normally I opt for combo-meals with two meats, but I am SO glad I didn't. The filet mignon was so perfect. It was cooked exactly as ordered, melted in my mouth, and was so flavorful. I felt bad for all the saps who just ordered the steak. It is SO worth the slightly higher price to get the mignon. 

When everyone was finished, the waitress, along with several other waitstaff, brought out two birthday plates for the table - one for me, and one for one of the folks in the other party. Someone had been sneaky and told them we were celebrating! They sang us a birthday song in Japanese, and then did a second verse in English so everyone could sing. It was great!

Spring rolls were good, although the tacos and tartare were just okay. Overall we were happy with the dishes and the portions.  Unfortunately the service could have been better, it wasn't busy when we were there (a Wednesday night) but still seemed like we had to wave the servers down to make our order and to get the bill.

I want to love First Watch - it seems like the ''in'' thing to do - it's not super expensively priced but it seems like it would be the selection of those with more ''discerning'' tastes. But the taste? It comes up bland a lot of times. I've been to this location and the one out by Whole Foods on the east side. That location would probably get an extra star - their food comes out piping hot and seems to haven been salted for flavor (what an idea!). This location? Not so much. My food is always lukewarm at best and nothing tastes that good. I've had their special - the Huevos Rancheros - and it's ingredients are delightful, but I could make a better dish at home. 

I must mention that yesterday morning we got a free entrée for the boyfriend's birthday (just join the Sun eClub online for your very own). And the food was again - just ok. He had muesli pancakes (a new addition to the menu) and I had the Bacado Omelet with egg whites. When I went to log calories after that meal I was pleasantly surprised that nutritional info was available on First Watch's website but then I was abruptly slapped in the face by the 75, yes SEVENTY-FIVE grams of fat just in the omelet I consumed. Be careful what you order.

Some final tips - 
1. If you must wait on a Saturday or Sunday morning, grab a coffee at the front  (its complimentary, a nice touch) and snag one of the cushy arm chairs (it makes the wait seem way shorter).
2. If you choose wisely (read: not the Bacado omelet), you can get a healthy breakfast, brunch, or lunch here.
3. Parking is available around the corner by The Gap & Coach or you can snag a spot in the parking garage directly to the right of the building.
4. Join the Sun eClub (a free meal awaits you).",2011-11-02 13:44:07

The interior is beautifully done with an awesome open space where you really have that sense of free mobility.

I enjoy their incorporation of air plants or ""fake air plants and trees"" that make it feel like you're walking right into a giant green house. Lighting inside is nice and bright and doesn't rob you of feeling any sort of overheating since they keep it pleasantly cool and comfortably air conditioned.

Each seating spot has its own personality where you can choose either a more intimate smaller table, lazy couch to lounge, a long wooden table to mingle, or the cool book shelf looking stair case thing in the rear of the place (just don't use the declined wooden slope part as a slide).

The desserts and drinks are where the place falls short for me though, I tried the raspberry ginger and yuzu tea, tiramisu, green tea red bean cake, matcha latte, rainbow cake, charcoal bun, and tofu cheese cake. In all honesty I didn't like any of it.

Both the ginger tea and yuzu tea had a very artificial sweetened flavor that I just didn't enjoy at all, the charcoal bun was very plain, the matcha red bean cake was dry and a little lacking to me, the rainbow cake was very dry and plain, and the tofu cheese cake was interesting but a little more funk or cheesy tasting imo. 

The tofu cake was the most interesting of the bunch since the tofu added a bit more of this enjoyable creamy/silky texture but I didn't really like the stronger taste it seemed to have. The matcha latte was not really to my preference since it's more of a bitter stronger matcha taste that I usually don't like, but I'm sure hardcore matcha or black coffee drinkers might appreciate it more than me.

The tiramisu was well...tiramisu; I didn't see anything negative nor special about this one. You can't really mess up tiramisu, or at least I don't think you can; right?

I think over all between the desserts seeming a bit plain and dry and most of the teas having this strange artificial tasting sweetened flavor, I didn't really enjoy the food and drinks as much as I enjoyed snapping the inside of gabi and waiting for friends to ask me where this was.

I guess it felt more like a tinder date to me: everything looked good on the surface, but was lacking everywhere else where it mattered. Oh well.. for both my love life and gabi",2018-04-18 01:49:14

The beet cake, as others have said, is quite good but unless you go there just to eat that, I don't see why anyone should eat here. I really cannot think of a time when I've paid for a more disgusting meal. 

I ordered some comfort food - roasted 1/2 chicken with rice pilaf and carrots on the side. Honestly, the chicken was so rubbery it was just beyond nasty. The rice had DEFINITELY been microwaved - it tasted exactly like it does when I heat up leftover rice pilaf at home. Not necessarily gross but definitely not what I want when eating out. The baby carrots had also been microwaved - if they were any mushier, they could have passed for baby food.  By the time the beet cake that my husband ordered came, I really had no more appetite but I did think it was pretty good. The meal was 14-ish bucks too so it was definitely an overall FAIL. 

I wanted to like this place becuase it seemed homey and it's right in my backyard but I just couldn't eat any of my meal. I hope for their sake, it was just a 'bad night' although I don't really believe in those.

This definitely isn't the cheesy, saucy, gooey Italian food that is so unappealing to me. This food was fresh, lively, and flavourful without relying on gooey, melted cheese and way too much sauce. 

We tried a couple of their pizzas. They were both excellent. The margarita was quite fresh and delicate tasting. We had a charcuterie board and the salamis were all delicious. 

We shared some pasta: the carbonara and one with a rosé sauce (I don't remember what it was exactly since I didn't do the ordering). I thought I'd prefer the carbonara, but I actually preferred the one with the rosé. I don't think they separated the egg all that cleanly on our pasta and I detected some of the white in taste and texture. It wasn't that pleasant, especially since the yolk was so large (goose egg) so it cooled down the pasta considerably and that made the presence of the bit of white all that more off-putting.

       - The only other buffet is Todai (in Planet Hollywood) and I think that place is way over-priced for the same quality.
       - vs AYCE - The main difference between Makino and AYCE Sushi places is that everything is laid out buffet style vs you ordering things. This allows you to see the rolls/nigiri that you might want visually before ordering. This is probably a better choice for the less sushi seasoned.
       - Quality - The quality of the fish has always been decent. Compared to AYCE places, it'll probably be in the upper half. With that said, there are a lot of poor quality AYCE places in vegas.
       - Sashimi - They have sashimi for their dinner prices. It won't be entree quality at a straight sushi place, but it's decent.
       - Nigiri - They have all the normal nigiri and hand rolls in a section. You can ask them for special hand rolls too.
       - Rolls - Their rolls are very colorful spread out as they are and seem like they have a lot of variety. However, most of the rolls are very similar. If you're looking for something different, AYCE places would be more suitable.
       - Hot Foods - They have a large assortment of hot dishes like tempura, noodles (udon and sukiyaki), chicken/beef teriyaki, that cheesy thing inside a shrimp shell, etc.
       - Desserts - The desserts are great. You have crepes, ice creams, tarts, creme brules, and their own chocolate fountain.
**Pros vs AYCE**
       - You can sample everything and aren't constricted to ordering half rolls.
       - It is very friendly for sushi newbies since they can see all the foods before they select them.
       - The hot foods are more in variety.
       - The desserts are better and have more choices.
**Cons vs AYCE**
       - The sushi level in both quality and innovation is lower to the better of the AYCE places.
**Price**

Thompson, we might have indulged in stronger pills all the different colors of the rainbow.  As it were, it was husband and wife in a dark green minivan on their way to Vegas for the weekend and we needed something to calm the road rage.  It took us 2.5 hours to get from Woodland Hills to the 15/215 junction.   For those of you that know the geography, that's fucking insane!   Anyway, it drove pretty well from that point on, but it still took us almost 6 hours to make the trek, so that blew our reservations at Boa Steakhouse that we'd made for 7:15.

My mother & stepfather, who'd been more intelligent than I (my wife had begged us to fly and I, stupidly, had said no) and had flown to Vegas from San Diego, suggested we try Pink Taco at the Hard Rock.  They'd eaten there before & loved it, so we took the car and headed out that way...

Let's just say it took a while to actually make it to Pink's, what with the incidental fact that the Killers were playing a show at the Hard Rock Cafe and, errr... it made it rather difficult to find parking anywhere around.

Cut to a table of 4 seated on the patio at Pink's.   Since this was our first time eating there, I ordered the Pink Taco and my wife got a massive huge burrito that... well, the name escapes me, but it tasted pretty good and had a good spicy kick to it.   The chips & salsas that they brought to our table were totally mackin', especially the verde salsa with roasted garlic, methinkst it was... Damn that was a really good salsa and we got a couple of rounds of that!

We didn't really drink excessively.... It's funny how psychologically you alter your behavior when you're around your parents, no matter how old you are.   So a glass of Chardonnay for me...   The large group of women clearly celebrating a Bachelorette Party next to us probably did 5 or 6 shots during the time we were seated (about an hour total).   Anyway, the food was good but this is the place you want to come at night and do some serious partying...   It's loud, it's all twentysomethings having a blast...and it's all good!   The food was good, but definitely not authentic, and a far stretch from what I've had in San Diego or even in LA.   Very good solid Mexican food, but not very genuine.

Minus one star for the big cockroach that was walking around the patio and made us slightly concerned about eating our dinners.   In Pink's defense, though, it was 106 at 9 PM so probably the cockroach was just looking for any kind of shelter or, slowly asphyxiating, was hoping some kind soul would step on it and end its suffering.

What I am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than Bobby Flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at Mesa Grill.  If you look at the guides, Mesa Grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  A burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  Fries are seasoned really well too.  

The barbecued lamb salad was delicious and not gamey.  They know how to make a pretty good Bloody Mary - but not as good as Old Ebbitt Grill in DC - Bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what I mean!

the food here is excellent.  some very nicely done southern cuisine with cajun & creole highlights, which is rare in mississauga.  to start, our party ordered the thyme fries and the cornbread.  both were delicious, but the fries could have been cooked a bit longer to give them that crisp crunch.

i ordered the blackened rainbow trout from a seasonal menu.  i usually expect a dominant black pepper flavour out of ""blackened"" items, but this one lacked that.  however, the fish was still cooked to a nice medium well, it was tasty by itself, and the spinach-mushroom fettucine it was served over was simple and complemented the trout well.

others from my party ordered the etouffee (seasonal), half bbq chicken with rice (also seasonal), and the notorious b.i.g. burger, all which were great.

aside from the southern food, it seems that door fiftyfive prides themselves on a large whiskey selection, and they do have quite an extensive list of that.  i tried the suntory toki as i've been dying to try japanese whiskeys, and was pleased with my dram.  the beer list here is decent, showcasing some good entry-level craft brews, so i wouldn't mind coming back for a beer.

We got the Aloha roll (which was a bit fishy tasting), the Hollywood roll which was my fav, teriyaki chicken and rice for the kiddo (which was excellent), a sushi and sashimi (raw slices of various fish and octopus) sampler platter, a la carte yellowtail belly meat sashimi (which is my all-time favorite cut of sushi) and it was a high quality and done right here (to give the melt-in-your mouth effect). We also had a roll that had predominately fried elements to it which was the bf's favorite. For dessert, they had cheesecake tempura that I had to try because it sounded interesting and I've never had that before. This was our least liked dish.

Tomo Japanese offers generous portions, enough for two but you will want to finish your entrée all yourself.  I highly recommend the Tuna Sashimi, Salmon, or Dragon Roll sushi all are absolutely delicious.

We come here primarily for Scott's yoga classes on Thurs nights since we have a closer location if we wanted to just work out. This location has a dedicated yoga room. Which means many times after class, if you want to stay and talk with the instructor, or stick around and play around for a few more minutes you can. There isn't another class waiting to come in. Well that is my experience at least from the times we go.

I've also found the instructors to mostly be very good, and several of the teachers teach at other locations as well as other yoga studios around town (which is a great deal to get some of these teachers if you are familiar with yoga studio monthly fees). Go to a few classes, find your favorite teacher and stalk, er, I mean follow them to their other classes.

The only thing that kind of bugs me is that you can hear the music from the pool or other parts of the gym, and sometimes you really need that peace and quiet.

Came in on a weekday, around 1 or 2pm. It was my first time, and I was a little weary, because it was dead! I almost left because the receptionist seemed like she was too busy on the phone to seat me. Fortunately, a lone employee was doing some cleaning in the corner, noticed me, and sat me down.    The place was spotless... it smelled like bleach (at least you knew it was clean). I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do--she kind of left me to my own vices, no menu, no explanation. Then she came back and asked whether I would like spicy or regular soup or both. She clarified the whole ordering process when she saw the confused look on my face (it didn't help that her English was poor). You choose the soup: regular, spicy, or both--meaning they split the pot down the middle so you can have best of both worlds, then you get up and physically handpick your meats/seafood, veggies, and sauces on to a plate and bring it back to your table to cook up in your boiling hot pot.  I was pretty impressed by the variety they had.  They had shrimp, clams, mussels, squid, pork belly, pork, beef, and huge selection of veggies to add to your concoction!  It was all kept in a market style fridge/freezer (the kind that you can see through and open). Everything smelled and looked pretty fresh! The selection of sauces and condiments allowed you to flavor your soup to your liking. I really enjoyed the built-in gas stoves at each table, including the bar. I haven't seen a shabu place in Vegas that's set up like this. In addition to the hot pots, you can order food from the kitchen (this is considered the dinner all you can eat, which is $19).

We stay at City Center often so we will definitely have to try and have a sit-down meal at Five50 next time. Located inside Aria Hotel right before the sports book. Very busy area of the casino so you may think all they sell is pizza. But they have a full menu of Italian fare.",2018-02-02 18:49:52

I did read that this place is under new ownership so it concerned me and it appears that way.  This is the pros and cons of this place. We ordered the special of the day which are Tom Yum Chicken with vegetables soup and their version of Pork Steak with their special sauce. I ordered their dinner portion of their Mussaman Curry.

Pros:
The portion size is quite large if you like quantity versus quality.
The tom yum soup is also pretty great and very flavorful.

Cons:
The mussaman curry is bland and only tasted of coconut milk with minimal spice. The vegetables and potatoes were not cooked and still firm.  There was really nothing special with the pork steak. It was just a pan-fried pork chop with their special fish sauce.

Also, if you plan to pay with credit card, you will pay their ""non-cash fee."" They do offer 5% discount if you pay cash.

Overall,  I prefer quality than quantity.  Would I recommend coming back? Most likely not. I would only come back if it was a rainy day with cash in my wallet to buy their soup or if I was sick and too lazy to cook soup.  I would not go out of my way to order their food.",2018-03-25 01:23:22

The first visit I ordered and shared one of the pizzas (forgot which one but it had porschiutto) and the bolognese with lemon ricotta. The pizza was ok, but nothing to write home about. It is a hefty portion though so definitely can be shared with a friend for a light lunch. The bolognese though was the highlight in my mind. I thought the lemon ricotta complemented the bolognese really well and offset the heavy/greasy feeling one often gets from eating a bolognese. 

Since I enjoyed my lunch, I returned for dinner and ordered a stuffed meatball and spaghetti and ate off some of my friend's fresh mozarella which I am told is made in house. The mozarella was fantastic in my limited cheese knowledge, because I can actually taste the strong flavour of the milk that the cheese was made from. That plus toast and the tomato jelly was a great combo. 

The stuffed meatball and spaghetti was ok. The meatball on it's own was great, but I think their bolognese just set a really high standard for me in terms of the pasta. It was probably the ricotta that made the difference for me. My friend also got a chicken parm. It was pretty ordinary, I recommend sticking to their specialties (ie. pasta + pizza) instead.

Of course we had to get it to go as its easier that way so I wrote down what I wanted and off my husband went to pick it up.  It was a Saturday night and there was no line! They just took my post it note and made up my pizza (half Alfredo, half pesto with roasted chicken, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella and artichokes!) 

My pizza was delicious although next time I might try to do Alfredo and pesto together and I want spinach on my pizza! I think it's a super cool concept and the fact that they don't charge you per topping rocks too! I do wish their crust was a lil thicker since I felt like my pizza toppings slid right off but it was still tasty.  My husband told me the pizza cooks really quickly which is good to know when they have a food rush. Definitely a huge bonus that they give LVAC members a discount!

We loved the Cheese Curds. They were crunchy, cheese oozed delicious. We ended up with two orders of that. The Jamaican Jerky Chicken was delicious, the portion was huge! Half a chicken grilled with special sauce and yellow rice with fried sweet plantains. The plantains were thick cut and fried to perfection. We Cubans loved it. The Seafood Paellas were not that great. The consistency wasn't really true Paella but the flavor was there. The seafood wasn't as fresh, mussels slightly overcooked, though fish was flaky and cooked well. Paellas weren't impressive, average, but portion was also very big! Each can easily feed two people. My sister-in-law's burger was good (you can't go wrong with burger they should all taste how they should taste). My BBQ ribs were ok, again, they tasted just like how should taste. Sweet and smokey. There wasn't any special twist or spin added onto it.

I actually come by here more than other sushi places simply for the firecracker roll - I have yet to find one that beats it in Charlotte. At Ru Sans, it's huge and the ahi tuna middle is always cooked perfectly... nice and rare as it should be. 

It may sound like a crazy detail but one of the best things about Ru Sans is how tight they wrap their rolls. I've never had ingredients come dropping out, leaving me fumbling in my soy sauce to fish out and pieces and trying to rewrap it myself. 

Oh and two words for you: lunch buffet. Take an afternoon and do yourself a favor. The buffet is extensive with one 12 foot table decked out in all sushi. Head toward the back and you find another 12 foot table with soup, salad, duck wings, desserts and anything else they decide to put out. Only downside is the sushi isn't labeled so if you love a roll, good luck finding out what it is. But silver lining to that, the chefs tend to make whatever they want for the buffet, and are constantly making sushi all throughout lunch, so on each trip, you have something new and fresh waiting for you.

Sushi isn't the only thing that's good here, though.  When coming to dinner, you'll get either a Japanese menu or a Malaysian menu.  It's always difficult to decide which menu to order from.

I had planned to take him last year for his birthday, but when I called and tried to reserve a reservation, they told me they only took them for bigger parties, which is fine. However, when we went on Saturday-many parties of two had come in with a reservation and made their way to their table upstairs. Maybe I misunderstood-but I thought it odd that I had been trying to get into this place for a year and was surprised when we sat near the door on Saturday and I saw party after party come in with a reservation and be taken upstairs. When I had tried to get in without a reservation again later in the year, the hostess dismissed me again. Whatever, I just planned to get there exactly when the doors opened at 5:00 for the next attempt, so I couldn't possibly be dismissed. So that's what we did.
Saturday, we planned to get there exactly at 5:00, which we almost did, got in around 5:15. When we came in, the hostess was filled with attitude, and it only got worse as the night went on, I only know because we sat directly next to the door where people were coming in. We told her we didn't have a reservation and immediately her demeanor changed towards us, like how dare we? Considering the last year I had been told that I wasn't allowed to make a reservation for just two people, I thought that her attitude was unnecessary, because obviously, if I would have known, I would have made one. There was one table for two left near the door, and we were told that was ok to sit at, so we did. The rest of the restaurant was jam-packed though. Only that one table was available when we arrived, meaning in 15 minutes, the place had been filled.

Other than the rude hostess turning away everyone that came without a reservation (the nerve of those people) our dinner was very flavorful. The guacamole (of course) was amazing. We got the sampler (3 different flavors) and I just enjoyed tasting the different kinds. Then we shared some taquitos, and I can't remember the name now, but I believe we ordered the carnitas, full of flavor! 

Overall, good place to grab when your out in the city, but unfortunately, you would have to plan your dinner if you want to go here. Make a reservation-because apparently you can do that for all size parties...which is the opposite of what I was told....

Anyway-they really need to work on switching out their hostess, because she made the whole evening uncomfortable, honestly, and she needs to work on her people skills.

I will say that it was relatively easy to cancel my membership. They asked my reasoning, I signed some papers, and only had to pay my last month charge (I was a month-to-month early sign on member). I never got hassled and didn't get any crazy additional charges. No big deal.",2016-09-08 17:12:47

One, they have excellent poutine, which for those who are unfamiliar is a Canadian dish from Quebec composed of french fries and cheese curds topped with gravy. Yes, it sounds gross at first but it is surprisingly good. Along with the traditional style, US Fries also has other styles of poutine including shepherd's pie and vegetarian. Two, they sell Eegee's! Again, for those not familiar, Eegee's is a type of icy fruit slushies from Tucson. Sure it's a weird combination: Quebec food, Tucson drinks, all served on Mill Avenue in Tempe, but hey, it works.

Well, I got that look tonight. I met my sister on the patio around 5:30. The patio is small but nice if it's not too busy. Stephanie was our waitress and she was very sweet, she had a great personality and I would definitely give her more like four out five stars but the food not so much. They do have a good happy hour on Monday and Tuesday nights from 2pm to 8pm so I will give them that. The app selection on the happy hour menu is quite slim however. We did decided to get the pretzels with cheese, the cheese is $2 extra which I honestly think is kind of ridiculous because pretzels and cheese should be a given. They were not bad, not great but honestly I could get a pretzel that is a million times better and much bigger a few feet down the way at a particular brewing co...

On to the entrees. My sister had asked before I had arrived what the waitress suggested off of the menu. She suggested the fish and chips hands down. I should have also heeded this advice but I was kind of craving a burger so I decided to take a chance and order one. I should have known right away that it would not be what I wanted when Stephanie told me that they did not have american cheese. I am an american cheese burger type of girl, cheddar just doesn't cut it for me. The look on our waitress's face when I ordered the burger was one of disdain. I know that she did not purposely mean to make the face but she did. I honestly wish she would have told me not to order it. It was not good, it was very bad in fact. Dry, tasteless, overcooked meat with a semi hard bun. I should have sent it back but I instead decided to suffer through half of it which is retrospect and a stomach ache later, was a bad idea. I did eat most of the sweet potato fries that came with the burger with the $2 cheese sauce that was left over from the pretzel. It didn't make up for the disappointing burger. My sister did enjoy her fish and chips and the tarter sauce did look good as well.

Overall I have come to the conclusion that this is a restaurant/pub that is very hit or miss when it comes to food. If you want to come here to drink and have an appetizer or two you might enjoy your visit more. If you come here to eat dinner, by all means do not get a burger and I would also suggest to avoid the sliders. Honestly, you can find a much better meal a few steps down the sidewalk. Most likely will not return. Stephanie, you did your best with the hand you were given.",2014-04-22 07:30:35

We were having a tough time finding someone to come on Saturday, but Monte at ABPC said he could make it out. He showed up promptly (with one of his kids and a friend in tow, which is always fine by me), and was able to get the root of our problems. While coming out on a Saturday isn't cheap, he did finish the job quickly, and even take time out (not charged to us) to show us how to fix a specific problem ourselves if it was ever to occur. I've never really had anyone take the time to do that with any type of home service. 
The wife and I were very pleased at his promptness, his fast yet high quality work, and his ability to come out for an urgent problem without charging us an arm and a leg. I can say I was thrilled he showed us how to fix a specific problem, because the day before we were supposed to leave for a vacation, we had another leak (not related to the one that ABPC fixed) and we were able to fix it no problem thanks to Monte. 
When the need arises, we will definitely be using ABPC again.",2010-05-19 06:19:04

1. If you don't have a Total Rewards card before you arrive, stop at the desk and get one. Then when the check-in line is a mile long you can check in at a kiosk and skip the wait. Or if you're a player and you score Diamond status you can go off in a fancy check-in lounge. I'm a low roller, so the kiosk is usually how I roll.
2. The later in the day you check in, the less likely you are to get the room you wanted. If your flight gets in late at night, just plan on rolling with it. If you're staying a few days you can always move rooms the next day. 
3. The location on the Strip is ideal. You're across from Caesar's, next to the Quad, next to Bally's, across from Bellagio. If you need to get to the convention center, the monorail is out back and an easy walk. The construction at the Linq is pretty much wrapped up, and the remodeling job at the former Bill's will be done in May/June.
4. The Fab rooms are all recently redone except for the bathrooms. It's just the way it is. The Go rooms are fun, especially the funky spa shower. Some of those Go rooms are showing some wear. But overall the hotel is a good deal.
5. The Linq next door is a lot of fun. Nothing in the Linq is cheap. If the way the lobby looks on the way to the Linq is any sign of what the future of this hotel is, a really nice remodeling job may be on the way.
6. While I adore the waitress who has waited on me in the Tropical Breeze for years at breakfast, if I'm going to have to pay $18 for breakfast, I'll walk next door to the Quad and eat at Hash House. Plus Hash House is now open 24/7 and the Flamingo's coffee shop is now primarily breakfast and lunch. It's hard to find a cheap meal anywhere on the strip anymore.
7. The Margaritaville casino is fun and now has more table games than before. The 5 o'clock Somewhere bar in that casino is probably the most fun bar in the hotel outside of Margaritaville itself.
8. Carlos & Charlies is annoying. Maybe I'm just too old to understand.
9. The Go Pool is probably the best pool in Vegas outside of Mandalay.
10. Service is friendly in this hotel. If you're nice to the staff, they will return that kindness and reward you for it. If you're drunk and obnoxious, they will tolerate you. Don't be that guy.",2014-04-22 21:53:35

Two of us came here to share various items.  The restaurant had few customers at 5 PM on Friday night.

We ordered:

Factory hummus order and pita (free with Yelp check in)
Falafel appetizer with fresh vegetables and tahini sauce
Meat combination with one beef kabob, one kafta, one sujuk and one kibbi with baba ghanoush (susbstiution of zucchini fries for rice for an upcharge)
Gyro sandwich (substitute eggplant fries instead of rice for an upcharge)
Baklava
Rice pudding
Shabiet

I ordered an iced tea also and was brought refills several times without needing to ask.  I also asked if I could sample their ghost pepper sauce that you can get with hummus.  Our server, Nikki, brought a small cup of the sauce and warned me to only dip the pita in a little bit of the sauce.  That's what I did and immediately started hiccuping from the reaction to the heat of the ghost pepper.  I won't be eating that--it is very hot as I guessed it would be.

First off before trying the ghost pepper sauce, we were brought an order of hummus and very hot, house made pita bread.  Both were excellent.  The pita was so light and fluffy in texture.  It was with a small piece of the pita that I tries the ghost pepper sauce.  We also had a small round of butter that was flavorful with the pita.

Next up came the falafel appetizer.  Good falafels with good tasting tahini and a selection of fresh vegetables to go with the falafel.  Next came our two main courses.  One was a gyro sandwich with zucchini fries and one was the meat combination with eggplant fries and an order of baba ghanoush.  Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.  Good gyro.  The meat combination was very good.  Standout on this dish was the sujuk--spicy sausage.  The spice was perfect for this meat.

We ended our meal with 3 desserts, baklava, rice pudding, and shabiet.  The baklava is much different than I've had before.  There is honey but it's not dripping or swimming in honey.  In addition, it's small in width and shaped like a piece of Kit Kat.  Very tasty and a different way of making it.  The rice pudding was quite creamy and very good and last, the shabiet with its ashta cream was very good.  The shabiet is shaped like a turnover and has this wonderful cream inside.

Part of my five stars also is for the service.  Our factory worker, Nikki, was really a pleasant woman who was quite interesting to speak with and she was always there to refill iced tea or my companion's water glass.

I have to say all staff I have ever encountered here from the valet guys, to the bartenders, servers etc have always been outstanding.  The rooms are nice and modern and they serve their customers needs around the clock.  It is within walking distance to Old Town nightlife and shopping at the boutiques, galleries and Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.  

I am a big fan of Sushi Roku, the restaurant attached to the W. I have always had great service, food and cocktails there.  With this prime location you are also within a rock throw of many other fine dining establishments, cute local cafes and bars.  

The pool parties in the summer are rocking with DJs spinning tunes, and Scottsdale's finest (or as some call them Snotsdale's finest) prancing around 95% naked, and possibly 10% filled with plastic.  At night this same pool area transforms itself into an energized nightlife spot.  

My last visit to the W I stopped in on a random Sunday evening to grab a cocktail with a friend and I was impressed.

(""Golden Greek"" is the corporate name, but the big sign out front reads ""Golden Diner"")

Had breakfast here on Monday with 3 friends.  The fresh coat of paint brightens this place up...'specially if you like lime green.

The breakfast special at 6.95 included 3 eggs, choice of meat, home fries, toast and JUICE.  (5.95 without meat.)  This is one of the few breakfast specials in TO that includes juice.  (The OJ was the cheap stuff...if you order a small or large glass outside of the special, it's a higher quality.)

I love the food. The Straw sandwich is one of my faves. It's pastrami or corned beef with cole slaw and kraut on a bread of your choosing. 

Everyday they have a daily special. Tuesdays are a good day as the specials are turkey with all the trimmings or meatloaf. The meatloaf is very tasty. The last time I ordered it I thought the mashed potatoes that came with it were a bit too whippped up. I like my potatoes slightly lumpy.

This place is usually packed around lunch time, so beware as the lines can be long, but usually go fast.

 I have been here for breakfast and dinner and those are the less busy times. It can almost be a ghost town around those times.

I tried the barbacoa, chicken Hermanos, and the pulled pork. All are essentially braised or stewed meats with a bit of fresh toppings (pico de gallo on the beef, a slight bit of mango on the chicken and a cabbage slaw on the pork). 

None of the tacos I tried were particularly spicy. The chicken had a mild hit of heat. The beef and pork had no heat whatsoever. I would say that I liked the chicken best for that reason. They did offer me a bottle of some hot sauce, but while the hot sauce had a nice amount of heat, it was way too smokey and overwhelmed the flavours of the tacos so I didn't really use it. 

The meats were, paradoxically, dry and yet too wet at the same time. I'm assuming they're braising too fast at too high a heat to achieve that disappointing result. A long slow braise at low heat would result in juicier meat. The interior of the meat, when you bit into it, was dry, but it was surrounded by way too much of the braising liquid. This led to really wet tacos which is definitely no bueno. Also, the meats (aside from the chicken) were just not seasoned enough. 

I make tacos or burritos at home from leftover braised meats and I season that meat up. I'm sorry but if I can do better at home, I think you are failing a bit at your overall purpose. I want restaurants to give me better food than I can make at home. I probably won't be rushing back here, but I would recommend it for people who like really wet and mildly seasoned tacos.",2016-06-13 14:43:56

You enter the building and wait in a line to get a number so you can sit and wait for your number to appear on a screen. Once served, you will likely have to wait again, depending upon what you are trying to accomplish. You know this is going to happen. This system hasn't changed in years. What is hard to understand is the gruff, ""where else are you going to go?"" attitude of so many of the employees. I'm sure the job is a grind, with the same stupid questions asked day after day, but a few of the workers do find a way to be civil. Even friendly. It's possible. Not the first nor second nor the fourth person that helped me were the least bit courteous. The third person was amazingly helpful and efficient, but I even had to wait for her to return from an apparent break before finally being helped.

Now I've come to learn the hard way that Glowing Reviews often at times can be deceptive. Graft, on the other hand, did justice to its own!!

The decor of this place throws across a trendy industrial vibe which I find a lot more inviting than a vintage or classic one per se. So well done on that front!

Service is an interesting conundrum coz if it were a ""normal"" restaurant I'd be totally fine with it. For a fine dining one, it didn't hit the mark. Inattentive and rather confusing is how I would describe our experience. Every round was served by a different person and we had to actually ask to remove plates and subsequent orders. No checking in on us or any other formal service etiquette were shown. Again not to nit pick but I expect such nuances from a Fine Dining place.

The food, however, turned it all around for us! Scintillating is how I'll describe the tapas style dishes and their play on flavors and ingredients. We kicked things off with Fried Chevre and Graft Mac n Cheese. The goat cheese with its pairing of a pepper honey glaze was a star! With an almost non existent fried coating, it simply melted in your mouth so much more elegantly than say a mozzarella. The saltiness of the goat-cheese with the sweet spiciness from the glaze was a sensual dance in the taste-buds! The Mac n Cheese was a more up-scaled version one and I love the thicker consistency of Gouda holding the spatzle together. Not the best of dishes but really good interpretation of Mac n Cheese!

Moving ahead, we tried their tuna salad, the pork belly, chicken liver mousee and finally the Quail. The tuna salad was fresh, light and reminded of a form of poke. Apple shavings were a surprising pairing which actually made it better. The Pork Belly was exquisite! Melt in your mouth goodness. What really took me by surprise was that accompaniment of Asparagus with pickled mustard seeds & szechuan peppercorns. The little bubbles burst in your mouth and give a whole new dimension to the otherwise nice but bland asparagus. The Chicken Liver Mousse with its onion marmalade and crostini's was a refreshing departure from the other ""hot"" entrees. The mousse itself was seasoned very well and the sweetness from the marmalade balanced the saltiness perfectly. The Quail was my first. The bird itself is very small but the meat was a lot more defined than say a chicken. Cooked al dante, it brought out its strong flavors. The accompaniment of farro with fig n bacon was so so good that I couldn't keep my hands of it!!

I usually schedule with Kendra because she is super nice and really fast -- and of course does a great job. Plus, she gives me these report cards that tells me just how wonderful and cute my dog is which I absolutely love -- I actually save them because I'm just that sentimental about my child, err dog, Toby. 

I usually do the ""teddy bear cut"" and most of the time my dog looks super cute although sometimes he doesn't look as cute -- but hey, I think perfection is a little tough given the hours and exhaustion these groomers face. My dog has never looked bad or been given the wrong cut as others have mentioned. They will also make any corrections you want and they ask you if your dog looks the way you want it -- great customer service. 

I do have one concern though -- the last few times my dog has been scared to go here, like holding onto to me tight scared. I don't know why and I don't know if something happened to him, he might just be nervous around other dogs -- he did get into a small scuffle around the same time at our residence. So IN NO WAY am I pointing the finger at this Petsmart and in all honesty I'd be really surprised if it was linked to them. This place is clean and all the groomers seem super nice and the dogs seem to be in good spirits.

The food was okay, I got the chicken wings with strawberry chipotle sauce, about $7.50 for 6 wings. They were fine, nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got the grilled salmon salad for $14, again, fine. I feel like this summarizes my hand-full of experiences here. Nothing on the menu is that cool or daring, and the prices are rather high for traditional bar food.

My glass was empty often & my server may have struggled to keep it filled. Overall: relaxing afternoon, delicious meal, good beer, good service. I recommend going when it's not too busy.

I had high hopes for this stadium, but it disappointed me.  The main reason is that parking is not only awful, it's confusing, dangerous and expensive....why?  Because there is no parking near the stadium.  You have to drive all over Old Town Scottsdale to try and find parking.  All of the parking close to the Stadium is reserved for special ticket holders and parking passes.  A cop told me to drive around and find a spot that there was plenty of ""free"" parking.  The problem with that is that many of the parking spots in Old Town have a 3 hr limit on them.....if you get to the stadium 1 hr early to eat, get pics, shop, and get autographs/meet players, that only leaves 2 hrs for the game....has anyone watched baseball in the last 100 yrs?!  There's no such thing as a 2 hour baseball game!  So, you'll get a ticket?  So what are the alternatives?  

Well, you can park in one of a couple of parking garages nearby, but they're not really nearby, they're kind of far from the stadium and already packed with cars from people who work in the area, so to find a spot is damn near impossible....plus to get to the stadium, you can either walk the long distance or tip one of dozens of golf carts that are working the parking lots to transport people to/from the stadium, a $5 tip each way and you're out $10....why don't they just build a Freakin' parking garage next to the stadium and charge $10 to park there?!  It's more convenient and less of a hassle.  

Another alternative is to park in a nearby business parking lot that sells spots for $5 to $10....again, another argument to build a parking garage next to the stadium and charge.

Sorry for the long rant on parking, but it's really that bad.

Once I got inside, it was a pretty cool experience, just like most Spring Training ballparks.  To eat, I had:

Cheese Pizza Slice, $6.50
Small Drink, $4.50

Our seats were awesome.  One day it rained cats & dogs.  Another day, it was perfect.

Overall, great baseball experience.....awful arrival/departure experience.  I'm glad I got to check this stadium off my bucket list.

I had the swampwater which was pretty good and only $7 for the frozen drinks and you can keep the cup. I got a nice buzz going from just one of these drinks. My friend had the 190 and boy that was a STRONG drink! One and done!

The layout of the restaurant is so weird. They have some big screen TVs along the wall, but the cubicle shaped booths in the center of the restaurant have very high wall, so basically you can't even enjoy the TVs if you happen to sit in one of those cubicles.

Bread was over heated, lettuce or slaw whatever it was was not fresh, and the crab was ridiculously horrible. Overlooked and pathetically small size.

The service was wonderful and I can't imagine it being any better. I was impressed that there was no smokey scent, despite the restaurant's location inside a casino.
Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Tamale - Shrimp was cooked to perfection. The spices were full of flavor in the creamy sauce. The sauce was rich, but I know that this was an appetizer meant to be shared. I ate it as an entree.
New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - The pork was very tender and had a flavorful crust on the outside. I enjoyed the chewy bread and the crunch of the onions. Very well done!
Mesa Burger- The sauce on the side was very unique and tasty. I thought the fries on the side were delicious and well seasoned, but not too salty. They had a nice crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. However, it was quite pricey for a burger. We have had better burgers for less.

We shared  the G's House Salad ( $6 )
With mixed greens, goat cheese, apple caramelized onions, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette. This salad is super savory and this is when I fell inlove with goat cheese.

Then we made our entree orders. I got the 'Just for the Halibut'  ($29) with lump crab on top and amazing sauce this entree was terrific. The fish was tender and flaky, and I wish I could bottle the sauce and take it home to use on my own cooking.
My boyfriend had the Ribeye ($29) which was cooked perfectly, I had to reach across the plate and grab some.

Finally - even though we were stuffed- we ordered carrot cake to go so we could enjoy it later. I also would suggest Mom's Apple Cake, which I had previous to this visit.

This is a no-frills kennel.  No sofas or cameras or private dog parties, but the dog runs are clean, they have indoor/outdoor space for each run, and the employees are very caring.  They offer outdoor ""playtime"" for an add-on fee, and it is really PLAY time.  The staff will take your doggo out and play fetch, run around, or whatever it is your doggo likes to do.  We typically do this as a once per day add on, and it's worth the extra couple bucks.  They also offer end-of-stay baths, so your furry friend doesn't come home smelling like a zoo.  

All in all, I have no complaints.  They are so kind here, and the location is pretty convenient if you're going to the airport or leaving town on I-15 South (maybe not so much if you're going north, but hey - you can't be convenient to everywhere).

Here's the deal - I used to be vegan YEARS ago so I am perhaps more open to places that specialize in vegetarian/vegan.  However, I don't SEEK out vege places anymore because now I am back to eating everything (see my review on the Pork Dip from St. Francis if you're skeptical).

I decided to check this place out because they have a modern vibe to it and all they do is coffee and desserts. I've passed it every Saturday for the past year and have always been drawn in by their clever signage. I had NO idea they were an ""alternative"" cafe until I walked in and checked the menu. 

This place has incredible baked goods and they do a great job with the coffee. That's pretty much all I need to be happy :) For starters, it's hard to find a good espresso spot in Phoenix. Secondly, I remember that with the vegan-restricted diet my general rule of thumb was if I was eating out and the food tasted good - it was probably not vegan. This place has just perfected sweet treats that are gluten and dairy free which just makes me even more impressed with it.

The hostess was pretty friendly and our service was on key :) The menu is pretty astounding for it had such a variety of seafood which I thought was amazing! I think I almost drove myself a little crazy trying to decide what to eat lol 

Now lets get to the food....They serve bread and butter before entrees and appetizers which was warm and a great start. We ordered sushi which we all shared and the Spider Roll was my absolute favorite!!!! My dad ordered angel hair pasta which had shrimp in it. My mom and I split the linguine with clams and it is a good thing we did otherwise we would be too full! The quality of the food was pretty good and I have to admit they don't dip on clams or shrimps in entrees they give you just the right amount. The portions of the food were sized just right as well in my opinion. I really enjoyed everything we ordered tonight!

At first, this place seemed like a good idea.  New dentist, new practice, a $40 all inclusive special when I had no insurance, etc.  The receptionist, Samantha, seemed very nice, so, she gets 2 stars, but the service here, SUCKS.

I'll explain.  I just moved to Las Vegas from NY 2 months ago and was looking for a dentist.  This one is right near my house and it got good reviews on here, so I decided to give them a try.  

The first question the Dr. asked me when he looked in my mouth is if I ever considered braces.  I told him no.  My teeth are relatively straight.  In fact, Rosie, the hygienist, had WAY worse looking teeth than I did.  She was nice also though.

So my story is that I have 4 relatively large, amalgam fillings on my left side.  2 up, 2 down, both in molars.  Dr. Tran's recommendation was $2400 worth of replacement fillings for all of my teeth.  This seemed bizarre as I know that amalgam fillings are typically used to bigger cavities and tend to hold up better than their ""tooth colored"" counterparts.  

I did, however, feel as though I got a good cleaning and it was done by the dentist, which you don't see very often anymore.  

Anyway, today I called my dentist back in NY who told me that replacing all my fillings was unnecessary and seeing as how I was just there less than 6 months ago, there is no way my teeth could have gotten THAT bad.  

I went to a new dentist today and he was right on with my old dentist in stating that there were nothing wrong with my fillings, and, in fact, if he were to remove them and put in porcelain or resin-composite, my teeth would be MORE sensitive than they are and I would probably end up with nerve damage seeing as how my cavities were all pretty deep.

So, save your time and money and go see Dr. Ruper @ Boston Dental on W. Lake Mead near Jack in the Box.  You'll be happy!",2009-03-13 01:15:23

We had both been craving Thai food, and because we were without a computer, we had to choose a place the old fashioned way, that is, we looked to see which restaurant had the most cars outside of it. Its hard to tell in China Town because it is just strip mall after strip mall, but there seemed to be many cars in front of Krung Siam and people going inside. 
When we got in, we were pleasantly surprised. The decor was very modern, and I felt like we were in an upscale Asian restaurant in Chicago or New York. Additionally, from the looks of the lights and the sound set up on the inside, this place gets hopping after dark. 

We were greeted by a very young looking hostess, and actually all the staff we saw were quite young, which was just not what we are used to in this part of town. On to the food! I got the Pad See Uw with Tofu and the wife got pineapple fried rice. We also both got Thai Iced Tea. The tea was not as sweet as I've had other places, which was very nice. The spices were more prominent, and the flavor was bold, but not overpowering. My dish was amazing. I think its probably the best tofu I've had in a while. It w as fried, but not over fried and the black soy sauce filled the pores of the tofu. It was nice and firm, but not too crunchy. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. I could have eaten them by themselves. The veggies were also cooked well, not too stiff and not soggy. The wife's lunch was also very good. All the veggies and fruit was very fresh, and including raw cashews and unsweetened raisins really completed the meal. It was flavorful but not too sweet and not too salty. 

The price was very reasonable. Less than at our other Thai haunts. We paid about $22 for the 2 entrees and 2 Thai teas. Not bad at all.

After dining at Krung twice, the food does not disappoint, but I am not sure it will become one of our repeat eats. We have sampled tom kha gai and tom yum soups, red curry and the dish simply called ""Broccoli."" A bowl of soup is quite generous, and both soups had a rich, pleasing flavor. However, they also come served with lots of the herbs and roots that contribute to this flavor, which is mildly frustrating if you're not one to chew down on lemongrass and galanga. I admit this may be a white girl thing, but I end up putting all those things on the side because they seem too tough to chew. Am I wrong?

(I decided to Google and thanks to Kasma Loha-unchit and her article here http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/lemongrass.html learned: ""In soups, lemongrass serves as a stock ingredient to flavor the broth; the tough pieces are not meant to be chewed and eaten. Thai people usually do not strain them out before serving; they know what can be eaten and what cannot, and some like to suck on the lemongrass pieces for a delightful hit of flavor."")

So, it is more authentic way to serve the soups, and I am just being a baby. 

The curry was good. The ""Broccoli"" had a great wok flavor, but the sauce was a little light, and their steamed tofu isn't my favorite.

So, why won't we repeat eat? It was most likely a late night destination for us given its hours, and the fact that during the day we have some fave go-to spots. And, late night they have live entertainment which created a less than ideal dining environment. It is simply one gentleman with a guitar and a semi-karaoke set up, but it is a little loud and prone to drunk hijinx. If you are also drunk, wildly entertaining, but if you are just hungry, a boozy lady sitting on stage doing her best to belt out Bob Dylan and other songs that the guitar man simply just doesn't know for close to 20 minutes is simply frustrating. I don't even know if it was supposed to be karaoke, or if she just decided she had the right to sing. I can appreciate a well done, Thai karaoke throw down, but that is not what was happening here. I suppose the restaurant isn't completely to blame for their patron's less than ideal manners, but I kept hoping someone would kindly escort her back to her table with the lure of some free delicious item.

If we walk up to the door and see the man on the stage, we will probably decide it's not the meal for us given the opportunity for microphone takeovers. However, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the food, and our service was acceptable. Definitely worth it at a late hour when you're running out of options, and, hey, perhaps the danger of late night karaoke is your thang! Maybe we will return for lunch.",2011-12-04 03:52:13

You're looking at a higher price-point for ayce sushi tho. About $30 pp after tax and tips on weekends. But trust me, it's worth every penny. 

The service is quick. Everything comes out fresh and hot, and they don't purposely slow down the food because they're afraid you won't finish.

They have a wide selection for sashimi and during the summer, they would occassionally serve sweet shrimp, which is typically rare for any ayce sushi places since a la carte usually charges $5 for 3 slices. When I went last weekend, they served scallop sashimi which is never heard of in ayce sushi places. During the weekdays, they also serve their pan-seared salmon sashimi.

Their mango rolls and yoghurt is a stolen recipe from ten-ichi it's just as good, if not, better. I can't give them any credit for innovation but MANGOOO ON EVERYThiNG...shall i say more?

Another menu item that WILL blow you away is their garlic stir-fried sirloin steak... Make sure you double or triple order because you WILL want more after!

Make sure you arrive early and if you're coming with a party, RSVP! It does get hectic over the weekend, but no matter how crazy they get, you never have to wait too long for food or wave a server down.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4w

The Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.

The 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.

I was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.

Overall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.

nxadipaiD8J7qn0LH1n64A,5hCdcQXSXGuOCSrKuOQhkw,PjlodjmfABi5dW-iek2P-w,4,9,2,2,"First, I'm going to preface this review by stating that regular CT users already KNOW what sucks about Calgary transit (cold weather train breakdowns, the grating ""please stand clear of the door,"" message, bus drivers smirking as they make eye contact and drive by your stop, etc) , so I'm not going to beat a dead horse.  

Instead, I'm going to keep this within the context of WHY I'm currently a CT user;  why that has changed in the past, and why it (likely) will change in the future.  

First, as a point of note, I ONLY use Calgary Transit to commute to my workplace downtown.  And I only ride the train.  

If I needed to use a feeder bus  system, with the multi-legs and transfers, that would be a deal breaker for me.  It's too much of an inconvenience, when the alternative is simply driving downtown uninterrupted, in a warm car with tunes, and parking right beside my office.

Trust me, I'm not alone in thinking this way.   There is a very real tipping point where riding CT just isn't worth it.

That being said, if you give me the opportunity to drive to a point where I can easily park and board a C-train, with minimal hassle or resistance, I will make the most of that opportunity. I will take the train.

Unfortunately, this is where things have gone sideways for CT through the years.  

Here's a little history:

LRT parking used to be free across the board.  And the overflow cars, such as around Shawnessy/Bridlewood, parked all over the commercial side streets.  

Really, no one cared if there were cars lining the access road around Canadian Tire.  It's not residential (BTW, all those overflow cars, which often included myself, equated to mostly PAID  transit riders).

Then along came $3 a day parking.   Simultaneously, the city re-zoned all the side streets with 3 hour limits... forcing the combined overflow + lot traffic to compete only for the small LRT lot.  

Clearly this was a move to force everyone to pay their 3 bucks.  But duh!  There wasn't room in the lot for everyone!

This was a commuter nightmare for a few reasons.  Mostly, you never knew if you'd get a spot in the ""official"" lot or not.  There was never enough stalls.
 
And two... even driving into the station from a main thoroughfare like Macleod to LOOK for a spot  wasted a good 15 minutes, factoring in the lineups at the traffic lights if you were unsuccessful.  
 
Three:  lining up to pay for parking at the machines daily?  If you were so lucky to grab a spot (early risers only), then this sucked hard in the winter.  

All this meant, in the $3-a-day-jammed-lot-world, I--and countless others--were resigned to drive downtown.   Which meant paying for gas, vehicle wear and tear, traffic jams, $20 a day DT parking, and polluting the hell out of the environment.  

But now?   

Reserved parking, baby.   

*** THIS HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING!  ***

It made me consider CT a viable option again!  

Yes, I opted for the $70 a month stall that some people bitch about.  

I reserve a spot, and I can say it has alleviated 90% of my transit frustrations.   AND saved me a shitload of money.   SAVED. ME. MONEY.  

Now I can actually plan my schedule ahead of time, and see things unfold according to plan.  I pull up to the station, and my spot is always there.  I hop the train, and I'm downtown in half an hour.  Start to finish, this process is more often than not pain free. 

Within the context of how I use transit, with a reserved spot, I can now give CT 4 stars.   (I deduct one star for the new train configuration... the standing room only cattle cars, which suck).

Nonetheless, I don't have high hopes for reserved parking being around forever.  Someone will kill it, because they don't understand the relevance of my scenario described above.

And on that day, it's back to one star for CT, and I rip them in the re-written review.  Me? I resume clogging the streets on my commute downtown.  I will feel bad about it, but hey... if I don't have a place to park, then I have no option.

we had tried phoenix palace dim sum when it 1st opened (everything for $2.25, even the normally $3 and up stuff?)  how bad can it be?

we left the place saying, ""what was that we just ate""

not bad, just not memorable

back to our happy place (china king)

then through the chinese-restaurant gossip vine, we hear that it's under new management and it's the place to be.

we reluctantly meet our family there with low expectations ready to go home afterwards to eat something else to take up the slack

much to our surprise, this place has changed.

the prices are comparable, the place is 95% full, and we were wondering where the standing room only crowd that we use to try and beat at 10:30 at china king were ending up at.

they're here.

with us.

from now on.

dare i try the place on the southwest corner of dobson and warner

no way jose

wild horses couldn't drag me there

the new happy place

you should try it

it will be your new happy place

it's late, i'll stop now",2010-08-28 07:15:50

They have a neat bar offering coffee/sandwiches/wine/beer all to be enjoyed outside in the lounge area featuring really lovely leather couches and rustic wooden tables. If you are there to enjoy a movie you can take the food and drink inside the theater as well. They don't offer typical movie fare, but stuff more along the lines of artisan sandwiches.

Let me set the tone for my tale of disaster....
-Co-worker's going away gathering
-She doesn't drink
-We get off work at midnight
-We are a group of 25
-We'll be hungry!

So Fran turns out to be one of the hand full of places in the city that will accommodate such a list of requirements (notice good food is not on the list or else we'd be screwed!)

We made a reservation for 25 at midnight a week in advance and showed up as planned. When we arrived the manager had his head down on the counter and his staff was flipping chairs onto the tables.... 

Turns out they've had one couple in the last two hours and decided to close the kitchen early (they close at 2am)... WITHOUT CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY HAD A RESERVATION! So as our group starts trickling in via car, bike and TTC the manager begins to panic and offers to have a table set at the Victoria street location. We had originally tried to get a table there in the first pace via phone but we were told they could not accommodate such a large group on a concert night.

The manager gave us $13 in taxi fair which was nice but only allowed 4 of us to make it to the new location without forking over more $$$. He also requested for us to have a table for 25 setup at the other location.

Though I think the manager dealt with the problem in the most adequate way possible... I feel this could have been avoided if they had just read their reservation book or called us in advance. If it was just me and a few friends I might have given this one 2 stars but for inconveniencing a group of 25.... 1 star seems fair!",2011-06-02 12:44:39

I'm rather picky when it comes to Chinese food, because I grew up in Richmond Hill where I got spoiled by delicious authentic restaurants, then moved to Waterloo for university.  In Kitchener-Waterloo, chicken balls and thick gross sweet and sour sauces rule the Chinese food world.  It was pretty awful.  So now I'm always cautious.  It's hard to know which restaurants are good because of the sheer volume in this area, but Yelp helped me find this one for one of my dining group meetings, and I've been back twice since with different people.  Everyone's been very happy and impressed with their experiences.  

My absolute favourite dish I've had here, that I've had every time and plan to continue ordering, is the squid in black bean sauce with peppers.  Bell peppers are one of the vegetables that I can't stand - but I still love this dish.  The squid is always perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the sauce is fantastic.  I just pick around the peppers and leave them for everyone else!  The joys of family style eating.  

Another favourite dish is the Beef with 3 kinds of Mushrooms - so good and flavourful!  Delicious!  The deep fried quail is fantastic, and of course I always order Chinese Broccoli.  

Some of the dishes that weren't huge hits were the beef brisket dish (too fatty and not enough meat), the pork chow mein (nothing bad, nothing great), the cashew chicken (again nothing bad about it but nothing spectacular).  

It seems that if you go off the beaten track of the well-known Chinese dishes here, you're rewarded - and I like that.  I also love the price.  The first time I went, with four girls stuffed, we each paid about $14 tax and tip included.  The second time was a family visit and I think for 5 people it was about $75 before tax and tip.  The third time I think we each paid $20 because we ordered a more expensive item (fresh fish - worth it!).  You really can't go wrong with such amazing food at such a reasonable price.  

All in all, fantastic food, amazing price - go there!",2012-10-09 15:23:12

Firstly, I find the staff to be very friendly. They don't seem to dislike their jobs, which sets them apart from many other movie theater staffs. Secondly, the auditoriums and restrooms are generally pretty clean, which I appreciate. Thirdly, I find that the prices at this theater are more affordable then others in the area, and I really love that they have a $5 deal on Mondays! Fourthly, I find it interesting that they always at least one Bollywood film playing. I'll admit, Bollywood films are not for me, and I've actually never been to one at this theater, but its really cool and unique that they offer that option! Lastly, I find that the patrons at this theater are generally quieter then at other theaters. Perhaps because this theater draws an older crowd; I'm not sure why exactly, but I'l take it since it enhances my viewing experience!

The only drawback is that because this theater is smaller, they tend to show only the really big hit films, and tend to have less showtimes. But I can't fault them for that, because I'm sure they are limited by their size. Still, I definitely prefer this theater to others in the area!",2013-10-07 20:34:42

Now, realize that Republic itself is not new. A couple years ago it replaced an irish pub.It is located in a very central (and convenient)green valley location and super easy to access. They are now doing this chic AYCE brunch

Place was busy but wait time was not an issue (food and sitting wise). Its awesome that they break down the brunch on 3 choices which also means 3 prices ( 10 ,15 and 20 bucks) thus making it more pocket friendly

The force was strong with me and I went for the full experience of the 20 dollars one which includes the items of the 10 and 15 plus some other stuff. And I can tell I dont regret . The food presentation was clean and simple. Portions were small..like SMALL but who cares, as you can order more and its included in the price. There are 3 specialties that you can order for no additional charge(after ordering 3 its 1 dollar additional per plate). I personally recommend to skip the ridiculously tiny steak and stay with the filet and lobster benedict times 3 YO!

Some things  I realized was that drinks were not included with the price but 15 bucks additional for unlimited mimosas was not bad at all (specially after 12 of them). Also...and sadly to report..Bacon was NOT included in the AYCE. are you serious??? no TOCINO? America is the land of the free and massive amounts of bacon.. DONT MESS WITH MY RIGHTS!! it should be anticonstitutional!

With so many options to dine on the weekends in Vegas, Republic does a good job as a local chic and a little different approach kinda  place with a good athmosphere, deco and product. Include bacon and maybe juices or milk to the price and I will be a regular.

Im giving it 3 stars because of the bacon and drinks situation",2012-10-14 16:11:34

There ended up being about a dozen of us, and while the hostess earlier in the day told me that any groups over 6 couldn't be seated together on the Patio, but Roladno the manager made sure we had a place for the crew.

Donnie our waiter was one of the best I have had in a while, he took care of the entire crew and even took care of some minor issues we had.

I booked the UYE there because the las vegas advisor said they had $1 drafts from 9-11p, well when we got there they said it was just for the 4th, but after explaining to them that we have scheduled the event based on that happy hour, they decided to honor it for us.

I personally didn't order anything off the menu (liquid dinner FTW), the few things I sampled were really good.

I really enjoy the grilled kalamari. There's something about not frying these and then applying some balsamic vinagrette with fresh onions that really appeals to me. I also like the kalamari gemisto because the pairing of the squid with feta cheese is just very delicious. 

My family never really likes an eggplant dip (baba ganoush per se) but I thoroughly enjoy the Melitzanosalata.

I usually get the lamb souvlaki because it's really really tender. The beef souvlaki is also pretty good and so is the pork souvlaki.

That next time, it just wasn't as good as the first time but it was still delicious.

Mezes is one of the better greek restaurants in Toronto. The layout of the seating is really cramped in certain areas. If you get a seating with a booth in one end, getting out can sometimes be an issue.

I came here with my friends from church-14 of us, the maximum being 14 people.

Upon walking in, it was already awesome, vibe brought us into an older century, with vintage furniture everywhere, the staff was awesome, like hosts, and we were their good friends coming over for dinner- or in this case, to solve a mystery. i remember Max, who was our cool limo-like, shuttle driver and also our partner-in-solve. wait, does that make sense? he was chill and made it worth it. 

We were presented the mystery called ""Barbosa's Mask"" 
What they do is present a mystery case to solve. we went to 2 different locations where we'd team up and find clues that would lead us to solving the mystery. it was so thrilling, felt real, i was truly scared at one point because the theme of our mystery had some ""spiritual"" twist to it. this allowed us to exercise our minds, thinking with common sense, and outside of the box as a team. so, what i love about the idea of this adventure is it allowed me and my good friends to work as a team in solving this mystery, which had us grow in our bond and to work together. priceless! - which is why it is the highlight of my 2011. GOOD TIMES.

i don't wanna give away too much(yes there is so much more i'm not mentioning, as to not give it away, to experience on your own)but it is a different experience, one i can bet the moon you wont regret). It was one the best 3 hours ever spent out here in Vegas- maybe even in life. i'd recommend going with at least a handful of your friends, this would hopefully, bring you guys closer at a different level. i rest my case.

i'm down to come back again when they have a new mystery in September.",2011-07-06 01:18:24

I was disappointed that I had to give them a dollar for ""admission"" and I'm not really sure why.  I also don't remember it being so ghetto, but the last time I was here was like 15 years ago.  We found our friend in the ridiculous statue shop in the corner and began to peruse our gaudy surroundings.  We got bored really quickly and just wandered around.  The best place here was the little kitchen gadget place.  Other than that, it was aisle after aisle of bedazzled obama shirts, scented oil crap, and weird used looking drug store findings.

This newly opened Spanish restaurant on Queen W had set some high expectations for, as I had heard nothing but amazing things, and Carmen definitely met those expectations!

My party and I tried a large arrange of the tapas, as well as a couple of the desserts & paellas. 

The standouts for me were:

-Fried Artichokes with salt & aioli. Mmmm. Incredibly delicious. Fried yet still not too greasy like many fried foods can be.
-Jicama con Aguacate: bite sized jicama shells filled with creamy avocado. Little bites of avocadoey heaven.
-Paella de Montana: rabbit, escargot, artichokes, & tempranillo. The rabbit was cooked to PERFECTION - asbolutely amazing. The rice in the paella had those nice & crispy delicious bits like you can find in a really good paella. The flavours in the paella all worked so well together. A++

The Carmen Paella with shrimps, clams, mussels, scallops, chorizo, chicken & saffron, was good, but fell a little flat for me in comparison to the Paella de Montana. I think it may not have been cooked long enough as it was more runny than the other Paella we had. 

I'd say the Paella de Montana and tapas were on a different level than the desserts & way outshined them. We had the creme caramel, which was okay, but nothing special, and the Amole (sugar and milk infused with saffron, with pine nuts and an almond-pecan biscuit) which was yummy, but again, not on the same level as the rest of our meal.

This place is pretty loud, so if you want to sit and have a conversation with a group of friends during peak hours, be prepared, you'll be shouting a bit.

Came here and was pleasantly surprised- the interior of the salon is immaculate and the workers were friendly.  Unfortunately though, I received a HORRIBLE gel manicure from one of the female techs and won't be returning.  I asked to have my nails cut- they weren't.  The tech roughly buffed my nails and then with my own nail ""dust"" all over my hands and nails whips out the polish like she wants to start painting my nails.  I asked her, ""shouldn't I wash my hands first?"" She told me no.  I replied to her, "" I'm going to get up and wash my hands"" and I did.  At the sink I inspected my nails and they were jagged and crooked.  Upon my return to the tech's chair I politely asked her to continue buffing my nails and to fix all of the uneven tips/edges.  Surprisingly, she was totally cool with it and did as I asked.  I didn't get to wash my hands again though, so on went the nail polish with all of my nail dust all over my hands.  The tech did an awful job painting my nails.  Three days later and I still have gel polish on my cuticles and the sides of my nail beds.  What really made me upset though was that after I was done drying under the UV light, the tech started filing my nails again!  Um, shouldn't you have done that BEFORE you painted them?!?  Ugh.

My dad had the pancakes with fruit. Same thing: light and fluffy. He put his away, and he and I are about the same size. Yeah, shut up.

A couple points off because it was my first bad experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth.... Literally. When I got to the veggies toppings, I usually ask for extra extra seaweed for my husband's bowl. Mind you, he doesn't get a lot of the other vegetables. He simply gets lettuce, and extra seaweed. 

They have done it for us a couple times in the past, but today, the guy refused to add more than the one serving they're ""allowed to give"". I had to pay $2 for extra seaweed on the side. I get it. Buuuut, what is the difference between last time we were there and today? Be consistent with your rules among all of your employees. What is the difference between extra seaweed, and packing the bowl with all these other toppings?

Second gripe.... The ahi was so mushy and fishy tasting. I know, I know. It's fish!! But it shouldn't be pungently fishy. The thick cuts of fish being mushy plus the fishiness was not cute today!! I loved this place. I used to come so many times since it just opened, and that's recently. Idk if I can for a very long time.

I had a great first time experience here. I ordered a Large Poké bowl with 3 scoops of Ahi. Wasn't sure what sauce to get, so I went safely with Ginger Shoyu. I got all the toppings and fixings I knew I'd enjoy with my bowl. The guy was nice enough to let me do half/half of imitation crab and spicy imitation crab as a topping.

Last time I was at Noodles the owner and chef was there and it seems that perhaps on the days he is working, the food is much better than when he is not.

Also, the owner/chef is aware of the needs of those who must eat gluten-free, so even if it does not say so on the menu, the owner/chef is able to make modifications to many items on the menu to accommodate those who need to eat gluten-free.

I had the awesome twin lobster tails with asparagus for my entree and my man got the shrimp pasta. We also split the jalapeno scalloped potatoes. Wow. All I can say is that it was the best meal i have had in some time. Our server was great, the food incredible, and the atmosphere upscale but not pretentious at all. And the prices are pretty good.
We were also given a complementary dessert for my birthday that we would have never ordered otherwise (too full!) but managed to inhale anyway.

Let me tell you, I have been a loyal customer to Tokyo sushi for years, and yes, that place was a dream for sushi buffets.

TJ sushi has a rep of being a small Chinese place in its other location. 

Knowing this, I went in around 3:30, the restaurant near empty. Usually, this is when service is at its worst, and for buffets, this means that the food is typically long standing, I still went ahead and walked into rows and rows of hot food. 

But here's the incredible part- it was fresh. Not only was it frequently replaced, but it was hot (WHICH IS SO RARE IN BUFFETS- everything is usually lukewarm), fresh and tasted great. The sesame chicken and coconut shrimp were still crispy- holy oats that's nice! 

The sushi was in a row in the back. Yes, Tokyo sushi had more, however, I was not disappointed. It isn't the highest quality sushi out there, but it was definitely fresh. Above all, they had sushi sandwhiches AND EEL- the eel was great and fresh too, which is a huge plus. 

Above all, the place went above and beyond in value- it was only 11.99 a person, which is unheard of. Hokkaido charges 17.99 a head for much less quality and quantity items. 

I am not disappointed in this place at all. Still a few kinks to work out, but the place is super clean, new, fresh, etc. I definitely see this place as holding its value.

I reccomend going here, it definitely surpasses any buffet in the city.",2017-05-02 22:31:19

From the appetizers (satay: my favourite) - the peanut sauce is made from scratch, to the nam sod salad and the entrees (the curries are brilliant), and the pad thai is not as  sweet as some American thai restaurant counterparts. The stir fry eggplant dish is wonderful as well. For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the mango and sticky rice.

Our waitress was fantastic walking us through the menu items.  As a starter, I ordered the special, which was bone marrow topped with capers and some other things.  I had never tried bone marrow before that, but I figured if I'm going to be adventurous I'm going to do it at an ""upscale casual dining"" place like Beckett's Table.  As for my verdict, it was delicious.  It was buttery and flavorful!  My entree was the seared tuna with a Mediterranean jardiniere.  It was the highest priced menu item, so I figured it must at least taste great.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.  It just paled in comparison to my husband's short rib entree.  No doubt, if I had to do it all over again I would have ordered the signature short ribs, too.  It was the kind of dish that makes you really happy as you're chewing.  Oh well, live and learn.  For desert we had their award winning fig and pecan pie.  What makes this dessert extraordinary is that ice cream they top it with.  I feel like it was the star on the plate.  The pie just complemented that cream cheese lemon zest ice cream.

What to get: Liege Waffle w/Spekuloos Spread.
What else: I want to recommend more things but I don't want to spread myself too thin.

Seriously, though, the name is very clever. Wallonia is the name that the Belgians call the Southern (French-speaking) part of the country. One of these days, Belgique-Belgie may split into two... the Flemish and the French. That would be a shame, but if it happens, it won't be unexpected. The title of this dessert spot is a play on the word Wallonia... one which I myself would be proud of.

If you have never been to Brussels and tried the heaven that is churned out at Maison Dandoy near the main square, the greatest Liege Waffles in the world, then this is a very very good attempt at giving you the joy without the travel expenses.

It's not as good as Maison Dandoy, and is second in the USA (probably) to Wafles & Dinges of Manhattan, but other than that, it's the best version of a Belgian Waffle that I've ever tried outside of Belgium. And the fact that they serve Spekuloos (the amazing, delicious traditional Gingerbread spread which has to be imported from Belgium itself) on their waffles (make sure you ask for it) just adds to the experience (I love parentheses) (you can probably tell) (anyway I think this paragraph is just about done, don't you).

The price is not too bad, considering it's in the most expensive fancy part of Pitt, right next to Murray & Forbes. Pop round the corner and try the Chunk Chicken and Pineapple Temptation at Rose Tea while you're here, and maybe a kebab from Turkish Kebab House. A slice from Aiello's too and you're all Squirrelled out in the best kind of way.

As for Waffallonia... It's a tiny little place with not much room to eat (just like the places in Belgium), service is fine, sometimes really friendly, sometimes curt (I mean literally my boy Curt works here, so...), and in general, it's the best dessert you can try in Pennsylvania. Pencil it in, because I hope I'm not writing this review in Vain, yeah? Get it. Pencil. Vain, yeah.

Anyway this review is so so long already. I need to end it.

You get sprayed in this room where there is a towel to stand on and a big mirror.  There is spray tan stuff everywhere.  Thought that was odd, but figured it was normal and didnt think much about it.

I recently got another spray tan @ Naked Beauty in Scottsdale.  So much better!  This place has a machine that you step into that sucks up the access spray so it doesnt get all over the place.  Plus, they put the lotion on for you so that your hands and feet get sprayed evenly.  At Glo--you need to do your own lotion, so the underside of my fingers were orange for like 3-4 days after my tan!  

Other than that, the tan itself did come out nice while it lasted.  However,I wasn't as pleased with how it fades.  It was very noticeable on my chest and stomach.  Looked like I had a bad burn and I was peeling-- brown skin!

We were a day early for the AYCE lunch buffet which, we learned, is available Thursdays and Fridays inclusively. Nevertheless, we mulled over the menu for a few moments and with some guidance from Baldeep, picked a few tasty sounding dishes.

Our selection was:

Butter Chicken - $10.95
Madras Chicken - $10.95
Pulau Rice - $3.95

The dishes at Zeera are prepared mild and you can have the heat modified to your liking, however, since my friend is not a great fan of overly spicy food, we left the dishes as they were.

Everything was amazing. The rice was the best I've ever had in an Indian restaurant... or anywhere for that matter, and even after we'd devoured the chicken, I found myself pouring the lovely sauces onto my plate and sopping them up with my Naan! Absolutely delicious! Next time though, I'll go with my husband and we'll get a little more heat added! ;)

The customer service we received from Baldeep, who I believe is the owner - or co-owner, was fantastic. There's no doubt they take pride in the food they prepare and they certainly strive to ensure their customers have a wonderful dining experience.

The tables are all small benches around larger tables that can sit anywhere from two to twelve. When it is busy (Friday-Sunday), it's not unusual to be sharing a table with one or more groups! Service varies significantly depending on how busy the night is, which can be unfortunate.

Once you are seated (which can take a while - service is touch and go here), they'll bring you a menu full of tasty Mediterranean treats - fatoosh and pizza and hummus and falafel and everything in between. I really love cheese, so I'm partial to the pita mozzarella which is like pita and mozza and cheese and deliciously edible. FYI - the food is quite good, but can take a while to get to your table.

I came in from out of town and was told by several people that I had to go to Deluca's. I got the country breakfast and I was less than wowed by what I got. My meal came out to me in portions as they were ready at separate times. The fried chicken is merely a chicken tender with gravy and shredded cheese poured on top (not enough to put any on my biscuit that came out halfway through). The homefries were good. 

Apparently, it is a seat yourself and grab your own menu kind of place. Another customer paying ended up handing us two menus before any staffers acknowledged our existence.

We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and a side order of Jalapeno poppers. The poppers were horrible. They were obviously frozen and heated up, but not even the good frozen brand. The breading was weak (aka soggy) and they had absolutely NO flavor. So very, very disappointed. That was the first and last time we order those.

The pizza, we have ordered in the past and they were just okay. Not great, but edible.  But this time, it was disgusting. The dough was not fully cooked, it was still very doughy. 

So the next day we decided to reheat the pizza using our pizza stone (why we didn't think of this the night before, I don't know, maybe just too tired or too disgusted) anyway the dough crisped up nicely and became not great, but edible, just okay.

The best part of the pizza was the toppings. They put a ton of cheese and pepperonis on it which was at least something, but not enough to keep me coming back.

After this experience I don't think we'll order from here again, we have actually been experiencing with making our own pizzas at home, and so far our worst pizza has been way better than the best they have delivered to us).

I was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.

We started with two big glasses of sangria.  I thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or I got used to it.

I had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  I had never had morels before and now I understand why they're so pricey.  There was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  The risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind I wish I could make myself.  My best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  I tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.

We split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote Happy Birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  The creme brulee was good but definitely not the best I've ever had.  (That award may go to Soba's coffee creme brulee.)

The total bill would have been $72, which seems a bit steep.  But it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  The patio was lovely.  I will definitely be back, if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto!",2009-06-01 00:17:50

I first heard of Beckett's Table on local food blog Chow Bella. They were on the list for the best grilled cheese and WOW is that ever accurate. I have the stomach size of a small bird so this is enough to fill me up- the bread is rather filling as it is homemade, fluffy and dense and all sorts of amazing. It also comes with a small dish of red pepper soup for dipping that is impeccable. 

My absolute favorite thing here is the pecan pie. Theirs is a refreshing take on an old favorite... as it is infused with fig and topped with a small scoop of their homemade gluten-free OUT OF THIS WORLD citrus cream cheese ice cream. I kid you not I think I dreamed of that ice cream for a week straight after I first had it... so unbelievably creamy and divine. 

My other favorite thing about this restaurant is the community table. It's a very beautiful, very long wooden table openly awaiting those who are both impatient and not shy.

They texted me saying they had a table for us in about 45 minutes, so I'd say that wasn't so bad.

From the gang called Yelpers with Elite Badges
When I'm called on, I got my song on
Squeeze the bottle, and salsa is poured on
Two drinks, boy, if ya drink with me
My reviews are gonna have to come singing from me
Off those stars, that's how I'm goin out


Otro Cafe is a Americanize Mexican food joint with some cute artwork and what I can describe is a classical home kitchen feel.  I really enjoyed walking in and looking at the arts and the open feel of this place.  

My partner and I sat at a booth and shot for their Happy Hour drinks; $1 off pretty much most anything you ordered.  For our starters we went for the Chips and Guacamole and Queso Fundido.  The chips and guacamole were both thick in texture.  The guacamole was still creamy to the palate and had some fresh onions bits while providing a strong limey taste.  It came along with two sides of salsa in a squirt bottle; red and green.  The Queso Fundido came out hot on a skillet along side with some flour tortillas.  Super cheesy with some mushrooms and sausage mixed, it was both hot in temperature and just a tad bit spicy, but not too overwhelming.  

As for our entrees with both went for the tacos!  I went for the traditional Carne Asada and Cochinita.  Both tacos came on a hand made tortilla, which was warm and soft to the bite.  The Carne Asada had a bit of charred texture but the guacamole smoothed it out.  The Cochinita had a subtle texture and sweet taste with a hint of the achiote.  Both were topped with cilantros and onions.  

Overall, I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Otro Cafe.  I heard they serve Breakfast, but I'm too lazy sometimes to travel to get my food!  However, for happy hour drinks and small bites this place definitely delivers! - Enjoy!",2017-01-16 20:36:13

We came in tonight and saw an empty table that hadn't been bussed but preferred the back area as opposed to the front. Initially, the server seemed stressed by that but told us it was ok. He rushed over to buss and wipe the table. 

We always start with the spicy edamame yum!!! I ordered the pho with filet mignon and it was as delicious as always. My boyfriend ordered the pho with beef, tripe, tendon etc. I strongly recommend googling what tripe is before ordering... (yuck) my bf enjoyed the pho but ended up taking out the tripe.

Often times we get the same server and I always forget to ask his name but he's sweet and a hard worker! Apparently a busser didn't show up for his shift which explained his stress upon when we sat down. I've worked as a waitress and I understand situations like that. I also think customers should be more understanding and kind. We all do our best after all..

Decided to try Emiliano's based on Yelp reviews and proximity to our hotel, Westin Montreal. The menus met our various needs and likes. Service was friendly and attentive. They take reservations.

Our group of six sat on the edge of the loft overlooking the main floor. What a beautiful place. Loved the ceiling and exposed brick wall,

We had:
Regular guacamole - delicious
Crab topped guacamole - I don't generally like crab, but this was excellent!
Three kinds of quesadillas - vegetarian, pork, lobster and shrimp - all great
Fish tacos - delicious
Coconut cake - recommended by our server. This was the perfect end to the meal. Light, fluffy, coconut-y.
Dulce Des Leches crepes were good but perhaps a bit tough and heavy at the end of the meal.

District One is a modern Vietnamese fusion cuisine that offers traditional plates like pho with a twist. There are a bunch of TVs in the restaurant and seating for tables, booths, and a bar.

Their alcohol and wine list is pretty detailed. I usually try different beers when I'm in here. They all taste yummy.

I had the steak and eggs. I opted for the normal steamed rice because I tried the tomato rice before and was not really a fan. The meat was good and the taste had a lot of flavor. No complaints at all!

The reason I can't make this place a normal go to is because the price is a tad bit expensive compared to other pho restaurants. Yes, they offer an amazing lobster pho and/or surf and turf pho, but that will cost you $30 for essentially what is still pho. If I want a normal pho bowl, I can think of a lot of places where I would pay less and probably pay as much as I would here but already have gratuity included.",2018-06-10 03:13:18

There aren't too many Asian restaurants around this area, and the few that are here serve American fusion cuisine...nasty fusion cuisine, I have to add. I came here with my Vietnamese friend, so the first test was to see if any of the staff could actually speak Vietnamese. Luckily our hostess/waitress spoke Vietnamese, test #1- check. It was another cold winter day in CLE so we definitely ordered pho (the deluxe beef noodle) as well as the grilled noodles- which have grilled shrimp, meat, and spring rolls with vermicelli noodles. For starters we got the grilled pork rolls. Test# 2 was obviously how authentic and good was the food- mainly the pho. I have to say, my friend and I thought the pho broth was quite decent. Maybe 2nd or third best in CLE that we've tried so far? I trust my friend's opinion, since she was born and raised in Vietnam- who would argue with someone that has eaten pho all her life?! Haha for restaurant standards, it was good, and filled our pho cravings. (If I had to compare it to homemade pho....well, there's no comparison.) The only slight downside to the pho here is, they give slightly less meat than I'm used to seeing. For me personally, I'm ok with that since I don't eat huge amounts of meat. For others, they may be slightly disappointed? Maybe order extra meat with your pho? 
The grilled noodles and pork rolls were good. I think it's hard to go wrong with more simple dishes like that. I like that they grill the rolls here, the taste is more delicious than the plain rice rolls served at other restaurants. 
The prices are slightly higher than other Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to, but then again the area is slightly more upscale as well. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet, and checked in on us to make sure everything was good. Overall it was a good experience and we would probably come back if we were in the area again! You passed both tests- congrats haha!",2013-12-30 21:33:33

The first time wasn't all bad. We had some generic nachos and I got a free drink, because the bartender messed up someone's drink order, and handed it to me instead of tossing it. Freeness aside, it was pretty gross.

Round 2. Definitely the worst of the three. Our margaritas were SO disgusting, we had to make up drinking games just to chug them down. We NEVER complain about drinks...too strong, too weak, too warm...nothing really phases us. We finally added ""too tastes like they used the shaker that still had sour cream in it from two days ago,"" to the list, after much debate. Plus, the shake weight commercial kept playing, so we made the best of it.

Third and final. Nothing stood out as being especially bad. The food was eh. The service was eh. I just finally learned my lesson. The only redeeming quality this place has is that it's a good people-watching location.",2011-04-24 00:46:00

Skewer pieces of meat, (poultry, swine, or bovine) hold them above burning charcoals, Crisp the edges and fatty bits, flip and turn until medium rare, set on slate and serve. The steps are undeniably simple, but the execution and creativeness is tricky. So when it's done right and in front of you, it's commendable.

Yakitori Kintori delivers on its promise of serving delicious and delectable morsels of meat and veggies on skewers. Perfect accompaniment to beer- the salty, juicy tastes of meat turn from good to great with every bite.

I ordered many things between two people and that's another positive about Yakitori, trading and sharing skewers. We tried different things like Japanese Yum (thought it was yam misspelled but it actually wasn't. It was still a potato-like-root), chicken oysters (aka. Chicken testicles), chicken tail (aka. Chicken ass), and etc. It can be a bit overwhelming as well because they serve literally every part of a chicken or pig from the menu, conveniently and anatomically illustrated with arrows to names-  balls are under here, ass back here and soft bone... here?

My favorites were the chicken testicles, duck breast, and tail. Lesser favs still worth trying were the Sasami mentei-mayo (which has nothing to do with sesame, in case you wondered), thigh and cheese meatball. On top of the yakitori are other options with rice and noodles or un-grilled like the octopus with wasabi. Everything I had I liked and the variety made the experience delicious. My advise is to try weird things and to see what is delicious before ordering doubles or triples. You'll be surprised with what you may fall in love with.

Pro tip: pass on the beer sorbet, as I mentioned in person while eating, ""Only somewhere like Guu can they serve this and have people accept it,"" otherwise it's just frozen shards of beer - bitter after taste with the only hint of sweet coming from the small dollop of whip on top.

Pro Pro tip: make a reservation because they take reservations. 

Overall, I really like Yakitori Kintori. It carries the Guu empire in the right direction not only in atmosphere and space (which is similar to it's first floor sister Kinton) but also flavors and awesome traditional Japanese food done in a unique way. Delicious and affordable, new and exciting come to mind after eating here.

It's a business that gives you what you expect.  I have quite a bit of pride that my reviews bell curve around 3.5 stars.

Anyway, I don't have much to judge this place on so I can't really stray too far from a 3 star review anyways.  I had a few jack+diets and my friend had a beer.  Decently priced if I recall.  Most of the bill came from the food.  We both had salads.  I can't remember what my friend got exactly though.  I got the chopped salad.  It tasted fine.  No complaints.  The food is actually from next door from the King George or whatever it's called.

Service was fine.  They got the men wearing suspenders and whatnot.  The women wear corsets.  It's a real small place.  Maybe 15 spots at the bar.  7 or 8 tables.  It used to be called Sidebar.  Other than the employees' dress, I don't think much has changed.  Obviously they wanted to capitalize on the mob museum down the road (which is worth going to by the way).

Not exactly involved in the diagnosis or management of Celiac Disease, but watching the trend of 'gluten free' everything take place from the perspective of a physician charged with assigning treatment to other autoimmune related conditions it was actually at the recommendation of a patient afflicted with both Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and biopsy-proven Celiac that a stop at GlutenZero Bakery off Eastern Avenue was planned, owner Clarissa and her son each busy preparing the days goods but delightful and forthcoming just the same.

In part a work of passion but also one of self preservation, the owner and her daughter each suffering symptoms for years before their own diagnoses, GlutenZero is a certified gluten free space in a repurposed former gym and admitting a great deal of expense invested in opening the place without yet catching on with the community at large it was with several samples shared that Clarissa discussed her process and practice, everything made in house with top-tier ingredients and even the Lichtenstein-leaning paintings on the wall produced by her hands.

Almost as expansive in selections as the space itself is in size, the front chiller filled with several styles of carrot cake while the rest are encased in glass near the baking area in back, it was first in a small spoonful of fresh, fruity Barbeque sauce that opinions began to form and although the German Chocolate was a bit more dense than some may prefer the flavor spot-on, the same to be said of a citrusy lemon curd cupcake stuffed with stiffly whipped cream that thankfully trended far more light.

Unable to pass up cinnamon rolls that were being glazed fresh from the oven before my very eyes, suffice it to say that unlike the springy curls of Glutton or The Bagel Cafe the version at GlutenZero eats more like a yeasty poundcake not-so-different than Cinnabon, though a touch more toothsome and far less buttery in taste.

Modesty impressed to this point, though still not wowed, it was next into the carrot cake that fork-and-knife were plunged, the first bite flooding the palate with sweetness and spice while subsequent tastes revealed textural variance amidst a substantial amount of moistness, the frosting tangy with cream cheese beneath a light dusting of ground nuts.

Told by both the owner and my patient that the chocolate truffle brownie was perhaps the best in town it was admittedly with skepticism that such a claim was assessed, but setting aside all prejudices related to rumors and dietary restrictions it would honestly be difficult to name any as decadent, both the flourless chocolate base and creamy ball atop it on par with plated desserts at restaurants despite far less expense.

****Doing very impressive things within the strict limitations of an entirely gluten free space one can only hope that there is a large enough audience to support GlutenZero Bakery through the early opening phases, I know I'll be back sometime soon to check out the pies and give the brownie another taste.",2015-10-09 22:03:20

I was going to take my SUV to another shop with great reviews too but the other guy had less reviewers...about a dozen. Alex, the owner, matched their price too. It appears that he believes in treating the customers fairly and you will succeed without major advertising (like that bald idiot from Dodge who proclaimed himself the King of Cars because his daddy gave him that dealership to manage, or that's the word among locals. I wonder what he did with that skinny Genie that he had painted blue every week for his infomercials. Probably suing him for paint inhalation and absorption. Then again, maybe he ""chopped"" him and is working elsewhere now. Badabup.)

It's still winter weather; so, I dont know about the quality of film used. Everyone is selling high performance, carbon, super sun deflecting space shuttle quality film (that can keep Dracula comfortable in the Las Vegas sun), over their competitors. Truth be said, my ""premium"" film that I used to buy from Walmart has lasted 10 years and blocks the sun just fine on one car we still have (rest were sold so I dont know if the film still holds or not). Alex said he was putting Suntech film on mine and was better than the competitors' hi-performance carbon. (FYI, they sell it precut on Ebay too, so is it really exclusive? I don't know.) For me, as long as the baseline is the same, anything better is icing on the cake. My car was done at 5:30 at night and it was already pretty dark in this time of year so I did not see anything when I drove home. I will see how these films are better when summer rolls around.

The next afternoon I went to look at the tint job. Tint job looks fine. I noticed where the installer cut into the rubber seals around the windows and there were strands hanging from some of the windows where he cut the seals. Very thin lines. I've DIYed my own windows probably 5 times in my life. I've avoided cutting the seals b/c I shift the tint around and lower the window a little, then just follow the seals with my razor. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but if this was my BMW, yeah, it would bother me because the razor blade is thin and pressed against the seals as a guide when you are cutting. This avoids cuts. You might knick it but not cut 6-7 inches. Another small passenger window had a tiny spot where film did not cover it. I dont know if this will cause it to peel or bubble later on. It's on the corner so this may be a concern in the future.

Overall, Alex was fair, friendly, and the workmanship is good, albeit with a few minor quibbles. My car was the last one done and it was closing time so maybe the installer probably rushed a little. He looked pretty young too. The water spots that were underneath the window tint, eventually faded after a couple of days.",2016-02-01 04:46:27

I had the Bill Walsh (former 49 ers coach) but I think they should change it to the Joe Walsh because this sandwich rocked! I know that sounds cheesy but it's true. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone including vegans. In my opinion a great sandwich starts with great bread and there's is right in the money! And they used this amazing garlic aioli that smells like what I imagine heaven smells like. Damn it was good! A perfect mix of turkey, cheese, avocado and the heavenly sauce. Mmm Mmm good! It's been 36 hours since I've eaten there and I think I will go back there tomorrow for lunch.
I'm a little surprised about their choice for the first location in AZ. It's across the street from Fiesta Mall which is quickly closing stores. And many nearby restaurants have gone out if business. I would think that they would have chosen a spot with mire traffic.

Well 2 years later and its my first go; and damn! Im in love. On a hot summer day this was so refreshing. Even tho it was cold - i ordered the Mauna Loa Bowl which has lots of spicy content (spicy salmon, spicy seaweed salad, spicy cucumbers and jalapeno) and i asked them to top it off with the spicy aioli. Goodness! How could something so spicy somehow manage to still feel cool going down to my belly. Salmon was jelly soft and tender. The edamami and cucumbers would give it the crisp so that your bites are even. Even the brown rice had a great taste to it. I added some Togarashi to add some more flavour.

All the ingredients we crispy and fresh and the place was clean. Seems like it will be busy. For $12 for the regular, I am completely full but also feel like I made the right decision health wise. 

Overall fulfilling in taste, portion and a semi-clear conscience, asked them to go heavy on the spicy aioli (dont poke me to death for it).",2018-05-29 18:49:54
LQhgSMqqNwCO1EpOpYzhWg,wISdr15RJTBtlhilcayCpA,H1j34TgbrVZkxeww9xlJTw,4,0,0,0,"Ok so I HAD to go to this place because I've seen it on the food network and I've had people rant and rave about the gyro's here. So I was in Cleveland recently and made it necessary to stop here and eat a gyro. I got to the place about 1:30pm and it's a good thing I did. I understand that the west side market place closes about 4pm? Or from what I'm told. Regardless, I didn't want to get there close to 4pm because I was also told that once they run out of gyro meat for the day they are done - and they usually run out before 4pm. 

When I got on the line to get my gyro- I could see they had three spits going and two of them were empty and the third one was almost finished. So I assume I got there just in time to get a gyro. Now remember- these are things I've ""heard"" from people so I don't know for a fact if they just stop serving gyro meat when they run out even if it's way before closing time so you'd have to verify that when and if you go- but anyway- back to my story lol So they had meat left which I was happy about. The line wasn't long at all- just about 4 people in front of me. I liked the little sign they had on the table explaining the ""rules"" of what you can't ask them for haha So I ordered my gyro and they certainly do pack them! Holy crap lol You definitely get what you pay for! 

My only complaint- we all know how messy a gyro can be. Sauce everywhere. They don't have any plastic forks or knives for the food!?  That was annoying actually. And on top of it- I didn't know this place didn't have any place to sit and eat the food. You gotta take all your stuff to go. Bummer. But upstairs I saw people sitting on this long radiator which actually over looks the entire market. So I made my way up there to sit on the radiator. Again- a fork and knife would have been ideal! So needless to say it was a big mess trying to eat this huge messy gyro sitting Indian style on a radiator. Good thing I grabbed extra napkins because I certainly needed it. 

Over all- the gyro was delicious! I know the difference though. I'm from New York and I've had the best damn gyros you can imagine lol Everything about this gyro was exactly the same as any other gyro - EXCEPT the sauce. That's the trick here haha The sauce was similar to traditional Greek style tzatziki sauce but there was something different about it which made the gyro taste different- but still delicious. The sauce is also pinkish in color compared to it being all white. I almost ate the whole thing- and I can never finish one of those! So it definitely was good. No complaints about the food at all. Definitely grab one of these if you're in Cleveland! But be sure to get extra napkins- you're gonna need it.",2015-12-22 07:58:03

   Chopstix is a small Chinese Restaurant with a take-out atmosphere located in the Mark's Street Walmart Supercenter Shopping Center (southeast corner of Sunset Road) in the building parallel to the road. Located a considerable distance from the Walmart Supercenter, there is sufficient close by parking. 

  Driving all over the southeast valley on the search for Plantar Fasciitis boots, I was hungry by the time that I left Sear's. Recently, I observed a Chopstix in the nearby Walmart Supercenter Shopping Center. From that time forward it lived in my head as a mental bookmark. It was time to scratch off this mental bookmark. 

  I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant luncheon special. When the Chinese restaurant is high-grade, the luncheon is very reasonable. At Chopstix, they feature both a luncheon and dinner combination special. The luncheon specials start at $6.25. The dinner combinations start off at $7.25.

  There are two reasons that the Chopstix luncheon special stands out from the majority of  the Chinese restaurant luncheon specials that I have ordered. The first reason is that the Chopstix luncheons exclude the customary soup of the day which is usually egg drop or hot and sour soup. The second reason, is that in place of the noodle based chow mein, the Chopstix luncheon includes lo mein. A beverage costs extra here. For the record I don't recall Chopstix giving me a fortune cookie. It's all good though. 

  Off the luncheon menu, I ordered the shrimps with lobster sauce. The kindly woman who took my order and payment chatted over all the people that like shrimps with lobster sauce. Maybe if I had told her about all the people who love New York style chow mein they would of added it to the menu. Anyways, I'd see her one more time when she delivered the food to my table. 

  The shrimps with lobster sauce luncheon included the following : lo mein (which I stated), an egg roll that resembled a spring roll, and fried rice. With a soda, the luncheon special came out to around $8. It was $8 well-spent. The shrimp with lobster sauce was delicious. 

The delicious shrimps and flavoring of the lobster sauce served with savory lo mein is tasty food that leaves me with a favorable taste of Chopstix. It is a favorable taste worthy of 3.5 stars. Since they never gave me a fortune cookie, I'll write a fortune that says,  ""You may return to Chopstix when you are in the Mark's Street Walmart Supercenter Center parking lot before 4 'o' clock.""",2014-12-03 04:32:08

If that does not get you down here maybe the great patio will get you here or the spacious bar.  I could see myself eating at the bar or one of the super comfortable booths.
As for the eats....The backyard burger, Windsor style is on my list of must eat again, porkwich is a must eat all the time, and the mac and cheese is a great side.  I can't cook mac and cheese like that at home, nice crisp top of melted cheese and uber yummy cheese and pasta under neath.  
The Windsor burger and piggy burger were great.  Just ask for extra napkins since you will look like a Carl's Jr commercial trying to scarf either burger down.  They are both messy, but I could not let the sauce and juice go to waste just dip the burger into the left overs on the plate. :) 
Let me describe the porkwich please....  Pulled pork, belly braised ham, cold slaw, smoked bacon, and the yummy sweet gold sauce.  All this on a buttermilk bun which is soft and a great absorber of all that sauce and flavor.  Get you eat on quick so the bun does not go soggy on you.  
The backyard burger has a great garlic aioli, caramelized onions, sharp cheddar, and some iceberg shredded up to add some color.  This was a great burger and even though it is a must eat again I am really a fan of the porkwich.  
My only downside is parking, really only a hand full of parking and then free valet.  Nothings free, I still gotta tip a guy that has to run down the street to get my car.  That's usually where your car will end up is down a side street adjacent to the restaurant.  I think the valet thing does fix the lack of parking problem and the food is so good it really is not that big of a deal.

They have turned dining out into a simple experience. In N Out specializes in three sandwiches: a hamburger, cheeseburger, and double cheeseburger in addition to fries, Coke beverages, and shakes. It is simplicity in dining that is delicious. In N Out burgers taste freshly made. Missing from In N Out are microwaves and warmer lights.

  This past Saturday after exploring Craig Ranch Regional Park and hanging out in The Cannery my brother and I were up for a simple 4 star meal. The Cannery failed at that. It was now 11 p.m. And so we decided to meet up at the In N Out Burger a couple of lights from the Cannery and off the Interstate 15 exit. The abundance of parking and lighting gave me a simple first impression. It was an impression that would develop into a 4 star rating. The restaurant met my standards in cleaniness. The cashier was welcoming. In back of the cashier, the people cooking the burgers were in plain view. I appreciate the fact that customers can see the food being prepared. The time between ordering and picking up the food was 8 minutes. Yeah it wasn't exactly fast food, however, the taste exceeded fast food. An In N Out cheeseburger and fries is worth waiting for. The cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was thick and tasty. I could believe that the burger was not frozen and microwaved.

They did stress that if you 'overordered' and did not consume things you could be charged extra.  Taking their advice we ordered moderately.

Yelpers have half praised this place. As expected, there are some dishes that are very well done but some, not quite to my liking. 

First, this is a comfortable small restaurant. The decor is not too grand but decent enough that you won't feel that you are in a hole in a wall type. 

In a corner of the restaurant, there is a set up for Tea Tasting Ritual -- when I asked the waiter how much is that for showing us the Tea Tasting Ritual, he said we have to inquire with the owner.

We ordered five dishes:

Crab meat Xiao Long Bao - Quite tasty. I suspect that a fair amount of MSG is in it. But the problem is that the skin is too thick -- not to my liking. Grade C. 

Dumpling - issue is the skin is not well cooked -- need to spray some water on the dumplings prior to finishing the dish. Grade C. 

Kung Pao Chicken - quite tasty and well cooked. Grade B.

Marinated Cucumbers -- Good dish to have, Grade B. 

Beef noodle soup -- the beef is outstanding, but the noodle is just not right. The soup taste is ok. Based on the beef, it is worth a B.

Business is decent but they have only one waiter. He is stretched way too thin. Also the dishes take too long -- I suspect that there is only one cook in the kitchen. 

Pricing is reasonable, not cheap but properly priced. Portions are adequate.

Research led us to Saigon Nites, and they did not disappoint! In fact, she got a refill, and if anyone's had a Thai iced tea before... that's some serious biznis in the form of condensed milk. Add boba, and you're at about a 1,000 calories, but, like a true warrior, she downed 'em both.

We also had the green papaya salad with shrimp and an order of fried rice, and neither was particularly impressive. The sauce/spices/flavor on both were pretty bland, and the shrimp didn't seem all that fresh. On the plus side, the fried rice came in an ogre portion size, so if you're looking for value, this dish will leave you with leftovers for days.

The sub continent region is covered well with a halal meat counter kept separate from the other meat cuts (looks like they did their research) and an aisle dedicated to spice mixes and other goods from that region. The frozen food and dry goods also covers that area well.
The main attraction is the cuisine from China and it is covered very well IMO. I am by no means an expert but I saw some items I have not seen elsewhere but a connoisseur is sure appreciate the effort that went in to procuring these items. 
Thai Food Selection is decent and I even found the now hard to locate Tom Yum Soup Can from Aroy D (one of the preferred make of Thai canned goods IMO)
Now for the regions that could have been covered better:
Japanese aisle is lacking IMO and even T&T covers that region better. Indonesian and Malay spice selection was decent though.
So far so good now for the bad part
The Seafood area had water on the floor and in fact there was so much water I felt like wearing rubber boots (Tsukiji Market Style in Tokyo :) The prices were good . The prices for shell fish were decent and some of the fish looked beautiful. One thing that alarmed me were the discounted fresh lobster. OK I get it many big super markets sell them on ice but these were just piled on top of the other and lobster that is not cooled properly can go bad real fast.
I did look at the food court as well and tried the hot and sour soup to help with the weather. It was OK just like any neighborhood greasy restaurant would serve. There is quite a selection here and it can be daunting sometimes to choose what to order as all sort of cuisines are represented here as well. There doesn't seem to be a flow of things. Some people were lining up some were just walking up and ordering. 
The staff needs training , it was hard to locate them and were not helpful when approached. They were only accepting cash or debit when I was there (though someone who tried this store said they do take VISA and MC) They also had a lot of promo items for the weekend.
IMO its a decent addition to this area and it will do well as I don't think they have alternate that can compete with them by sheer size and selection.

On a Saturday afternoon, we found ourselves in the Landsdowne area searching for a quick bite to eat and stumbled upon this gem. We shared the Chickun Parm ($10) and a lemon filled donut from their impressive glass display. 

The chickun parm was absolutely delicious. The crispy breaded seitan was hot and crunchy, doused in a tarte tomato sauce with melted cheeze on top. The addition of the pesto give it an extra boost of flavor. The sandwich was sizable - as in I could only eat half before I was full. It also came with a side of popcorn!!  Which was delightful and cute.

The lemon filled donut for dessert was the best!! Plenty of creamy tart lemon filling encased in a soft buttery dough. It was tangy and sweet, the perfect way to end the meal.

The only real downside is that there isn't alot of seating, so expect to stand at the counter or share seating with other patrons. Worth it though. I loved it here!!",2018-06-27 18:18:27

Let's start from the very beginning...when you sit down, you are greeted by some chips and salsa.  But not just any kind of salsa, corn salsa.  The salsa is a good mix of sweet and regular salsa-y.  The chips add a nice saltiness to it.  Then the margaritas are refreshing with a good balance of sweetness and tequila.  I always get the Mahi Mahi fish tacos with usually one of their taco specials.  I love how you can mix and match the different tacos.  The tortilla they are served on is hard to describe.  It is more flaky and light than your average flour tortilla.  The ingredients in the tacos are very fresh and flavorful.  Lastly, I am always craving the jalapeño mash potatoes, because they are THE best mash potatoes I have ever had.  However, they are only served as a seasonal side.

If you ask me what my ALL TIME FAVOURITE coffee is....I would say cafe sua da!  I love the smokey and bitter flavour of the coffee beans with the sweetness of condense milk. It's seriously so good.  So when I saw a fellow foodie posting about a place in Pacific mall that sells Vietnamese coffee...I knew I had to check it out.  
It's a small little store located upstairs in the heritage area. The store front had a cute poster of an owl with a rice hat!!  The ladies that served us were very nice, one of them spoke Vietnamese to us, but all I could say was hello auntie in Vietnamese  My friend however was able to speak to her! Very nice ladies. The coffee only took a couple of minutes to make, it seems the dripping coffee was already waiting for us  When I took my first sip my eyes grew big... The flavour was phenomenal!!! It wasn't too sweet, there was just the right amount to pair with the smokey coffee flavour!!  It was so good, I was very impressed. My favourite cafe sua da will always be from Viet Hoa, but it's pretty far for me to just casually go to get coffee. So I guess Dak Lak will be my go-to place for cafe sua da from now on!!

As many reviews have had recalled, I was looking forward to ""the best taco I've ever had"".  Like many other restaurants, the fish option here was clearly an afterthought.  Not bad, but pretty comparable to the fish tacos at Mad Mex, which for the price point is less of a value.

I think this could possibly be the best taco you've ever eaten if you don't typically eat tacos a lot.  My taco wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing.

Tako did have some redeemers though.  For starters, I got the poke and street corn.  I love street corn and thought this met the bid compared to similar corns I've had in New York and Miami.  This corn was different in that it wasn't on the cob but rather loose corn.  It was very sweet but it just made me question whether or not it was fresh.  

The poke...was fantastic!  It was a concoction like no other!  One part tuna, one part guac, one part sweet sauce, one part crisps.  All my flavor and texture needs were met far beyond expectation.  I will say it's very much an acquired taste.  But if you have it, it sends you to the moon and back.

Have walked past this cafe a few times during the day and it has always been FULL of people with laptops and I never thought there was space for me. But recently, I was able to drop by after work and it was actually empty. So in terms of crowdedness, it seems to really depend on the day/time. Or perhaps since it's the end of April, all the University students are done studying? 

Well the space is really minimalist and basic, but I like it. I did vaguely remember the place from its previous incarnation (also a cafe but different name). There is seating at the window, one picnic table, and some smaller tables for 2. At the back there is a sofa and bean bag chair -- more of a comfy, social space. The side wall looks like a funky white/blue pattern but when you look closer it's actually a bunch of little faces. 

I had a regular latte which comes in a pretty big mug and the barista asked me if I wanted skim/1%/2%/whole milk. Soy is 50 cents extra. They have lots of teas as well as wine, cocktails, and beer. What strikes me as a bit odd is that they close at 7pm. I wonder if they would get more business staying open a bit later, especially given that they have a liquor license. Music was francophone and Latin American stuff. 

Nice spot for chillin', reading, or doing some work over coffee and snacks (they have a selection of sandwiches). Cool vibe without trying too hard.",2011-04-30 23:18:01

I ordered the French onion soup and the lobster pot pie. The soup was good with the cheese crust, but it wasn't oozing cheese like French onion is supposed to. 

The pot pie was a bit overpowered by the tarragon, though you still got a good lobster flavor on the back end. The brandy cream sauce was not super flavorful and a bit too thick and heavy. Also, the puff pastry top didn't bring much to the dish.

My realtor deserved a nice relaxing day at the Spa. I booked a day visit (as a local) for her and I and found a February special going  on for a massage, pedicure, and a facial. I had to make a few changes on the service offered, as in a facial with a chemical peel, a deep tissue massage instead of a sports massage (stretching). Every time I had to call in to make a change about my reservation, the staff was attentive and helpful.

Day of arrival-We got to the spa right when they opened, even though our services didn't start until 10 am. We were able to use the steam room and Jacuzzi, have a light breakfast and mimosas on the 14th floor balcony-outside-beautiful and then start our day of relaxation.

From the luxurious warm and comfy robes and sturdy slippers, to the peaceful rooms to relax in, we practically had the spa to ourselves! 

Every room was clean and the spa was very inviting. There was not a single thing that was unpleasant. Oh, except the person giving the manicure was not very ""friendly"" but all in all it was a good experience for a Sunday, at a Spa-at a casino.

I want to mention how sweet, caring, and professional Shyla and Maria were with me. I appreciated there concerns about my well being-the tenseness in my back and neck and shoulders, and the recommendations they provided. They knew exactly what I needed and they had just met me prior to the body scrub and polish and massage. I will be back!

I also enjoyed shopping in the spa afterwards and went home with an identical luxurious comfy robe! Now I know to shop here when I come to visit the casino in the future. The product line is amazing and there are a lot of nice skin moisturizers available.

When Dale beat out Rob last year in the Canadian edition, I wasn't super happy, I thought Rob's cooking was much more consistent and much more my taste (ie. What I like to eat).

When Bestellen was announced, I was excited to finally be able to taste his food.
Went on a Sunday night, typically a slower night in restaurants in the city (even newer ones like Bestellen with a lot of buzz). Called for a reservation a week out, looking for a 7:30 or 8pm seating. I was told all they had was 6:30pm, which we took. 

Arrived at 6:30pm to an almost empty restaurant (maybe 35% of the seats full). The restaurant stayed that way for our entire meal, which lasted until 8:30pm. Why we couldn't be seated at 7:30pm or 8pm remains a mystery.

Drinks: Pimm's Cups ($12) all around. Very good, super boozy. 

Appetizers: We were all pretty hungry. Appetizers ordered included: Caramel  
Popcorn ($5), Steak Tartare ($13), Scotch Egg ($6), Micro-green salad ($10) and Salt Cod Cakes ($10). Caramel Popcorn is tasty, though a tiny portion. Steak Tar-tare was a huge disappointment; totally under seasoned (no salt) the meat was tasteless, the scotch quail egg was an interesting touch, but the egg was overdone with very little yolk (which is my favourite part of steak tartare). The Scotch Egg was the clear favourite at the table, cooked perfectly, wrapped in ham and battered . My only issue with it was that it could have been warmer, it was a bit on the cold side. The salad was good, tiny but super fresh and well dressed.

Mains: Everyone told us to order steaks. We did not, mostly due to the price (starting at $38). I had the Orata ($24) as did one of others in our party.  It was a perfect dish, the fish was light, skin crisp and sides were delicious. Was a pretty small portion.  The other two in our group had the Burger ($18) and the pasta ($18). The burger, like the steak tartare was ruined by the fact that it was not seasoned. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, yet tasted like nothing. Toppings didn't really add to it. Disappointing. The pasta was good, spicy sausage. 

Dessert: Ordered two Pots De Crème to share. Amazing. Dark chocolate crème with Crunchy-like honeycomb on top. Good that we only ordered two, they were super rich.

Overall: Great décor, good service. Food, was very inconsistent. Would I go back? No, probably not.

-No sashimi
-No customized rolls
-No a la carte then switching to AYCE

I don't eat shellfish and my wife can't eat avocado. This sounds like a very limiting situation for us. We eat tons of sushi, so it's not normally an issue.

KvH47QYfcpwVlxqRicFUvA,u9r7r92gaqijc3eday-XkQ,btUPcPBH26ZelAlogTIC5g,5,0,1,1,"Let me start by saying that I'm in a recovery support group for Kohls addicts. My name is Amanda, and I have a problem. 

Okay, good to get that off my chest! 

Now, given my love for Kohls deals/savings I guess you could say I'm a Kohls aficionado. I've been to many Kohls stores in different cities and states, and I must say, this Kohls is in my top 2 favorites! I'm guessing most people reading this are already familiar with the glory that is combining Kohls coupons to get all your favorite clothes, shoes, accessories, cookware, and home decor for next to nothing, so let me give you a few reasons why this Kohls is so special. 

#1- It's huge. This Kohls has 2 floors! There's an escalator and an elevator (for all you stroller/cart pushing people.) Since it's so big, each department is extremely well stocked and quite spacious. You don't feel overwhelmed and cramped like you might in smaller stores. Their makeup/beauty section is great, and I particularly love the home decor section at this location. (Seriously, try to say no to all the cute home stuff when it's 50% off AND you have a 30% off coupon!)

#2- Great selection. Since this Kohls is so big, you can often score harder to find items. Fyi, if you do need to find a particular something, you can look for it on the Kohls website or app, and it will let you know if they have it in stock. If you want to save time, you can go ahead and order it and then pick it up from customer service. You'll be in and out in less than 10 mins! Most of the time when I'm trying to locate an online item in store, this location is the one where I can find it. 

#3- Super friendly staff. I know a lot of Kohls has great staff, but uh, well, you know some are better than others, lol. This Kohls staff is very friendly, and if they see you walking around they'll say hello and ask if you need help finding anything. There are multiple checkouts throughout the store, so it helps keep the lines to a minimum. Even at chaotic holiday time, the staff are still pleasant and helpful. 

So there you have it! This is a great Kohls store, and I highly recommend it!",2017-05-26 19:27:52

the salon is difficult to find - its INSIDE the optima towers. you have to park underground and then walk up - and wander aimlessly around the beautiful garden atmosphere until you finally find the place.

the salon was clean, friendly, inviting, rather cramped though, i felt like everyone in there was watching me. which is fine if youre not a dyke getting a mohawk-like haircut in scottsdale. snobbery sucks. jaimie was my stylist and she did an awesome job, really thinned my hair out and gave me a fresh clip. usually stylists don't understand that my hair is thick and jewish, arizona is hot, and i don't want something heavy. jaimie found a good cut to fit my look.  i walked out of there totally satisfied.

my only qualms- $60 (plus tip) for a haircut is not something i can afford on a regular basis, seeing as how i've gotten pretty comparable cuts for much less (i have lots of gay friends who SURPRISE! cut hair) and I usually don't pay more than $40 or $45.  also, no refreshing beverage was offered to me on a sweltering day after a run around the optima like a crazed chicken looking for the place.",2009-05-28 17:37:46

The balloons were all handing out cheap candy.  And the ones that werent, or werent out of candy, had lines that were very long.

First off, I did not have any problem with customer service and everyone I encountered seemed friendly enough, especially the security.
The price was great, and if you plan on spending most of your time downtown, I think this is a good choice.
The area isn't too good, and there is a greyhound station literally right next to the hotel, but I did not feel unsafe here.
The room itself is outdated, which I expected, but it did seem like they had updated furniture since the last time I was there, which is nice.
The bathroom was ridiculously tiny, to the point where if you were using the toilet, you could barely fit in there with the door closed. 
Our room seemed clean, but after further inspection we found dried blood on the curtains, deep scratches on the doors, and sticky counters. I'm sure had we complained they would have given us a different room or cleaned it, but we were honestly too tired and the bed was clean so we just settled for it. 
The only other issue I had was the parking garage. You could only get there by taking one ridiculously slow elevator from inside the hotel. All of their elevators seem like they are on their last leg, but this one really struggles and I was pretty worried we were going to get stuck the few times I had to go in there. 
One thing to note, we actually had to leave Vegas early. I turned in our card keys and just explained that we were having to leave early and thanked them. I was quite surprised to see that they actually refunded the resort fees for our entire stay. That was very generous of them and I was not expecting that little gesture at all. 
Overall, this place is fine. I personally would probably prefer somewhere a little newer, but if you are trying to do Vegas cheap, I think the Plaza would work well for you. Some other reviews seem to state otherwise, but I appreciated that they went out of their way to refund the fees for us, and they were all very nice when we were there.",2017-11-08 01:56:15

Lobster Poutine: I love Lobster and I Love Poutines but i did Not love this lobster poutine. Sad but true. The dish was teeny TINY. The fries were skinny and not super hot. The cheese was rubbery, cold and NOT melted through. The pieces of lobsters were tiny and i'm not sure i tasted any of it. And i'm not sure there was much gravy on the poutine (which explains the cold, rubbery pieces of cheese curds) 
For $17...a great concept but not well-executed. Disappointing

Seared Scallops with carrot butter and green beans. 
Amazing. 
The scallops were perfectly seared and tasty. Wonderful flavor and i would have grazed on them all nite long. 

I had a taste of my friend's risotto and it was divine as well. 

Dessert: Deep-fried mars bar with a scoop of ice cream. 
Oh my. that's all i can say. 

The restaurant got a little smoky towards the end of our visit...i guess the ventilation in the kitchen could have been better. 
But overall, a great experience

Highly recommend for anyone visiting Montreal",2011-11-01 01:49:57

I felt that none were quite as good as the top sirloin which was included in the $30 option, as was the lamb which was nice as well.

It a hardwood floor (hybrid?), which was nice, instead of disgusting Vegas hotel carpeting. Plenty of space, clean, nice tv.  I've been to the Flamingo a number of times and have yet to get a back view.  The strip view is obviously the best but even the 'back' view isn't back, now, if you don't mind a big ass glowing Ferris wheel. 

However... BRING A POWERSTRIP!!  No, I'm serious. At least in my room, there was a severe lack of power outlets and the six plugs that were available were being used by their alarm clock, lamps, etc. So, you have to start unplugging their stuff.  I was trying to do some work with a computer, hard drive, etc., and I had to work with the lights unplugged. 

Maybe I haven't been to Vegas in a while but check-in is 4pm...FOUR. Super lame. You have to pay $15 extra to check in around 1 or 2... lame. I had to because I assumed, like most hotels, check in would be a normal time. 

Pool. Now, good and bad. If you want a nice quiet time, those days are gone.  I used to like the quiet pool and I'm not even that old, nice and big.  However, they turned it into a ""pool party"" now.  If you're into that, cool... but if you have kids, you're hosed, but I think it's only on the weekends.  There is still a normal little pool area for families but it's right next to the music.  Also, this could be good or bad... if you're self conscious about how you look with a shirt off or in a bikini - don't sweat it here - believe me.  This was like the, um... how do you say it in a nice way... ""blue collar"" crowd.  Super red lobster tans, bellies, drunk guy on the pedestal with a beer bucket on his head.  I had fun though.  

Parking is tight.  I went during the construction of the neighboring Cromwell and there were guards by the parking lot, asking if we were guests.  The guy interrogated me, asking for me key card, but as I hadn't checked in yet, I was about to dig out the paperwork... but he 'believed me' and let me pass.  Sucks if you wanna come here to gamble though.  And, I got one of the only remaining rooftop parking spots.  Hopefully they cleared that up by now though.

the food is exquisite...and another option for veg heads without settling for other restaurants where the only option is ""veggie burger"" or ""salad"". portions here tend to veer on the ""lesser is better"" option and we agree. they even offer vegan wine....a bit expensive, but the novelty was worth it however, i'll stick with water next time. overall, prices are reasonable for the food. 

so many options i can't even begin....ok, i was going to try but there is just too much. and.....there are options for meat eaters, like grass fed beef. all in all, i was very pleased with my meal...it was flavorful yet simple. like i said, another great option for those of us trying to care for our bodies.",2014-06-30 00:53:27

I've had the Italian Sausage sub, it was quite tasty and a lot of food on top of a serious Italian Roll.  Go for the wrap option if you are more interested in the meat.

Salads are by far the highlight for me.  They really pile on the veggies for $5!  Add chicken or steak for another $3, (good, but pretty obvious they had been strips in the freezer earlier that day).

f_HO0Sm7745pnXLbHR-9Iw,VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,3,6,0,1,"Once again, I just spent nearly two weeks staying at this hotel. Here's the state of the Flamingo today:

1. Now that the former Imperial Palace has undergone a massive makeover from casino to the rooms as the Linq, the Flamingo seems to be taking its place in the Caesars portfolio as the affordable dive on the strip. The Fab rooms look great, but you can tell that they money to refurbish ran out in the bathrooms. When the elevator stops on some floors you'll notice that the baseboards have been removed and some floors look older and more tired than others.

2. The elevators have become downright scary. Many have been redecorated except the control panels haven't been replaced. Some cabs have missing buttons for floors. Some cabs the floor lights up on one side and not the other. One cab's digital floor readout says ""2V"" and if you press a certain number of buttons it forgets what floors you've punched in and you have to press them all over again. During my stay entire banks of elevators failed during peak hours on a Saturday. They need to get these fixed quickly. The IP had a reputation for horrible elevators, but they were completely redone as the Linq. They need to do the same thing next door at the Flamingo, quickly.

3. Food options are dwindling at this hotel. They closed the coffee shop (I admit it, I miss the ladies who waited on me every morning for close to 10 years) and cut the hours of the buffet. After an underwhelming meal at the food court and an awful meal at Carlos & Charlie's, I ended up eating most meals at the Linq. I forgot all about Margaritaville until after I left, but it is one of the better restaurants at the hotel. The all night pizza joint next to the steakhouse now has more seating since the coffee shop has been shuttered.

4. The Total Rewards kiosk for checking in has been removed. At peak hours check-in lines can be long.

5. Housekeeping didn't service my room or the one next to me one day. They sent a housekeeper up to my room at midnight to service it. Whoops.

6. The pool is still pretty awesome.

Add it all up and you have a decent room for the price. This is far from one of the nicest hotels on the Strip, but it's well located and usually well priced. The Go rooms are more fun than the Fab rooms (but the Go rooms are starting to show their age) but for a place to lay your head it does the job. I found myself spending more time at the Linq because it's nicer, has better food, and is more fun. If you're on a budget, stay at Flamingo and play at the Linq. 

But if Caesars is reading these reviews, PLEASE fix the elevators at this hotel. You can skimp on other things, but you've got to do something about the elevators!",2015-04-18 14:24:00

The chicken is similar, as Lisa K. has said, but it has more of a heavy citrus flavor.  I think flavor-wise I like this roasted chicken better, but no one seems to be able to recreate the same unique crunchy skin that Zankou does, sadly.  They also do a really nicely done grilled chicken breast along with the roasted chicken.  It comes with a garlic spread that is pretty good but I am still partial to the paste that Zankou chicken has.  This was much much more creamy.

I echo what others have said, this is really moist chicken that blows El Pollo loco and pretty much every other roasted and most grilled chicken away in town.  They have a huge list of sides to go with the chicken, and most are really healthy.  This was probably the best health conscious and low-carb meal I have had so far, and one that I can even get my picky eater husband to enjoy.

Just look at their collection of positive reviews over the few short years. And the regular IG postings of Ninser_the_foodie when he stops by 3+ times a week, on his own, to grab a cup.

Brew Tea Bar is pretty much perfect. Except their typical long lines out the door, especially on super hot days that would normally keep most sane people to shelter indoor. So how do you improve on this business?

Open a new location!!! 

So that's exactly what happened. Today. Starting at 11am! In Henderson!!!

It is in the same Plaza as Taco y Taco and Twin Peaks on Eastern (just off the 215). So if you reside or work or hang out in the SE, there is no excuse not to stop by and grab a dessert tea to cool you down as we close out this summer (or have any of their teas served hot, besides the slushes of course, once the weather gets cold).

Even though this location is brand new. There are not a lot of tables and seating s to fill the entire ""dining"" area yet, and the crowds are not yet aware of this new location yet, the service is still efficient and great like their SW location.  They still want you to try their tea to make sure the sweetness is to your liking, if not they will remake it for you. But my Coconut Milk Te was good and required no further adjusting. But thank you for asking and referring me by my name too!  

Attention to the  little details and doing them right consistently by the entire crew here and at the original location is what made them so popular.

So consistency, personalized service for a quick service food business, reasonable price point and convenient location all adds up to a perfect 5 stars experience for me.

Btw, no more stamp cards. The new system just needs your phone number and the order will be credited to you once you completed your payment.

Our server seemed as if she was still new or still in training as she kept saying ""...hmm I haven't tried that one yet"" and ""I'll ask someone in the back for you"". 
Nothing wrong with being new, in fact she was great! She was very friendly and had a great personality. 

I ordered the Daytona Beach and Garlic Parm sauce on the side. For those of you who like a good smokey, chipotle,  bar-b-que flavour with a kick, Daytona Beach is for you. 
I also really like the Garlic Parm sauce as it had an incredible buttery with a hint of garlic and parmesan.

I'm definitely going to come back and try the other flavours!",2017-03-16 14:39:06

With the temperature hovering between 'I want to stay indoors and starve than go out'  to 'there's no way I'm getting out in this weather',  the craving for something hot and spicy gets to me.  I have been on the quest for a decent ramen for awhile now and the good ones are located downtown,  which I am not willing to consider at this point. 

So here I am,  expecting just a mediocre bowl of hot noodle soup,  a chunk or two of meat and an MSG buzz.  But boy,  was I surprised.  I wasn't expecting this hole in the wall to serve very good Ramen,  comparable to Momofoku.  I ordered the spicy one,  and chose the level 2 spice.  The broth was rich and had a good kick,  noodles were just the right chewiness ,  and the BBQ meat was tender and flavourful.  

I was in tears with the spice but I couldn't help but finish the broth as it was that good. Server was very attentive and kept refilling my tea,  which helped alleviate the spiciness.  

I will definitely be back to try other menu items. One Ramen combination that seems interesting is the bacon and cheese.  That I'd have to try very soon.",2014-12-04 02:39:12

I don't know why it would take an hour for us to get our food if our reservation was for 2. Now I know to prepare for an hour wait before expecting to eat.  

On top of that the rest of our service was horrible. Whoever our server was, was not around. My kids ordered drinks and needed waters but never got any. My boyfriend and I had waters that were empty right after the rice was served until the end of the meal. Never once were we offered a refill. We were a party of 4 and 2 of us ordered the white rice vs the fried. 2 of us ended up with no rice at all because our server never brought the white rice. Then to top it off all four of our meals included ice cream. Our server magically appeared at the end of our meal only to hand us checks. Never got our ice cream either.

This place has been at the corner of  Athabasca and Yonge St., ever since i was a little one and it is still a family run place more or less.

Their pita bread is good, nice and chewy, and it makes me wonder if they use the same base for their pizza, since I see a lot of neighborhood people ordering their pizza, we keep meaning too - but we keep going back  to their souvlaki pitas.

Their Greek salad is good from what I have had, since we have to skip the olives (due allergies) and their Caesar is good too, using more like a vinaigrette rather than a creamy base. 

Even at it's busiest, the noise level never really reaches above a murmer, so it's also a great place for a no fuss, quiet meal.

I'm not sure if all the theaters have those seats, but I did ask the box office guy if you could pick your seats in all theaters and he said, ""yes!""

Well, I don't know if Lancaster's Bar-Ba-Lo's were the first, but they sure are the best!  The wings are always meaty and dripping with loads of sauce.  Of course you always have the option to ask for them extra crispy.  Me personally, I love them how they come.  

*Kid's cheeseburger is legit - very cost effective, yet filling.  It comes with fries.  
*Cobb and Maui Salads are excellent.  I usually add a hard-boiled egg onto each.
*BBQ sandwich is good, comes with a side of BBQ sauce (vinegar) and slaw.  
*I have never had the brisket personally, but I've been told by coworkers that its phenomenal. 

To me, its better to take your food and go if you have that option available. Sometimes the waitress service can be spotty and it can take a while to get your meal during lunch time.  The to-go area is always quick and the service is always great.

A different front desk gal changed our check-out time from 11am to 1pm without making me feel I was asking for her first born the way other hotel employees make me feel. 

Spacious rooms. Reminded me of condo living with tons of closet space, kitchen counter, sizable fridge, modern art. Comfy-enough beds. Great temperature without having to fuss with thermostat. 

Amenities aren't impressive. Soap left a weird, velvety residue on my hands, & shower gel/shampoo aren't super high end, but I liked the sleek, black packaging. Large shower. Toilet enclosed in its own glass room. 
 
Fantastic pool! Humongous, less than 4 feet all the way across, warm, clean. Pool area is surrounded by cozy beds & plenty of lounge chairs, but had no showers. 

Loved not having to walk through a smoky casino. 

$29/day resort fee, a fee most hotels charge now. I assume this fee covers wifi, free water bottles, & the cool keurig machine.

The warm hostess (who is also the daughter of Chef mom), greeted us to take drink orders. Unfortunately, they do not have Ethiopian honey wine (deliciousness in a glass!), though they do have a lovely light Ethiopian beer (think Hefeweizen). The group of us ordered pretty much everything on the menu. Meals are served in a large stainless silver dish lined with injera (Ethiopia's version of a tortilla, but much softer and spongier). The meat-eaters raved about the lamb, while the herbivores (moi included!) delighted in the vegetarian combo (the yellow lentils and stewed chickpeas stole the show!) Why not 5 stars, you ask?

1. It's an upscale hotel with pool, not a resort.
2. Very little privacy, you can hear everything going on in the rooms around you. 
3. Be prepared for uncompromising management and additional fees not listed on your reservation. 

Booked room with ""lagoon view"" for about $200,  or bad. Upon arrival I'm told there is a $90 incidental fee which was never mentioned until now. Upon arriving to our room we were exited to check out the view, which turned out to be the back of a shed with rocks all around - no landscaping.
We thought maybe it's a mistake. No, apparently being in the general area of the pools passes for a Lagoon view room. They offered another room on the second floor which would have been fine, but management told us to leave and come back. What kind of resort actually tells its customers to leave? Perhaps $5 off lunch at your property would have been helpful?

 After settling for what we got and being fine with it, I thought laying down might be nice. Immediately you can feel springs in your back and popping sounds as you move. Unacceptable even for a Super 8. Be prepared for a sleepless night as drunk college kids are likely to keep you up until 3AM.

Although I've never visited their original locations in Jersey and Philadelphia, I heard through the grapevine how delicious their ice and custards were. So when I realized there was one in Arcadia, I was excited to stop in for a taste! Let me say that I was more than pleased with the ice! 

The lovely ladies were more than eager to give me samples of the different flavors (that rotate throughout the month) and they said that the flavors tasted exactly like their name. Swedish Fish? We'll see if the taste matches the flavor, I thought, and wow! I seriously felt like I was eating a Swedish Fish minus the chewiness. The flavor was exactly like the candy. Cotton Candy and S'mores followed suit and tasted exactly like their names as well! It's pretty unbelievable considering it's an ice! 

With every spoonful, I felt immediately refreshed and learned that it has something to do with how the ice's are made. Instead of using ice and adding flavor, they make the flavor with liquid and then freeze it to make the ice. This is why the flavors are so fresh! 

After tasting several flavors, I ended up leaving with a cup of a combination of cherry and lemonade. The flavors complimented each other wonderfully and it was the perfect way to continue my day without melting in the heat!

All the sales people work on commission so once the sale is done they no longer care about you, it's not their problem.


We bought 4 items, a desk, a dresser, a serving hutch and a chair.  The chair was the only item that had to be ordered because they did not have it in the store.  I was told it would be in on Tuesday and they would call...NO CALLS.

I called and talked to a guy who answered and said my salesman would be arriving to work in about 30 minutes and they would have him follow up and call me....NO call.

I then called a on Wednesday and talked to the store manager who said he would check with the warehouse and get back to me and yes that is correct, NO CALL.

Now almost two weeks from the day I orders this chair I call and the salesman was really nice and clearly said, we are busy and we work on commission so if I stop to look into this its taking my time away from a sale.

I did explain that I understand that none of this was his fault as he had nothing to do with this from the start through today when he picked up the phone so to not take anything I say personally as it is not directed towards him, I just needed to know if the chair is there or If I need to come in get
My money back and go somewhere else to buy the chair.  I told him I talked to the manager and everything I had dealt with and he said let me see what's going on.  I gave him the invoice number he looked it up and said it shows two in the warehouse, that my salesman was with a customer right now but he will have him call me back.  We will see.  As of now though, it's hard to recommend this store as a place to go because it's all commission driven and you are nothing more then the next sale and forgotten.  

Even the store managers could care less about you once the sale is done.  They run things like a timeshare sale.  When you buy a manger comes over to say thank you and them they kick you to the curb....next...",2016-11-26 18:45:22

Then the server said they were out of Jack and Gentleman's Jack and my only option was single barrel at $15 a drink. So finally went with a specialty drink that tasted watered down. As I started looking at the menu I learned they are a whiskey bay with like 30 types of bourbon starting at like $4. And my only option was single barrel at $15?

Came time we to order food and our waiter was nowhere to be found. After a good 10 minutes he came by and I ordered the brisket with Mac n cheese and loaded potato.

Food is nothing special.

I had a burger and the ground chuck was not juicy or flavorful. The egg bun tasted fresh and was just the right amount of bun. The California side salad (extra) was delicious with candied pecans. 

My friend's chicken parmigiana was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Noodles were tossed in butter or olive oil with a bit of garlic. 

I checked out their nutritional information menu online as I like to eat healthy when I can and everything is very high in salt (sodium). It is nice to be able to see how many calories are in each item but there are very few healthy options unless you go with a salad with nothing tasty in it and then why pay so much for it?

I just had it again over the weekend as I was craving for some onion rings but it left me quite disappointed.  It's a shame because the cook was very kind and the place is literally right around the corner from where I live so it would've been very convenient.  Not sure if it was just the cook or what but I'm really hoping that they'd improve. 

Classic Rock - The most basic burger they have with a single patty.  The patty this time around was bland and dry.  The burger itself was quite bland considering all the toppings added.  I've definitely had way better burgers for a fraction of the price.  2/5

Onion Rings - Came here specifically because I was craving onion rings and I was again disappointed.  The batter was incredibly thick that I honestly don't even know if I even got any onions.  Because the batter was thick, it was very greasy.  Onion rings shouldn't be THAT greasy.  I've had thicker rings with big rings of onions that weren't as greasy.

Then we received our meals and all was well with the world. I had the lamb with Serrano chile sauce that was so good I wanted to throw my plate across the room! All meals excellent.

Then, in keeping with the evening, the server, though our plates were cleared, didn't come back to the table for a very long time. We again flagged someone down to find him so we could get our check and leave. At that point we were frustrated and skipped dessert. 

I have the utmost respect for Mr. Flay. The food was fantastic. The service unfortunately lived far below the reputation his name should engender.

Warning, DO NOT go when it's crowded (holidays or weekends) or you will truly miss out on seeing it's charm. To clarify Scarborough bluffs is comprised of several different parks. Here's a link to see all the parks that comprise ""The Bluffs"" http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=0519dada600f0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD

So many photo ops abound - nature trails, a bridge, beach, marina, bluffs, birds, benches...Lots of things to do like hiking, fishing, grilling (there are bbq grills and picnic benches set up throughout the parks), biking and just strolling. The trails connect you to the marina, beach and bluffs which has a beautiful view of Lake Ontario (water is clear and in some areas you can see different shades of blue). 

Make sure to take off your shoes and take a walk on the beach. There's nothing more relaxing than being by the beach, hearing the sound of the waves and burying your feet into the soft sand ahhhhh. Bring your volleyball net and set it up with the available poles. Beach volleyball is an even better workout than regular vball plus you get a soft place to land if you dive for a ball. 

They have paid parking but you can walk your way down to the park if you're up to it. There are friendly cops that patrol the area but do not get on their bad side by not paying for parking or feeding the birds, you will get a ticket. Me and my friends did chase after the birds though, made me feel like a kid again.

My roomies have been here every week since it opened and I'm a little late to the game BUT, I have been here twice in a week. So, it's happening. 


Food -- the marinade on the food is super bomb. Spicy isn't too spicy and super perfect sweet and saltiness. Lots of pork and beef dishes. 
If there's one thing I wish they had, I wish it was gyutongue! It's my fave KBBQ meat! 
Not the best place for veggie eaters although the banchan are bomb!!! 
Banchan is next level. Some I've never tried before. The cold radish soup or whatever that is is new. I'm not sure whether to drink it but, I surely eat it. The kimchee is my favorite & I don't normally care for kimchee...prolly bcuz most places make it super spicy and hard to eat. Their kimchee is more vinegary than anything :) 
Pancakes are great for the grill :) 
Always get the corn cheese. Treat yourself. 

Alcohol -- great price for each soju bottle. Gotta try that peach soju. 

Atmosphere -- inside feels like you're eating outside lol maybe some street vendor in another country? Grill is the best. They change out the grill often depending on what's the best way to cook the meat. They have a GREAT way of sucking up the grill smoke, too. Adjustable for the workers to do their job yet, just enough to stop the smoke from heading your way. 

Workers -- super friendly and on it with whatever your heart desires. You want the sesame oil, you got it. You want more banchan, you got it. There's the buttons on the side for you to press if you need service, your check, or etc! 

Price -- not all you can eat but, way RIDICULOUSLY reasonable.
Last night 8 of my friends and I ordered couple large combos and a small one. Few bottles of soju and cheese corn. And our bill was less that $300; hence around $35 each. CRAZY CHEAP!!! Especially since we were all so stuffed and had some leftovers!

This place is located in hipster Kensington and since I was headed that way anyways, we decided to try it out. 

Anyways, when I walked in, I already loved the vibe, It's very chill with a beautiful bar, loud but not overly loud music, long tables with bench seating, and friendly faces. The menu was a little hard to navigate because I didn't quite know what some of the items were... no description available. But let me just say this. GET THE BABY BACK RIBS. JUST DO IT. It's so crazy good! And the wings.. LOVE! We also got the watermelon and feta salad, which I'm not really a fan of just because I don't like the strong smell of feta. And the macaroni and cheese was pretty good but got too heavy after the first few bites. The drinks here are strong. I got one whisky drink and you don't have to wonder where the alcohol went in this place. It's in my cup!! I could totally feel it after a few sips. Or maybe that's just how they do it in Calgary. Anyways, fantastic meal for 3 for under $100 with drinks. Highly recommend!",2017-11-09 04:04:15

Not only do I love the location (Crowfoot NW, by all my friends) but I love the restaurant itself.  It has a nice ambiance inside, with a lounge area and gorgeous patio for the summer!  The lounge has plenty of high stools and tables, which I love, but also has booths and chairs by the bar.

I'll admit that the cost of drinks might be a little higher than say Boston Pizza, but i think it's fair.  They have a bunch of their own beer... in fact, that's all they serve.  You can't get Keith's or Canadian at this place.  Only Brewsters brewed beer.  It's pretty neat.  My favourite is the blueberry beer they have... which comes with blueberries in it.  Very yummy!

They have a nice selection on their food menu as well.  They offer a different variety of pizzas and appetizers... stuff you don't usually see.  I love the dumplings they have, which come with a lovely dip!

The staff are always so cool, too.  One guy we had, who was serving our table of twelve, had a little trouble keeping the drinks straight but made up for it by bringing us a couple of free jugs.  I'll let slide a couple of missed drinks for free jugs... anytime!

So, yeah!  That's why I love Brewsters in Crowfoot.  It's a great place for family or friends!",2009-10-29 03:03:05

I think there were about 15 of us, so it took awhile for everyone's food to come out. When our gluten-free pizza came, we dug right in. We were really hungry! Our pizza came with four toppings - garlic, mushrooms, chicken, and something else which I forgot. :) It was pretty good! My hiking partner encountered a green pepper on one of the slices though (not one of our toppings). The person next to us had a calzone and it was huge!

GXV1ecOTCK6lvKGqdHkfgg,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,k8F_QpUeKIRu72skzZiDAg,3,10,7,9,"My philosophy on life is to try to live it as an adventure. On my days off from work, I try to escape to a park to enjoy an outside adventure. But there are only a certain number of days that I am off that I can partake in outside adventure. And so, on workdays I enjoy the inside adventures that a well-written book brings to my mind. The Whitney Library is one of the many trailheads of the Clark County Library System to board these literary hikes into the inside adventures. 

   The Whitney Library is the closest Clark County public library to the City of Henderson. It is small one story building abutting the south of Tropicana Avenue between Nellis Boulevard and Boulder Highway. 

   Because this is the closest Clark County Public Library to my apartment, I have made this my home library. The neat thing about the Clark County Library System is that the borrower can request a book from a distant branch that the library will deliver to the home library as a hold. The majority of the time I will stop here when I get in the mood for a certain subject or CD. 

   The Whitney Library has a decent selection in a small well maintained public space. I see it as a Seven Eleven for picking up written adventures.  My written adventures of choice are non fiction with a focus in biographies, rock n roll, travelogues, U.S. history, and miscellaneous subjects. The first book shelf when you walk in to the right of the book return holds new books. The library is up to the times with new books. Just recently they had the new released Bee Gees biography when it hit the press. On the way to the non-fiction section at the end of the rectangular library are the shelves holding DVDs, drawers holding CDs from Beethoven to Elton John. To the left are the computers and kid library. Deeper into the library, shelves hold volumes of fiction adventures. Beyond the fiction books are the shelves holding non-fiction adventures. This is where I spend the most time deciding what to read. 

   In comparison to the sundry of libraries that I have spent time in, the selection of non-fiction books is decent. I would estimate that one side of an aisle is dedicated to music books that features books written about Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Frank Sinatra. The majority are relatively up to date. Regardless that I fail to find a biography on Walt Disney here, the selection of performing arts books is decent. The US history and travelogue section could use more substance. I have visited the library wanting to take home an adventure on the Colorado River or a walk in the Appalachian Mountains to leave empty handed. On the other hand they have a decent selection on President biographies from President Washington to President Obama. It has always been in the back of my mind that I could get on the digital card catalog to request a book. 

  The Whitney Library is more than books. It is a place that I visit to pick up a classic CD. When I read about Billy Joel for example, the written pages get me in the mood for the music. And the Whitney Library stocks up on sufficient CDs that have improved the soundtrack of my life. 

  Surprisingly, the Whitney Library offers an impressive selection of WWE DVDs. On my last visit, I saw a rack dedicated to WWE DVDs. 

  Complimenting a decent library is a decent staff. This is a library that I have been calling to renew my books when they are close to being overdue. The person on the other end of the phone has usually been friendly and helpful. 

  The Whitney Library may not be a palace holding books but it is certainly a decent trailhead to follow the written adventures of a well-written book. In the future it is a trailhead I intend to return to.",2015-05-28 04:31:10

My boyfriend got some kind of coffee or mocha flavored one--it was good, but I really don't care for coffee flavored stuff like he does. He loved it though. Still raves about it (He was a Main Street Cupcake newbie). He insisted he was only going to eat half of his cupcake, and then have the other half the next day. Yeah no. He ate all of his and almost half of mine! It is definitely decision of the day when you go in there, unless your craving certain flavor...so many options.

Between the four of us, we tried two different paninis, some wine, the raspberry-lime-lemonade (OMG), a latté and an espresso.

At 4 p.m. on a Saturday, we had a 20-minute wait so went around the corner to the Phi Centre to check out the art installations. We found the restaurant quite crowded and noisy -- that's what you get at a (deservedly) popular spot, I guess.

John (the manager) is an awesome guy.

We ordered the Mac & Cheese appetizer off of the happy hour menu which was around $5 and normally is about $8 - decent savings.  It was very good.  We forgot to request the optional bacon in it, so we will give that a go next time!  It was delicious with out it though.

For main course I had the Western Burger and my fiancee had the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Both of the buns were a touch dry - but the meat on both sandwiches was very nicely done.  The coleslaw on the pulled pork was a touch too tart for him, but if you like more tart coleslaw this may be right up your alley.

I guess I'm used to having a lot more mushrooms on veal marsala.

I've been making that dish for about 30 years and I've never heard of it with Alfredo sauce but I have to admit  she gave me a taste of it and it was delicious.

Earl Grey Frozen Cotton Candy: 5/5
The cost is $4.25 for about a 14 oz cup of shaved ice. The flavoring is delicious! It has a good balance of earl grey flavoring and sugar.

I think this should be in your ""Unique Foods To Try Bucket List"" for sure because it is so weird. The gelatin part does not really have any flavor, but the fresh strawberry and lychee is what made the rain drop cake. On the plate with the cake, Loftti Cafe provides dipping sauces of chocolate and strawberry. I think if you're looking a ""healthy"" dessert, the rain drop cake is what you should order because from what I could tell it's just fruit, gelatin, and dipping sauce.

I was a frequent flyer of this place when it first opened, mostly because for a year this nice little bistro who offered buy one get one free sushi rolls. As someone who should probably open her own sushi restaurant to get a return on my investment, anytime I can save cash on sushi is a plus.

A while back the restaurant management changed and switched the deal to buy one get one half off. I understand this a business with profits to make so it didn't upset me but left my sushi-loving soul disappointed. Yet, I only dined here a good bit due to price and not quality... and even though the rolls the discounted, the prices are a bit higher so not truly snagging a discount. The sushi isn't bad by any means but not memorable - nothing that blows me away. At Ru Sans I covet the Firecracker roll. At Sushi 101, I always snag the Sir Justin roll. But I have yet to find an amazing roll at Akahana. Pretty average sushi here with no special sauces, ingredients or anything that makes me crave this eatery.

However, props to the bistro for the atmosphere. It's a sleek, modern design with plenty of room between the booths and tables so you're not invading anyone's personal space. Upon walking in, you're greeted with a waterfall trickling down a tall glass panel that almost hits the ceiling... nice touch. We've always been seated promptly at the restaurant and service is more times than not good. Never had bad service, just slow... and last time I never got my requested side of aioli... blasphemy.

The menu has lots of appealing options, but none impressed. From best to worst:
Popcorn Chicken = winner of the night, best thing we tried.
Baba Ghanoush with Plantain Chips = decent, this would be a great thing to nibble on over drinks.
Plate O Bacon = decent, as it was simply bacon with maple syrup drizzled over it. would be hard to get that wrong.
Butter Chicken Wings = tiny wings that flavour wise did not remind me of butter chicken
Lamb Lollipop = a single bone from a rack of lamb, that was light on meatyness and was overcooked and dry
Double with Pork Belly = too much chickpea, not enough flavour

One thing that also displeasing is that there were 2 different sources of music, meaning that anyone sitting near the curtain dividing off the 2 halfs of the room would have to deal with competing and clashing sounds. I think I was the only one to notice but it did bug me til I had enough pints to focus my attention on the food.

The last block from Las Vegas Blvd to the El Cortez is a little sketchy late at night, but it's unlikely you'd have any problems, and there is a security guard in front of the Cortez 24/7 looking towards Las Vegas Blvd.

Most of the patrons are old and crusty.  The bartenders and cocktail waitresses have been around the block a few times, and most of them are very nice.

As I've gotten older, I've become more of a downtown Vegas guy:
--- The casinos are closer together
--- There's not a mass of humanity on the streets and sidewalks, like on the strip.
--- If you don't feel like gambling, you can just grab a drink for $3 or $4 and bullshit with some old bartender
--- Crazy people are more likely to hang out downtown and crazy people usually have good stories to tell
--- The seediness doesn't really bother me anymore

My expectations were fairly low being how close this place is to Memorial Library, but I give Roast a high recommendation, especially in comparison to other sandwich and burger options near campus.

The brisket sandwich was a little on the small side for its hefty $9 (with fries) price tag. I understand that they're using one of the top local meat suppliers but it's about $2 too high for the serving. That said, it was delicious. Genuinely -- I'd eat it again and again. The beer braise was perfect and the meat was tender and not too fatty. 

The roasted eggplant sandwich was good and quite hearty for a vegetarian serving. Fries were excellent, by far the best next to campus. Their nacho fries was huge and features fries that somehow outshined their rich toppings, which is pretty rare.",2012-12-09 01:14:51

I've never tried poutine and I got excited when I heard about this place offering a vegetarian version. Everyone was super friendly here and we (friend and I) both thought the dish was pretty tasty. We added hot sauce to it because we felt it needed an extra kick. Since I've never had poutine before, I have no point of comparison but I appreciated the veg version with the mushroom gravy, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions.

I actually had a laundry list of items and the appointment with Jesse was for the early afternoon. When Jesse finished up his previous job ahead of schedule, he called first and asked if it was okay to show up a few hours early and get started. I sincerely appreciate the respect for my time, because it is typically a pet peeve of mine when people show up unexpectedly early, so bonus points for that!

As to the work itself, I needed to have two heavy (100+ lbs.), one-piece, high-end toilets installed, a new kitchen faucet, new angle stops/valves and supply lines throughout. Jesse jumped right into it with the toilets and was able to get the old, builder-grade units out and the new toilets in very short order. His installation was meticulous and it was quite obvious that he took a great deal of pride in his work. Once the toilets were out of the way, Jesse also did a masterful job of removing the old kitchen faucet, thoroughly cleaning up the porcelain mounting surface and installing the new faucet and hot/cold supply valves. 

While Jesse worked quickly, it was clear to me from the outset that his efficiency was a byproduct of his extensive experience and that there was absolutely no compromise in the quality of his work. I also very much enjoyed my conversation with Jesse during the install and greatly appreciated his insights for future plumbing projects that I picked his brain about.

When it was all said and done, I felt the price paid for the work was very reasonable, certainly with the level of care and attention to detail that Jesse had put into it. Having dealt with a number of plumbers over the last decade, I can honestly say this was the best interaction I have ever had and that I would not hesitate in the slightest to call Sav-On and Jesse again for future needs.  No nonsense, no up-selling and no bullshit, just a highly skilled plumber with pride in both his work and his employer, who showed up and got the job done right. I could not in good conscience leave anything less than five stars. Thank you Jesse!",2018-06-21 05:32:39

Our friend had heard about Velveteen Rabbit, but had never been there before, when we first checked it out last year. We had so much fun that we made some return visits on our most recent Vegas trip. 

Velveteen Rabbit is definitely not on the radar of your average visitor to Las Vegas as it is in the old downtown area, far away from the Strip. It's located on Main Street, which is currently under major reconstruction. The wife likes consignment shops and the like so we usually visit the Buffalo Exchange across the street and there are several other places that we like to visit in old Vegas, like Goodwich for a sandwich or Makers and Finders for coffee. I would say that the majority of people that go here are locals that live nearby. 

Velveteen Rabbit definitely has its own vibe with a traditional long wooden bar to go along with several antique couches and chairs, etc. They usually have some funky music playing and they even had some live music one night that we visited. I just noticed that I've made it this far into the review and haven't mentioned their signature item, their drinks! We usually wind up in Las Vegas at the same time every year, so we have only experienced the Fall menu. I presume that means there are 3 other seasonal menus that we have yet to experience. Life goals, I guess. The menu is a collaborative effort from all the mixologists on staff, and in the end, the drinks are for the vast majority all delicious and you will try something new or some strange combination that you would never have tried before. Or they can make you a rum and coke if that's what you really want, but you should really try  something from their menu. I believe that we tried the whole seasonal menu this time between the three of us and all but one of the drinks was a winner. Cheers to many happy returns.",2017-12-06 01:21:10

We heard about this place having good fish tacos so we decided to check it out.  When we get there, it is pretty clean and the setup is comparable to other taco shops.  They have music from Hawaii playing over the system and the decor is made to look like you are in hut on the islands.

We are greeted at the counter with an Aloha.  The waitress could be from Hawaii but I am not sure.  I then place an order for 2 fish tacos, a fish and chips, a Ceaser Salad with grilled fish, and a kids fish and chips.  I also use the check-in deal for the Coconut Shrimp appetizer and 2 beers.  After the order, I ask her who's idea was to take this from Maui and open it up here.  She couldn't understand me initially due to my pidgin accent but she eventually got it and pointed me to the asst manager Adam who gave me the breakdown.  I told him this place doesn't really look like home but the prices remind me of Hawaii.

We sit down and notice the tables are shaped like surfboards which was cool.  To my surprise Adam comes back and gives us a plate of poke and fresh taro chips.  Super Mahalo to Adam for that.  Shortly after, the rest of the food comes.  The poke was goos but the taro chips were awesomeness.  They shave it and fry it there then lightly salt it.  The kids loved it.  The Coconut Shrimp was also good and had a little heat to it.  My tacos were filled with so much that I could hardly bite it.  Once I did get my mouth around the monster, I was impressed with all the flavor.  The cabbage tasted fresh and gave it a different texture.  The fish were large chunks and the sauce not to overpowering.  The surprising part was the ripe mango chunks on top.  I am really not a fan of ripe mango but this gave it a fresh taste to the taco as if it was cleaning the pallet for the next bite.  

The family liked their orders.  My son didn't like the fish grilled but finished it anyway.  The ladies also finished their fried fish and only left a handful of fries.

We usually have a great time here!  The buffet is ok.  Not great for the money.  The M is much better food and food quality.  However, The Grand Cafe is a GREAT option!  Wonderful food and great service at great prices.  We usually just go there.  Table games are great and there are plenty of options.  The reason they don't get 5 stars is that's very tough to get drink service while playing slots.  Very slow and not attentive, also the $25 ""resort fee"" is a stinker.  Just tell me what the price is and quit adding stuff.  Not cool.  Overall, you'll have fun here.",2013-10-28 21:30:31

The hubby and I were looking for a good pizza place to try and this popped up on yelp nearby...SO we learned how it worked before we went in...
Basically you build your own pizza with unlimited toppings or none for the same price. One size,but its a big one, I couldn't finish one on my own.
We bought two: Diavola sauce, fresh and shredded mozzarella, chorizo, pepperoni, fresh basil, bell pepper...and the other was the stock Bianca. Both were amazing.

One time I had put something on hold for over night which they were doing favor for me saying will only hold till noon next day. I called them at 11:55am politely saying I was on the way and as promised to come back to pick it up. The bossy lady shouted at me:""haha I will give you 5 minutes, u don't make it here they ate going to the floor"" - HANG UP on me. It was aweful. Aft that I didn't go back for a month! The employees were all looking scared as if working under a strict boss in Soviet Union.

The  cute nice black young dude employee kept telling me no worry n he swept up the puppy pee. I kept apologizing he kept saying it's okay. I was moved by that. 

The employees at fitting room and jewelry area are also nice too .

We noticed about 5 or 6 different restaurants along that side of the Arboretum. Most of the places had their menus on the outside and nothing really appealed to us. This place kind of had a cool looking sign so we walked in and asked to see a menu. The ladies at the front of the restaurant were so welcoming. We decided to go ahead and stay for dinner. My husband ordered a ying ling... and they served it in a ""COLD GLASS""  how awesome is that?! For an appetizer we got the crab ragoon, which I have to say was excellent. Normally from take-out Chinese places it's usually frozen and deep fried on ordering. These weren't the usual triangle crab ragoons that you see at most places, but the blossom ones. Super Yummy! They serve them with some duck sauce. 

For entrees he got Mee Goreng which he loved. I thought it tasted like there was some dill in it. Not a big dill fan myself, but he loved it. I got my favorite which of course is a Pad Thai. Very yummy. Their Pad Thai is very plain though not a lot of extras. The food was delicious and we'll be back again for sure, but I LOVED the service!!

We had the all you can eat, and for the most part, it did not disappoint.  I really want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't.  To start, you can order several dishes at a time, and they bring them out as they are prepared.  I really REALLY liked this.  It allows you to relax instead of constantly planning your next move.

It's odd to say, but fortunately Hakkasan only suffers from that third one.

The interior is really one gigantic space, but seems like a big labyrinth with multiple rooms and halls due to the tall partitions set up throughout.  There are many dining tables and a bar tucked away in the back.  Some drinks were creative, others were easily available elsewhere, but they'll all run you $15-$20 each.

The menu has many appetizers, sides, and entrees to choose from, as well as a few tasting menus available, which require four people in your party to order.  For a party of six, we ordered four tasting menus and a few other dishes to round out our meal.  For a set menu that is meant for four, it comes with a surprising amount of food that easily filled up the six of us.  Nothing was disappointing, but the standouts for me were the crispy duck salad (they do not skimp on the portions here, if you enjoy duck, get this dish), duck with truffle oil (again, good portions), and the wagyu beef stir fry.

The food was well prepared, in generous portions, and left all of us feeling satisfied.  The part that makes Hakkasan hard to recommend is the pricing.  The tasting menu we ordered was $118 per person, and most dishes are $30 each.  Total for our meal was over $1,000, which is ridiculous for six people eating Chinese food.  Fortunately, and the main reason we came, we were able to enjoy a promotion that got us 50% off our entire bill.  In the end it was around $80 per person, which is much more reasonable, but arguably still a lot.

The pricing at Hakkasan makes it hard place to wholeheartedly recommend, but unlike other Asian restaurants on the Strip you'll actually end up with a good meal if you decide to spend the money here.",2013-12-31 19:34:12

When we arrived at Copper, I was actually quite impressed with the interior of the house. It's well appointed and has a romantic atmosphere...you know, if you're into that sort of thing. We were seated quickly at a great table on the ""porch"" and the server even checked my coat for me. That's about where my positive comments will stop, so if you're a die hard Copper fan, you should probably stop reading.

It took about 5 minutes for us to get water, about 10 minutes after that to place our wine order, and approximately 10 more minutes for the wine to actually arrive. Fortunately, it was delicious, unfortunately, our server literally stood there and read the entire back of the wine bottle after pouring it for us...awkward, he then walked away from the table before we were able to place our food order and came back about 10 minutes later to take it. We both went for the standard Indian fare; he chose the murgh (chicken) tikka masala and I chose the chicken chettinadu. We also got plain and garlic naan and the veg samosas.

The samosas arrived are were really quite good, not greasy at all. However, there were only 2 and they were $7. I know Copper is an upscale joint, so I expected the prices, but $7 for 2 veg samosas seems a bit unreasonable to someone who has eaten Indian food before. I think the naan was $3 for 6 quarter rounds, I think you get quite a bit more for your money at other places, but all in all, it was tasty and worth the $3.

Our food finally arrived (it really took a long time considering Indian food is always pre-prepared and just has to be ladled into bowls, probably about 25-30 minutes). The best way for me to describe both of our entrees would be ""Meh."" Perhaps they're catering to a more ""upscale crowd"" or just to the masses, but the curries were hardly spicy at all and there were quite literally, only, at most, 10 small chunks of chicken in each of our bowls. I love going to Indian restaurants and being able to select my spice level, but that's not the case at Copper. You get standard, mild, American curry whether you like it or not (maybe you can ask for spicier?). I also LOVE the left-overs you typically get at an Indian restaurant. ""Free"" lunch the next day is probably one of the best parts! The portions here are quite small, so don't expect lunch. 

Aside from being totally average, the chicken tikka masala was $17. Let me repeat that, SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. For a child's portion of chicken tikka masala. My chicken chettinadu was $19, for an equally child-like portion. I suppose if you've never eaten Indian food anywhere else and have a money-tree in your yard, this is probably a great deal. However, I got got by Copper. Our check for 2 entrees, naan, one appetizer and a bottle of wine (one of the cheapest on the list) was $120. For super average Indian food. Bummer.

I realize, from other reviews, that people REALLY love Copper. Like, are OBSESSED with it. I, however, cannot join the masses and sing the praises of Copper, it's just not that good and it's incredibly over-priced. Granted, they have to pay for that super swanky East Blvd. address, but the food is nothing to go crazy over. My recommendation: Save your money and hit a hole in the wall place where $20 will get you enough food for 3 days, will actually have some flavor to it, and you'll get more service than you probably even want (and all the yummy freebies the hole in the wall places give you to snack on!).",2012-01-04 19:58:16

Cute place. Food, not so 'cute'

I was a little disappointed with the food here. I read the reviews, and was very excited about trying this place. We ordered a ton of food and I was unimpressed.  

Breads are yummy goodness! Another bread basket please! :)

The bacon biscuits were good, but I think ours were a little dry that night, maybe will give it another chance next time.

Tried to order the grape salad, out, so...
Chopped salad looks like a 5 year old threw some iceberg lettuce on the plate, but when you eat it it grows on you a little, it has a lot of sweet veggies and they also tossed in some micro pieces of caramelized sugar oats? A little surprising, but not bad.  Dressing is on the bland side.

Chicken pate is decent.  This is another dish that grows on you.  It is a very chunky pate speckled with veggies.  It is great when you eat it with the roasted red peppers and cheese that come on the plate.

Sausage and polenta, meh. I've had better.  It's good, but nothing to knock your socks off.

Matzo ball soup-bland, uninteresting and beyond mediocre. It is also a ridiculously large portion.

The osso bucco on the menu is a fraud.  It isn't osso bucco at all.  I understand the concept of the restaurant, so I wasn't expecting a completely traditional dish, but come on,  the meat was a bit dry and was saturated with an anise flavor which is not what comes to mind when I'm thinking osso bucco.  Can we get a hint of a tomato based sauce here? 

Chile pork stew.  Very heavy  flavors, concentrated sauce, not really my thing.  Cornbread is good though.

Shepherd's pie was okay, the sauce was good, but just a little too concentrated, heavy, and very salty.  It needed more of a starch to cut the sauce down.  This is another dish with a slight identity crisis.  But sadly, the best dish so far.  

Desserts were great.  The pecan and fig pie was delish. Crust was like the outside of a fig newton cookie and the fresh figs were the highlight of the entire meal.  The cream cheese ice cream is very different and decadent.  This is the one thing on the menu that we all wished was a little larger in size! 

On the lighter side, the blueberry and pear cobbler was bright and naturally sweetened by the fresh fruits within.  Cobbler to ice cream ratio a little off, but it was good nonetheless.

Pimm's cup cocktaill is really good. Very light and fresh. 

I guess if I want upscale home cooked food, I will just have to continue cooking it myself. :(  

We will come back for dessert and drinks.",2011-01-15 17:43:29

Cod fish cakes (can't remember the exact name of the dish): they were unimpressive and tasted like a mix between a potato croquette and a fish stick.

Salmon ceviche: I've had lots of ceviche in the past, from many countries, so I have a point of reference. Ceviche is supposed to be marinated in lemon (or something else with high acidity) together with veggie bits (like onions and whatnot), and seasoning. Chiado's ""ceviche"" was merely chopped bits of raw salmon. The veggies were not incorporated, and the salmon was not marinated. Probably should NOT call it a ceviche. I wouldn't even call it a deconstructed ceviche, nor an interpretation. It had no identifying characteristics of ceviche.

Dourada (sea bream): Blackened white fish. It was alright. nothing impressive.

On a Sunday afternoon, late lunch, the St. Clair W location was quite packed.

At first, I thought it was weird, but he was right, it's actually the quietest table in the restaurant!  Feels kinda separate from the busyness upfront...until you hafta scoot around people to head downstairs to the washrooms.  ;)

Ordered the grilled calamari, quite good.  (I would've preferred the breaded version, but I was *trying* to be healthy.)  And for main, the Primavera pizza ($14) was shared.  Due to the toppings like sundried tomatoes & olives, the pizza was on the saltier side, but still didn't feel too heavy because of the thin crust.

Aside from the really thin crust, what sets their pizza apart is also their CHEESE!  They use really good, chewy quality mozz, yum!!!

The tacos are comprised of simple flavors that, when layered, become quite tasty. The meat (I had chicken and pork) is lightly seasoned and is cut, or maybe shaved, in very small  pieces. The kimchee is slightly spicy, but also sour.

The chef used flour tortillas. I was dismayed at first because corn is my favorite, but unlike other reviewers my tortilla was soft and warm. I think it was grilled because it was crispy in places. 

Sure, a trip to Del Taco or Taco Bell would be cheaper, but ew! Why go there when you can have real food? 2 tacos for $4 something is more than enough food for lunch, and I think the price is very reasonable.

Tuna Poke Wonton tacos - really fresh but way too spicy for me. Hubs loved them, though
Roasted Bone Marrow - This was a hail mary because we've been wanting to try it for awhile. On it's own, we weren't fans, but add the frills they serve with it, very good.
Brussel Sprout Salad - TRY THIS!!!! It was my favorite out of everything.
Grilled Cheese, Bacon, and Tomato soup dumplings - The soup was so flavorful and the ""dumplings"" were potato (I think) filled with melted cheese topped with bacon. AMAZING!
Lamb Chops - another try this! Delicious and huge!

In the search for a wholesome banh mi, I've gone to about 6 Phoenix Vietnamese restaurants in the past year and have been disappointed in their banh mi's every time. Either the bread wasn't fresh enough, there was too little meat or there wasn't enough asian mayo, none were good enough for my liking. Today, I decided to try Sekong's Noumpang Saiko Ang, which is a grilled beef Cambodian sandwich. This sandwich was fabulous! The bread was just the right amount of crispy outside/soft center, the beef was tasty and tender, and the best part, enough mayo that has been so lacking in my previous endeavors. I would say the only thing missing is fresh jalapenos, which I am sure they would add if I request it. Now that this heavenly sandwich has touch my lips, my only hope is that the fresh ingredients remain consistent.

The menu is large and features spicy, delicious food.  It took me a while to figure out what to order and in the end, I decided to order two dinner entrees for myself.  The restaurant accepts credit card.  Dining area is medium sized.

Highlights: I ended up ordering dish D9, which is a platter of Asian eggplant, and S26, which is a platter of stir fried chicken with cumin.  I will emphasize that two dishes is way too much for one person - you will be full with a single entree.  By my foodie nature, I couldn't resist trying both even though I knew that I couldn't finish both.  The stir fried chicken was cooked well.  You could definitely taste the cumin, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Also, there was a decent amount of peppers, onions, and aromatic vegetables to provide flavor to the dish.   Certainly not a dish that's mostly onions.  I was very impressed with the Asian eggplant.  Excellent sauce, great amount of spice, and delicious ground pork with sauce.  One of the best dishes I've eaten that includes Asian eggplant.  As a note, rice needed to be purchased separately for both of these dishes.  The servers were polite and food was cooked in the promised time (around 10 minutes).  Wait times might be longer at peak hours - I went when the restaurant was empty.

Critiques: The food might be better in either Hunan or Sichuan province in China.  I haven't been there, so I can't say.  I was very happy with my food though.  No complaints. 

Overall: I definitely recommend the eggplant dish here.  It was the server's recommendation and I agree that it's a dish that you should try.",2016-05-21 17:37:28

Super cool space... almost cavernous with a ton of outdoor space.  The parking lot fits like 10 cars - (okay, maybe an over-dramatization) but not that many cars so there is an overflow lot about a block away.  The overflow lot is just an empty gravel lot and the snow was melting over the weekend, so it became a mud bowl, just be prepared to step in things - not that you would wear overly formal shoes to a brewery, but it could be my OCD not wanting to get mud in my car.

Anyways, aside from the parking situation... the bartenders were super nice and there were a lot of them since the bar is pretty big AND it was a weekend.  

Live music had set up next to our table so the back half of our visit here was spent shouting at each other, but there were plenty of other opportunities to find another table in a quieter corner.

Food truck (improper pig) was in the parking lot outside so the food situation is similar to most other breweries in the city.  

Dog and kid friendly atmosphere.  I saw a number of families here with small children.  There's even one pinball machine and an arcade came to play... along with a stack of board games so there's something for everyone.

Beer was tasty.  I had their DIPA and was surprised at how ""not as in-your-face"" it was as Double IPAs tend to be...

Cuisine: Pub
Location: St Lawrence
Address: 70 The Esplanade
Price Range: $5~


Extra information:

* Couple locations in GTA
* Live music
* Patio during summer

I was lucky to preview new summer menu from Fionn MacCool.

Fionn MacCool is your friendly neighborhood pub that serves your usual wings and beer where you can just chill with your friends on a nice summer day.

We got to try 7 new items from the menu but in smaller portion so do keep in mind that when you order these off menu, they will be bigger in portion.

I tried: Pear & Vanilla spiced lemonade

* Captain Morgan Spiced rum, sage simple syrup, mint, pear juice, ginger soda and fresh lemonade
* Sweet, light and refreshing for a hot summer day

I tried: Irish Chip Nachos

* layers of Irish chips, tossed in Celtic sea salt and vinegar with aged white cheddar, hot peppers, tomatoes, green onions and topped with chipotle mayo
* This would be a good dish to order if you just need something to munch on
* It is not heavy as your usual nachos

I tried: Grilled Bacon Sarnies

* Mini sandwich made U.K. style- grilled back bacon and sliced bacon, avocado puree, spicy onion salsa with a grilled lime wedge
* You can't go wrong with bacon

I tried: Lamb Burger

* Chargrilled ground lamb, Indian spiced braised onions and Stilton cheese- served on Ace bakery bun
* Usually I don't like blue cheese but in this case everything worked well together and the cheese wasn't over-whelming
I tried: Dublin Street Sandwich

* Grilled flat iron steak in spicy sauce with roasted red peppers, citrus yogurt, cucumber and pickled onion wrapped in warm naan bread- served with tomato mint salad
* My least favorite item from the menu, steak pieces were good but I didn't really like the bread and found it a little dry

I tried: Pear and Pomegranate Salad

* Blend of spinach and frisee tossed in honey citrus vinaigrette topped with slices of red pear, pomegranate seeds, pecans, shaved parmesan and drizzle of honey
* Drizzle of honey on top really brings the salad together

I tried: Steak & Shrimp

* Tender bavette steak grilled to order and sliced with chimichurri sauce, jumbo grilled shrimp and charred corn
* Steak was very tender and the shrimp was cooked to perfection

I tried: Red velvet doughnuts

* served with icing sugar and white chocolate sauce on top

Definitely worth venturing out of the city limits to experience some authentic Chinese dishes.

All the yelp photos helped us tremendously as well as our server, whom patiently recommended dishes once we bombarded her with questions.

We over-ordered of course, but that means we had leftovers available for later (and we got to try a lot of things in one sitting).  The szchenuan wontons were amazing... (hopefully you are a fan of spicy since this place does have a lot of options with all things pepper on them).  The twice cooked pork was awesome as well.  Make sure to ask your server about their season items like the veggies and their specials!

Overall, it was located in a strip mall but had a ton of tables... seemed like there were a lot of people and some reserved booths for the regulars.

We waited for what seemed like forever for our food and while it still had great quality (keeping it at four stars for that alone), I was a little taken aback at how slow and disorganized the wait staff seemed to be with things.

Aloette doesn't take reservations, it's first come first serve - meaning you probably want to plan your visit to avoid peak hours where you might have to wait a long time. After chatting with a fellow yelp friend who went on a Saturday at 5pm, and got seated after a half hour wait, I decided to also come for early dinner on a Friday evening. My friend and I got to Aloette at 5:15pm on a Friday and got seated right away. The restaurant was around 70% filled when we got there and it seemed like you can get a table pretty quickly up until 6ish on a Friday. We got seated by the bar which was surprisingly comfortable. Never once did I have to adjust myself on the bar stools or felt like I was falling off (some bar chairs are really high and uncomfortable).

We ordered the Beet Salad, Atlantic Cod and Beef Short Ribs. I am normally not a beets person but omg this beet salad was delicious! There were a lot of flavours and textures in the salad. I like the texture of the yellow beets they used over the more popular red beets; the malt crumbs and quinoa added crunchiness to the salad. And since the beets were slightly sour due to the vinegar-y dressing they used, the sweetness from the pomegranate balanced it. The Atlantic Cod dish is a Japanese influenced dish with miso butter and shiitake mushrooms. I love the flavour of this dish as well and it's just different from what you would normally expect when restaurants do a Japanese spin on their food. This is also my friend's favourite dish of the three. Last but not least the short ribs were really tender and juicy and you won't be disappointed, but flavour wise because I do eat a lot of Asian food, the short ribs reminds me of the Chinese beef briskets I can get readily at a lot of Chinese restaurants so I would probably opt for something else next time! I should also mention the portions are pretty decent as you can see from the pictures. We were full and did not have room for dessert. Service was excellent throughout the meal.

The place itself is sooo 30 years ago and has more awful wood veneer than the veneer room in an '80s Chrysler minivan factory.

The menu is ridiculously confusing and most (not all) of the workers are unattractive and unfriendly and simply don't care and don't care to help you.

And the food is sooo unhealthy! After ordering a hotdog and a small fry, one of the workers was like ""Anti-diet food right there,"" he said.

Oh, and the bathrooms aren't much bigger than the large fries!! If you actually manage to find them and survive the climb down the veneer lined, near 90 degree angle stairs.

Recently I ordered their pork bone soup and the amount of meat that I got was really negligible compared to before and compared to other places. I usually get full after I finish the dish and the rice but I was still hungry afterwards - I filled myself up with the side dishes. I also tried the soondaegook (blood sausage soup) which was a huge disappointment and really different than other places. It was served in an almost transparent broth - which is much different that what I'm used to as I believe it is typically served in a red spicy broth flavoured with the gochujang. Maybe it was made differently here or it was a different style, but either way, it wasn't really appetizing. There was also only like 4 pieces of the blood sausage in the broth too. 

This place has other great dishes though. I really like the jajangmyeon and the great affordable lunch deals! Maybe I won't come back here for the dishes I talked about above but I would definitely come back here for some of their other dishes.",2018-03-18 06:39:33

The spiced hot chocolate (CHOCOLAT CHAUD EPICE - SPECIAL CACAO 70) is supposedly a dark chocolate spiced with paprika, curry, cardamom, and espelette pepper. It was more subtle than I had expected. The flavours were really well balanced and drank rather smoothy, except it definitely is thicker than your joe schmoe powdered hot chocolate mix so it is a bit rich on the palate. $8.75.

Had a bite of the classic crepe with white chocolate (CREPE AU CHOCOLAT CLASSIQUE - AU BLANC) which actually wasn't cloying sweet (contrasted really well with my drink), but it is literally just crepe drizzled with white choc. This one seemed slightly overpriced. $7.50.

Finally, the classic chocolate fondue with dark chocolate (FONDUE AU CHOCOLAT CLASSIQUE - AU CHOCOLAT NOIR) didn't seem anything special. it was served lukewarm in a tall mug and while there was space under the mug for a candle, there was none. Still plenty molten, however, to dip the bits of banana, strawberry, pineapple, brownie, and waffle. The brownie was actually quite delicious on its own (actually more spiced than expected), but dipping it in more chocolate seemed excessive. Waffle squares were not good...could have been omitted. $9.50 for ""simple"" (vs. ""double"" - which i assume to be either two flavours or supersized)

Nice quiet place to hang out, with a patio out in front. Overall I can see this place being pretty exciting for chocolate/dessert lovers but for those just looking for a nibble of sweetness post-dinner, you'll definitely want to share.",2015-07-05 16:31:55

Honestly, I didn't know that was a thing when my boyfriend and me decided to randomly visit on a Friday afternoon. The place was dead when we walked in, which always makes me hesitant. Not this day. Which I had started with a lunch at Meat & Potatoes.

The bartender was extremely friendly and, what do you know, he's a friend of Blake's, our favorite bartender at M&P (small world). Since we had just eaten, we didn't order anything off the menu so my review doesn't include that. I can't wait to go back and try some of their items, though.

The design/layout was not at all about what I was expecting. It's nice and I love the blue and black colors. I didn't interact with the hostess or waiters/waitresses at all, but they all seemed friendly. Their draft selection was also much better than what I was expecting. What can I say? I don't think the North Shore's selection of bars and restaurants is anything to write home about, but BZ's could definitely change that, especially if the food is spot on.

She had mentioned Wurst to me a couple times before and I told her that it was just around the corner. I brought it up on my phone and mentioned to her that the dessert is salted maple rosemary ice cream. Well that sealed the deal. This is one of the reasons she runs...the guilt free ice cream follow up. For, it's beer...and Wurst's tap list is pretty good and they boast a pretty nice bottle list too. They even post on their web page when they last cleaned their lines. Very nice.

Of course, those two things are bonuses, because you come to Wurst for the sausages. I really wanted to have a staple like Oktoberfest or Bratwurst, but my sister asked me if I had ever had kangaroo. Well, no I hadn't, and thus my choice was made. Add to that some duck fat fries and a Mill Street 100th Meridian and I was set. The kangaroo was an interesting meat to choose and it was accented with herbs, but it wasn't too distinctive. It was nice and it tasted lean, but I can't say much about it other than it probably needed those herbs. The duck fat fries were pretty damn awesome (get these!!!) and the beer was decent.

I wanted draft and that was the best on offer. If I wasn't driving, I have been jumping into the bottles next. They have some standout breweries like Cantillon, Founders, DDC, Evil Twin, Mikkeller, Trou, and Freigeist. They're also doing casks, and starting in January 2016, bringing out the beers they've been cellaring.

There's still tons left for me to come back for; guinea fowl with cheddar/asparagus, duck with maple/fois gras, wild boar with mushroom/tea, and elk with cumin/porcini all look like standouts on the game menu. The traditional sausages all look pretty damn tasty too and they now have heritage breeds (Tamworth and Berkshire) which would be interesting to try. Another thing that really excites me is that they offer a currywurst sausage too.

If you have room, they also offer and interesting soft serve ice cream which seems to be a Toronto staple now, but they kick it up a bit by offering duck fat fry bits as a topping.",2016-01-06 02:06:59

The menu is southern California Baja...Think Wahoo's on steroids. I walked in with no welcome or greeting.

I told the guy at the counter that this was our first time here and asked for his recommendations. He suggested the California (basic taco... Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and salsa). 

Hint of cynicism coming next... So as he rings our order he asked if we were members of the addict club, their rewards program, it pained me to remind him again that this was our first time here. 

There is not much to say about a bean and cheese burrito so I will move to the taco plate. It was good, but not all the hype people talk about. I'd like to comment on the salsa, but I think the tomatoes and onions that came with it are not considered salsa (maybe they are).

It was yummy anyway and since it was my birthday I didn't make a peep to the waiter about it. It came with a mountain of french fries--very nice and 2 of my friends were munching with me.  YL ordered the trout which I thought was the best dish that any of us had ordered.  A whole trout filleted and quite tender, topped with some green beans and sliced roasted almonds. The combination was divine. 

The best was that after our meal the waiter presented me with a cake with a pink candle (I love pink!)  that said ""Happy Birthday"" and had my name on it!   It wasn't just a slice of cake for me, but a long elegant chocolate hazelnut cake for me and my friends!!!  It came from the bakery downstairs in the Venetian.  

We all left happy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is staying at the Venetian. Plus, it isn't very expensive for lunch.",2006-08-07 23:52:35

A friend suggested it to us, so my SBL (Sexy Bearded Lover) and I thought we would try it out. 
Walked in and was completely surprised at the beautiful lighting and the cool 80's Latino music playing. It has a super chill vibe in there and you immediately feel comfortable. 
We sat down and ordered the trash can nachos for an appetizer. First off they are life changing. 
They are brought out in a bottomless bucket that's turned upside down and unveiled before your eyes, and in one smooth lift of the container your life is forever changed. I know we heard the Jesus music in the background, how could you not. 
The nachos stay mostly the shape of the bucket, but when they become unhinged, it hits you that this pile of cheesy awesome chicken and creamy goodness is bigger than your head. I'm not kidding, this pile of crunchy, salty freakishly addictive nachos is one of the best things we have found... ever.
We ate and ate and realized that our main dish needed to be a la cart. We ordered the carne asada and pastor street tacos and a few fish tacos to mix it up. Again, some of the most excellent food we have had to date. The street taco meat was never dry or chewy, but only moist, and flavorful; my mouth literally thanked me for ordering them. The fish tacos were made with love and everything was beautiful on the plate. We left there full, fat and happy. Can one ask for anything else when dining out? I think not. 
PS. The pastor tacos come with a slice of the sweetest pineapple, making that particular taco this Yelpers all time favorite. It's really not even right how perfect the food was there. Definitely a 10 on the it was so good it was stupid meter.

Here I was circling around and around the Center looking for a stand alone establishment like an idiot. I had to pull up the Yelp app to figure out where this place was. Guess I should've read some reviews before stopping by lol. Derp :P

THE GOOD EARTH PITA ($9.95): A veggie pita that was ""too healthy"" for my tastes. I like grease and fried food and am probably the most unhealthy vegetarian that has ever existed, but hey, that's just me. The pita was loaded with an assortment of cold veggies and spilling over with each bite. The best parts of the pita were the sunflower seeds and hummus. 3/5   

VIBE: Reminded me of the cafeteria at a hospital. There's a few large tables seating 4+ people available and sofas further out. I would feel kind of awkward eating here by myself since Bronze Cafe seems more so geared towards groups. 

SERVICE: No complaints here. The ordering style is exactly like Starbucks. 

PRO TIP: Military & Students get a 10% discount.

Worth a Return Visit?
My fellow Yelpers obviously disagree with me here but it's unlikely that I'll return to Bronze Cafe. The prices are expensive for what you're getting. However, if you're into eating healthy and like soup, salad, and sandwich places, the Bronze Cafe is worth looking into it.

Staff: They are friendly and boisterous but don't assume this is the norm. They definitely open up once you start to talk to them, but usually they offer friendly service.

Ambience: Like most Chinese restaurants, it is loud but not too loud since there are carpets (some place are tiles and that tends to amplify sound). Their chairs are really light so unfortunately if you place your jacket on it and get up, they tend to fall over. Other than that, the seating is padded and the environment is comfortable.

Food: We came here for dinner service and had a lot of the foods a la carte. They offer the meal sets but it was for a birthday and we got to eat an array of dishes. We had the Peking Duck which has been a favourite of mine since I was kid and they do it pretty well; not too dry and had the right amount of fat on it. We had their regular Cold Steamed Chicken which I was not a fan of because there wasn't any flavour. There were also Sweet and Sour Pork and Ribs which were yummy. I love the sauce and it meat was still very soft and juicy; some places overcook the meat causing it to be dry and hard. There was also a tofu and vegetable dish and it was great. The broccoli was flavourful and the tofu was nice and silky. For desert there was Tofu Pudding (or Dou Fu Fa) and it was some of the silkiest I've ever had. Unfortunately, the syrup was a little bitter; I thought it was the ginger but there was something else that made it bitter and I couldn't figure it out.

The Cordoba Cafe was inspired by the traditional drinking habits of Italians. First, dine, then have an after drink. But in tune with the Mexican flavors, the fernet is sourced from Mexico, not Italy, and it's Mexican Coke in the mix as well. Most importantly for the jolt, it also features Cartel nitro coffee. I was impressed at the dedication to the authenticity of the drink, and it showed in the delicious flavors.
The second drink, the one from Sips and Sweets, had burnt honey and spices in it. I encouraged Zach and Tracy to put it on the menu, it was so good that the flavors infused into the foam, amazing!
Finally, my tacos came. The duck was cooked perfectly, not too crispy, and there was a pecan crunch which was new and complimentary. The pork belly was perfect, too (but how can you really mess up pork belly?), and surprisingly the crispy avocado was delectable and one of my favorites.

Bottom line: No need to charge when i ask for it spicy.

Treat your customers with some more respect and incentive to return. The food is good I'll give them that. But service needs to step it up- big time. The manager/owner need to stop being so stingy/cheap.

The food is good- but I cannot get over the lack of service and puhLEASE charging extras for spicy is a rip off.  So really, it's not a problem with the chefs or the menu, my issue is with the service and the people punching in the numbers.

If you really want Hakka food with better service---- Go to Tangerine across the street in the other plaza or even Fredriks in the plaza beside or maybe even Hakka King.

Anywhere where they add a charge for SPICE is a rip off. I don't care if its only $0.50.. that's beyond ridiculous. Last time I checked the we didn't live in the middle of nowhere where ingredients that lend 'spice' cost so much. The customer population is largely south Asian. You cannot charge for spice.",2015-07-06 02:40:29

Even the sign outside is un-Pittsburgh:  custom-made metalworks.  Obviously the two co-owners have put a signature on it.  Lets talk food:  the southern italy influence is evident from reading the menu.  But instead of the usual mass-produced menus for your average run-of-the-mill trattoria, the menu carefully offers what I would suggest to be a ""regional sicilian"" repertoire of culinary offerings.  Sure, it is pricey, but try that yourself in finding quality foods and preparing them the way they do.  As for the ambience:  the place is small, with tables favoring more the one-on-one meetups.

I proceeded to order the most common meal here - a cherry coke, a Special with Swiss, and a sour pickle. In my opinion, everything was A-ok, and upon first glance it stereotypically looked like what I jokingly call ""white people food,"" except it was actually pretty good and tasted better than it looked. 

As someone who doesn't particularly like lunch meats, the bologna was actually pretty tasty and the Swiss cheese/bread combination complemented it nicely. The mustard, however, didn't come through for whatever reason. Maybe the sourness of the pickle I was eating at the same time ended up drowning out the flavor? I don't know, but it was a bit disappointed given that mustard is one of my favorite Western condiments. As for the cherry cola, classic fountain drinks always give me a cool vibe, as if it could make a person cooler just by drinking out of a glass of it. For a place with so much history to it, it didn't disappoint on that aspect.

Overall, come here for the old-school vibe if you're in the mood for a throwback and some simple, cheap eats. Maybe I'll go back and see if I can actually taste the mustard in the future...",2016-07-26 04:24:58

There was no attention to how the salad was made. It was just thrown together. Go to soup plantation or sweet tomato if that's what you want. You will spend a lot less and have a better salad. For what you get, the food wasn't cheap. 

Also they will ask If you want something but they won't tell you it's an extra fee. I caught them doing that to everyone in my room and when I pointed out the fees before we paid no one caught on. So beware!

Overall I would not go back. I was unimpressed by the salad because the flavors were off and nothing seemed fresh. Most of the food seems prepackaged or filled with preservatives. 

I can't presume that the food here is unhealthy but in no way would I consider it a place where I would go if I were being health conscious. It really seems full of preservatives and not very fresh.  Salad places should be full of raw food options that are fresh and unique in flavor. 

My opinion... Go to presto instead. Make the drive to rainbow and tropicana! P.S. I'm not affiliated with Presto I was just super impressed by the food!

That would've been the end of it, but when we finally got to the table and the waitress took our drink orders, our DD asked for a small margarita.

I was enticed by the indoor, air conditioned play space for a hot June birthday.  Also, not having to clean my house before or after a party was a plus!

The owner was incredibly helpful and very generous! The party hosts were great with the kids and kept things moving right along.  

We had an age range of 1 year to 13 years at the party and every single one of them had a great time.  Even a few of the parents got in on the fun.  2 of the dads like the boxing ring :)  The birthday girl (7) was made to feel like queen for a day and had a blast!  She enjoyed how they made her the center of attention.  

We got about 2 hours worth of party time.  30 minutes in each room, there are 2, then about an hour in the party room for cake and presents.  

It was refreshing to have someone else do all the work for a party, for a change!  I just showed up with the birthday kid and the cake!

We rarely go out for lunch on purpose on Saturdays or Sundays.  There has to be either a)extra cash flow and/or b) a good reason.  Going to Bang Bang Burger this past Saturday was because of both A and B.

Upon walking in, I was a little throw off by the decor and the interior set up but I quickly remembered that it's just a simple burger joint.  So then the decor made more sense.  Ordering was easy.  The menu isn't that extensive, yet, but I'm sure as they find their ""voice"" if you will, it'll grow.  I ordered the regular cheeseburger and hubs ordered another burger...I forgot.  The cool thing was that when I asked if they could just skip using a bun on mine, they told  me they could do a burger wrap.  Huh??  OK!! Let's try it.  

My little burger lettuce wrap hit just the spot.  It was just the right size of meat to lettuce ratio and the meat quality was great.  It melted in my mouth.  My Hubs burger, on the other hand...was all bun...hardley any meat.  Where's the beef??  Reading the reviews, they suggest getting the double meat and it would be better.  We also order a beer (yes in the middle of the afternoon..why not?) and mine was GOOD! I think I got the one with the Monkey on it.  LOL! Can't remember the name.  The Bang Bang burger sauce was nothing more than 1,000 island dressing...which they admit to, but they make it in-house.  Sorry but it threw me back to my McDonald days and eating a big mac and it's ""special sauce""...aka....1,000 island dressing.  I'll pass....

We spoke for a long time with Joe and we loved his passion for really wanting to bring a different type of burger joint to CLT.  We liked Bang Bang and will come back if we're ever in that area.  Great little addition to that area.",2013-12-09 15:41:07

First off, know that The Club Terminal 3 is much better than the one in Terminal 1. Even if you don't have a flight out from this terminal, take the shuttle and relax here instead.

When it comes to American lounges (and ones offered via Priority Pass), this is probably one of the better selections you have as a member in terms of value and access. The Club serves as a small resting spot that comes with refreshments (small sandwiches, salad and soup bar, etc.) and a full open bar for you to continue your drunken adventures. Note that it is staffed so you can't simply grab and go your own cocktails. 

While it did get busy throughout the evening, but it made our stay at LAS much more comfortable. There are enough areas with power outlets and sofa chairs that you'll find a spot for yourself and your company.

One should note that there is indeed a shower facility available inside the bathrooms. However, there is no system to regulate who goes in next or whether someone cleans it before use, so it may be a bit dirtier than other airport showers. With that said, if you need to freshen up from the dessert heat and can live the dorm-shower life again, then it will do.

While everything amenities wise was good, there aren't any good views of the tarmac or aircrafts in this lounge. The one in Terminal 1 does win in that respect. However, it's a small  detail in an otherwise good lounge.",2017-08-01 05:26:16

Issues:
- 30 minute wait to get to customer service agent to rent car. 

- The only agent working when I arrived spent the entire 30 minutes with one customer, crushing the line.

- Eventually a second agent started working

- The whole time a person I can describe only as ""a barker"" was out telling the line to move this way or that and asking passers-by if they wanted a rental car.  She stood by uselessly for 30 minutes when an empty station was available and long line of customers needing service.

- After getting through the first agent, to my horror you had to talk to another one in the garage to get your keys, adding 7 more minutes of hell and taking the total time to 40 minutes before I could sit in my car.  This is why people pay for Hertz Gold.

- The car return process was a nightmare.  The rental form had no address for the LAX return center (I did a one-way rental) and E-Z is not big enough to be listed on the airport signs.  So I used my GPS and ended up in front of a construction site.  Tried Google Maps and ended up nowhere.  Called and got a reference point (""near the Sheraton Gaeway"") which eventually lead me there.  Time wasted:  20 minutes, all while trying to make a plane.

- The actual return site was a shack in the corner of an Easy Park long-term parking.  

- The service team was rude

- They left one guy standing in the wrong place, missing two shuttles before he had to ask how he got the airport

i passed by la palette which is on augusta i think, popped in to look at their menu and left.  i stopped by aspetta to get a cappucino.  they had tables, i had a graphic novel to read but i didnt stay.  my first objective was to get the cappucino and with that accomplished there was not much to do but find a bar.

i have passed by ronnies local 69 on numerous occasions with a little bit of wonder.  it was open and seemed like the only open bar nearby.  besides, i dug it from the outside so why not.

well its pretty dark inside, housing a few square tables up front, a couple of booths for about four to six people each sitting comfortably, a small intimate bar, all the aforementioned made of wood.  the walls were painted tin tiling or what looked like it.  they were also divided by a picture rail that also marked the division of a camouflage green from a dusty cream atop it.

i wanted to sit at the bar.  i had a jacket on, there was nowhere to hang it, not much light and not much room for that matter.  next was the idea to snag a booth since there were not that many folks in the bar.  those plans too got dashed as someone was saving it with the territorial purse and half drank pint guarding it silently. that left the back room.

the back room is square with no windows or doors save the threshold that is its entrance, lying just beyond the bathrooms.  i settle myself at one of many small squarish wooden tables.  im the only one back there.  i go grab a beer.  mill street helles bock is the drink for the night.  its quite a tasty beer and i settle down to read my graphic novel.  the table wabbles.  i try not to care, but care, so i move one over.

i guzzle my beer and periodically look up from my novel to see paintings the subjects of which i cant remember hanging on the walls.  in between the paintings are, to my surprise and salvation, rickety, circular dimmer switches that can adjust the lights that are mounted just above them.  destroying the ambient romance, i gladly fiddle with the switch to stop the impending blindness my eyes are succumbing to, and read with much gusto.

the space begins slowly to fill up, and i begin to wonder whether i should order another beer, wondering if my wife will want to stay as we are to meet friends later on.  to my delight she waltzes in shortly, drops her bag on the table and takes the last gulp my beer and approves it for a round.

over our few rounds of beer, we talk and the place fills up.  inside, in these close quarters, you feel perhaps that you are in some tavern in europe, some little bar set up in someones house, in their back room.  the music is nice, good to accompany with toe-tapping and head bobs.  the beer we drank was 5 fifty a pint.  no pretension, no lineup, easygoing.  it reminded me of the commies daughter in its decor, but definitely lacked as vibrant and magical a verve, though, its coziness and age has wooed me enough to make this place a frequent place for a lounge.

Flavours - What makes this place good is the flavour of the broth.  It's always robust and tasty no matter what choice.

Ingredients - Not too bad when it comes to portion size and the amount of stuff that comes with the ramen.  Whether it's tenderous rib or BBQ pork, I don't feel like they skimp.

Menu - Small, focused menu leads to better quality.

[Bad]
Prices - I used to come here a lot because it offered a tasty bowl at great value but it seems prices have gone up along with all the other ramen places.

Slow - Literally just a mom and pop shop.  The wife serves and the husband cooks in the back.  Although a small restaurant, sometimes the food comes out slowly, especially when ordering yaki soba.

[Worth it?]
On this latest visit, it didn't feel like old times and I didn't find myself enjoying it as much as before.  Maybe with the higher price I set a higher standard or maybe other places have stepped up their game since then.

In previous years it would be a no brainer value winner.  Now that prices have gone up, I'm not sure $15 for a bowl is considered value anymore.

I always order there Beef Ho Fun with no bean sprouts (just a personal preference), beef with black bean sauce, spicy salted chicken, shrimp wontons, and chicken corn soup. 

Beef Ho fun is always a must! No matter what I order, this is a staple. It's not too oily and the beef is tender not chewy. Beef with black bean sauce was too salty so I always get it with rice, the spicy salted chicken is good but not consistently crispy (I've had better ones), shrimp wontons are not stuffed...very mediocre and the red sauce that comes with it taste weird. I'm not ordering that again. The soup was ok, I had to add a bit of salt. 

Make sure to bring cash as that's the only thing they accept. It's great for take outs, I've never eaten at this place before.",2015-03-08 20:38:24

I frequent this location often, DESPITE how I always tell myself to drive further and go somewhere else.. I usually end up here because it's near. They are slower than molasses in freezing weather IN Maine! Because I have ended up multiple times with the wrong drink order via the drive up OR that it's always , ( any time of the day), got a LONG line and with that, a LONGER than usual wait time, I try and gauge the drive up length versus parking and pulling my lazy self out and walking inside to order. The last visit I had, for example, I parked, went inside and there was no line... the drive thru had no less than 8 vehicles waiting. I had my order taken immediately. I stick with what is on the menu here and make it my goal to not order anything crazy : 220* Capps or extra froth, for example.. I don't want to throw these guys off with what I know isn't that difficult BUT here, it seems to be. I stood waiting for a basic, nonfat, caramel macchiato for almost 20 minutes.. they forgot about my order. Finally I was asked by one of the several baristas if I was still waiting. He admitted they 'somehow' skipped me. Thankfully, I'm pretty patient. The other barista, a girl, gave me my now prepared drink. You know what , it was a latte. She also shortened my name .. with a wink? What? (KIM is my pet peeve ..& the name on the cup clearly states Kimberly :) .. ) Oh well. I had places to get to and it wasn't worth correcting my name , or my drink or advising these many baristas that the drink bar was a mess of spilled stuff.. sugars missing and empty canisters or half and half. I simply continue to frequent this particular location in hopes that because this part of S PHX has not much by way of restaurants or coffee places, this location will get its act together: you know the basics ? Clean the place more often , be quicker with simple menu offered drinks, be friendly, get the drinks correct and be apologetic for wronging a customer, not smarty!

There are basic pizzas such as marguerite and cheese, costing $8.99 for six slices ($2 off on Tuesday) and speciality pizzas. From there you can add toppings for $1 each. You order at a long counter as they build the pizza for you. Upon paying you receive a number. The pizza is brought to your table.

Hubby had the marguerite with pepperoni. I enjoyed a cheese pizza with olives and mushrooms. Pizza was delivered piping hot to our table.

We wish that the crust was crispier, it was difficult to cut with the restaurant poor quality silverware. That is pretty much the only drawback.

I know there have been some negative reviews on the service but I have never experienced that here. My Grandmother loves this restaurant, so we go for family dinner relatively frequently. 

The positives have been the friendly service and the rapid preparation for a rather large party. They have always seated us on time and provided a timely meal. 

The negatives, the interior and menu are both dated. It's like a restaurant that has seen only minor changes since the 80s. Its clean and warm...just dated. The food is also on the bland and uninteresting side. I've had any number of pasta and Italian themed entrees, and honestly, it's hard to review as they are pretty forgettable. 

One of my favorite things though is the entree descriptions on the daily menu. Things may be drizzled with scallops or splashed with artichokes. I try to imagine the preparation in this manner and it makes me giggle to see a chef throwing my scallops at my plate, bouncing everywhere.

So it came looks good....til I have to mix it...Uber lots of water so it's runny.

Ordered raspberry iced too....yummy....I'm on my 3rd glass...I'm so full now.

We tried the chickpea curry, samosas, aloo bonda, and a potato curry. For a small establishment inside of a market, they do a great job with presentation. All of our food looked tantalizing. 

My favorite was the potato curry. So much flavor. The aloo bonda was also good, but the oil that the aloo bonda/samosas were fried in tasted old. They would've been the highlight otherwise. The chickpea curry was fine, but lacked flavor. The Indian flatbreads that come with the chickpea curry were AMAZING. The potato curry came with lentil soup, roti, and white rice. Both of the appetizers came with green and red chutney (sorry, I don't know what they are traditionally called!) We left very full.

I took my dog with me to the event to get some socialization and desensitization to distractions. I'm so glad that I went! There was no admission fee and the vendors were plentiful with the raffles, prizes, and free items. There were many rescue groups with adoptable dogs! It was hard for me or my dog to focus on any one thing at a time because so much was going on. I think I could've spent the whole day there. 

Some tips:
-cost of parking is $4
-bring your dog's vaccine records or sign their waiver form
-arrive at least 15 minutes before opening time so you can beat most of the crowd. It begins to get crowded at 11am. 
-if you have a small dog, plan on carrying it when it gets crowded. People are too distracted to watch where they are going
-lots of free treats/food but only give one or two to your dog or else it could upset it's stomach
-bring a water bowl and a bottle of water
-poop and pee area is outside, NOT on the doxie race track!
-see the flyball and agility course demos! Those are fun.

Somehow a 24 oz cup at this coffee bean was smaller than a 20 oz cup from Peet's. Huh? The staff are friendly and service is quick, which is why the 2 stars. But after getting iced drinks at Peet's I realized what a jack this CB is. All the iced drinks are 3/4 ice and 1/4 coffee drink. It's cold but a $6 latte should last longer than 4 small sips. At Peet's they put just enough ice in to cool it but still give you your $$ worth. And the quality of coffee is so much better at Peet's it's ridic. I tried a croissant at CB once and it tasted like it was 3 days old and possibly used as a soccer ball during slow times of day. By comparison a chocolate croissant at Peet's was flaky, warm, delish, tasting like it came from a gourmet French bakery. CB charges gourmet prices for ghetto products. The only place CB may be better than is Dunkin Donuts, which is a pretty low bar. And somebody needs to inform CB corporate that the up-sell at the drive through is super obnoxious. When I say I just want a drink and that's all, stop asking if I also wouldn't like a sandwich or banana or salad with my coffee. I don't leave my house not knowing what I want at all, somehow end up at a CB dt and then figure it out with their help. Annoying the crap out of the customers isn't good service, it's completely disingenuous and not authentic. It makes me want to throw my coffee at the person handing it to me at the window. Good riddance to crappy coffee and excessive customer service. At Peet's they're genuinely friendly, the coffee is bomb, and they give me what I ask for, no more and no less.

Last year I came and had the ceviche and got food poisoning and felt ill for about 2 days. For some reason me and the same friend as last time came back to grab some food again possibly for my birthday. WOW have I never been so disappointed in this place. We got in at about 8:30 a safe amount of time I was thinking before they closed boy were we wrong. Just about everything went south from there starting from the beginning. 

Drinks, I had a regular iced tea and when it arrived it was almost clear WTH and it was sent back for another. When it came time to get a refill it was refilled with the tropical iced tea which is a abomination to me. 

Our order was taken and the sourdough bread was dropped off. Last time I was here i remember the bread being toasty warm but I thought nothing of it being cold. Before my friends Caesar salad and my order of half dozen oysters on the half shell arrive the waiter tells him they are out of the Filet Mignon and so he proceeds to order the Chicken Parm which he has enjoyed in the past. At the end of the appetizers a man whom I assume was a manger tells me they are out of Linguine for my Seafood Jambalaya and hand me a new menu and is about standing over me waiting for a new order after he gives other options. I tell him to come back later. I finally decided to get the N'awlins BBQ Shrimp recommended by the waiter.

The entrees arrive my order looks good and is tasty except for the fact they have cut up a whole lemon that is mixed in with the sauce and they appeared to look like a yellow squash...YUCK Bitter Face as a chew into the lemon piece another WTH moment. My Friend fared worse than me I think. His Chicken Parm was kinda lukewarm and the pasta side had no sauce and the 2 sides that are included with the meal were never brought out. In his words ""They totally microwaved that shit"" ""I would not come back if they were giving it away"". The manager did decided to comp us 2 free desserts for the lack of items from the menu but it could not take away the resentment that we just paid for this.

If you don't want a sandwich, you have to awkwardly pass people to get to the salad station. Same goes for soup. The menu wraps around above where the stations are, so god forbid you want a sandwich/soup combo and don't know what the soups are. You then have to do some strategic neck-cringing to see the choices, or decide on the spot when you get to the next station.

HOWEVER...after our last visit I saw and experienced some things that absolutely need to be fixed. When ordering snacks, I witnessed an employee picking up a hot dog from the roller heat machine (?) with HIS BARE HANDS. that should have been my warning, but I foolishly ate the food anyway.
Observation : when you ask for jalapenos, they give you a small cup to help yourself by the butter and napkins. I figured it was safe because of the acidity, that it was not refrigerated. Yeah...learning curve lol
Long story short, I got food poisoning from the jalapenos. I will spare the details but I know that was the cause. Employees need cleanliness and food handling training. food should not sit out (even jalapenos) for so long without being dumped and refreshed with a clean container. In fact, just keep them behind the counter in the fridge, to prevent others from sticking their fingers in the container.

I seem to never hear anyone talk about it. Well, I finally made it to SOHO, and it was delicious. I can't really think of any complaints!

Let's start with those biscuits... Probably my favorite part of the meal. So. Good. Melt in your mouth good. Served with apple butter and herb butter. I could have just made a couple more of these babies my meal. The biscuits alone are why you need to get here. 

We started our meal off with deviled eggs and chicken fried oysters. The deviled eggs were a classic recipe with crumbled pickled carrots on top. Good, no complaints. The chicken fried oysters were the weakest part of the meal. Not bad, but not amazing either. There was too much breading to the part where they dwarfed the oyster and it was all you tasted. 

Next we had the tomato bisque. Generous portion. Served with a camembert grilled cheese, perfect for dipping in the soup.

Now onto the most important part, the fried chicken. It was really hard to choose between the mornin' style (rosemary waffles), evenin' style (collard greens and mashed potatoes), and late night style (pulled pork mac n cheese). We ended up going with the evenin' style. We don't regret it, but if we go back I think we'd do different. Everything was good. The sausage gravy was sweet and the perfect accompaniment to the fried chicken. I think the chicken had too much breading, and a lot of it was falling off.

However, the past 3 visits...in which we rarely ever come here to eat...I've been jipped out of a chicken, side order of fries looks like it's under a budget cut, and I'm actually quite annoyed. Yes, I know. 1 piece of chicken. BUT! When you order your kid a kids meal and all he gets his ONE chicken when there's supposed to be two and like 9pcs of fries...seriously.

I'm not one to gripe about food, but 3x in a 9 month period being short a chicken. Kids meal short a chicken happened twice, last visit we ordered the 3pc combo. Instead, we got 2pcs so basically it was pretty much a kids meal. But what does that really mean when two out of the 3 visits our kids meal came with one. I never called to complain because I really feel silly for calling about being short a chicken, but at the end of the day...you're paying a price and you should get what you paid for. 

Workers seem diligent at the drive thru window and on point, but somebody isn't counting their chickens and I'm ready to tell their momma. Just felt like typing that in too. Lol.

Whenever we pull through the next time...whenever that is... 3 strikes have been used and now I'm gonna have to count my chickens. Other than that, we all know Raising Cane's chicken isn't bad at all.

I came here again with a friend after 2-3 years, and I thought to myself, ""What was I thinking?!""

First off, never order a meal here.  It's not worth its price for the quality.  I ordered myself a side of takoyaki (again - in relation to the search of the best takoyaki).  Gosh, the takoyaki was horrible.  What was I thinking!?  It was full of batter, and the squid taste was just awful.  Not only that, they topped it off with TOO much sauce.  I was not impressed.

The popcorn chicken was surprisingly a lot better than Go For Tea.  However, still was not fully satisifed.

The drinks were okay.  I can't recall what my friend ordered -- it was some sort of hot celestial tea.  I ordered myself a hot red bean black tea with tapioca.

Gosh, that was bad too.  There was all this powder reminants at the bottom of my drink in the end.  Not only that, the tapioca was hard and not very chewy.

Our convention was excited to return to the Fremont area this year. We even expanded it to be 6 full nights instead of 3. 

What a disappointment. Upon arrival, after 3pm, I was told the suite I'd reserved wasn't available and that all I could get was a double bedded room. I'd also requested that I have a room closer to the elevator because the halls are long and i'm a bit on the hippy side. My room was the next to the end of the hall. 1 door closer. 

The bellman dropped one of our bags when taking it out of the cab and splitting it open. Not even an apology. 

Upon checking in, the front desk staff was rude to the point of obnoxious. I heard later if you slipped them a 20 they would fulfill the accommodations. I guess they didn't know bribery was against the law and that would explain where my suite went. Poof. 

Arriving at the room, the bed were made but housekeeping had failed to remove several used bottles of beer, 3 filthy wash cloths behind the bathroom door & we had no toilet paper. I called housekeeping and was informed a manager would have to call me back. 10 minutes later the manager called, apologized and assured me they would send someone right up. An hour later I called back. They sent someone but he refused to remove the dirty wash cloths until I went Big City Woman on him. 

the one bright spot on my arrival was going to Oscars. I arrived just before happy hour was over, had a great waitress & the food was as excellent as ever. 

The rest of the week went down hill. It was as if they didn't want us there at all. There was no security guard at the tower entrance so 4 out of 6 nights we found people sleeping or passed out in the vending machine area on my floor (9th). Unacceptable.
When making my reservations, I specifically asked if they had finally gotten in room movies, and was assured they had. This was a lie. and the ""front desk manager"" (I say that with quotes because Im pretty sure she wasn't) was over the top rude when asked about it. There were no channels on the TV so you had to guess what channel you were watching. and yes I know that most folks don't come to Vegas to watch TV but you can't gamble 24x7x6days. Do I look like Melinda Gates? 
Let's move to Friday when I needed a bellman to move some luggage for me to another room. With an additional of our 375 rooms checking in, there was a 200 room wedding also checking in. The bell desk had 1 - yes I said it - 1 bellman on duty. who puts 1 bellman on duty on a weekend? I had to call the front desk they said they would tell him. 30 minutes later nothing. called for the hotel GM - and was told there wasn't one on duty. LIE. No hotel, no matter how big or how small doesnt have management. 

Today, upon checkout, I started at 7am calling the bell desk no answer. Finally I called the operator who again informed me there was no GM on duty. On a Sunday at 8am with 750 rooms checking out? LIE. I sent my son down stairs only to find out that the button that is marked ""Bell Desk"" on the telephone, doesn't ring to the actual bell desk. It just goes no where. 

Its a IF they don't want anyone staying there. 

As much as I love to go to Oscar's, I will never ever go to the Plaza again. I don't care if I do miss out on those lovely Carolyn cocktails. I'll get over it. I don't need to spend my $$ and I did spend too much to be treated as if I was some homeless motherless child.

I've had Korean bbq in several bigs cities - Chi-town, NYC, ATL... I may not be Korean but I'm a pretty good judge of food so i know good Korean BBQ. The risk of one star had absolutely nothing to do with the food or waitstaff - it's all due to the seating arranged by the hostess. 

Came here on a Friday night around 5:30 with a party of 14. We were told It would be 40-45 min wait. The hostess pointed out two tables in the front and said that would be ours. We put down our name and headed next door to Seoul for beers while we wait. 30 min later, we check with the hostess and was told it's another 40 min wait again. No reasoning, no explanation. We glanced over at the tables that were supposed to be ours and noticed there's two new sets of customers seated there. Wait - did you just give our tables to someone else? And failed to update us? When we realized that, we went back to the hostess and was told those two tables couldn't accommodate 14 people so they had to change the plan. I was beyond livid. Why were we told one thing and not updated when the plan changed? At this point it's been an hour and a half wait. I don't mind waiting but when you're told 40 min and it's been 90 min, something's gotta give. Because we already invested so much time - not to mention we're here to celebrate my 18 year wedding anniversary - we decided to continue to wait. Luckily our name was called about 5 min after the showdown with the hostess. 

We get to our seat and it's three tables. Our friends visiting from MN were on the opposite side so there was absolutely no interaction with them during the meal. Another negative. 

Now on to the food. As soon as we sat down, someone came by to take drink orders and the ban chan (side dishes) were dropped off. Before our waters were even given, another person (our waiter) came by to take our food orders and It went uphill from there. I'm talking from a 1 star to a full 5 stars right away. 

All of the side dishes were delicious. The meats were so flavorful- definitely the best bulgolgi I've ever had. Packed with flavor. The dipping sauces were plentiful and on point. Try the corn cheese. I know It sounds weird but there's something about gooey mozzarella cheese melted over sweet corn that paired together so well. Who would've thunk It? My 10 year old nephew has to be the pickiest eater alive. He eats a total of 6 things in the world- rice and chicken, rice and eggs, pizza, nachos, cheeseburger and nuggets with fries. That's It. I was not looking forward to paying $12 for nothing but surprisingly, I gave him chunks of pork belly crisped up on the grill over a bowl of rice and he rated It 10 out of 10. That's saying a lot!!! 

Let's talk about the service for a minute. Can I give them 5 stars too? I mean, my table consisted of 6 people, 3 of which we're guys over 200 lbs each. And we stayed taken care of. Ask for more rice? You get it right away. You didn't even have to ask for drink refills, you automatically get a glass that's kept full. No matter how many times we asked for additional items, everyone stayed friendly and obliging. Our waitress Camilla must be an angel sent from heaven cause she put up with our neediness with a smile fixed on her face. Gratuity was included in our bill but each of our three tables gave more tips on top of It because our wait staff was impeccable. Then at the end of our meal, the manager or owner walked around and talked to us. Man I wish every place was like this. They have seriously ruined me for customer service anywhere else. All in all, even though we had issues with the hostess and the wait time, we will definitely be regulars here. Just not with a large party again.

This was the most over-priced, crappy food I have ever eaten in the Phoenix area. 

When you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....

The black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?

It's nestled in an old house just off of 1st SW, and while it's been gutted to make an open space it still has that home-like feeling. It has great music (and they take requests. They once hooked up a friend's ipod!), tasty bar food favourites (try the nachos!), an awesome array of local beers and often resembles your super-cool friend's low-key house parties. There are pool tables and foosball upstairs, a balcony, and a variety of tables and benches to rest your drinks and hang out with your friends. For these reasons and more, I make my way down here pretty often.

The crowd is mostly made up of younger hipsters in their twenties and thirties looking for a quieter night out, and that is kind of the problem. Back in the day, before it became a ""destination"" you showed up, grabbed a table and settled in. Now on weekends the place is so crowded it can be very difficult to find a place to set your beer, much less sit down. There are only so many people you can squeeze in a house before it starts getting cramped, sweaty and a lot less relaxing. Not to mention the lines! The Hop has a tiny little bar that can comfortably fit only two bartenders. On a busy night it is not unusual to have to wait ten to twenty minutes to grab your drink.

Some are larger and carry a better selection of items. This one is one of the newer stores and it shows. It has not been torn apart and ransacked like the others. 

Yet again, I am going through the home section in search of the last remaining pieces to pull my rooms together. At this point, it feels like I am trying to find that elusive unicorn. Am I asking too much? All I want is a teal porcelain elephant with Thai rhinestone embellishments. I saw it at another store, but it was chipped. WHY!?!?! I might not have found it yet, but I have enough pillows to place on every seating area. Good luck finding a place to rest. Those chairs and couches are for my pillows.

The menu had typical burger & fries kinda options with other choices as well ... from steak to salmon they had a nice variety. 
I came in for a trial run and ordered a cheeseburger & fries with coffee & water. 
The service was prompt and considering the room was full I got my food in a timely manner.  The burger was larger than I expected and was done just right. The fries were hot and the coffee was fresh.

They inform you that the crust is well done meaning that the outside is slightly burn because of the oven its cooked in. I didn't mind this seeing that the crust taste amazing all by itself. My favorite dish however are the meatballs served with focaccia bread.

The meatball is tender and just falls apart in your mouth and the red sauce that comes with it is just as good. The bread is warm and fluffy with a slight crisp topped with parmesan cheese and oregano. They also serve the with a side of soft ricotta cheese for dipping.

We ordered a large traditional pie and the toppings are $3 each and $2 after the first topping. That's pretty expensive seeing that you can pick another pie with several toppings for only $4 more. We did however find out that mushrooms and pepperoni's count as 1 topping so that was a plus. 

They serve about 12 drafts and I went with a yards brawler which ahas in a 12 oz glass but it cost $5.50. Again that's a little much. After order a large meatball (4 meatballs), a large pie with shrooms and pepperoni and my beer. Our total bill was $45. Not the kind of price I wanna pay for pizza so I will only visit this place every now and then.

I think the overpriced pie is due to it's location and the fact that they are way over staffed. For the small crowd of 20 people, most of them at the bar, they had about 10 waiters and 7 of them were just hanging around talking. Not the best look for a restaurant.",2014-09-11 20:53:37

Even though we ate very little off our plates it wasn't until - the cashier asked me ""how was the food""; that anyone even showed concern. I told the cashier it was ""terrible it just wasn't good"".  I wasn't going to speak to a manager initially however; the two cashiers talked me into speaking with a manger.

Asking us how we are doing but facing the chip rack is a little strange. At least make eye contact, what if I was a celebrity or something!! Jk


Our order came up, we ended up getting over charged for an extra sandwich. It was annoying and we didn't realize it until we were waiting that we just paid $25. We could have a nice 2 for $20 at chilis for that...

Anyway, they came out with the right sandwich and out change for the refund but it was just really bad quality for the amount of time and (lack of) effort put into the food.

-9LD1aphLvyMjlM3c_hEKg,K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,3,3,2,1,"Last Sunday, second day in the Phoenix area...

Blame Yelp for this review... I would have never found this attraction on my own!

Joe's Farm Grill is housed in a Tomorrowland-like building construction with Glass and Steel framing that was pretty popular during the 50s when architects during that era deemed the use of a lot of Glass the wave of the future. A ""get-it-yourself"" fountain drink dispenser is located outside the building... which makes it available for the people sitting in the outside Patio and at the Picnic Tables... but it's kind of a hassle for diners inside, that do not prefer the ""fresh air"". As I walked into the establishment... I was very surprised to see another Disneyland-like feature seen only at amusement parks...  a snake-like waiting-line area. I had to pinch myself... Where was I? Disneyland or Gilbert, Arizona? 

The actual Dining area is divided into two spaces... the front area has a dual function of being an ordering area and a dining area; there is also a rear dining area more suited for larger groups such as families separated by a see-through wall. 

First impression after ordering and being handed a beeper to notify us when our order was ready... Dang, it's HUMID in here! At 10am on a Sunday, with the restaurant only 2/3rds full... the humidity was a little irritating... I would not like this place later in the day when occupancy reaches 100% and the temperature reached 110 degrees.

FLIES, FLIES... and more Flies!!! This was my second observation... In the waiting time for the Buzzer to go off, I had performed the following entomological analysis... You have two kinds of this nuisance at Joe's Farm Grill... Before you get your food, you get buzzed around your dome by these real-small flies that are attracted by your body orifices. Then... after you get your meal, the small guys disappear and then you have to deal with larger flies that are attracted by your food. I don't know which ones were worse... the Big Flies going after your food, or the Teeny-Weeny ones trying to use you as a human incubator for their progeny. Yes, I had THAT much time while waiting for the Beeper to start Flashing! All this despite the Orkin fluorescent Bug-Killers! Take me out of this friggin' Healthy Outdoors!


SWAT! SWAT! SWAT! Now for the Food Review... 

PLASTIC PLATES??? 
All entrees are served on Black Plastic plates - another AMUSEMENT PARK feature!!! When I picked up my meal for my friend and I, I thought to myself... ""Joe's Farm Grill is actually receiving 4-Stars... for using Plastic Plates?!?!"". Of course, the plastic must be recyclable or environmentally friendly. I don't know of any other restaurant on Yelp that can get away with this without getting penalized in the ratings...

Pancakes & Fresh Fruit (**** 1/2 $6.49) Stack of Four, Fresh Fruit, Whipped Cream and Syrup. Smaller than average Pancakes, but the Pancakes were made just right with very good consistency; Fruit consisted of quite a bit of Blueberries, Raspberries, and Strawberries. VERY, Very good.

Meat & Potato Scramble (** 1/2 $7.99) Skillet Potatoes, Bacon, Sausage, & Ham with four Cheeses. A less than memorable Scramble... maybe because it was SALTY!!! Healthful? NOPE! 

This Scramble could have been the Freshest Scramble ever... Would have never known that with the Saltiness masking everything.

Iced Tea (*** $1.99) All you can drink in a smallish cup... if you get it yourself... OUTSIDE... in the 110 degree HEAT!


Afterwards, my friend and I walked outside, to get away from the architectural masterpiece I refer to as a humidifier, where the most impressive part of the restaurant location was... the humongous Trees! But, I have to wonder why anyone would Picnic underneath these trees, though... You have to wonder why all the limbs are supported by HUGE steel Stanchions, as large as the limbs they're supporting, embedded in the ground. And... hasn't anyone that pic-nicked under the trees read the warning signs for falling branches and the danger of climbing on said branches?

Last observation... which is the most disconcerting... With the restaurant 2/3rds of capacity.... only two couples of ""color""? Look around you when you arrive at Joe's... you can perform the math yourself. Unfortunately, I notice things like that...

I also noticed quite a few reviews that mention the TV show, ""Diners,  Drive-In's & Dives""... When has a TV show been the arbiter of what is a good restaurant? Frankly, I'd rather ""find"" my favorite dining establishments myself.


I really admire the idea of Self-Sufficiency and Sustainability in the Joe's Farm Grill which supposedly results in better Health for the patrons and Fresh Produce for the restaurant. Does this result in ""good"" food compared to ""other"" less-healthful, non-sustainable restaurants? Regrettably, No.",2011-08-03 10:51:22

First off, no one working wanted to be there- you could see it on their face and through their lackluster service.  It is a ""seat yourself"" environment that creates an atmosphere which no server knows how many tables they actually have.  Once we did meet our server, I don't know who she is because she never introduced herself, we realized the fan in the door way made it far too cold to sit on the patio.  We asked the server if it could be turned off and disappeared for about fifteen minutes only to tell us that the manager was too busy- I would have at least offered to move our table.  Then we finally got a chance to order- we waited a very long time to get our food and even when it came out it wasn't hot.  My friend and I ordered the same burger, however hers was supposed to be well done while mine should have been medium rare.  The server did not know whose burger belonged to who and asked us to cut into it to find out.  One was medium, the other medium well- the server shrugged and just sad ""well switch them""

I got the Pomme Pilot and according to my friends, I had the best dessert than the rest on the table after they all tried it.

I just went here for lunch the other day with a friend whose husband is the chef here.  So needless to say, this review is of the clubhouse dining - not the golfing.  The food here is pretty good.  It's your average country club fare -- upscale, but a bit conservative.  

I was so tempted to walk in the joint with a sweater draped over my back and shoulders and tell them my name is Carlton, but I held it in.

I ordered the chicken with a wine mushroom sauce and rice pilaf.  Good, but par for the course (no pun intended).   Service was polite and quick, as it always is when I've been here for business meetings.  I've also been here for a number of rubber chicken banquet dinners - so I know what to expect.  

The clubhouse facility itself is decent (not as fabulous as you might think), but the banquet set-up is a bit small, semi-circular, and is downstairs, so you feel like you're in some kind of basement.

You come in and wait in a hoard of persons vying for a table.  The line usually splits in two so it is the luck of the draw as to whether you get seated before the people who were five behind you in line.  It would be so simple (and probably quicker) to have someone directing people.  It is terrible enough that it loses three stars.  Perhaps that is not a breaking point for other people, but essentially stalking people while they eat is not my cup of tea.

The space in there is terrible.  You can not fit between tables, let alone in the winter with a coat on.  People bring strollers in to the restaurant creating blockages and tripping hazards.  None of this ok.  If you are going to have a diner as packed as the Dairy Bar, please prohibit strollers.  Callous?  Perhaps, a little.  However, it brings down your liability when someone will inevitably trip and fall.

The food is great.  Affordable, delicious and huge portions.  One portion is enough to feed two people (maybe three).  The food is hot and it is served quickly.  I was impressed that when I ordered scrambled eggs they came out fluffy.  In the restaurant business, eggs are generally the make or break point.  They are sometimes burned, some flat, sometimes just plain inedible.  Mickies is great when you want to grab a quick breakfast and just hang out for the day.

Avoid this place like the plague if you are there on the day of a football game.  It is a stone's throw from Camp Randall and as you can imagine packed with a sea of red.  

Overall, Mickies is not to be missed.  However, leave everything but your wallet in the car.  And wear comfortable shoes because it is going to be a long wait.",2012-09-12 15:55:51

I guess they are famous for two things which get talked about in other reviews but we didn't try those so I will just breakdown the stuff I got ..

Shrimp pho-11.99 I think which many feel is a lot for pho but compared to a lot of our pho places I've been to this price isn't bad for the size and for the fact that I have a server with a smile lol

Oysters - I got 6 they were decent 

Wings on happy hour - they were dry but I think my server felt I didn't want any sauceso that is why I didn't get ones like in the picture but they were tasty flavor 

Shaken beef salad - so so good like melt in your mouth meat and good dressing

Anything with country ham on the menu is worth ordering. Most  items are calorie laden but if you want to try to eat something nutritionally decent, the harvest moon salad is a good lunch option. There are a couple of interesting parallels with that dish and Neil Young. Of course the song title and also his mention of country ham in the song Albuquerque.

Perhaps, this is to create jobs,  Tell our forecoming President.

I may be picky (you may say)  I'm half Jewish and I only do not eat pork or shell fish, besides due to my job, I see lobster and good food everyday, I did not have many choices of appetizer.  I picked steak tartar whatever but I did not like the taste as there was only meat taste.

I saw my friend order oyster that looked good.  We shared a porter house steak but he did not order any side.  (He was to pay and this was the first time eating out with him, I was observing.)  The meat was cooked to our choice - good.  For the others, wait till I go out with another friend and try again.

I see that the menu does have good items.  Good try.

The price???  Mummmm depending with where you want to compare. Feel like eating at Sheraton or Marriott Hotel.   It is pricey.  In California, you can get better price for this standard. But definitely, a place that you can show off a little bit if you are dating someone.  Haha!!

LOTS of potential there for them to create some very cool space though, so I hope they get to that.
The great thing about the Plaza is that you're right in the heart of Downtown, and they have lots of stuff right inside the hotel.  $2 Dos XX at the casino bar, restaurants, gaming, all new and redone.  The valet is a bit confusing as the front valet (drivearound entrance) is only open for a few hours in the evening, all other times you have to enter off the side by the bus stop.
Bottom line is, we never felt unsafe, the staff all over the hotel was wonderful and friendly, and at roughly $50/night it was a steal!  I will DEFINITELY stay at the Plaza again!",2012-07-22 22:49:49

Coming back after many years, I am actually QUITE disappointed this time and I consider myself as quite accepting to many things.  I got the Fruit & Jelly Dessert which had some Tapioca Pearls as well.

Fruit(Banana, Star Fruit, Kiwi, Grapes, Mango, Watermelon, Papaya, Melon) with some Black Jelly.  The fruit was HIT & MISS as the first thing I noticed  when it arrived was how GREEN the Kiwi was.  It looked FAKE and it tasted fake as it is too RAW and hard to bite and digest.

The Melon wasn't much better and the Grapes looked like the last of the bunch reserved just for me because I've been NAUGHTY.

We did get the Lychee Mochi which had Lychee flavour mixed in a liquid CREAM on the inside which as the special, promoted at $3.50 it was worth a try coming with 5 bite-sized pieces.",2010-05-18 03:47:26

The sauce was average out of any Italian restaurant in the area.  Nothing to write home about but nothing really spectacular either.  My only complaint was the serving size of the pasta.  It was the size of an appetizer serving.  For the cost (about $17),  I expected a larger portion.  The waiter also brought fresh bread and a few different dips.  This was a nice touch.  Unfortunately,  after the food being served,  we never saw him again except to bring the bill.  Our water was not re-filled even once in the duration of the meal.

  The prices at Tony's Pizza in comparison with the food concessions at Art in the Park was reasonable. They offer specials including two slices with a large Coke for $6; or a slice of pizza with fries, and a large Coke for $6.50. I chose the two slice special. 

   In contrast to the neighboring Milo's Cellar, Coffee Cup, and Art in the Park ; Tony's Pizza was nearly empty. There was zero effort finding a table in the small restaurant. I chose the table closest to the Coke machine. If I had chosen a few tables down, I'd be overlooking historic Nevada Street. Regardless, a few minutes later I was overlooking two slices of pizza.

I enjoy the smaller theaters as it gives you a more intimate setting in which to connect with the film. The atmosphere is very quiet with little to no noise from your fellow movie goers and plenty of space to spread out. 

My favorite feature of the theatre is that they have a student and local artist gallery displaying fabulous works of art all throughout the lobby space of the theatre. 

The theatre could use a bit of a makeover as most of the fixtures and seats are dated. But it's charm shines through its bleak surroundings. Hopefully really will consider the reserved seating model in this theatre soon.

I've been impressed with each visit.  The only draw back is that I don't feel comfortable hanging out there.  If you're over 18 you will most likely be the oldest person in the joint.

I ventured all the way to Lawrence and Warden from Mississauga to eat here this past Tuesday.  The dining room was full (mind you it is a small dining room - around 10 tables) and there were people on the patio.  There were also a few larger groups of diners, so I had my hopes up.  

I ordered the tomato bisque with crab to start, crab cake and the grilled and butterflied branzino.  My party finished shared the red and white poached pear with blue cheese, candied walnuts and balsamic reduction.  

The meal started off well.  The tomato bisque had a great consistency and colour,  the seasoning was bold, and the crab gave it the added saltiness that the soup needed.  However, I thought that as you continued to eat it, the seasoning overpowered the crab and it got lost in the dish.  The crab cake was a winner - it was moist  and perfectly dense with a nice golden crust.  I only wish that there was a second one.  I was slightly disappointed that there was only one on the plate at a $10 price point.

I really enjoyed the vegetables on my entree.  It was a standard mix, but the addition of beets was a nice and pleasant touch.  The fish was ok.  I wish it was more buttery, but it had a great sear and texture.  I do have to mention that my mom ordered the potato crusted halibut and it was the driest piece of fish I'd eaten in a long time.  It looked so plump when it came out, but it just fell apart.

The poached pear wasn't a highlight at all.  I felt like it wasn't cooked enough, as both pears had a lingering vinegar flavour.  That's about it.

Today I took the plunge and decided to try it out. I went in and asked the friendly lady there what she would recommend and she said poppyseed so I ordered three. The lady laughed and said she recommended I order at least six since they will be done by the time I get home. So I joked it off and went on my way home. After a few steps curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a bite. Needless to say I went back and doubled my order. These bagels are excellent! Not too big not too small and very soft on the inside. I would recommend the poppyseed and raisin one. Also they are priced at .65 a bagel which is steal compared to crappy bagels found elsewhere. I'll be coming here regularly.,2016-10-14 21:18:06

Of the three locations mentioned above, this one has the worst service and the food is usually almost as bad as said service, its prices are higher than other locations for no good reason, AND they throw in these hidden ""extra charges"" wherever they deem necessary on top of it! 

On my last reluctant visit, we were in a rush but I so badly needed my shish-taouk fix and this was the nearest place to curb the urge. As it was rush-hour and we were so close by, we ended up eating at the JT location. I was hoping things would be different this time, but they weren't. There was the surly cashier and the testy guys throwing together one's food (they're actually not so bad, especially when you smile at them) who didn't make for a warm welcome, but I went for the food which was a little better than on previous visits, but still way too greasy (I don't have this problem at other Amirs). On top of it, we were charged an extra dollar here and there without any explanation (we didn't notice the charges on the bill until we sat down and started eating), meanwhile we didn't ask for anything extra!

The service I can get over as it's not exactly a sit-down-and-tip kind of place, but their food is always SSOooooOO greasy (or dry if you get the chicken kebabs) and their prices are still higher. If the food was better, I might not mind paying a few extra dollars but it's not! 

This location has a drive-thru window, not that their meals are the kind of thing I'd dare try and eat on the road, but for take-out, it's an option. I'd check to make sure all the items ordered are in the bag before driving away though--this place seems pretty sloppy and careless about what they do. Better yet, I would simply avoid this Amir if I were you.",2013-12-10 20:24:01

My co-worker found this restaurant on another internet site and we decided to try it out for dinner.  From the outside (Scottsdale Rd), it doesn't look like much.  We were tempted to keep driving and find another spot.  Fortunately, we pulled into the lot in the back and saw the very nice patio and true restaurant entrance.   As has been mentioned, the service was just okay; however, the food made up for it.

I recommend the tamales as an appetizer or a light meal.  They were divine!   Also, the crab enchiladas were very good.  You could actually taste (and see) the crab.  I loved the fact that the entree was served with freshly prepared veggies and that you could substitute those for rice and/or beans, if you so choose.

Granted, Phoenix Sky Harbor has added numerous restaurants, but none as satisfying as Chelsea's.

Generally, I travel in the morning, so their Classic French Omelet is my favorite. I add either applewood smoked bacon or ham. The omelet has always come out perfectly cooked, and with exactly the right balance of spinach and gruyere cheese to the eggs. Although I have had numerous breakfasts at Chelsea's, I can not bring myself to have anything different. It is THAT good.

Traveling later in the day, my fallback is the Tuna Sashimi Salad. The Del Mar salad deserves mention, but I am hooked on the Tuna Sashimi Salad.

Service has always been great. I sit at the bar, and the bar staff is very attentive. I've had excellent Bloody Marys on occasion, and their coffee is always really good.

Chelsea's has simply become how I start my travel. I have not been disappointed yet. It is a bit on the pricey side, but nothing is cheap at the airport...",2015-07-17 14:49:35

I was so happy to see they had my favorite- macarons for $1.50! They were not super delicate melt in my mouth but i would definitely get them again. They also have cookies and cupcakes for that 4 o clock sugar fix. The owner is super friendly and talkative. I tried one cupcake (white chocolate frosting with red velvet cake) and it was heavenly.

With a FULL, yes FULL! Menu available 7 days a week until 2am Betty's can't be beat.  A popular haunt for an assortment of ne'er do wells, hipsters, artists, writers, musicians, George Brown College students and faculty alike, smattered with the occasional alcoholic and "" Cougar""-Betty's caters to everyone!

If it's not the selection of 29 draft beers on tap, the speedy unpretentious, yet knowledgeable service, or the ever-present glow of big-screen TV's generously splashing the 'game of the night' or Sportscentre across their screens, then it will be the artery-clogging, meat-sweat inducing, yet unapologetically addicting ""Meat six,"" that will keep you coming back!

At Betty's the menu is as eclectic as the patrons that frequent it, ranging from traditional pub fare such as the standard club sandwich ( known as the Klub Fred), to meaty chicken wings, and nachos to the simply sublime, read the tandoori chicken satays paired with mango dipping sauce, to delicately seasoned pork dumplings.

I haven't even touched on the spacious sun-splashed back patio, which doubles as a utopian urban oasis for those scorching summer afternoons best spent consuming copious amounts of alcohol and eating oneself into a self-induced food coma.  If this is your focus, as it often is mine, then Betty's is where you want to be.

Queen is defined as the female ruler of an independent state, esp. one who inherits the position by right of birth.  Betty's never inherited this designation, no silver-spoon dangled from its privileged mouth at birth.  They have earned all that they have through simply understanding and responding to the needs and wants of their ever thirsty and hungry clientele, day after day, year after year.

I've been to a couple of high end ""gala"" type events here now and have experienced both table service and ""food station"" type service. I have to say I prefer the table service as the food stations never seem to be able to keep up with the volumes of people/ Either way though the food has always tasted good and has been above an beyond your standard hotel fair.

The Imperial ballroom level is nice and lends itself well to large galas or weddings.There is ample space for mingling outside the ballroom (and to set up additional bar and food services).  Washrooms are spacious (there was never a line) and quite clean. The decor there is nice too. The only weird thing is that the men and women's washrooms are quite far from one another. I overheard a few guests perplexed as to where the men's washroom might even be.

Catering staff were friendly and professional, a step above many of the other event venues I've been to recently.

As some of the previous Yelpers have noted, parking isn't cheap. I appreciate expensive daily parking during the week, being a prime downtown location. But $25 for a Sunday night event is a bit ridiculous.",2013-02-25 15:09:22

Then you get to 3 sides.  There are so many to choose from.  I'm biased because I love eggplant, so I always get that one.  As another yelper mentioned, the fried sweet taro is really good! I have tried their green beans,  their lotus roots, their on choy, and tofu.  All are very good! 

And you also get a bowl of soup, or upgrade to a can of pop for 6.65 plus taxes.

Very solid chili chicken

Cons:
Non-Hakka items leave a little more to be desired

We were feeling Hakka one evening and decided to try a place we've never been to before.  As anyone who reads my reviews knows, when it comes to Hakka in the GTA, Fredericks is the king.  Asian Garden is a pretty good choice for Hakka, but it won't be dethroning the king anytime soon.

I came in to order take out.  I don't think they have much staff in the back because even though the place only had one table seated, they told me it still would be a 20-25 minute wait for my food to be ready.  Asian Garden has a good amount of tables but I suspect that take out is the preferred way to go for most of their customers.

Of course when you go to a Hakka place, you have to order the chili chicken.  It is the standard for which I judge Hakka places.  Along with the chicken, I ordered some deep fried shrimp and a mixed vegetable stir fry.  

The chili chicken was pretty good.  It was a drier version than most others you find in the GTA.  It had a good blend of spices which give it a nice kick.  It was by far the best of the 3 dishes I ordered.  The deep friend shrimp looked like pretty big pieces.  When I bit into it, I found that it was actually a couple of smaller shrimps encased by a lot of batter.  It was still OK, but I felt a little misled by presentation.  The vegetables were clearly the dish I liked the least.  They just looked like vegetables you get when you go to food court Chinese food.  They don't seem to offer green beans here which is what I would of ordered usually.

In the end, Asian Garden is a pretty good pick for Hakka if you're in the area.  I would easily recommend their chili chicken and other Hakka specialties but would refrain from the non Hakka items. Also, paying in cash on pick up orders give you a 10% discount.",2017-03-17 12:09:18

Ordered: pepper pork bone with mustard green in hot pot, shredded pork and penny hot sauce lo mein ,and deep fried squid with pepper salt. 
The pepper pork bone with mustard green in hot pot had a lot of vegetables, a fair number of pork bone pieces but there was basically NO MEAT on any of the bones so you're mainly relying on vegetables to get full. They gave us soy sauce and yes, you do need it because there isn't much taste to anything in the hot pot. Silver lining is that it's probably pretty healthy and MSG free. However, for $18.95, totally not worth it. Go have Korean pork bone soup and actually get some meat for half the price. 
That being said, the squid and lo mein were great. The lo mein is my usual go-to item here when I'm feeling indecisive. Consistently good. The squid had a good amount of batter with squid and the squid was firm yet tender enough that I don't have to play tug of war with it.

I wasn't pissed but I was very annoyed that it didn't match the paperwork and they left it empty. So I had to wait 10 min or so for them to go fill it up.  When the guy gets back and I look at it, it's only 1/4 full. I was like what the freakin hell??? I go back inside to let her know so she can match up the paperwork again and I question this and ask why it's not filled up? She said 1/4 of a tank is the minimum they have to fill it.  I said what If I have to do some real moving and stuff around town??? Am I supposed to keep filling it to only a 1/4 of a tank since I know you don't reimburse/give credit back to the customer if it's OVER the amount given to us?? She apologized and just simply said that 1/4 is all they have to fill it to.  

Luckily I was only picking up something at walmart that was too big for my car and that's all I needed the uhaul for, so I didn't use much gas or mileage but it's still ridiculous.

#2,  I had originally planned to pick up the uhaul pickup truck closest to the walmart that had my item and then drop it off at the location closest to my house (only making a 1 way trip)  and they tell me I have to drop it back off at the location I picked it up at.  JUST FYI!!!!!!  It CLEARLY says on their main page on their website and I quote...

""Because U-Haul has over 15,000 locations across the U.S. and Canada, you'll be able to pick up equipment close to your origin and drop it off close to your destination.""


It does not show an asterick or a note or stipulations or says only in town moves or ANYTHING restricting of any type.  and I WILL be fighting this. and I want 1/2 my mileage at 59 cents per mile reimbursed to me.",2012-12-09 16:28:40

VlXVQQHA999fNpAn4hvdvg,TSxpgqzG0u38CGyyLfSAAg,atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg,4,3,0,3,"Metro Brasserie offers the best value for your French dining dollar in town.  Compared to Vincent on Camelback, Christopher's, Zinc Bistro, Coup des Tartes and Sophie's French Bistro, Metro Brasserie is THE go-to French restaurant in Phoenix.  Metro Brasserie fills a HUGE void in this town by offering delicious French food at a reasonable price.  

I really want to give this restaurant five stars but I just can't.  The problem is the menu.  It needs a re-write.  The descriptions are simplified to the point that the menu does not clearly set a diner's expectations.  The prime example was the dish my BF ordered.  The menu described it as ""Poulet Rouge:  roasted chicken, Carolina-Gold rice, vegetables"" ($17).  From the description, I envisioned roasted chicken on a pile of plain rice with a veggie medley.  When I asked our waiter, he clarified that the rice is actually a risotto and they take the meat from the wing and the thigh and blend it into the risotto.  The chicken breast is cooked and rolled in the crispy skin.  Hello?  That's nowhere near what I expected from the menu.  The two women seated near us who were conversing in French called the waiter over after they received their food.  The woman who ordered the chicken had to ask the waiter if she received the correct dish as she didn't recognize it.  The way the chicken breast is rolled and the skin is crisped, when the kitchen slices it into medallions to place on top of the risotto, it looks more like bacon-wrapped scallops.  It's fine to under-promise and over-deliver, but this menu is a clunker and it gets in the way of the excellent food. 

We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes ($11).  When the menu mentioned that they would be served with blue crab, I figured there would be a speck or two on the plate.  I was delightfully surprised when the tomatoes arrived absolutely covered in huge chunks of crab.  This is a generous amount of crab and the combination of the warm, crunchy tomatoes with the cool crab and the sauce remoulade was perfectly balanced.  

The doughy texture of the bread reminded me of the bread sticks at the Olive Garden with a harder crust.  They were good and the warm bread was nicely complimented with herbed butter.  However, I expect mini baguettes to offer up the traditional symphony of crunch that sets them apart. 

Both of us ordered the Frisee au Lardons ($9).  I expected the salad to be frisee tossed with a warm bacon dressing served with lardons (bacon cubes), a poached egg and a crouton.  The menu mentioned a Creole mustard dressing, but I didn't expect the salad to be served cold.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said he would talk to kitchen because it was supposed to be warm.  On his second stop by the table after I brought it up, I finally told the waiter that the fact the salad was served on an ice cold plate (which would have been a good thing if the salad was supposed to be cold), likely contributed to cooling off the dressing.  However, the frisee showed no wilting at all so I don't believe it was ever heated.  The menu description needs to be tweaked.  I would not order this salad again given the cold dressing and I feel like the menu should have told me that.  Maybe a lot of folks who dine here aren't familiar enough with French food to have expectations for classic dishes like this, but the menu should disclose when they're monkeying around with a standard.

I had the Brasserie Burger ($12) and it was utter perfection.  This is bad news for Delux as the burger here is flat-out amazing.  Order it.  You will not be disappointed.  It's the best burger in town.  I splashed out the extra $2 for the Pommes Frites.  They were delicious and serving them in a paper-lined mini metal bucket is genius because it keeps them warm.  

The BF had the aforementioned Poulet Rouge.  He's not the type of guy to order chicken in a restaurant, but both of us agreed we would order this dish again.  The breast meat was perfectly moist and the skin that was crisped around it was utterly delectable.  The one change this dish needs is more aggressive seasoning of the risotto.  Otherwise, this is fantastic and a screaming deal for $17.  

To round out the meal, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($7) and it was excellent.  The warm cake was a nice contrast to the pistachio gelato.  The ice cream arrived a bit melty on the plate, but the flavor combination was spot on.  The crème fraiche was a really nice counterpoint to the sweetness.

Check out the crazy restrooms!  Like Christopher's, they are awfully spacious... 

After enjoying a fantastic meal at Metro Brasserie, I am surprised that I didn't catch on that the concept of this restaurant is ""French country meets the American South"" until I read it on their web site.  True, the fried green tomatoes should have been a huge clue, but it didn't come across via the décor or the menu.   

Metro Brasserie is our new go-to French restaurant.  We will be back!",2009-06-03 19:04:59

This sandwich has a following of devotees just like the McRib.  Only difference is that these followers prefer FOOD to ""food like substance"" (see Mcribwich episode of Simpsons; it was voted the #1 meat flavored sandwich) Not at lee's...This is real fresh made bread, real meat and fast service.  For breakfast I like the croissant sandwiches.  They are HUGE and super fresh.  

I've been to California's best and I will admit there are some amazing mom and pop shops there, but for a chain this is the tops.  We are in a desert, far from Asia, but it's so nice to get some authentic sandwiches so far from their origin.

They gave us chips and salsa right away. The salsa isn't my favorite, but nothing bad about it. the chips were great! (and maybe I was hungry too...)
The taco plates are all around $10. I had the baja fish. The tacos were packed full and very generous portion of fish! The fish has a great crispy panko crust and the cabbage was topped with a fantastic spicy aoili. the bf had the special, which was the red snapper tacos. The server came back and said they only had enough fish for one taco so he could choose one other taco. He chose the carnitas. I tried his snapper taco, which seemed a bit fishy, but that was immediately after eating my tilapia baja taco. He liked it just fine. He also had no complaints with his carnitas taco. 

I ordered a Dark and Stormy, which I was excited to see on the menu. The bartender was very generous with the rum, which is usually a good thing, but I would have liked more ginger beer. But all the drinks are only $5! Unless you're there during happy hour, in which they're even cheaper.
Service was very good. Our bill came to $26 which I think is pretty darn good for 2 great meals (even took almost all the rice and beans from both our plates home for leftovers) and a cocktail.

That is something I have never experienced before. I guess they think they are pretty special. One time we were there the Barmaid carried her 2 year old around behind the bar then sat him down on the bar. I guess that is OK too.

My husband told me that he thought one of my bridesmaid did my make-up since he can see the outline of my foundation.  I told him that the make-up stylist did a horrendous job.  I paid so much money to look like a clown.  The sad part of it all, I really could've done all of this by myself and looked so much better.  Not only that, I've been having difficulty the entire week before my wedding and the day of my wedding where I had no time for anything.  They kept calling me a week before my wedding saying that they can't order my extensions until I come and pay.  The sad part of it all is that when I had my hair extension appointment, to see which color I should get, they told me I can pay everything all at once on my wedding day.  So I agreed to it.  I called them back letting them know and the person I spoke with was a money-hungry bitch.  They kept calling me telling me to come pay the amount and they didn't even let me know how much the hair extensions were!  Oh my goodness! These people are just ridiculous.  I kept asking them for the total for hair/airbrush make up and also the hair extensions.  They completely ignored me!  And finally, when I haven't bothered them about it, they keep calling me demanding payment. HOW CAN I PAY WHEN YOU WON'T TELL ME HOW MUCH IT IS!?!?!?

This was literally going on an hour or two before the make up lady came.  THE MOMENT she walked into the room she asked where to set up. So I told her.  I informed her that I'm having difficulties but I will be paying her.  She literally said, ""How long is it going to take? I have another appointment.""  She made sure that she went super quick with my appointment.  Apparently the other bride is more important than me.  That's great.  So why am I paying you to be here right now?  They finally told me the total cost at the end up the appointment.  FINALLY TOLD ME HOW MUCH IT COST AT THE END OF THE FUCKING APPOINTMENT. This entire situation is so annoying.

I now use 10% Salicylic acid on pimple prone areas, daily Cetaphil facial moisturizer with broad spectrum, Witch Hazel 2x daily all over my skin after my wash with baking soda. All available at Walgreens and CVS. 

During my precious visit another clients appointment ran longer which was perfectly fine with me because I had nothing else plan but how awesome is this- Summer offered a complimentary hydration cleanse on my face and neck all free. I really appreciate the time and knowledge I share with Summer because I'm in the military and skin care hygiene is not up my alley. 

 I recently was in the field (Army training life...ugh!) for a few days and I didn't have my luxury items I would have like to clean my face with. Today I came in for another DermaSound facial cleaning. I'm impressed with everything Summer shares and does, I truly see a difference in my complexion, facial and neck skin and I feel blessed to have met Summer. 

Ladies, if you're in the Las Vegas area this is a beauty Spa you must get your appointment in with. Summer is on Style Seat, 8News Now Las Vegas, PINTEREST, Groupon and Facebook. She's got many affordable deals going on which are all customizable. I wasn't paid nor con' into writing this review, I loved my 3 experiences with Summer thus far and hope I don't get transfer orders from Las Vegas anytime soon OR else I'll be screwed!!!

fykz3d9GWzV00WMH4_wnUQ,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,o5ftMib2dp12c2vqgA5LUg,3,4,1,2,"Note:  I've actually been to Dillon's Thunderbird as well, but I go here more often so I figured people could review this location separately if they wanted.

For anyone whos ever been to Kansas City, they know theres a distinctly different feel when you goto a suburban BBQ restaurant versus an urban BBQ joint.  In Kansas City, a perfect example would be KC Masterpiece Grill (a suburban BBQ restaurant) versus Arthur Bryant's (an urban BBQ joint).  In Phoenix, we have a similar equivalent.  Honey Bear's is more of an urban BBQ joint whereas Dillon's fits the suburban BBQ restaurant to a tee.

The differences between places like Dillon's and Honey Bear's lie mostly in the atmosphere.  Dillon's is a nice easy going sit down restaurant that just happens to serve barbeque whereas Honey Bear's is the type of place where there isn't much room to sit, its sounds like a crowded bar on a busy day, and the aroma grabs you right from the get go.  Each has its charm.  But for this review, let's talk Dillon's food and atmosphere.

Much like their original location at Thunderbird and the 101, the Dillon's at 59th Ave just north of the 101 serves up a cozy restaurant style atmosphere with a full bar near the front and plenty of seating everywhere else (including the patio).  I've never had trouble getting a table here as this place is pretty tucked away near the Arrowhead golf course communities.  The crowd usually varies depending on the type of day, but most of the time you'll see young families, workers from nearby, and couples nearing retirement.   I've always had friendly service, but I've always been baffled by how slow service is.  Like I said, I've never seen it crowded so one would think you could get in and get a meal pretty quick, but its never worked out that way.  So does the food make up for it?

Mostly.  My favorite time to come here is lunch as their lunch menu is basically the same as dinner (only cheaper) and the sandwiches usually hit the spot.  The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are among my favorites as the portion of meat is usually just right and they throw on the right amount of sauce.  Steak fries or beans usually go pretty well with these.  If ribs are your thing, they've got you covered with baby back or pork spare ribs usually being the tried and true favorites.  The appetizers (while diverse) aren't terribly special as they're about what I'd expect to find at most restaurants (onion rings, quesadillas, artichoke dip, etc.).  I will say that the cinnamon apple dumplin for dessert is pretty tasty.

Like I said, the prices are pretty reasonable at lunch.  Dinner is a little more expensive, but still not bad.  So why 3 stars?  Bottomline, its okay.  Nothing great or amazing, nothing bad or disgusting.  Just decent.  The quintessential suburban barbecue spot.  You'll leave satisfied, but probably longing for the more authentic barbecue joint like me.",2008-08-25 21:47:58

All the other major chain sandwich shops are the same, nothing special. I can make those sandwiches in my own kitchen (probably better ones). Not Ike's though, his sandwiches are one of a kind.

This location is relatively new and the service was a liiiiitle slow but the food was worth the wait! I ordered the bbq roast beef sandwich and it was oh so good. Generous portion of meat, appropriate portions of all the toppings and the secret sauce mixed with bbq sauce? yes please!!",2014-05-08 22:23:54

Then there's the BOGO sushi deal every day which is fantastic for lunch. The prices are really reasonable but the problem is I end up eating so much for lunch I end up feeling bloated after everything is done. This is my fault though so I'll cut them some slack for that.

The interior is dimly lit, even during lunch, and the staff seemed a bit disinterested in me? I mean really I was joining my friends for lunch but it took until everyone was finished before I could get a menu and order? Seriously? My water refill was also quite seriously lacking for a while, and the waiter rarely came by to check so there wasn't much opportunity to ask for a refill. But at least the food came out quickly, and tasted quite good which made me happy. Because I was kind of scared about what I'd be getting for such cheap prices. I guess big portions is the name of the game here because I saw the table next to us had ordered some sort of stir fry and that thing was huge!

From 5 stars to 1. I might give it 0 if I could. :-(
This is more about the service than the food.

Had lunch at Bouchon. What a train wreck. I'd indicated we were in a hurry and was told we should be able to order and eat in 30 minutes.
25 minutes later, the food came.
Salads. Minus the salad dressing.
Tiny little $16 salads.
I ask for the manager. He says he will personally make sure they are remade and wont take a half hour
He brings them back in about 10 minutes.
They now have dressing but they are missing cheese and avocado.
$40 comped meal and even being comped didn't make it any better.

Hopefully your mileage varies. Bouchon is capable of so much more.

Old review:
Every dish was exquisite and worthy of gasps of foodgasms. I thought i'd died and gone to foodie heaven. My only gripe was that they are trying to pretend to be a casual French cafe, so in trying to be casual, they skip things like bread plates. For the price, they could put out some bread plates. ;-)
But ignore that minor complaint. If you seriously love food, Bouchon is for you!",2006-03-08 04:50:14

I think there are things that would make it better that are within reach.  That said this is a wonderful place which I enjoyed and would gladly return.

Things that should be worked on:

1.  The salumi is great but it isn't a dish in and of itself.  Getting paper thin slices of cured beef or pork is great but if all there is as accompaniment is a peperoncini and two thin baguette slices that are like crackers, well that's just not that interesting if I am there to dine.  If I was at the bar and this was a way to get me some salt so I had more.beer then I get it but these are not free giveaway dishes designed to encourage consumption of libations.  They are part of the dinner menu.  I would love to see the kitchen do something creative with the cured meats as in actually make something new with them.

2.  The seats are absolutely the least comfortable I have ever sat in in a restaurant not by a roadside in a third world country.   I get that turnover is good, but these seats made me want to stand and eat.  It's rare for seating to actually detract from a meal but these seats do (if you are lucky enough to sit on a bench good for you.  I didn't actually sit on a bench but unless the bench was on fire it would probably have been better than my chair.

Those are my 2 cents.  I actually think the veggish items were better than the straight up charcuterie.

The staff here are super nice and also pretty patient.

I love the idea of just trading out a growler for a fresh, clean, and sanitized one.  I think the only thing they ask you to do is leave about an inch or two of water at the bottom of the growler once you are finished with its contents to nothing gets stuck to the bottom and makes it difficult to clean.

The space is small, and quaint. It is one of those restaurants where the servers remember you, and there are a lot of regulars.

I sat at the high top bar area, which over looked in to the kitchen. There is no doubt that the servers, and the people making the food (one being Alice, the owner) were hard at work. They were slammed on a Sunday morning, and somehow the kitchen area was still kept super clean (super impressive) The only complaint that I have (not even really a complaint, just a heads up) is that all of the food is prepared on the same cooking top. So if you order pancakes, chances are they were cooked on the same spot as some bacon. I am a vegetarian, but this wasn't an issue for me. However, if you have sensitivities, or are vegan you may want to give your server a heads up.

My omelette was one of the best that I have ever had. It was HUGE, and had a ton of veggies on it. In addition, Alice served up home fries with onions and green peppers - made to order on the cook top. 

Service was great - I never had to wait for a refill on my coffee, and even though they were extremely busy the servers were very attentive and asked me how my breakfast was.

We ordered the Wurst special for March... it was a three-course meal that started off with a duck-slice salad doused in a ketchup-type dressing (too expensive for such a small portion of meat.) The main course was a cast iron dish full of over-salted meat (dinky 3"" ""bratwurst"" sausage, non-German flavored lean porkchop, chunk of smoked back bacon or Slanina as we Serbs like to call it), Russian (purple) potatoes (which aren't exotic, by the way... my mother grows these in Calgary), mystery vegetables (half-cooked Radishes? I don't know... it was so dark I couldn't really see my food) and over-salted/weirdly spiced saurkraut. The last dish was a Black Forest Cake experiment gone wrong.

The food is really not German at all... it is too salty, too spiced and not simple enough. Saurkraut should be sour... not pure salt. Meat should taste like meat... not pure salt. Black Forest Cake should have a hint of Kirsch... not be soaked in vodka.

This place is way overpriced. Dinner for husband and I came to around $100 for Dennys-quality food. A real shame... for these high-end prices, I expect a 100% flawless meal and experience... not pub food/atmosphere.

Anyway, if you want to experience real ""German"" food, try Edelweiss for lunch, and also give The Austrian Club (NE Industrial area) a shot. It's not in a fancy area like Wurst is (Mission... probably one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city) but is superior in taste. Great for weddings too.

I'm not sure I like the overall concept of Wurst. There is a noisy bar downstairs and a restaurant upstairs. Problem is... in the restaurant upstairs, the downstairs bar noise overpowers everything.... even the Lederhosen-dressed ""live music"" that walks around playing different tunes (Birthday tunes mostly) is drowned out by the club-type music and very LOUD people downstairs.",2012-05-03 20:22:34

The decor was strip mall gloomy, but I expected that.  The music was a little low, so it was a bit silent when we went in there.  I think turning it up a notch would be great.  The man taking our order was very friendly and offered a sample of the Wednesday Special Eggplant Stew.  My friend ordered that.  I got the Lamb Kabob Entree, and my other friend got the chicken wrap.

To start off, my dish had a lamb kabob, basmati rice w/saffron, and a grilled tomato.  The lamb was very flavorful and not dry, and the rice was okay.  There were a few sliced red onions on the side, but I could have used more.  What was really lacking was pita bread.... oh wait.. under the rice and kabob was a half a pita bread that was hidden.  It was a really poor choice to put it under there.  It soaked all the juices of the kabob and ended up being mushy.

My friend's chicken wrap looked pretty good.  A chicken kabob wrapped around a pita with cucumber sauce and onions.  The fries he got looked double fried.  I think he made a face at me, because they had a brand of ""true chef ketchup"".. and he's from Pittsburgh.

The other friend said the eggplant stew was okay.  With all the mediterranean restaurants around, I was hoping that the special would be the star of the place.

Our waiter was kind enough to rush over and let us know that happy hour was just about to end, if we wanted to get a drink order in.  Oddly enough, we DID want a drink!  I ordered a mojito, which is always a favorite of mine.  They have all sorts of fancy ones, but I just wanted a plain jane mojito.  Not only was it delicious and only $3, it was BIG!  One of my friends swears by the Sangria, and the other had a fancy mojito and loved it too.

We opted to just split some appetizers.  We ordered the Cinnamon dusted chicken flautas, beef empanadas, and a side of corn crusted (something like that) fries.   The fries were very good, but they were just fries.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I guess I thought it would be totally different than regular fries.  The beef empanadas were very good; it's just shredded beef cooked up in puff pastry.  A very simple idea, and one I plan to try at home sometime soon.  The beef was a little bland, but it was a very filling and satisfying little treat.  But now for the best... the cinnamon chicken flautas.  Hoooooooooooooooooooooooly cow did I love those things.  I've already been back once since, and I know I should try other things, but I couldn't resist.  I've found myself craving them at the oddest times.  They are just shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla, cooked and rolled around in cinnamon.  Sounds weird, but absolutely wonderful.

I want to give it 5 stars for those flautas and mojitos, but based on the other two items (and until I try something else there) and their terrible, terrible Tostitos tortilla chips, I'm going to stick it at a 4.

indirect fire is fundamentally ingrained in all. There is something
delicious about the char-grilled flavor and marks that have us
crawling back for more.

I do not know what style of BBQ this is. Is it Memphis, Kansas City,
Carolina, or Texas style? I am not sure, but it is appetizing. The
variety of sauces are different in their own way. There is nothing
more disappointing than getting ready to try all the sauces to and
finding out that they do not have much distinction. My favorite is the
Wilbur's Revenge. It gets some brownie points for references to a
childhood classic, Charlotte's Web. This is their spiciest and it does
not hit you until the aftertaste.

I was not hungry, but my dining buddy was ravenous, so we got the
Dave's Sassy BBQ salad and an order of 12 boneless wings. I know, who
goes to a BBQ joint and orders a salad. I would have agreed with
everyone who makes this statement, but there is something irresistible
about this one. For being a basic greens salad, we opted for the
pulled pork and then smothered it in the Wilbur's revenge made it
thoroughly enjoyable. Normally, I shy away from over dressing a salad,
but not here. BBQ sauce might be my kryptonite. The boneless wings are
nothing special, just your run of the mill variety. For the $10, you
are paying roughly the same price as Buffalo Wild Wings on Boneless
Thursday. If you are dining on any other day of the week, it is a good
deal. If you want more options on sauces then go on Thursday to BWW.

The prices are cheaper than Lucille's, but I will wait until I try
their ribs before I start comparing. Two meats, two sides, and corn
bread at Dave's cost about $10 dollars less than their competitor.",2011-04-28 06:58:48

It was the day after UW Men's basketball had a major win in the March Madness tournament, and, unfortunately, many of their staff called in sick that morning. (Hey Kids - if you're going to run with the big dogs, ya gotta get your butt out of bed the next day!) Brunch service was not top notch that day, but the manager who was both managing the floor and waiting tables was hustling and apologetic. 

I think the food is good, but not great. There are a lot of brunch places in Madison, many of which have signature items. Avenue offers a pancake flight, but none of the offerings appealed to me or my friend so I went with an eggs Benedict dish and my friend had French toast. The EB was good. I had a side of potatoes. The server asked if I wanted onions with my potatoes, and of course I did. The strange thing, though, is that the onions were clearly not skillet fried with the potatoes. They were cooked separately and thrown on top, but not in a good, garnish-like way. The flavors didn't blend together at all, which is odd, because onions and potatoes are usually a great marriage.

The place is good for groups and has a solid following, so I would return, but it's not a place I would suggest to others. There are many other better brunch options in Madison, starting with Eldorado Grill and Umami, which are only a few blocks away.",2015-04-17 14:01:11

Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered ""The Prosciutto"" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich ""panini"" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details.

K8Qnlvb7OhOxaRQonAeDIg,8x-lBENayDizUL8wXlTyOg,WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg,4,0,0,0,"Vapiano's is designed and laid out like a stylish European quick service restaurant. As you walk in you are handed a plastic charge card the size of a credit card. When you order the food, the price is added to the card and you pay for everything as you leave.

Since everything is self service, tipping is not required, however, leaving a couple of dollars for the person cleaning tables never hurts.

The food selection ranges from a wide variety of pasta (made fresh in house) with different meat, vegetable and sauce options to pizza, sandwiches and salads. All of the dishes are priced reasonably and the portion sizes are generous. 

The overall atmosphere is casual with decor that would not be out of place in a much more upscale restaurant. 

There are two reasons why Vapiano's did not receive a 5 star rating from me:

The amount of meat, seafood, etc. that comes with most of the dishes tends to be on the small to miniscule side.

The other proplem is the consistency of the food. Depending on the cook that prepares your order, your food may be over or under seasoned. 
The other night we ordered the Pesto E Spinaci and the ""hint"" of basil pesto ended up being a big heaping boat load of pesto.

I'll admit that when I came across Fractured Prune Doughnuts, the only thing mildly appealing about their name was the word ""doughnuts."" Prune donuts? No. Luckily their odd name has nothing to do with the shriveled up plums typically reserved for those trying to stay ""regular."" The shop is purportedly named after a local 1800's athlete named Prunella, whose brittle bones earned her the nickname ""Fractured Prune."" Not sure if it's the best name for a donut shop but anyway....History lesson over - let's move on to the treats!

Now I recognize that there are a lot of boutique-style donut shops all over the country. Not unlike the cupcake craze, these eateries try to wow consumers with a dizzying array of decadent and unusual toppings. Fractured Prune is no different. They have everything from Marshmallow Madness (marshmallow glaze topped with marshmallows) to the seemingly now ubiquitous Bacon Bomb (bacon and cinnamon - is this bacon fad ever going to end??). Unlike many donut places that offer different types of base doughs (cake, raised, chocolate, pumpkin spice, etc.), Fractured Prune only offers one - a basic cake donut. Like Krispy Kreme, they take the base donuts and simply dip them into different glazes and add toppings. The good news is that when that inner tube of cake dough reaches it's destination after floating down the hot grease river (yes, like KK you can watch the entire journey!) the result is decadent and delicious. Also, unlike other shops where they make all the donuts and display them in the window, they won't dip your donuts until you order them, so they are guaranteed fresh.

You order by using a handy paper slip, describing each of their creations. You can also flip the script and make your own. I opted for the Salted Caramel and the Ms. Prunella.

The Salted Caramel is exactly what you would expect. The aforementioned cake donut, dipped in a caramel glaze and topped with sea salt. It came in a tray and it looked like a hot mess, so I went Seinfeld and attacked it with a fork and knife. The cake itself was heavenly - piping hot with the perfect texture. It was a bit on the greasy side, which I suppose is to be expected. The caramel glaze was a little runnier that I would've liked but still nice and sweet. Unfortunately it seemed like all the flavors were completed overshadowed by the salt. It was very salty. I am a sucker for salted caramel treats and I like that hint of saltiness to balance out what is typically an over-sweet dessert, but in this case, it was just too much.

Water-break (they have a water cooler tucked away in the back corner! Great palate-cleanser)

Next: On to Ms. Prunella. I supposed that this would be the closest thing to their ""signature"" donut and that is why I ordered it. It starts again with the basic cake donut, this time dipped in a mixed berry glaze and topped with cinnamon sugar. This one was much more palatable - the sweet/tart of the mixed berry glaze hit the spot! This is one I would order again.

All in all, I enjoyed trying out Fractured Prune. It was a nice treat on a relatively cool day. If you do decide to try them out, I would recommend that you eat them right away so you can properly enjoy that hot dough. At $2 a pop, they aren't necessarily cheap, but they aren't even close to some of the ridiculous prices you see people paying for those fancy cupcakes.

I paid a visit the first week it opened and service was ok at best, the menu didn't properly describe the food, and I left underwhelemed.  I returned six month's later and we got terrible service, a menu that didn't properly explain the dishes, and ho hum food.  I went back last year and sat at the bar instead of a table and service was great, the food was good, and it was a three-star experience.  It might have been a four-star experience had I not heard constant employee high-school-like gossip going on in full customer view and earshot.  At that point, I decided this just wasn't the place for me.  Much to my dismay, some friends really wanted to go here recently.  I reluctantly attended and I really wish I just opted out for the night or forced everyone to head down the street to Lola.  GHT's prices are pretty much the same to that of Lola anyways.

First, service sucked worse than ever.  Our server seemed distracted and scatterbrained.  She got most of our orders wrong and our drinks arrived about the same time our main course arrived.  Our second round of drinks didn't come until it came time to pay our bill--about 20 minutes after we ordered them.  She gave us the drinks for free given all the trouble, but she put another table's food on our bill.  It took us 30 minutes to actually get out of the place because of the check problems.  I would have asked to see a manager, but our server was barely present that it wasn't even worth the additional hassle.

I didn't bother to order anything fancy because it all seemed priced higher than the value.   I wouldn't mind checking out the pig's head, but it wasn't available and I'm told they generally only have a few each week.  I wonder if it's really any good or just something over-hyped through legend.  If it's like the pig's head at Au Pied de Cochon in MontrealI, then count me in.  But past experience tells me this pig's head is popular in Cleveland lore because no one around town does a pig's head.  So... I opted for the over-priced burger.  The burger was a letdown.  What I hear is supposed to be some fancy custom grind, actually tasted like 85/15 grocery store ground beef. My friends got the lamb burger, which tasted ok with the bite I stole, but it wasn't worth the $17.  Not by a mile.

With all I've said, I want to be clear that my rating is based only on my most recent visit, the quality of service at that visit, the quality and value in the burger, and the quality and value of the lamb burger.  During this visit, service is the worst I've seen out of any restaurant, the beef quality wasn't worth the price, and the lamb burger was absurdly overpriced.  I don't think I could go back to try anything else.  I'm worried ab out service and I'm worried about whether I'm wasting my money if I buy something more substantial and expensive.  Truthfully, I don't get the hype about this place.  I never have.  This restaurant seems to be the product of successful marketing winning over quality of product and service.",2014-06-30 18:46:46

The main bar is on the first floor (ground level) and bigger than the previous one.

But since everything tastes good, you can't really go wrong.

I like the peking duck here. The skin is nice and crispy and cut thinly. The meat is juicy but not fatty. It's fairly lean. It's not fancy but it's very flavorful. The second dish with lettuce wrap and stir fry duck was very tasty as well.

Purposely drove across town to try some pastries. I know it's late in the day and they wouldn't have much options (it was about 4pm). Got there and they lady was putting everything away saying they closed an hour early during summer... Which the hours didn't reflect on Yelp or even on the hours listed on the door. But she was nice enough to take my order.

Got the pretzel croissant, cherry cobbler thing, chocolate coin, and I asked for a crunch cake and German cheese cake and didn't get the cheese cake and ended up with 2 crunch cakes. Fairly inexpensive for everything though... Less than $14

But nothing was spectacular. I was really looking forward to the pretzel croissant but it was underwhelming. Not that flaky, not buttery, not' pretzely'. The chocolate ring was okay but there's an amazing little bakery in Arizona that is soooooo much better. The cakes were not great. I had a couple bites of each and tossed em.

The layout hasn't changed, however, it has new flair to suit District One. I really like all the decals on the back wall!

I came with a few Yelpers (The Q's, David V., and Paolo) and it was a new experience for most of us. We shared both of their chicken wings selections; Tamarind Wings ($6.95) and Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings ($6.95). The wings were fried without a batter and tossed/dressed in light sauces of their respective flavors. Both selections were bland, lacking a pinch of salt, however, the Garlic Serrano had great flavor potential. Without a batter, the wings lacked any type of crunch or bite. Additionally, the orders came with pickled vegetables (carrots and daikon) that were good! We also tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio ($10.95), served with lime juice, white onion, and peanuts. The sauce (soy sauce and oil base) was very tasty and it made the beef taste amazing.

Everyone ordered their own dishes, like Fish Tacos ($8.95), Tomato Rice (side order; $1.50), and the District One Rice Combo Platter ($11.95). The fish tacos were made with hamachi sashimi, avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomato in fried wonton ""shells"" and came in a set of three. It was okay, but nothing special. The tomato rice also lacked flavor and warranted a shrug. For the Combo Platter, you can choose between chargrilled short ribs or pork chop and it comes with kimchee, pickled vegetables, lap xuong (Chinese sausage), and a fried egg. The chargrilled short ribs were good and had a nice ""char"" flavor (no marinade).

I ordered the Slow Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice ($8.95), served with a soft boiled egg, and Jasmine rice. This was really delicious! The meat was soft and tender and the sauce created from the coconut juice and pork belly was fragrant. I threw my whole bowl of rice into the stone pot to utilize every drop of the succulent sauce. Even if there weren't any other successful dishes, I would come back just for pork belly coconut juice! Everyone else seemed to really enjoy it as well.

Service was really nice! We didn't realize that we had stayed almost an hour after their closing time, however, they were really cool about it. I like the menu because of its focus on Vietnamese fusion and obviously, that makes it unique. I don't eat Pho, but the MP Lobster Pho is definitely enticing! Not sure how much the price fluctuates, but it was approximately $27 last week. Anyway, I'm willing to give the other dishes a try and if anything, I'll always have the pork belly as a back-up plan!",2014-03-18 05:01:53

It was kind of disappointing for the price of 18.99. Sure price of shrimp went up this year, but still, for almost 20 bucks this dish is mediocre. Then, tasted ""The Monterrey"" for around 16-17 bucks I believe, I chose it cos it looked delish in the picture. Again, it was just okay but better than the Shrimp Fajita. Also ordered their Mucho Margarita, and that one was spot on. Will probably go here next time for happy hour and see what they offer. Service was borderline rude. I was with my parents that time, so I assumed I might whip up my ID just in case, and the server said "" I dont need the ID, it's okay"". Then I asked jokingly ""why do I not look you ng anymore?!"" (im 24 lol) and she said ""no not anymore"" with a couple of hahas. Gee, thankssss. But yeah anyway, minus that little situation, ambiance is pretty with fake coconut trees and cloud ceiling.

Maybe I worked in the service industry too long but in my view you are supposed to say ""Hi! someone will be with you as soon as possible"".

Environment- The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous; when we were there I remember seeing beautiful fresh flowers in vases everywhere. I loved that. Because it was a nice time of year we sat outside, where there was a beautiful brick fire place. 

Service- From what I remember our server was great and our food came out in a timely manner. 

Food- My boyfriend and I still talk about the fried pork cheek and ham hock...DELICIOUS. I also got macaroni and cheese with bacon for an appetizer...cheese heaven. Our entrees were just as amazing, my bf had the short ribs and I had the Osso Buco, which I highly recommend.

We went for dinner after the dinner rush at 7pm, this place was super noisy to the point where we couldn't have a conversation with people at the table. Seemed like they were seating by the rooms vs by server, so once one room was filled up they would seat in another area. 

My biggest complaint is that I ordered Veal Marsala, my veal was VERY overcooked and tough to even cut into, I did tell our server who swapped out for Chicken Marsala however it took them about 40 minutes and by the time I was super annoyed and not hungry let alone my friends and family were already finished eating. Also, two people at my table ordered meatballs, they were also overcooked and came to the table luke warm, they were not eaten and asked to be taken off the bill. The manager said that the meatballs were boiled and probably at the bottom of the pot and not stirred. 

Christina was our server and probably the ONLY thing positive I can say was that she was very sweet and accommodating however I would suggest giving this girl a promotion to manager as the manager who came to speak with us never introduced himself, had a bad attitude and did the bare minimum by taking the meatballs and Marsala off the bill but his attitude wasn't one of a manager should have. The only way I knew his name was that his initials are on the bill and it on the door. 

And for a suggestion.....it would be really nice if they offered gluten-free pasta for those of us with allergies since they are a pasta establishment. I had 5 things to choose from, and 3 of those I couldn't eat...you know the rest of the two other options. Meh!",2013-08-19 03:48:13

I brought my parents here during their visit to Toronto.  They're used to low-quality American seafood chains, like Red Lobster.  This was a big step.  We generally enjoyed our experience, but there were a few issues:

The FOOD: First, off the lobster supper rocks.  It is a large whole lobster + mashed potatoes + creamed spinach + bread.  At the $25 special, it's a great deal.  The only issue was that they serve the lobster 100% whole too hot to handle.  We had to send it back to get them to slice it in half and provide some instruction to us newbies.  

We also had the 
--Lobster Mac & Cheese ($14): incredibly rich, a definite hit
--Lobster cappuccino ($6): hmm...not sure what they were going for here.  Not much lobster involved.

Suggestion for 2: Order the lobster dinner + one other dish & share.

The DRINKS: We went for wines over cocktails.  It turned out they were having lots of issues with their on-tap wines.  This really delayed things (we're talking 30+ minutes), and they didn't really offer a very good substitute.  They managed to rustle up some alternative bottles, but didn't offer us the lower prices.  As much trouble as we had here, I honestly might have expected some sort of comp.

I saw the lobster caesar...kind of not my thing.  I like caesars, I like lobster tails, but I'm not sure it enhances either to combine the two...weird.

The SERVICE: Our server was friendly, but rather harried.  I wouldn't call the service good, nor bad.  We definitely were ignored for quite a while, and there could have been a lot better service with the wine issues.  

OVERALL, I think this is a great place to come for the lobster supper on a Sunday.  I don't think I would pay that much any other day.  The food was quite tasty, but there were definitely a few kinks that kept it away from the 5-star mark.",2014-02-07 19:24:39

I've also been to Cabo for brunch and dinner. Our brunch experiences have been delightful and, if memory serves me correctly, I had a stellar bloody mary the last time I went there for lunch.

My only beef with Cabo Fish Taco is that they don't take reservations for dinner (or at least they didn't the few times I've called), I sincerely hope they'll reconsider because I would love to add the restaurant to our repertoire of locations to go for birthday celebrations and/or to bring out of town guests but I don't like to wait in line for 45+ minutes for a table.

Great Clips has always been a standby for me.  I hesitate to say a reliable standby simply because despite my relatively simple haircut needs, the results have been far from reliable.  But at $15 each visit, its at least a cheap standby.  Still, there are times when the haircut has to look right.  Special occasions especially.  With Great Clips its always been a gamble depending who my stylist is.  Having had enough haircuts gone awry, I finally got up the courage to take a shot at a more professional salon.  And fortunately, one such salon is mere steps away from my apartment in Downtown.

Coiffeur has been around for awhile now and given the high praise from fellow Yelpers (both men and women), its easy to see why they're still going strong.  The salon itself has the modern urban feel you would expect here in Downtown, but thankfully without the pretentiousness I feared.  Case in point, my guy Isreal.  I've been coming to get my haircut by Isreal for months now and the guy is as enjoyable to joke around with as he is reliable with his tools.  Israel will share stories and jokes for days, all the while doing a bang up job on my hair.  Every time I've come here he's gotten it spot on.  

Yes, I pay almost twice as much here as I would at Great Clips, but I get more here too.  The treatment here is more personalized, the stations are roomier and more comfortable, the hair rinse is complimentary, the tools at each stylist's disposal far more diverse, and most importantly they've gotten it right every time.  As a bonus, they give a discount if you live in the Roosevelt Square Apartments as I do.

So I guess in the end change wasn't as hard as I thought.  In the case of my hair, change has meant peace of mind and a friendly, fun experience with the staff at Coiffeur.  Though to be fair change will be tough the day I have to find someone who's on his game with my hair and his comedy routine as much as Isreal is.",2016-06-23 01:26:46

On this fine evening members of the Yelp community and I invaded this place. Like a gang of food thugs we dove right in mercilessly. The atmosphere was tense and the crowd was subdued? I dunno.

I am going to give this place 3 stars because the food is really hit and miss. The portions are ridiculous to say the least! There's just way too much food for your money, even the very thought of the sheer size of those dishes make me cringe still.

While everything was certainly flavourful, I do find some dishes (like the stews and their baked pie/bread thing--both were quite enjoyable) to be a little on the salty side. Coming from an Asian that's quite a statement! They are also heavy with their dill and parsley as it was probably the only thing green in the dishes! LOL Jokes aside, it was a meat and carb fest to say the least. The delicious dumplings were so big they dwarf mother Russia but the one caveat was the semi raw dough on the top where the dumplings are pinched. The rice pilaf was way too dry and overcooked. Soups were pretty decent but nothing to rave about; though I did enjoy the borscht. Perhaps the one and only outstanding item was the Crepes ""Suliko""; with that delicious ground beef in that pillowy, eggy wrapper.

The Family that runs/owns the place are first and foremost intelligent, and as such have shaped their business to reflect a niche within the community. Sam's is many things -- a sports bar (well done renovation!), a pool hall, a place designed to cater to a variety of desires and demand (IE that a large, casual group may require), a Sunday brunch location (excellent one, given the cost), a one-on-one meeting place... they really understand community. Although the design of the place may appear 'chain-business', that is far from the actual case. Rather, the appearance of Sam's indicates the dynamic range of what type of 'business demands' the owners are prepared to respond to. Instead of pulling the 'niche' marketing interior design, Sam's has evolved (as any community business will) to accommodate multiple business scenarios. To sound a touch academic, Sam's is a fine illustration of why R Buckminster Fuller stated that humans expressed their best potential because, as a species, they were the ultimate (metazoic) generalists (see: Critical Path)
     This business will not specify its abilities -- it doesn't need to. They are sincere with what they will do. Their brunch is more than fine. Top-attention paid by whosoever is working. Their beer selection is an expression of what the community drinks -- ditto their range of spirits and wines. Many food items indicate what locals demand, and some menu items indicate what the family has pride in. For example, their Borscht is in the running for the best borscht you can order in Calgary. It is specific to the culture and geography, yet I would put it up against any other borscht in town (outside of making it from scratch).
     The people involved in the business deserve full stars. So much patience, sincerity and local accommodation. I cannot describe in a short review how these people really are the foundations and the capstone of their business. If you want to experience what Hillhurst-Sunnside is like, check out Sam's quite a few times. No visit will be like the other, yet you will notice a 'sameness' (community) running through each event.

We arrived around 5:00 and seated quickly. However it seemed there was only one waiter for the entire dining room. We sat for well over 10 minutes before he came over. No drinks and no bread. 

Once he did come to our table we ordered drinks and dinner. All glasses of wine are $5 for happy hour which is nice. We decided on the pot roast with soup and a house salad. It was quite a while before we finally got our drinks, and still no bread. The salad came out and finally bread. Did not care for the raisin bread, too sweet for dinner. 

The pot roast came out a while later after we had finished the salad and soup. The plates were never removed. They sat on the table the entire meal, up to the bill.  The pot roast was chewy and the broccoli overcooked. I swear the mashed potatoes were instant. After we were done the waiter offered us dessert. We chose the apple crisp after offering us about 5 choices. He returned and said all they had tonight was a brownie, they were out of everything else. 

In the waiters defense it seemed like he had a lot of tables and had no help. The manager finally came out to assist him but by then it was too late. Service was a ZERO.

As always I'll start with the positives. 

Very clean dining area but it just opened so I expect that. 

Good malt & good fries. I tried the black bean burger. I can't say it was bad but it's not my preference. It was just that, black beans & only black beans with spice. No other veggies so I'm sure some enjoy this type of burger but it just wasn't my cup of tea. 

Now onto the negatives. First, it was raining   like crazy we parked right in front of the door and have a newborn so we made a mad dash for the door. To my surprise when we opened it there stood two employees chatting guess they couldn't open the door for customers? Strange. The employees were just awkward, first job for majority of them I'm sure but very weird. No sense in going into further detail but very weird behavior. They charged us wrong. Charged us for a root beer float rather than just a root beer. We signed & then recognized the error so they fixed it but we'll have to watch our statement to make sure we don't get charged twice.  

As we were ""enjoying"" our meal someone was banging very loudly on the back door. For a few mins this went on.Another patron had to get up and inform an employee. Turns out another employee got locked out in the rain & I guess they couldn't walk around to the front of the restaurant. Again, weird. Let's bang on the door with a restaurant full of customers.

I asked for something anytime this week and they said they could fit me in today, giving me a choice of three different time slots.

I was actually quite worried that the place would be pretentious, because I'm very wary of people in the services industry judging me. I can't even order pizza without worrying that the man on the phone thinks I'm a tool. Call it a quirk? Anyway, I got there and everyone was lovely. I couldn't have asked for nicer people. Really warm and friendly.

Considering I made my appointment so last minute I was practically a walk-in, I didn't ask for any particular stylist. I ended up with Matthew and the two of us had a grand time. I told him I hadn't had a haircut since I left Ireland and that it needed to be done, but that I didn't really want a hair cut at all. I told him short hair makes me look like Kelly Osbourne but right now the condition was just awful, and despite three years of growing out half a decade of Kelly hair, I was ready to let go of some of the length.

LONG story short, my hair turned out fantastic -- a million times better than I had hoped. Matthew was very meticulous and his attention to detail was mental. The man did things to my bangs that I never knew was possible (and I'm a complete hair salon slut, not to mention a demon with a scissors, so I've had it all)!! He was also just a medium amount of chatty, which was nice. I get shy at the hair dressers, and when I'm nervous, I ramble. A few times he asked me questions, about where I was from, my job, whatever, and I could hear myself starting to babble, so I had to catch myself and just tell my mouth to shut up. Still, he didn't seem to mind my babbling or my bouts of silence!

At the end of the day, I expected to come home moderately happy; knowing I'd done the right thing but depressed that I'd lost half my hair. I actually like it as much as my old hair!! YAAAY! At $68, I was pretty pleased. His next appointment actually arrived before he was finished and he still took his time, cutting this strand and that until it was perfect.

Step 2: Put your name on the list, and okay-- now you can read more reviews while you wait!

I'm obsessed with KBBQ, and while I was initially skeptical that it could be THAT good, this has got to be the best KBBQ I've ever had. I had Hobak for dinner last night, but I'm dreaming about it today still.

1. Everyone else knows the hype is real. Line is long at peak hours.
2. Pick your combo. The short rib (kalbi) and skirt steak are AMAZING! Everything melts in your mouth! 
3. Your server cooks it for you to perfection. Our guy, James, was incredible. Genuine vibes, so nice, and funny. He's rocking a sweet K-Pop frosted hairdo, so you can't miss him. 

Even though it's not AYCE, we went home with hardcore leftovers after eating and eating and eating. I like how they cook each meat individually and wait for you to finish a round before continuing; normally not a fan of people cooking it for me since they dump it ALL on the grill at once, and it gets cold before I can eat it. 
The quality is the food is so good. 
Banchan unlimited, of course. 

The staff here will truly make a good experience great. Since table turnover is a lot less (you'll end up spending two hours here), I'd recommend hooking your staff up with a killer gratuity if they did good by you. My first trip to Hobak was 5 star service that deserves 5 star appreciation!",2017-05-16 16:48:19

My friend and I came here last week during their soft opening and they only accepted cash since they haven't install their debit/credit machine yet. Tbh, that was a bit of an inconvenience but luckily I bank with TD and it was just right around the corner. It was hard to find street parking during the day as their was a 20 minutes time limit. I resulted in parking by the carousel but mind you, that lot is also small (limited parking spots). My friend told me there was underground parking within the condo but I am not sure since I didn't bother trying looking for the entrance. Worst case scenario, you can always park across the street where Goodlife, Theatre, etc. and just walk over.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staffs. We came right when store open so they were still getting everything ready. Menu options were either build your own poke bowl or choose one of their signature ones. I decided to build my own so that way I know for sure I won't waste any toppings that I won't enjoy. I don't remember the price exactly but it was around $10 for customizing and each topping was almost $1 so it does add up. I remember my bowl after tax was $13 and change which wasn't bad. My poke included brown rice, spicy salmon, avocado, masago, seaweed, zucchini/cucumbers, fried garlic, sesame, and spicy aioli sauce. I like that the bowl was a decent amount, ingredients were fresh, and they were generous with toppings. 

The place is small so not a lot of seatings but it's definitely a quick in and out spot and I noticed most people do take out. Overall, enjoyed my experience and looking forward to coming back more often since it's very close to home.",2018-05-20 03:02:36

It was one of the first places I went to eat with my husband (then boyfriend) and I'm emotional so there's that. They were like just becoming popular when I moved out of NY and the only ones I knew of were the one right by my school in Westbury, the one inside Penn Station, and one random one we found one day walking from the Museum of Natural History. And now I know this one, located inside the Scottsdale Fashion Center. This was my first time in Scottsdale, period, and all I have to say is it must be nice to be rich, lol. Anyway, I love that all Shake Shacks have treats themed around whatever area they're in, that's super cute. But Shake Shack was already fairly pricy so once you put one inside of a mall you're dealing with really overpriced burgers and hotdogs. My husband ordered a Shack Burger with regular fries and I ordered cheese fries and a black and white shake. I remember begrudgingly ordering that shake because I KNEW it wasn't going to be $6 worth of shake but to my surprise  the waitress swiped a coupon and I got it for free so thank you, sis! But for $6 I want a lot of shake, I want a shake and that it was not. It was delicious though, my first time ordering a black and white. I love their crinkle fries and I think their cheese sauce is super tasty, my husband is not a fan but he's picky. I have to really be in the mood for a burger to order one but I had a bite of my husband's and I would put the Shack Burger way above any burger from In & Out, Sonic, McDonalds or Burger King, for sure. It even looks fresher.

Additionally, they have a policy of reserving seats at the bar for their usual favorite customers so when you arrive to attempt to eat at the bar, you will be thwarted by the tiny ""Reserved"" signs at any of the available seats. It appears that there is some inside group of people who are able to reserve seats at the bar even though they are not immediately eating.  The bartender informed us that there wouldn't be any bar seating available tonight because no on had even ordered yet when we arrived at 6:30.  Essentially a group of squatters sits their with their napkins on the bar and bread in front of them while they drink their vodka drinks and socialize.  Why not get a table if that's the plan?

I had pretty low expectations for this place after reading the Summerlicious menu. The entrees didn't seem spectacular and there was a pretty big discrepancy in price between lunch ($15) and dinner ($25) even though the menu was mostly identical. 

Reservations were easy to make although the hostess made an error with the number of seats we wanted. My dining companion was quite shocked to hear that our reservation was mistakenly made for 18 instead of the agreed-upon 2. 

Fast forward to dinner: 
The location is great and if you live in Toronto, you've most likely walked bast the restaurant multiple times. The inside is narrow but had comfortable seating. I loved the rustic decor and the novelty moose behind our seats. Free wifi is definitely welcome since you can always escape to your phone if your dinner partner turns out to be a dud.

Came here on a rainy Friday night for a dinner with a friend and had a good time! I liked the ambience of the restaurant as it was really cozy and simple.  

We asked the waitress for her recommendations so we ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki and sukiyaki wafu spaghetti with a side order of okonomiyaki fries to share. We were really impressed with the fries. There were a ton and they were nice and crisp with skin-on (the best!). The sweetness of the steak sauce balanced well with the freshness of the green onion and creaminess/sweetness of the mayo! The pastas were tasty too. The shrimp okonomiyaki tasted exactly like the fries except it was on spaghetti with four shrimp. Personally I found the sukiyaki better than the shrimp but maybe that's because I indulged on the too similar okonomiyaki fries first. The shrimp pasta was on the heavy side but that's just me! All in all I really enjoyed this unique twist on pasta.

The short cake (from the nearby nakamura bakery) was a nice way to end a good meal. 

On the down side, I wish we ordered one of the other pastas for variety because everything tasted too similar (sweet tasting) after a while. Next time I will opt for the tomato based and cream & rose based pastas! Value is not terrible nor great, but is decent.

Service was great, despite our exhaustion from skating earlier our thirst was quenched and our water were refilled frequently :) We arrived at 9pm and despite the place closing at 10, we were never rushed. We even stayed 10/15 minutes past closing without any fuss.",2016-01-20 00:56:08

I reserved a car an hour before pick up and it was ready for me. The staff was very friendly and easy to talk to. The location is not hard to find, they had plenty of cars to choose from at the time of my visit!

I rented a nissan versa note for 2 days and paid the quoted price. The car was great, cold air, runs smooth, clean, and great mpg! The car was also practically new with only 20k miles on the dash so it had up-to-date technologies including a USB charger directly to your iphone/android. Unlimited miles!

Ask for Dale. I'm sure the other staff are also as great as him but I've had a pleasant experience with him. No hidden fees, doesn't bug you about getting their insurance and such. I would come back here whenever I need to get out of town again!

You pay what you are quoted basically. No hidden fees!

My son and I both had the Filet Wrap and shared a side of Basmati.  The side was fairly large, definitely enough for two people.

The filet meat was well-seasoned, and tender, very yummy.

On the downside, I thought the amount of meat was a little skimpy.  My son ran out of meat and still had about 1/3 of his wrap left.  Bummer.

I'm going to go back and try some of the daily specials, which all look tasty and appear to be a better value than the $7.99 wrap that comes only with a wrap and a good sized tub of tzatziki sauce.

I felt the filling in the xiao long baos to be a bit too salty. I think I drank at least 3 cups of tea while eating them. The beef rolls were decent, and the beef noodle soup was ok. The beef was tender in the beef noodle soup, but I thought the soup base was nothing memorable. I've also rarely seen broccoli in traditional beef noodle soup, but I'm not really going to complain about that since I do love broccoli...but just a little different from what I've had before?

C'est prouvé que lorsqu'on travaille dans des cafés, notre productivité est augmentée de par le son ambiant des conversations, l'agitation des percolateurs et les rires des baristas. Il y a même des trames sonores de café que tu peux télécharger pour écouter chez toi en te faisant à croire que ton travail avance plus vite ('mettons). 

Un matin, je me sentais boboche, alors j'avais besoin d'un café pour m'encourager à travailler sur mes affaires. Je me rends donc dans Ahunstic pour découvrir la nouvelle location du Brûloir, tout récemment rénové. Une fois installée, ça me frappe: Au travers du claquements des tasses et des coups de porte-filtres se glissent des douces notes de violon et de piano. De la belle musique classique au lieu du traditionnel indie-pop. Première gorgé de café, la mauvaise humeur sort d'un soupir et mes joues retrouvent leur teinte rosée. 

La particularité du Brûloir, c'est qu'ils ont une impressionnante collection de cafés torréfiés à même sur place. C'est donc l'endroit parfait pour acheter des grains frais à ramener chez soi et essayer plein d'affaires afin de comprendre si tu aimes plus ton café fruité ou avec des notes de chocolat. 

Le soleil frappe chaque mur de l'endroit, grâce aux grandes vitres qui découvrent la devanture du petit local. Ou c'est peut-être aussi le grand sourire des employés, qui t'accueillent avec une voix si douce que tu te sens comme dans un cours de yoga. Mais on est vite ramené à la réalité; les ustensiles s'entrechoquent à l'arrière, et une odeur de grilled-cheese à la poire s'entremêle à celle des pâtisseries.

This is by far the WORST company we have ever done business with. Initially when we went here we had fantastic customer service and our sales gal was very helpful. We bought a brand new sectional and bedroom set. Now to some people $4000 might not seem like a lot of money but to us its not a purchase we take lightly. We were leery about doing the financing but thought this was a good option for us, we also were happy to hear we got a warranty. So lets cut to three weeks later when we had our delivery scheduled for (the day we moved in to our new place). The delivery was NOT on time, in fact they tried to reschedule day of saying that they were at our home (earlier than they were supposed to be, I was moving from out of state and we had been VERY CLEAR that our delivery needed to be in the late afternoon/evening), The driver said if we were not there within fifteen minutes we would need to reschedule. We immediately called customer service and spoke to a supervisor to get this sorted out. 

Now the actual delivery, the inlay boards for our bed to support the mattress were the wrong size and they refused to go and get the correct size, let's be clear that the warehouse manager or delivery manager should have double checked before this was loaded on the truck. Second, the underside of our couch was completely torn and there was a chunk missing from the side of our customized sectional. (we paid extra to get the color and material we wanted). The delivery driver colored in the missing wood with a sharpie and didn't repair the underside of our couch. We called in to customer service and the CS manager offered to bring us the correct inlay boards in her personal vehicle on her way home that evening so we wouldn't have to sleep with our mattresses on the floor. 

Current: 5 months later we were moving to a home we purchased and we called Living Spaces because the stuffing was going flat in our couch cushions (something that was covered under our warranty), they said since we were moving, we instantly voided our warranty. We had a verbal disagreement with them that we were still in the place of residence where the items were delivered and we wanted the warranty honored, we were told no. We also escalated to a manager and again were told no, our warranty was voided.

Our additional issue is also with the credit, we were approved for a specific amount of money, we went back because we needed to buy the matching dresser and nightstands for the bedroom set, we were going to add this to our finance account. We were told that we couldn't because Synchrony Financial (who they partner with for financing) had changed our approval amount. This was something we were never notified of via phone or in writing. 

Living Spaces is a company I regret EVER doing business with, let alone doing business with twice to have a complete set of furniture. The second time (for the dresser and nightstand, we spent close to $2300 out of the checking account that day).

I would strongly advise anyone from shopping there, they have no interest in providing good customer service and they have no interest in looking out for the customer or being an honest company.",2015-04-17 23:14:02

Came in on a weeknight on a warm spring day and we were very lucky that there was no line. Seated immediately and was prompted with some salty peanuts as a snack. Menu is not extensive which is good for indecisive people. There was maybe 8 soup bases to choose from, and many add ons/ small appetizers to share. 

I choose the regular soup base which was very flavourful and not milky in texture (unlike dagu's soup base which i find a bit more rich and milky). Each noodle soup comes with 10 ingredients ranging from fish tofu, shrimp, tripe, veggies, 3 pieces of meat (i think it was lamb), quail egg, bamboo shoots and a couple of other ingredients. Once you recieve the bubbling soup, you immediately dump your ingredients in so it can cook for a longer period of time. very similar concept to hot pot but just not all you can eat! haha Once you get your soup you are also provided with a bowl of rice noodles. I find the noodles here super chewy and tasty. It is already somewhat seasoned even before putting it in the soup! Noodles are also unlimited so if you're not full with one bowl you can keep ordering more and more noodles!

As side dishes, we ordered the seaweed salad. Not the typical sushi seaweed salad, a thicker and more real tasting seaweed seasoned with some seasame oil and green onions. Very tasty and fair for the price (4.99 for a good size dish), and also the popcorn chicken. Nothing too much to rave about the popcorn chicken but it was a nice added touch to eat while waiting for the noodles to come.

Service was fast and super friendly. All servers could speak english and would great in recommending what to order.

There was a lot of rice in both of the nigiri and the rolls, so it fills you up really quick. I ordered a premium roll with spicy tuna, but they covered it with too much sweet sauce, so it threw off the balance of flavors complete.

I think that stuff would make even mushy boiled brussels sprouts taste good. But I digress...

I tried Sushi Rolls in the lower level of the Oxford Center today. I think they've got a good thing going on down there. The sushi was relatively inexpensive, the location is great, and if you don't feel like eating in the restaurant itself there's plenty of seating in the courtyard right outside the place. The cardboard plates that the sushi is served on are sturdy and they look rather impressive with an elegant Japanese style design to them... economical and keeping the price down but an attention to detail that doesn't make them ""look cheap"". 

I had the spicy tuna roll today. I normally don't go for tuna but I liked the look of it. The gentleman behind the counter told me that it had Sriracha Sauce in it. Sriracha and that green horseradish stuff... for $7.99 how could I go wrong.  It was delicious!

So we waded through the madness of the Fremont  St. Experience and finally found them in a corner of the Plaza. When you walk up, it looks like a normal pizza place, with pies sitting out waiting to be consumed by the slice. I was immediately drawn to the white pizza and after reading the menu I knew this was not the run of the mill food court pizza. They are quite inventive with the toppings and very friendly. 

I went with the White Chapel, cute name, which was a white slice featuring spinach, garlic, and ricotta. It was pretty fantastic and I definitely would have eaten another slice. It was flavorful, especially the spinach and ricotta, and the crust was crispy, thin, and delicious. My husband had a slice that had bacon, sausage, and pepperoni, a real man pizza. It was also very flavorful and delicious, you were really able to discern the flavor of each meat in every bite. I kept stealing bites each time he turned his head. We also tried a slice of the Goodman, which features spinach, potatoes, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. This was good, but not as outstanding as the other slices. We also had some garlic knots, which were good, but nothing too special.

Overall, this place is dishing up some great NY style pizza with inventive toppings. The sauce, the toppings, and the crust are all highlights to these pretty outstanding pies. This is drunk food, with some serious flavor!",2012-08-19 03:46:56

Now that being said. . .when I first went to Veggie House. . .I was wondering how I was going to like the fake meat.  Trust me. . .I had serious doubts. . .but my friends wanted to go and try it, so I went along with them. . .

Maybe it was because my expectations were so low. . .that first time. . .but everything that we had was DELICIOUS and so on point.  I think I asked the wait staff about 5 times in that meal. . .you sure this is not real meat???  =)  The textures of the differnet meats that we had were really to close to what you would think the real stuff would be like.  We had crispy beef, crispy eggplant, General Tzo's chicken and some other items that I can not remember the name of. . .they were all surpisingly on point!

One of my friends actually had an issue with the texture of his pork dish. . .and you know what?  I tried it and honestly. . .the texture of the fake pork was the texture of the real pork in the same dish in other chinese restaurants I had before.  The texture tended to be a little on the chewy side and Veggie House was true to form. . .they made the fake pork like it was supposed to be!  crazy. . .crazy delicious!!  =)

On my second trip. . .i had their crispy beef again. . .and it did not disappoint. . .it was so good!!  Loved it!

I also had their Cilantro salad. . .and OMG. . .if you are a cilatnro fan like me. . .you will love this salad.  They chopped cilantro tossed it in a soy sauced vinegrette with a slgiht kick and mixed it with slices of pressed tofu and some fried eggroll skins for texture. . .it was freaking delicious!  I could eat it everyday and I probably would not get tired of it.  =)

I also had their Roti with curry which the serve told me was one of their more popular apps. . .this was one of the dishes that I did not like as much.  The roti was awesome!  BUT the curry was a little on the too sweet side for me.  As I progressed and ate more of the curry. . .the flavors did deepen and I was able to taste more of the nuances of the dish. . .but the sweetness lasted througout and it kind of made it weird for me.  This was the only dish that I had that was NOT a 5 star dish.  

Ambiance. . .(4/5)  It's a little weird inside as it reminds me of huts with straw roofs. . .but for the most part I can ignore it and just focus on the great food.  =)

Service. . .very prompt and very cordial (5/5).

Now if all vegan places tasted as good as Veggie House. . .I could be a vegan but until that time I will enjoy my vegan meals here. . .and enjoy the real stuff elsewhere.  =)  I will definitely be back!",2016-02-25 03:53:37

I moved into the area recently and have visited a handful of times in the past month and have already hit a royal and multiplr 4 of a kinds..Im not looking to get rich, just have some fun and not lose my shirt in the process lol

drink service at the bars are mediocre at best...plus I always tip and nothing bugs me more than when you tip someone and they dont even acknowledge it. I mean, you dont have to plant your lips on my butt, but a simple ""thanks"" goes a long way..

drink service on the floor is much better, but than again, I always tip, so they always come back when they figure that out....as it should be ...

theres a steak and shake there (me likey), lots of machines, a decent sportsbook split for race bettors on one side and sports on the other, and I really like the Del Mar Deli...cant say Ive been at any of the other food outlets recently..

Watching it become nationally famous through Food Network's ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"" was exciting, surreal, and made me all the more anxious to stop by. 

Shockingly, Kay had this place bookmarked for months! The other night, we decided to put off a visit no longer. 

Unassuming during the day, ominous after dark, Big Jim's occupies a building that sits below a poorly-lit underpass in a portion of the neighborhood known as ""The Run."" 

When you walk in, however, you are greeted graciously like a longtime friend and fed lovingly with hefty helpings of food that runs the gamut from bar and diner fare to good old Sunday evening homestyle cooking. 

It was the latter path that Kay chose with her Italian Wedding Soup and Hot Roast Beef Sandwich entree. The sandwich was a mountain of beef, bread, gravy, and fries that poor Kay only halfway finished. 

Dad recommended either the Italian Hoagie or the Bacon Burger. Thankfully, I listened to reason and didn't attempt to devour both, so I just went with the burger and was rewarded with an archetypal patty that was burly, copiously juicy, criminally fresh, and sublimely cooked to my specifications. In fact, EVERYTHING about this burger was open-faced perfection, from the veggies and sharp, solid, chilly, dill pickle to a bun so blessedly baked and brand-new, my imagination led me to believe that it had sprung from the ovens of Shangri-La. All hail Big Jim's Bacon Burger. Its place in the pantheon has been quickly secured. 

However, their fries, served in an insurmountable heap along with all else on their menu, need work. Brown, greasy, and limp, I've honestly had better fries at Eat N Park. I coulda, shoulda ordered onion rings. Oy.  Remember kids, cut them fresh, change the oil regularly, fry them twice. 

The atmosphere was very casual, talkative, and family-oriented, and the service was friendly, speedy, and graceful; our waiter didn't miss a beat in spite of how busy the restaurant was. 

I'll certainly be back for that Italian Hoagie. Until then...

We simply told her ""we like gin,"" and she immediately took the reigns and gave us great recommendations and explanations of different drinks on the menu. I had a Negroni and really enjoyed it. You could easily tell that they pay attention to every little detail when crafting cocktails. 

My second trip, tonight, was a slightly different experience. I had two Manhattans, both of which were excellent and completely consistent with each other. The bar was a bit more crowded than last time as it is Saturday night. It continued to fill up until we left around 10. Our bartender seemed very flustered, although the drinks he produced were still great. Maybe it was just an off night for him. 

The bar itself is stylish but not overdone. The bathroom could definitely use a makeover, though--not sure what's going on there (appears to be mid-renovation?).

They have the highest grade beef as an option, but I was happy enough with the ""regular"" version (sorry I don't have my beef grades memorized). Also - the wedge salad is delish!

The service has also been great both times. We had reservations & were seated right away  Our waitress was attentive...in fact, all the servers are attentive to all the tables. They seem to float to each other's tables (and have food runners), which makes it very efficient overall. 

Wine options are really affordable...if my memory is correct the Pinot Noir I got was $5.50 for an 8 ounce pour - that's really big! So another bonus!

I enjoyed the Mushroom n' Swiss so much at the other location that I had to have it again.  This time, we were smart enough to order the beer cheese dip with the pub chips.

I tried to order my burger medium rare.  Usually if a place refuses to cook it less than medium, it's an indicator that the burger has been frozen (so I've been told).  He said they cook it to medium-well in a burger press, and there's no other options.  ""Don't worry, it'll still be juicy"", he says.  Sorry - while somewhat juicy, it's not the same.  But hey, I understand.  The last one was good, this should be too.

While the restaurant was somewhat busy, the food came up fast (sure - they use a burger press...).  The burger was quite tasty.  Not quite as good as the last one I had, but still something I'd have again.  The pub chips were better this time around - not as overdone.  The beer cheese dip makes them uh-mazing!

The service overall was pretty good, they refilled our waters pretty often on a hot day so points for that too, that is where all the positives end.

The food was pretty bad here. I started off with beef carpaccio, the beef served was bit off colored and ""seared"" on the outside which made it a grey and pale pink piece of meat served. I was not impressed. 

I had ordered the steak sandwich and had specifically asked nicely if it could be medium rare or medium, since I HATE well done steak. I got a beyond well done steak sandwich for my entree. The mushrooms were also making the bread soggy and it was pretty greasy. I would have complained but I was with a big group of coworkers and my boss and did not want to spoil the celebratory mood by complaining about my food. It was hard to eat this. 

For dessert I got the cheesecake, and it was a gritty over-sweetened mess. The cake is definitely overbaked and has a terrible gritty texture. It was also super sweet, I ate one tablespoon and could eat anymore.

I get that summerlicious is pretty cheap, $15 for 3 courses, but I have been to other places for summerlicious and winterlicious and they have been great (eg Bodega right down the road).

I found Veg Out while walking the farmers markets.  I fell in love with the first sample of sweet almond rice!  They have amazing delicious food that is gluten and dairy free!  Since I am trying to watch my calorie intake, I always ask about calorie counts and they have a good estimate for me.  I know that it might be annoying, but I like to know what I am eating!  
Every week they have a new selection of foods, labeled with ingredients and expiration dates.  My favorite so far has been the sweet almond rice and the not so cheeze sauce!  I used that on veggies, tofu, noodles, it was great!  This week I bought spinach artichoke dip and tamales.  The couple that creates the dishes is very kind, they take credit cards (thank gosh) since I do not always have cash on me.  they post on their facebook page a few days in advance what they will be having for the week.

The reason for not receiving five stars is for the inconsistency of the size of their product. One time their bowl can weigh two pounds then the next time it can weigh 5 ounces with the exact same combinations of ingredients. It's the workers who dole out the portions that make it inconsistent. I don't know why they don't use measuring cups or spoons for the ingredients instead of tongs which are then eye-balled.,2016-07-05 21:22:24

The bathroom was clean and I love the soap that they have...smells very good. I ordered the soup of the day which was corn chowder....flavorful, but I prefer my chowder to have a thicker consistency.  My chowder was supposed to come out first, but my food ended up coming out first. I ordered crab stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes on the side. When my food arrived, I asked them where my soup was. They apologized and brought it out.  A few minutes later the manager came over and apologized and said dessert would be on them. I thought that was amazing customer service and I greatly appreciated the gesture. The crab stuffed chicken was good, not delicious and mashed potatoes were just ok. I ordered the ""hot"" chocolate cake and that definitely was the star of the night. Would I give this place a 2nd try, yes.",2017-07-30 22:54:22

We ordered Mezes of rodos (Huge seafood platter!) I ate most of the octopus and lots of calamari. I must say this platter was so filling for the four of us. Our drinks were filled regularly. Great service.

We also ordered a lamb souvlaki dinner for one of the people in the group who was not crazy about seafood.

I must say all the food was just excellent. Service was excellent. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It was very busy. Large groups/couples/guys/gals/ and everyone looked happy.

Good flavor, crispy texture, juicy meat and plenty of sauce if you like them with more. Ordered pho, bbq banh mi, and ahi tuna green salad.  The pho came out room temperature. I'm not bagging on them but this is the second time in two months this happened, so I'm confused why the broth isn't the temperature of the sun. It slightly concerns me that it's not hot enough to cook the raw meat as it was intended.  Sent it back, they warmed it and everything was fine. You would think the token flagship dish of vietnamese food in a vietnamese restaurant would be bulletproof. Next the banh mi. Ugh. Insert sigh here. Again second attempt....I'm trying to be fair and give two attempt before writing it down for the world to see. First thought....WTF.  The supposed pickled vegetables came out limp and soaked in rice wine (both times). I'm pretty sure it's rice wine vinegar that was supposed to be used with sugar and other spices. # disappointed. It killed the sandwich. The overwhelming taste of alcohol from the cooking wine ruined it. Peeled veggies off for the second time and dipped it in the wing sauce to mask the tadte on the bread.  And finally, the salad was great. Nice presentation, good portion, and the citrus miso dressing was a nice touch. The ahi was fresh and we all know you can easily tell if it's not.

It has a different concept than the one I usually go to in Scarborough. I ended up here, twice, because we needed to use the Groupon that's specific to this location only. Both times were at odd hours (2-3pm onwards) and both were the same experience.

In this downtown location, all the items are ordered from the server via a sheet of paper where you mark down what you want. Whereas, in the Scarborough location, all the items are self-serve except for the beef and lamb which you have to order from the server.

Now this would've been good, knowing your items are fresh from the kitchen, ONLY IF you have enough staff to pull it off. Service was just HORRIBLE.
They only had TWO people for the entire floor! These two people both bring the guests in, get the food from the kitchen, serve the food and clean the tables (and I believe also does cashier) for the entire floor.

The funny part is with only two people on the floor, you'd think they would be always visibly busy on the floor. But no, sometimes both would disappear for a long time leaving customers clueless on who will be serving them.

It's so hard to catch their attention too. There are times where people are raising their hands already but they'd rather clean the table instead when it's not like the place is full and running out of tables.

We usually end up staying so long because the first round along already takes at least an hour. And then it's so hard to get them to do a second round. There are times where my soupbase was 1/4 left, and I had already told them at least twice already and they still can't manage to refill the soup.

So my dear Little Sheep... WHY not do the self-serve here?? If you can't handle service based hot pot, just stick to self-serve like in Scarborough. The irony is that though Scarborough location is self-serve, there are actually a lot of servers walking around to take your order of beef/lamb as well as to refill soupbase. There is also a dedicated cashier in Scarborough.

In fairness, the food quality is better here than in Scarborough simply because it comes from the kitchen and not just left in the trays sitting around. Mind you, some of them are frozen though. There are more selections as well.

The ventilation is also better. It doesn't feel like a steam room unlike Scarborough since it has better ventilation.

However, it is also pricier and comes at a cost of very bad service. So I don't see myself coming back here when I can just have an enjoyable time at the Scarborough location.",2016-04-01 02:43:05

A call to the humane society rescue hotline (they only do dogs and cats and the like) got me redirected to Liberty Wildlife Rehabilitation Foundation: a voicemail answered by volunteers whose outgoing message promises to call back as soon as possible, typically within 30 minutes. 

I left a message and then anxiously called back a few hours later after not getting a response. The second call was quickly returned and I was informed that while they do not typically send out rescue volunteers for smaller birds (only the big guys like owls, etc.), if I could capture and transport the bird to their sanctuary, someone would be there until 7 p.m. to accept him and begin to nurse him back to health -- even on Easter Sunday.

The little guy was speedy! Together, a few of my Easter guests and I were able to corner him and get him in a box for transport to Liberty Wildlife Rehabilitation Foundation.

Indeed, the young girls greeted me and enthusiastically took the little guy, trading me for an intake form which collected my contact information and the closest major intersection to where the bird had been found. No money. Just information.

Since cutting most meat out of my diet, I had very rarely looked back... until it came time to go to a Korean BBQ with friends. It was the first time I found myself longingly craving meat. The bulgogi and samgupsal and even kimchi jigae was now pretty much off-limits.

However, I discovered that Miega is by far the most accomodating Korean restaurant in Cleveland when it comes to non-carnivores. It is not on the menu, but if they have the ingredients, they will make the most beautiful, delicious platter of vegetarian gim-bap (Korean sushi) with freshly cooked fried eggs. The kimchi jigae is already made vegetarian (the pork is added after the stew cooks, so it's easy to omit). My husband ordered vegetarian bibimbap and they left out the bulgogi and added tofu in one of the most beautifully-arranged bibimbaps I've ever seen!

I occasionally eat fish, and this is the place to have it! The grilled mackerel is delicious with rice and kimchi. 

All of the banchan items that are served before the entrees have been delicious!   

The servers are wonderful - I always enjoy trying to use the very, very small amount of conversational Korean I know with them, and they are happy to humor me and offer pronunciation help. 

Tip: Another great thing about Miega (I hope/think)  is that it is BYOB. We have brought a bottle of wine to dinner there a couple times. When I visited Korea, drinking soju with every meal was customary - I now tend to feel like any Korean dinner (well, I guess any dinner) seems more festive with a bottle shared with friends.",2012-07-19 21:29:40

I've eaten at Samba several times over the years, and was much more impressed when it was new. Some of that is to be expected, it's a lovely space and the concept was new to Madison. The building shows some wear (fix the damn front door, already!), but overall it's holding up well enough.

The star of the show is actually not the meat service, but the wonderful first course salad bar. Not a typical salad bar, but a meal in itself- I would go there for just the curried chicken salad and the popovers. I keep telling myself 'next time', but we always get meat as well.

The meats were fine- I recommend passing on the chicken legs and the chorizo, although it makes sense financially to offer lower cost cuts in addition to the steak and tenderloin (beef and pork). Beef is served on the rare side, so be aware, but it's quite tender and juicy.

Service was perfunctory, somewhat excusable for a Groupon night, but the server lost us for dessert by taking 10+ minutes to bring the dessert menu, and then disappearing for several more. That's the first time service has been rough, though.",2013-04-15 02:25:36

They have tried hard with the decor and an outside roof patio lounge area. Happy hour specials are decent. It is comfortable with plenty of seating.

At first I was scared off that the prices would be sky high, because of the atmosphere, they were not. Appetizers started at 6$ drinks at 6$ for happy hour. Fancy martinis can climb to 10$ and up after that though. 

I tried the trio platter with crab cake arugula salad and fried veggie pasty thing, it was nice. My friend tried the Tilapia fish tacos. The rest of the menu is mostly meat dishes, seafood platters, steaks, and lamb chops. Price climbs but it is not outrageous. It is not a place for vegetarians and vegans, one jerk on yelp gave them a one star review for this. Um if you don't eat a certain kind of food you should probably google their menu before you eat there its common sense. 

My friend tried the Tilapia fish tacos and liked hers. Drinks and service were fine we had no problems with rude or unfriendly staff, I wish there was music. There was some but it was very quiet. There is only one stall in the bathroom, I don't mind waiting because it is a nice bathroom modern and clean but its worth noting just in case. 

Also I wish the menu had more variety it was nice but Its like walking into any other big new thing in Pittsburgh and seeing the exact same food over and over again, Can I get a fish taco with maybe a chipotle salmon in it instead of freakin tilapia everywhere I go? But I digress this is a nice place and definitely suffices for a nice night on town. There is also plenty of comfy seating if it is not packed.

I have to say if you're from another city with a more diverse viewpoint on life (or you have a life at all) do not read the one star blatant racist reviews of this place on yelp. It's getting old already Pittsburgh give it up its 2013, grow up already. Get off your stupid little hill and accept that there are several types of people in the world doing their own thing and that thing might be new to you but that's not a good reason to put it down and spew your stupidity all over yelp.

It started out by me taking my 11 year old in for simple haircuts,  Then it progressed into taking my older daughter for up-do's and blow outs.  At the time, I wasn't a client here, I was seeing a ""five star"" color specialist, an hour away,  in Phx. (I live in Mesa). I was just bringing in my girls for cheap trims and haircuts and fancy up-do's.  It was close to our house and not expensive. My girls  usually saw Rayna, she even gave me a few blow outs and did a nice job. Once she wasn't available, so we were booked with Cassandra.  After awhile of noticing that the  stylist Cassandra was actually really good, I thought instead of driving up to Phx for my next blow out, I'd give Cassandra a try, since it was just a blow out, it would be fine. She did a fantastic job, at half the time of driving to Phx, and half the cost.  
So, the next time I let her touch up the color on my hair and again, great job and great price.   It has quickly evolved over three years and now, not only are my two daughters and my son  Cassandra clients, but I have personally been going to Cassandra and every experience is wonderful and pleasant. I recently just had Cassandra add some highlights to my dark hair and my hair looks so good. I always get compliments on my hair. 
I see Cassandra every 4-6 weeks for color (and trims) and more often for styles and blowouts. Cassandra is a great stylist.  She is young, pleasant, smart, articulate, and consistent in her work.  She also does a great blow out, without relying on a flat iron to do the work.  I have really gnarly , dry, Brillo pad type hair, she blows it out smooth as silk. It is very very hard to find a stylist who can do that. I know this from many years of experience.   This Regis salon is convenient for me and I always have an easy time making an appointment. The pricing is very fair and reasonable.  
It isn't an elaborate, fancy place by any means, sadly, that's why I had always been skeptical about coming here and why I only took my children here. But I am extremely happy with every experience I have ever had here. 
If you are ok not paying for the over styled,  pretentious. high end salon -look, and just concerned with getting a great color, cut and style at a reasonable price then give  Cassandra a try.  Go in for a simple blow out or style just to try her out and see how it goes.  Heck, take your kid in for a cut and style and see how it goes.    I will add, VERY IMPORTANT, I purchase the best shampoo and conditioner, luckily, they sell the brand I use at this salon. 
I ALSO bring it with me and use it at my appointments.  
It is Pureology. It is not cheap, but neither am I .  
Your hair is an ongoing investment, so, know that just having a great stylist is only half the battle.  You have to be responsible for how you treat your hair. If YOU decide to over-process, or bleach your  hair, or change it from light to dark every two weeks or use cheap products, this is not and should not  be a reflection of your hairstylist. 
A hairdresser can only do so much for you, it takes you taking care of your hair and making good decisions for your hair , combined with a stylist that has product knowledge and talent.   Sorry for the rant.  But I hear  people blame their stylist all the time for things out of the stylist's control.",2016-09-19 17:39:35

Foot long was average pretty much in every way.  Bun was slightly stale and hard.

Chili dog was average.  Chili was below average.

Diet Dr Pepper was more soda water than Dr Pepper.

If you measure all hot dogs on the planet on straight line continuum with the $1.50 Costco special being the mid point, I'm not sure this place measures up to the mid point.

After more than a dozen visits to this lounge, I'm confident of my four star rating. In agreeing with what Kristin told me once, yes, Sidebar is very much what would happen if Roosevelt and Fez had a baby, at least design-wise.

The environment, decor, and drink offerings rock. A few quick notes to illustrate:
* Exposed brick and stairway entry that would make any East Coaster drool. 
* Cozy C-shaped booths for lounging. 
* Requisite absinthe dispenser in the middle of the bar and TV screens showing old films to indicate urban trendiness. 
* Kim Crawford sauvignon blanc by the glass, Anchor Steam by the bottle
* White space-age-ish 4-seater tables and multi-colored LED panel thrown in for good measure.

In a few birthday parties here, I have gotten different results. For mine in January, they gladly reserved a booth for my besties and me on a Friday at 9 pm. Of course, no signage or anything, so it was a bit of a hassle to say the least as the owner, Josh, gladly asked people to move. The next month, we ran into some resistance on reserving, but were able to manage it due to our own efforts.

Overall, service has definitely improved. Although, be sure to watch your drink as ambition can get the best of them - they took away several of our half-finished glasses when we weren't looking.  One complaint to the bartender, and this was fixed. 

A new and appreciated detail is their drink menu featuring some unique cocktails. One request would be to beef up their appetizer offerings.",2009-05-29 21:15:46

There were so many people gambling that I felt like I was no longer in Cleveland.  This is a good thing!  The tables were full.  I could barely get close to them to see what the minimum bets were.  We checked out the buffet, but did not eat.  It looked pretty decent, but the prices, $13.99 for lunch and $23.99 for dinner, were steep.

Most Japanese places these days are effectively fast food sushi, and while good they lack authenticity. This place is different. It has a wide range of options that you'd find in Japan, and some very unique dishes. They even great you with Ishamaese. 
The staff is very Japanese and the mild struggle with English makes it that much more fun.
We had the octopus ceviche on with dried seaweed papers, tomato Kimuchi, and Tuna avocado tartar. All fun and tasty.
For mains we had a short rib special which was very good and a surprisingly delicious vegan tempura salad.
We topped it off with a cold house Sake.
Nestled in Cabbagetown on Winchester just east of Parliament make sure you make a reservation and get their early if driving to find parking.

(the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.
i'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.

You may actually drive by this place and not notice that a restaurant is here (since it is hidden behind trees and next to dairy farms, corn fields and such). 

Casual atmosphere with large out door picnic area, very pretty.

Ribs- Super moist, tender, fall-off-the-bone, finger-linkn', smokey, sweet & bold sauciness! 

Cole-Slaw- So-so. Wish it was more like KFC 'slaw (sweet).

Garlic Fries- Good, a little greasy towards the bottom, but very crispy and flavorful.

Pulled Pork- Nice and plentiful.

Total cost? About $30. But ssooo much food and exactly what I expect BBQ to be.

I should've written this review sooner to share my love of this sushi destination. My roommates and I have long made special outings to the Gilbert location, because we enjoy the sushi so much. But imagine our anticipation, finding out that a new location was opening up in our neck of the woods... literally a hop, skip, and a jump away!

The things we love about Masa Sushi is how hot Miso soup and a chilled salad are served immediately and are included with any meal. Ditto for the fresh fruit and pocky dessert! The service is warm and inviting, and we are recognized during repeat visits by the hostess and waitress here (although we have yet to make it onto their ""wall"" of Polaroids). We will have to shamelessly ask to be photographed, I suppose, on our next jaunt, but maybe before we stuff our faces with fresh fish goodness. It's a wonder they don't employ Oompah-Loompahs to roll us out after our bouts of fishy gluttony!

Let me save you time on the menu, which is endless and dazzling. You must try the Monkey Balls! More of an appetizer, the Monkey Ball includes warm mushrooms, spicy tuna, and cream cheese on the inside and is deep-fried and drizzled with a special sauce on the outside. In fact, on all of their menu descriptions of their special rolls, a description is always given for what's ""IN"" and what's ""OUT"". This two-layered approach not only makes for great and interesting sushi, but is a novel way to find that perfect combination to satisfy your sushi cravings. My favorite is the Boston Roll (IN - shrimp, crab stick, salmon and avocado; OUT - baby lobster, baked cheese). It may sound funky, but it is delicious! This is a sushi roll that eats like a casserole! I've found that it is best complemented with sriracha (which you must ask for on the side) and soy sauce.

There's plenty more to explore on the menu, but now that I've found my favorites, I'm sticking with them. Newcomers to Masa Sushi are encouraged to find their own favorite ""INs"" and ""OUTs"", because IN-and-OUT is what it's all about!",2014-10-29 21:18:41

I had an enjoyable experience overall.  The waittress was attentive, but nothing like the overbearingly quick service at the Penguin.  I think people were knocking the service because they were so busy when it was just opening.  The food was also similar to my experiences at the Penguin.  I got the Full Blown Hemi, southern style and it was just as good as I remembered.  My girlfriend got the pork sandwich, which was good.  The gravy fries w/ Pimento lacked an ample amount of gravy, but maybe I just got a skimpy batch.  The gravy was kind of runny too, not as thick as what I was thinking it would be.  They were OK, but most food is good after a few beers in your belly.  I like how they have an expanded menu with a Greek twist and will have to try something new next time.

Going on a -15 Friday night was a good idea because the place was not very packed (about half full at most), so you would get good service and hot food.

I would compare Mercatto to Terroni, only has a much different vibe to it. Mind you, I'm only taking the Queen W place as the comparison, but I found Mercatto to be much more urban and marche like. What the heck did I say? More urban in the sense that it was modern looking and the waiters were very easy going as our waiter was dressed in jeans and t-shirt. Very pleasant staff. Marche like? well the inside was wooden tables and chairs in a hollowed out industrial type frame. I can see this place being really noisy when it is packed. There would be lots of echo.

The food is comparable to Terroni (but I liked Terroni), only not as much selection. I am sure that there would be a little something for everyone to try. I enjoyed their Antipasti Misti, which included 2 choices of deli meat, cheese, and antipasto.

What really stood out for me was the way they served wine. It basically works like fountain pop if you are ordering just a single glass. I know this sounds nasty but it would take to long to explain here. I was also impressed that a lad came in by himself and was talking with the waitress about a selection of wine. She brought to him 4 glasses with about 1-2oz in them to try. The guy selected his wine and when she went to get him a glass full she said, and you can finish all those up.

Another dish we got was the house special veggies with mock chicken. It was not bad but the portion was kind of small for its price $11. It had tofu, broccoli and mock chicken inside. It was nothing special though.

The Monet exhibition is on view through January 6, 2013. This exhibition showcased 20 works by Monet and eight other works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro, and Eugene Louis Boudin.

February 2013 onwards we can look forward to a Warhol series. 

The gallery itself is pretty compact, the audio aids provided are quite easy to use and the gallery doesn't seem to get too crowded to allow enjoyment of these exquisite works. Although I have to mention that the audio provided quite a lot of useless information rather than descriptions of the art work and the artists. 

Strangely enough, in addition to the gorgeous art, I was drawn to the walls of the studio that were painted a stunning purple!

The cost of a ticket here is around $16 for adults ($13 for locals) and children under 12 are free. Pretty reasonable for a priceless experience. 

It's nice to partake in these creative gems without taking an international flight. If only this were a little bit bigger....think the Art Institute of Chicago maybe? We did Smith Center...now for a large museum (that's not mob related) Vegas!",2013-01-04 21:16:59

At 6:30 p.m., we were the only people in there... except for the jazz trio.  Now, I like jazz as much as the next person, but the bar at Sullivan's is fairly small and compact, and the music was pretty loud.  It was good but seemed a little unnecessary.  Our drinks (a dirty martini and a Cosmopolitan) were good, but not great, and were $26 together.

Onto dinner!  Our waiter greeted us and kept mentioning how he'd heard how much we liked Shiraz.  Huh?  He said he'd even send over the sommelier to help us pick a good bottle.  Again, huh?  I finally had to tell him that I thought they'd mixed us up with other people because we had cocktails at the bar.  He showed me his notes from our visit three years ago (tracked through OpenTable?) when we bought a bottle of Shiraz.  Ha!  I appreciate the attention to detail, but it seemed like a little bit of overkill, especially since it'd been three years, and there isn't really an alcohol we don't like.  

The fella decided to go with the $39, 3-course menu and got the shrimp cocktail, lettuce wedge and steak.  The shrimp cocktail was fine (it's really hard to mess that up) and there were fewer shrimp than with the full-price appetizer; the lettuce wedge was okay but would've been even better with bacon; and the steak.... well, for Sullivan's being a steakhouse, it was pretty bland.  It almost tasted like bologna to me.  Yikes.  On a better note, I opted for the cheesesteak egg roll appetizer, which was delicious, and the chicken piccata entree, which was tender, moist, and seasoned perfectly.  We each got a glass of wine - not Shiraz! - and our waiter had some good suggestions on those.

I really wanted to have a great experience at Sullivan's, but for the price, there are much better steakhouses in Charlotte.  Bummer.",2013-06-02 18:49:54

Cosmo Music is for music lovers looking for any instruments. But their guitar selection is just so awesome with the wall to ceiling guitar display. I like the idea that you can try them all out before getting something you like. They have private rooms set up with various amplifiers for that purpose. And of course if you are a guitar player, you would not be happy to just own one of those babies!

I like how the store is divided up into different sections/departments with dedicated sale representatives and you can just find everything you need without looking around.

I picked out some treats for my pups and browsed the front of the store. They have good wholesome brands for both treats and dog food. 

It is refreshing to see a place like this with quality products to feed our pups. 

I would prefer to shop at a business like this which offers products that are good for your dogs paired with exceptional customer service.

Hands down better than Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong in LA

We got the family style meal and it came with various different meats.  I think overall all of the meats and marinades were legit, but overall by far the pork cuts were the most flavorful.  I wished they had served the non-marinated meats first and then the marinated ones, but all was exceptional.

The atmosphere is similar to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, but this place has way better meat, less cramped, service is good, and THERE'S NO WAIT!  Literally you could drive from LA to Vegas and get here in less time than it would take if you waited at Kang Ho.

Don't let the name fool you, they offer more than Strudel. This is the first German (and Austrian and Hungarian) food truck in Charlotte that I am aware of.

They had a pretzel melt which looked amazing but there was a 15-minute wait. The Goulash is what I went for which was available immediately.

The goulash cost about $12 but it was worth the price. There was enough tender meat for two and a serving of spaetzle. Big on flavor, went well with beer. 

Unlike some food trucks that barely fill you up, the offerings here last for hours and are a good complement for beer.

Quickie review... Our 15 minute wait time for a table turned into 45. While not completely their fault they should be able to judge turn times a little better than that.

The cornbread was very good and the artichoke was out of this world good and after that it all kind of went down hill. Mom had the Macho Salad which she enjoyed but she also asked for no goat cheese and they forgot about that.

I ordered the filet rare and it came out medium rare but I chose not to send it back. While it was still enjoyable it definitely wasn't as good as it could've been. They also forgot the worcestershire butter which I think is delicious and definitely took away from the meal.

Dad ordered the filet medium-rare and they brought it to the table butterflied, completely unacceptable. It's a ""center cut"" filet and it's not difficult to cook medium-rare, as evidenced by mine. The second one they brought out for him was overcooked and didn't even appear to be a quality cut of meat. He decided to opt not for the 3rd strike and ate it anyway.

Our server insisted on removing my dad's meal from the ticket, which was very nice, but we would've rather had an enjoyable meal and paid full price any night of the week. Bandera again? Maybe, but I'm definitely more inclined to seek out new options in the future.",2011-02-17 17:32:23

Based on the reviews, 24/7 seemed like the best option.
I called and left a message on Tuesday evening. It wasn't initially returned, so I called back on Wednesday and was able to schedule an appointment that was convenient for me (5:30p). There was a little confusion about whether the appointment had been set/confirmed, but that was rectified.
I was a little peeved that i rushed home from work to get home by 5:30, because I received a call at 5:45 from the repair person saying that he was 20 minutes away. 

However, Eddie was extremely friendly and personable. It turned out that my issue was nothing but a simple click of a switch. Sigh... However, he showed me where everything was in case I had a similar issue. 

I was initially very angry about the cost ($99), since it literally took him 10 seconds to ""fix,"" and Eddie could tell that I was unhappy. He understood that the cost seemed rather high for the actual work performed, so He went out and negotiated with his supervisor and they were able to cut the cost to $50.

I was so grateful to Eddie and also to 24/7 for listening to their customer and working out a fair solution. They even called back an hour or so later to make sure I was happy with the work done.

For that reason, I will definitely use 24/7 again for my electrical needs! They really went out of their way to be fair. Eddie is a great representative of the company as well.",2015-02-19 12:03:49

I took my in-laws to see some art and they really liked it. I enjoyed viewing paintings by some of the most famous artists in history.  The questions I have are, who gets to decide what goes in an art museum and what doesn't? Ya know? I mean, who is to say that this person's abstract is better than this other person's? What makes an artist famous?  Why do people want to see Picasso vs the million others who paint very similar to him?  I just don't understand.  I have to say though, that I really liked Renoir's works as well as Van Gogh's use of color. But anyone can imitate or replicate that. I would love to have a knock off of several of their pieces. If they were the first artists to paint in a given style, then that helps to answer my questions.

The collection here is really large and diverse. I enjoy looking at the armor sets, swords, and guns of the days of yore. I also liked the Egyptian collection. We spent almost two hours in the museum and we didn't even see everything. I want to go back and view more. The free admission is amazing.

Well lets begin by saying I am very disappointed, especially considering the great reviews. then again everyone's review is for jerk chicken of course. So I've attached pictures of the new locations/menu. I ordered the oxtail w rice&peas extra oxtail gravy on the rice of course. 
Oxtail portion is small for 16$ that I paid for the large (large means more rice not meat). both the rice and Oxtail lacks flavor/taste, the seasoning is very minimal which suck. I'm also used to having oxtail w the nice thick gravy fall off the bone meat where you'll see little chunks in your rice. no, not here the gravy is quite watery and bland so adds absolutely nothing to your rice/peas. I don't know how hes gotten such raving reviews, but then again I'm used to eating Caribbean food so maybe that has a role in my taste buds. Or maybe his other food is much better, which I do plan on trying this week sometime, but as for the oxtail ...issa no for me dawg *Randy Jackson voice*

The duck fat fries were great. Not greasy at all and not salty. You get to dip them in homemade sauces. 

Servings are great. Portions are big and the food comes in a wooden food platter...which makes it look so fancy. Presentation is always key for me, and I love looking at beautiful food presentations. It makes the experience more worthwhile.

After a quick look at the menu, I decided on a Buckwheat Belgian Waffle w/Vermont Maple Syrup, $12.  To wash it down, I ordered a Coffee and Water.

The server brought out a mini-pot of Coffee so that we could refill our cups at our leisure...bonus, I like when a restaurant offers that.  After a short wait our food was served.

I poured a little Syrup on my Waffle and took a bite....it was a little disappointing.  The texture was good and it was cooked just right...however, the flavor fell flat for me.  It tasted too ""grainy""....not in the rough texture sense, but in the bitter, wild grains sense.  It wasn't what I expected....even the Syrup couldn't save it.  I only ate 1/2 of the Waffle.  Looking back on it, I'd like to try it with an IPA....it might go well with a bitter Beer like that and I love IPA's.  That would be weird though, ordering a Waffle at breakfast and a tall glass of IPA...ha!

Our server was great and the place is very well kept.  If I come back, I'll be sure to try something that I'm more familiar with.

The cashier was nice and friendly and even warned us when the beer we ordered had not been very well received. She gave us a sample before letting us commit.

Stone bowl seafood + sea urchin don - Judging from the name, you can't go wrong with that right? it has my favourite sea urchin.

Kingyo Style Death Chicken - on the menu it says 'do not order if you aren't too good with spicy food'. It was not spicy at all, if anything it should say 'do not order if you aren't too good with sweet on your meat' because that was the main taste.

After having dinner at Flanny's we had an urge for something sweet to headed over to Jalsa. At the time we went the place was empty and the selection was very slim. I think it was a Sunday so that's understandable -- only a slight deduction for that. 

I inquired about the ice cream flavors and asked if they made some of the very exotic flavors that were there and she said no. Hmmm. That didn't resonate with me at all. If you're going to offer such different flavors, but you bought them from a vendor, how is that special?  It just seemed odd to me, especially if I'm paying THAT much for a scoop of ice cream. 

Second, my cupcake was not to die for. I don't remember the name and that's sad because again, a cupcake costing that much should be memorable. I think it was $3.00 or so. I could be that out of it and not realize that cupcakes are expensive. Regardless, they were too pricey for me, particularly in the calorie department.

Better decor and better food than the Steeles location, and MUCH better than other AYCE joints.

I find the fish very fresh and the sushi well-made (this is not ZEN, it's AYCE) and I can try a LOT of sushi, sashimi, teppanyaki, and other dishes for a fraction of what I spend at the high-end places.  Some favorites include the salmon sashimi and roses, their beef and chicken skewers, teriyaki salmon, teppanyaki sirloin with garlic, and the big bouncy 'golden shrimp', which usually cause me to skip the tempura shrimp altogether. And if you like avocado, try the baked avocado seafood salad, which is a light avocado mousse, studded with a few micro tiny bay scallops and baked to order in a scallop shell.

Try and go early in the morning to avoid weekend lineups. Don't go on a long weekend, you'll be squished into a super sweaty lineup trying to get on/off the ferry.

I've been to Eddie V's so many times, but the last time I went was probably my last. I ordered a glass of wine to accompany the many many oysters I was excited to eat. The oysters themselves were good quality, but they had not been properly clean and my boyfriend and I were disgusted with the whole experience. We asked the manager what was going on since we were used to such high quality there, and instead of bringing us clean oysters or apologizing...he implied that we didn't understand what clean oysters actually were. He explained that because of the quality of these oysters they do not wash them and if we ate oysters more often we would know that. Interestingly, we eat oysters all the time and I'm sure no pretentious oyster connoisseur like the one the manager was describing would appreciate pieces of shell all over their oysters either.  In the end, and after a battle on what constitutes a clean oyster, the manager took some of the oysters off our bill. However, it wasn't about having any of the oysters taken off of our bill - it was about getting what we came in for - good oysters and good experience.",2013-08-06 04:17:36

The places are ridiculously affordable as well. In Toronto, this was a huge breath of fresh air. For a dozen, it was only$5!! This is one of those businesses where they're genuinely in it to serve the public amazing treats.

Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.

While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.

The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.

My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.

Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.",2009-11-01 20:17:19

Apparently, I others thought this as the lone diner sitting along the glass walls overlooking a surprisingly busy alley was clearly waiting for his female date to arrive. At first, I thought he was checking me out as I walked toward the back of the restaurant to meet up with Bobo. I was so flattered by the head turning that I didn't even take in the chill atmosphere until I sat at our two-seater table. As I looked around at the welcoming bar and small dining area, the earthy (due to the dirt colored walls) yet urban (exposed bricks and picture windows overlooking streets) and somehow rural (cast iron pans hanging on the wall) new restaurant, I got a distinctly Brooklyn 2012 vibe. I'm guessing the name, Soho, is meant to evoke a different neighborhood in the big city, but the vibe is more fitting for my experiences ducking into new Brooklyn hot spots. The Southern Hospitality of the name comes across in the menu (and frying pan decorations). The menu integrates southern favorites with mod, innovative flairs. For example, cheese steak that's not steak, but brisket! The best part of this cheese brisket was that it was part of the happy hour special and only $7. The chalk board over the bar listed the happy hour drinks, all $4 or under, including a hand crafted raspberry-whiskey cocktail called the Chattanooga. If you know me, then you are familiar with my life rule #3: If I see a berry drink on a cocktail menu I have to order it. Hello yummy $4 Chattanooga that was perfectly frothy from egg whites! At this time, happy hour runs till 6:30. Obviously, that's subject to change. 
 
2 super cute tiny biscuits are complimentary and served with some sort of butter. We ordered deviled eggs. My first criticism is that the deviled eggs were cut into quarters...I wanted more zip with my egg. Either give me half an egg so I can enjoy all the yolk-mayonaise goodness, or give me more zip with my yolk-mayonaise mix. My second criticism is that the chips were almost flavorless; the flavor that was there was sort of...yucky. Perhaps the fat used to fry them was yucky?  I'm not sure what it was, but I didn't like them. Also, after only paying $7 for a huge sandwich that came with chips (neither Bobo nor I liked them) and various pickled veggies, the $5.50 for what was probably 1.5 eggs seemed like too much. I'm not saying they're overpriced, but they seemed overpriced next to a $7 meal. Overall, I loved the experience and look forward to dining here often. Next time I'll ask about the chips and see if they ever serve them spiced, or can add salt, or see if others said they didn't like them. I am a huge lover of fried potatoes so yucky chips will not do on my plate.

Cons: The used clothes are way overpriced. You can easily pay as much for one of these dresses as for something new. There is no negotiation on the clothing prices. The $48 used dress is the $48 used dress. Customer service was also not the best. The lone salesgirl on duty wasn't actually rude to us, but was singularly unhelpful and seemed a little put she had to wait on us.

First they serve tap water probably because they want you to pay for drinks but then their cocktails aren't great either. We ordered a Moscow Mule and the taste ginger beer was so over powering it was awful. I should have turned it back in; certainly not worth the money. Then I ordered the quinoa and kale salad nothing else on it and my daughter had the quinoa and kale salad with chicken and despite the fact that the restaurant was almost empty it took over 1/2 hour to get our food.

Service - Servers always give you a hard time about splitting tabs. When you can get them to do so, it seems as though it's never correct and they have to re-do it a few times before getting it right. 

Eats - They keep taking things off their menu that are good and not adding new items. 

Drinks - Not as strong. Plus, you used to get enough for 2 drinks with 1 martini (one poured, one more from the shaker). Now you're lucky to get 1 from it. Just don't give me the shaker when it's basically empty.

When I made my first visit here in the late Nineties driving from Phoenix, I instantly was awed and captivated by this place. Even before laying eyes on the strip for the first time, I will always remember the glow of lights that was so visible from so far away. Seeing the Luxor light from afar before even knowing what it was. It was a transcendent moment for me when we drove over that hill and I saw all the bright lights and neon dancing in the night!

So much history has been etched on Las Vegas Boulevard. The names of the famous and infamous litter all of Las Vegas' rich and storied history. Legendary casinos come and go. The Sands, Dunes, Desert Inn, Stardust, Frontier, Hacienda have given way to the Mirage, Bellagio, Venetian, and Wynn.....which have paved the way for the next generation: The Cosmo, Aria, SLS, etc.

One thing that remains constant: This IS the entertainment capital of the world! Where else can you find some of the world's finest restaurants within walking distance to a Del Taco? Where else can you buy a $10,000.00 cocktail (Ono cocktail at XS) within walking distance to cheap drink specials ($1 Michelobs at the Casino Royale bar)? 

You have some of the worlds best entertainment here! Cirque Du Soileil, Le Reve, Jersey Boys, stand up comedy shows, variety acts, magic acts, and the list goes on and on! 

Yes, it's a total tourist trap. Who...Freaking...Cares?

Who can say they don't have some incredible memories of some kind on the Las Vegas Strip??

Plus the people watching is just off the charts! lol

You do have to watch out for the drunks, scam artists, druggies, overly intoxicated people, panhandlers, prostitutes, pimps, and other less-than-savory characters....but it's all part of the package. lol

- One memory I can share: I remember when I was driving to work on the strip(to a casino that is long gone *sigh*) when I had to wait at the Flamingo and LV Blvd. light for 15 minutes while several elephants walked down the closed strip to make their way to Thomas and Mack for Ringling Bros Circus show. That was a sight at 5 am!

Most other memories...I don't think would be appropriate to share in this review lol 

I love this place. I love this city! It's not perfect, but it can be a hell of a lot of fun!

Viva Las Vegas!

Server seats us at the bar. We ask if we can take one of the three booths (all have couples in them and so are we). They tell us to wait and come back with who I assume is a manager. She explains to us that there is a maximum number of booths that can have couples and that the rest of the booths are (sort of) reserved for larger parties. I kind of get the feeling that I'm being judged by the sort of customer I'll be (I don't dress business casual. I'm fairly h&m casual and uninteresting, but clean of course). I start giving a bit of attitude but my other half reminds me that this is our first ""date"" in a while (toddler life). I agree and let it go. I will end up regretting that attitude I gave the manager, here is why;

First off, the place is very small, true, but still feels airy. We are seated at the very end of the bar and it is actually fairly comfortable (Although being in the industry, I do feel that these two seats are badly placed since it's too close to the kitchen action).

We are greeted by our server. She's extremely friendly. It is a perfectly sized menu so we quickly get under way;

Oysters to start; not the best ones I've had. It doesn't come with the traditional mignonette but there is a salsa.
Beef tartare; generally a big fan of the traditional with the quail egg. This one has some warm crispy bits. I criticised it at first but as I dug deeper, sort of fell in love with it. Beware, it's a fairly large appetizer portion. 
On the side, they offer their homemade cheese bread. I'm not a huge fan of cheese bread but the texture of the bread is extraordinary!
Our mains are the salmon and the steak. 
Salmon has an amazing mustard sauce on top, wife loves it so much, she has to order a side of it, and it is truly amazing. 
Steak is very very simple; with shiitake mushrooms on top. No fries, no half-made salad, nothing else. Just the amazing steak and the mushrooms. I'm completely against wasted garnish and find this amazingly beautiful.
We each started with a glass of chardonnay. I ordered a second. Just as we were nearing the end of our date, the manager came by and topped us off to thank us for our understanding. Now this is managerial beauty!!! You madame, know what you're doing!
We leave extremely happy and of course will return.",2017-11-21 08:15:26

The interior is cute. Set up where you can sit and enjoy your lunch but after work you can post up at the bar and sip on something yummy. I wish I had the chance to try one of their margs but alas, I had work to get done at my job.
I got the AZ Style burrito meal and also a chicken taco. The chicken taco was free because I checked in on Foursquare. Love Foursquare deals.
The tortilla was amazing, super soft and chewy and not hard/stale or thin/transparent. The potatoes were thick cube cut and the pollo was seasoned with something not too spicy. I should have asked for it without onions, they were tiny but I'm not a fan in general.
They have an array of salsas to choose from, but the bottles weren't labeled so I was a little hesitant on what I was getting myself into so I stayed clear.

When I called to schedule my appointment I got their voice mail and decided to leave a message after my second try to reach them. After over 2 hours I had not received a call back so I decided to call again and finally got a receptionist to answer the line. The scheduler did offer me an appointment the same day which I was grateful for and had asked for. When arriving I was greeted warmly and asked to complete new client paperwork. My therapist called me back for treatment a little past my scheduled appointment time. The therapist was very nice and I am sure meant well but she seemed to have been right out of massage school with little experience. To top that, she talked about her child and friends during the entire treatment. I will say that she has potential as far as her technique is concerned but I think I could get the same service at a massage school clinic. I wanted to relax for an hour and simply enjoy my treatment but was not able to fully do so.

I recommend getting take out if you want to try this place.  We waited for over 20 minutes to be seated and realized they weren't going in order of arrival.  When finally seated we had no menus and had to wait another 5 or so minutes for those.  Drink order about 5 minutes later.  Food order about 15 minutes after drinks came.  Food arrival a good 45 minutes after being seated.  The food thankfully made up for the ridiculous wait, but by that point we were out of drinks and even after asking for refills waited another 15 minutes or so for them to arrive.  The waitress constantly reminded us that ""they were busy"" which began to make us feel like an inconvenience to her since it never was accompanied with an apology for the wait.

Now the food was excellent.  I highly recommend the spicy wonton appetizer (not very spicy at all) in the peanut sauce, wonton soup, and cashew chicken.  All were very good and I would consider getting them via takeout in the future.",2017-01-29 15:12:50

sif0nVVwmNIcmovp74qWqg,TSxpgqzG0u38CGyyLfSAAg,1d6c6Q2j2jwVzBfX_dLHlg,3,2,1,1,"Cowboy Ciao states, ""Our aim is simple and true: thrill each and every guest, at every visit, with an entertaining and memorable dining experience."" I wish Cowboy Ciao had lived up to its promise. The Roaring Fork is better for ""urban cowboy"" food, which is a surprise given the rave reviews that Cowboy Ciao has received.  

The restaurant has dubbed the decor ""Border Baroque,"" and they note ""one reviewer called it Addams Family meets Old West bordello."" To me, it's more like a Disney version of Spanish Colonial/Santa Fe with a ""Touched by an Angel"" vibe. One of the weirder elements is a raised table for four surrounded by faux adobe walls.  Prominently displayed above the table is a vintage-style black and white photo of a nearly nude male that has some strong gay bar overtones. The photo is cool, but it has a Rudolph Valentino feel and the only part about it that is even remotely southwestern is the wooden frame. It's an odd choice, but that is true for the entire Cowboy Ciao atmosphere.     

The layout of the dinner menu is also odd. It starts off by listing the desserts at the very top. The titles leave lots to the imagination as there is no detail provided and it's unclear why the menu lists the final element of the meal first. The intent may have been to tease the diner with a tempting array of sweet (and savory) endings, but it really looks more like it was laid out by an inexperienced member of a high school newspaper staff. 

The Stetson Chopped salad ($12) was recommended by our server. It's odd that the menu provides no description for this salad, but that may be because the restaurant thinks this dish's reputation precedes it. The presentation of the salad is nice as it is arranged in rows of the individual ingredients running across the bowl (however, this presentation of salad is hardly original). The salad shows off good knife skills in the kitchen as the ingredients are uniformly chopped. The server walked us through the elements and then tossed the salad with the buttermilk pesto dressing. The BF really liked this dish and I thought the flavors were good and that the dressing was an interesting blend of ingredients. However, I really disliked the texture. It was chewy and gummy; almost like chewing salmon salad flavored gum. It's also over-priced. The entire salad would have measured less than a cup, so it made for a meager split appetizer. It's not like the ingredients for the salad are expensive. It's made up of cooked Israeli (pearl) couscous, Roma tomatoes, air-dried sweet corn, arugula, smoked salmon, and asiago cheese with toasted pepitas and dried black currants. 

Given the stingy portion on the Stetson Chopped, we decided to try the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry ($14). It's a scaled down version of the restaurant's signature entree. It features cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black, trumpet, shiitake, morel and yellow foot mushrooms in ancho cream. The sauce was a deep brown color, but it was in desperate need of salt. Even with salt, it was amazing how flat the blend of mushrooms tasted. The dish is served over ""double-cooked"" polenta. I'm not a fan of corn meal mush to begin with. Frying it after the initial cooking process is fine, but this version was dense and tasteless. When I order the signature dish at a restaurant, I expect to be blown away. That was not the case with this mediocre mushroom melange. Frankly, the Sauteed Mushrooms side dish at Durant's is better because those mushrooms are well-season and not enveloped in a sauce that masks the nuances of their individual flavors. The portion was more generous and the BF and I split reasonable servings for the price of this item.

The BF decided to go with the Rib-eye special ($40) as his entree. It was a huge portion with a full pound of steak. The meat was nice, but it was way too aggressively seasoned. A piece of quality meat does not need to be overwhelmed with spice. The rib-eye came with what was described as a sweet potato hash. Coincidentally, the BF makes a superb sweet potato hash that is on the order of caramelized sweet potato home fries. The version at Cowboy Ciao was really lumpy mashed sweet potatoes with nothing approaching the texture of a hash. There is no excuse for lackluster side dishes.

I ordered the Slow-Roasted Short Ribs ($31). The portion of meat was generous, but not enormous like the BF's steak. I liked the dried cherry BBQ sauce that was presented on the side. The meat was fork-tender and made even more delicious when dipped into the tangy sauce. The side dishes were again disappointing. The pecan grits were utterly flavorless and the pan-fried vegetables needed seasoning. Hiding the vegetables under the huge lump of grits was a less than stellar presentation.

Our meal was not thrilling. Since that it what the restaurant aims to achieve, it was a disappointment. When we have a hankering for this genre of food again, we'll make our way to The Roaring Fork.

Ciao, Cowboy Ciao.",2008-06-03 15:52:01

The salon is ecclectic.  She has local artists' works adorning the walls and changes the art every couple of months.  You can even sell that or your jewelry there!  The walls are all different, too.  The accent wall is actually paint and LACE.  Who thinks this shit up?  Ambur!

The spicy tuna roll was really good. I was hesitant about having sushi delivered considering our unforgiving heat here. But I'm really glad I did. It was spicy, fresh, and cold. 

The musubi, hit the spot, although I'm not Hawaiian, this was something my gma adopted when we were kids, so it was a throw back to my childhood. That salty, fatty, starchy goodness.

Lastly, the BBQ chicken. Dark meat, and your choice of side of rice (fried, chicken fried, white steamed, etc. the list goes on). The chicken hardly had any gristle or fat (thank god, because when you're in a good mood, biting into something crunchy and rubbery can mess up your groove if its not your thing) and it was charred to absolute perfection. I'm one of those weirdos that likes her meat cremated, gives it a different flavor!

And they were nice enough to give me a fistful of fortune cookies, a pair of chopsticks, and basic plastic ware. As well as a take out menu. 

Which btw, when it reads ""We Delivery!"" on the front portion of the menu, you know your meal is going to be legit. :)

This is a HAVE TO spot. Its better than Ono, better than L&L. Their menu is long, sushi, Hawaiian, and Chinese! All in one place?! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE.",2016-10-01 06:12:04

It is uncomfortable. The restaurant is small and quite boring. There are ceiling fans going but it's not helping. The ambience is nothing to write home about, and all I see is a bunch of people getting mixed drinks at the bar. Therefore, I think this is a great place if you like to drink.
As we walked in, with reservations, we were placed at a very uncomfortable small table right next to where the waiters have their water pitchers and likely put their orders in. We request a different table, preferably a booth, and it is not available. We accept a different table, but it too is positioned in such a way that, when the restaurant is full, there is no ability to move your chair around without hitting the chair of the person behind you.
We look at the menu and have to ask how it works. As we look at the menu, we start laughing, realizing that this restaurant charges five dollars for bread and butter. Really? Unfortunately, nothing on the menu seemed appetizing. Initially, I thought let's try a couple of things on the menu to see what they're like. My friend and I decided to opt against that for the following reason: the restaurant was not full... Probably only a quarter full... And it was so hot in there. So uncomfortable and so stuffy. With the incredible variety of options in Las Vegas, we chose to simply get up and leave, which we informed the hostess of so she could give the table to someone else, should they need it. I was really excited about trying this restaurant. The disappointment that I felt as soon as I walked into this restaurant... I would not try to come back to this restaurant, nor will I recommend it to any friends. For me, the ambience and comfort of a restaurant is as important as the food that is coming to your table.

Second, I did the soulful Sunday class and it was PHENOMENAL. The instructor, Jamie Zimmer was so great, and made my first class one to remember. She was very calming and soothing and relatable. It was pretty hot in the room (as its meant to be) but she would never let it get unbearable. She was aware of the temp, and lighting. She was just awesome

Third, all the classes are online...so you are able to see exactly when the class starts, ranging from seriously SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES. I plan on doing a kettleball class soon...that to me is so great. Like I don't ever have to go a gym, I have pilates, yoga, bootcamp, ketteleball, and many more types of fitness classes. 

Lastly, the décor and vibe of this place is so refreshing and clean and modernized. ITS PERFECT PLACE TO GO AND RELAX AND DO YOUR THING.

I think that I'm a little ""burgered out"" due to the proliferation of burger joints in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas.  In order for me to give high praise, you really have to do something outstanding with your menu, service, decor, etc....  Burgatory provides a nice environment, solid menu options and great service.  However, when you compare their offerings to other burger joints, it's just equally appealing to the other burger restaurants.

We went during their ""Happy Hour"" last Friday where you can order their appetizers and beer at half off the menu price, as well as $5 well drinks.  Great deal if you can get there between 4-6pm.  Because of the price, I decided to go with appetizers for my meal.  I ordered the Fire kissed Sriracha wings, Moo Better Blues sliders, Sea Salt and Herb Pommes Frites and the Bangkok Steak Fries.  My daughter and I split the apps and my sister and niece ordered individual customized burgers.  Additionally, my daughter, niece and sister ordered milkshakes and I ordered Mike's Scratch Margarita.

The fresh cut fries were exactly as I expected them to be: hot, crispy and well seasoned. That may not seem like much, but I can't tell you how many times I've been to a restaurant that specialized in ""burgers"" and then the proprietors screwed things up by serving wishy-washy frozen fries. Ugh!  The wings were well done and the sliders were tasty.  Additionally, the $5 ""Rita"" had some mojo behind it. (You know how ""some"" restaurants water down their well drinks on special...  This was not the case.  Whew-wee!)  My only compalint was that the Bangkok Steak Fries (actually tempura fried portobello mushrooms) were on the greasy/heavy side.  Good idea gone wrong because of a leaden tempura batter.  Tempura batters should be light and extremely crispy which allows the food being fried to shine through.  This did not happen.

The problem with abstract art is you could change it all every month and it would still look the same. This makes a gallery concept stagnant and would never give me a reason to return based on artwork alone (which it should considering your name has GALLERY in it).

Owners were playing fetch with their dogs and the dogs get to roam free and have a blast chasing each other. There is also a smaller fence area for miniature dogs if you don't wish to mix them in with the bigger dogs. After your dog is done running around there is an area to rinse them off before u leave as well. The only reason I give this place a four us because some owners didn't pick up after their dogs and you have to be careful where you step. And the places to get poop bags were also oddly located. Otherwise a very nice doggy play time!",2014-10-13 05:06:35

I completely understand how employees want to go home and not have people walking in when they are closing; but one day my mom and my siblings came to this location maybe 2-3 hours before closing time so  we thought we were okay.
NO. The waitress barely had that many people to wait on and it took her a million decades to get us anything whether it be drinks or food. You almost did not want to ask for anything just because we wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP. We already knew what we wanted for a good 30 minutes before she came back and took our order.  Then we got our order maybe another hour to an hour and a half later! SWEET. By that time my mom being the feisty little Filipino lady that she is was absolutely livid and was complaining about when we would get our food. I don't rush people yes i am irritated and hungry but i will not rush you or get loud.  God only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors. 

    So after staying at this location for 2 hours or so because of the long wait for everything i am slightly scared to go back to any chilis but i love their strawberry lemonade so its hard to refuse based on one girls performance or lack of.  As i finish my review on their not good food quality and piss poor service i cannot help but notice another girl had the same issue in june and i almost wonder if we had the same female who had waited on us and literally waited before taking our orders and giving us anything. If i went to this location which i highly doubt we will, i hope to god she is or was fired because if you cannot handle a couple tables and are no where to be found majority of the time something is just not right about that.  I am sorry. This is Arizona honey work laws suck here and if you aren't a decent worker you should not have a job unless you are being a brown noser with the managers and that's the only reason you are there is one of the many reasons i hate hate HATE Arizona work laws with a passion. But that is a whole other story.",2012-01-05 14:34:00

This, of course, meant that the rest of the world also read the many positive Yelp reviews and knew it was the perfect day to stop into Joe's. Why waste a sunny, cool day inside?

I waited in the half-hour-long line while Husband sat in back with the dog at one of the picnic tables once the line started getting inside. There was a worker dude who would helpfully hand out laminated menus to us line-standers and answer any questions we had. He highly suggested the Fontina burger, but I already knew what I wanted: a cheeseburger with sautéed onions, a side of onion rings and fried zucchini, and a chocolate milkshake. 

After I ordered, I was given a little buzzer/beeper thingy for when the food was ready. It took just long enough for me to check out their super clean bathroom with the dolls in the walls and the doll movie on the tv before the food was ready. YUM that milkshake! I really liked my cheeseburger, but Husband wasn't too impressed. We both liked the onion rings, but left a lot of the fried zucchini in favor of drinking our milkshakes (he got vanilla bean). My biggest problem actually ended up being the ranch that we requested for the sides... it tasted really off. The consistency wasn't right and it didn't compliment the food at all. I am a firm believer that onion rings need to be dunked in something, so I ended up dunking in my ketchup. It worked, but I wished for something better.

There were a lot of other dogs lying around under picnic tables, so that was pretty cool to see. There is also a bird group that gathers (I'm pretty sure they were parrots, but I can't say for sure. I know they were very colorful and friendly!) some weekends out at one of the front tables while they eat. Parents and kids would wander over to talk to the bird handlers, which was neat. Definitely a family AND dog friendly place.",2013-01-30 22:56:45

The restaurant was clean and tidy however when we were there there was quite a bit of smoke coming from the kitchen area that seeped into the main restaurant (I think they had some ventilation issues).

Both the egg rolls were super small and they served it with sweet and sour sauce (not the traditional fish sauce), and the grilled pork was tasty but portion wise small for the price.

Overall, it was worth the visit but will most likely not worth another visit.",2014-05-11 20:14:36

The only reason I went last weekend is because our very kind neighbor gave us a gift card for Christmas that we haven't used. We should have regifted. 

Let's start with the breadsticks. Salty and drab. Maybe I just got spoiled with other Italian eateries that give you a loaf of fresh bread and either herb butter or herbed olive oil. These are covered with garlic SALT. 

My husband had the salad which was decent, but c'mon. Their dressing is so commercialized now. I had the minestrone soup which was, again, decent. Tastes like it's from a can.

I had the baked ziti which was flavorless. My husband had a chicken garlic pasta dish which is edible but, again, not great. 

Service was very good. I feel sorry for the waiter for having to work at Olive Garden. He should take his good food service skills somewhere else.

I must share my experience at the OG from a couple years ago. I ordered the manicotti- which they don't have anymore. While eating I dug out a huge piece of plastic. The server got the manager who explained to me that it was a  plastic bag that the food comes in. She was extremely apathetic about the whole situation and I only got comped for my meal. 

People can save alot of money by skipping a trip to the Olive Garden and buying a Stouffers frozen Italian meal. If you do want to spend money on a good Italian meal check out the ma and pop local Italian places. Roma Garden and Aiello's are a good start. They are the same price for real homemade Italian food.",2012-04-06 15:59:41

I love the location since it is close to both home and work. Additionally, there is plenty of parking. Upon arriving, you have a nice view of the wraparound porch where you can enjoy your meal outside. Once inside, you are greeted by the hostess and a nice view of the oyster bar. The oyster bar has cute motorcycle seats which is both fun and comfy to sit at. To the right is the bar and bar tables. To the left is the main dining area. We sat in the main dining area at a small booth made for two. The decorations inside are soothing and reminiscent of the sea. 

As we looked at the menu, our waitress came up for our drink orders and told us the evening specials. I decided to get the special - sturgeon in a pesto sauce. My husband ordered the Adriatic stew off the menu. We also ordered the yellow tail appetizer. Our waitress brought out complimentary bread and our appetizer. The bread was interesting as one was squid ink bread. Different, but tasty. My husband enjoyed the yellow tail, but I wasn't a fan. (Not a huge fan of raw fish.) Shortly after we finished off the appetizers, our food was quick to arrive and plated beautifully. Our waitress described the sturgeon like swordfish and she was right, it was very similar. I enjoyed it a lot. (Not fishy, more on the firm side, and flavorful.) My husband was excited for his stew but a little on the disappointed side. It looked beautiful and tasty but was actually more on the flavorless side and the fish was overcooked. 

Overall, we will be back but probably just for happy hour. I'm really looking forward to having some pork belly and the gnocchi!",2014-03-16 21:22:03

Basically the meat is obscenely greasy, the cheese is fatty and flavorless, the bread is always wet as if it were dipped in water or something (I really hope it's not fat, but it just might be), and the veggies are processed garbage.
