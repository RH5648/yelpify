I tried the chili cheese dog, the banh mi dog, and house fries.

The chili cheese dog was great.  I love the fresh chunks of cheese.  The brisket chili was so good.  It is a messy one so grab some napkins.  This is a definite must try again for me.

I didn't really care for the Banh Mi Dog but being Vietnamese I had to try it since it was obviously inspired by the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  It was good but could be better.  They should have used pickled carrots and picked daikon if they wanted to stay true to the banh mi spirit.  But it was good and I would have it again.

The house fries were decent but I didn't think they were great.  They definitely gave me a generous portion and I barely put a dent into it.  The fries were dark brown so I am assuming they either double fry it or fry it for a while.  Either way, they were decent  but nothing amazing.

They have additional stuff on the menu that isn't on their website.   Can't really tell you what they are.  I've never heard of the stuff they had listed.

I like the atmosphere.  It has a retro feel.  Asides from a few tables, their seating primarily consists of bar top/stool lined around their kitchen and against the window.  They got some pretty good music playing on the speaker.

Overall, I like it and will give them another shot.",2013-02-24 03:32:33

The food itself isn't bad. I ordered chicken tikka masala mild because much as I love spice, my stomach makes me pay for it days later. Better safe than sorry!

Their chicken tikka masala isn't laden with sugar like other places. In fact, it's the opposite. Tons of fenugreek and methi in it makes it almost sour/bitter, but still in a good way. 

Portions are HUGE for what I normally get in a lot of Indian restaurants and prices are proportionate to serving -- thank you so much for that. I wasn't a fan of their Onion Kulcha because it had a slightly bitter taste that didn't go well with my CTM, but on its own, it was fabulous. It was also piping hot - that's hard to find in a lot of places.

I'd come back and try their buffet.",2014-11-13 19:29:23

However, after a half dozen visits, I've yet to have a meal where I left feeling overly satisfied. Salads, entrees, pizza, and today's visit: brunch, have all been ""OK.""

Avoid the farm bread as it's really on the level of a bread that should just be brought to the table for free. Drinks are reasonably priced, they'll be more than you might be accustomed to in Oakland, but not significantly more.

Took over 30 minutes for our food to come out today, but the restaurant was busy and it was relaxing sitting outside so it wasn't a big deal in this case.

All-in-all, it's a decent spot for a casual lunch or dinner, but from my experience, don't expect anything to knock your socks off.",2016-05-07 20:12:58

I don't eat a whole lot of Vietnamese food, but this place is real close to my neighborhood so that is always a plus.  They have made the restaurant bigger so there is plenty of seating although they due tend to be busy around lunch time.  The last few times they weren't breaking any records for speed even though my waitress was very nice.  I'm not sure this would be the best place if you are in a hurry. I appreciate the vegetarian options they have on the menu.  I thought the Vegetarian Pho was very good.  I haven't had many versions to compare it too, but it was much much better than the vegetarian versions I have had at the noodle shop downtown. The Tofu Vermicelli is really great.  it;s a cross between a hot noodle dish and a salad.  Which sounds kind of odd, but it's very good. They also have a pretty efficient take out so calling in and picking up isn't a problem.

Try:

8qZVsgxM2dDO5BYAUjGdiQ,2sr6IVXA9KHmcclxQfVizw,Po0QGzgwFrfnGJEi_akCjA,1,3,1,0,"Went tonight for my wife's (she is from S. Korea) birthday as she was craving Korean BBQ.  We normally--in the past--have gone to Sura but decided to change it up for this occasion.  Well, we now know that we will NOT be going back EVER to this place!  I will say that the place had decent food...brisket was good and so was the pork bulgogi.  But, the banchan was just mediocre...and based on the review pics from the past it seems liked we didn't get the full selection of side dishes.  

We got there around 6:00 PM and and we started to cook the AYCE ""Nevada"" BBQ (priced at $16.95/person) around 6:14 PM.  I only know this because I started to snap some pics of the group around that time on my iPhone.  Why did I check this a little later on, you ask?  Well, our server rudely wanted to turn off our grill around 7:15 PM and we told her we still wanted to eat a little more.  She then told us that the time limit was 1.5 hrs for the AYCE and we had only 10 more minutes.  Say what?  I was quite shocked as I have never been to a KBBQ that actually had a TIME LIMIT!!!

So, I checked my phone and saw that I snapped the first picture at 6:14 PM.  Which means we didn't have only 10 minutes left, but actually 30 minutes left when we were rudely advised.  Ironically, we were all getting stuffed anyway, and was ready to wrap up soon.  Now keep in mind, that some other tables who came in before us were STILL eating when we were told we had to wrap it up.  I guess they must have had ""cooler"" waitresses than ours.

I asked to speak to the manager and she smiled and listened, but you could tell she could have cared less (""Oh yes, uh huh, ok, sorry...."").  She even told me--as I spoke in a normal voice complaining about how we were cheated out of a half hour in our ""timed"" 1 1/2 hr allotment (geez, that kills me to even have to mention that!)--that I needed to ""calm down"".  After, just standing there for several minutes with no offer to make us feel better or even a nice gesture in words, I said ""Thanks anyway...I guess you can go then""...and she did!

So, be forewarned that depending on who your server is...and I guess if you don't fit the mold of true Koreans/Asians (I'm Korean-American, BTW)...you may be told to wrap it up and stop eating as your time may be up!  So, combined with lousy, slow service, you could be getting very little BBQ for what is supposed to be AYCE.  My advice to you is to go to Sura or another local AYCE Korean BBQ.  At least there you won't get horrible service and a ridiculous time allotment for eating.  If you don't heed my warning, then maybe you better bring a stopwatch to verify that you really are getting 1.5 hrs to eat their so-called ""AYCE"".",2015-07-04 06:54:32

Unfortunately, we are a true Italian family and we judge Italian restaurants by how close they come to real Italian cuisine.  This is definitely an American version of Italian food.

The wine list is outstanding with a variety of excellent wines at all price levels.  The atmosphere is lovely and chic and the place is hopping with customers--in other words great vibe.  I don't know why restauranteurs feel the need to hire young attractive maitre'ds who never smile and aren't welcoming.  To the young ladies who seat customers here, the clients notice when you are indifferent to them--smile and pretend that you enjoy your job.

Sack's is one of my fav sandwich shops. It was my go to spot for lunch last semester at ASU. These days I can only afford to go on occasion. Great sandwiches just wish they would come down on their prices a bit to make it more pocket friendly.

Nice bonus if you ""like"" on fb as they offer free drinks from time to time. Oh, and the cookie you get with your sandwich is a nice touch. And there is also the punch card. 10th sandwich is free!

The impressionist and jazz are my fav sammies. One is a veggie and the other is bacon, turkey and avocado. The crew comes up with some pretty tasty sandwich specials, sometimes they sound crazy, but trust they will be delicioso!

The karage was a bit soggy which made me sad because that crunch is just as important as the flavor to me.

Vegetable tempura was ok. I wish I could tell you about the shrimp but it never showed up.

First the beer is lacking! If you are into the usual american beer this is enough. HOWEVER, the wait staff said they don't sell much of it, but they do carry Huss Brewing Beer. Not sure why anyone would drink the other stuff, but if you like craft beers the local brews are here, but have to find them and remind the staff they do offer craft beers. 

I liked the tvs all around and there is an app to listen to the screen if you bring earbuds. Which I think would be great if I were here to watch a game.

Ok. Onto the food. I ordered a Hatch Burger because someone recommended it. Totally not what I was expecting when I read the description, but I tried it anyway. Ham and a hamburger patty do mix well together. It also had Hatch green chile. It was very different from what I could get in NM, but it was oddly tasty. The burger served open faced on sourdough was good, but the sourdough was soggy. Who needs the carbs anyway! Next time if I were to order it would be just on the plate. I ordered a salad for my side. It was really good. Romaine!!! No iceberg here! It had everything I liked on it too. All the ingredients were finely chopped and added to the salad. Next time I would hold the bacon, because I don't like salad with bacon. The balsamic dressing was the best. The pickle spear, served with the burger, lacked crunch, but the salad more than made up for it. Brad ordered the carne adovada, he is brave and likes to search for food from home. It was not as good as home, but it was tender and moist. The red chile, or what ever it is called, was tasty for Arizona. He surprised me and ate the black beans. I have not acquired a taste for black beans, but he said they were good. Lastly, because Brad cannot live without dessert he order the Mile High cake. It looked nice and was dark chocolate flavored.

Service was pretty good except we asked for fresh squeezed orange juice and it came back carbonated.  Weird right? So we were thinking they must have accidentally given us mimosas ..and the server tried to convince us because the OJ was so fresh it seemed carbonated..  what?  I dont even know what to say to that.  So pass on the OJ.  

The fresh ricotta was delish and the porchetta us an extremely heavy portion, so if you are craving steak and eggs. this will definitely fix that craving and then some.

The pepperonata eggs Benedict and arugula salad was very good and the hollandaise was slightly different with the added peppers twist.  Not spicy just very flavour-filled ..a nice change.

Here's what I didn't want to notice but noticed while dining at Wingharts. 

The music that was being played was coming out of a visible iphone that was hooked up to a juke box.  One of the high top tables was stabilized by two dish rags folded and propped under the table legs.  We all jerry -rigg from time to time.   But I expect more from a resturant that sales $9.00 bugers. Moving on there were some horrific looking paintings on the walls. One which reminded me of the movie the Ring. 

Yes  the shipwreck burger was delicious.  The pizza I got was not so great. While the toppings were good and the crust was warm the artichoke paste that was spread on it was only slightly cool.  The crust of my pizza did nothing to heat the artichoke paste. That was very distracting.
So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5?   I really wanted a meal I could sink my teeth into but that's not what I got. It's probably my own fault for going to a buger joint and getting a pizza.",2013-01-30 02:35:18

But they had a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment book, so I thought I would give them a try. SO glad I did! My husband and I had a great experience, and I'm sure we will be returning, even at full price.

It was prom night, so the place was pretty packed, but we were seated right away, even without a reservation. We each had a house salad ($5 each), which was nothing special, and we split a bottle of good Chianti ($36). I had the veal parmesan ($24), which was tasty and served with a large portion of penne pasta. Sauce was a little plain, but the meat was cooked nicely.

The standout of the meal was my husband's fettucine alfredo ($16, or free for us with the coupon). Whenever we try a new Italian restaurant, that's his standard order to gauge the place, and he said this was among the best he's ever had. I tried a bite, and I would have to concur.

So the food was good and the prices were reasonable (especially when using a half-off coupon!). My only complaint is that it's a little dark inside.

We came on a Thanksgiving Monday.
Servers are experienced they worked at other HK style restaurant before. Speedy service, special lunch and breakfast menu. They forgot to give us special menus so just ask for them during lunch and breakfast hours.  Note: a menu also posted outside the window, be sure to check them out。 Busy lunch time We arrived.  It is so called Korean Restaurant, however it offers HK style food, Japanese Ramen and Korean signature items. I would say it is a Chinese-Jap-Korean Fusion Cuisine. 

To evaluate a fusion restaurant , I haven't try Korean and Japanese items therefore my rating is based on only the food we tried today. 

Food are 4/5. 
Service are 3/5. No cutlery, no table setup and unfinished cleaning table before directing customers to the seating ~ bad impression before ordering. 
Cleanliness 3/5


One score lost on food because the Milk tea base is not the greatest I had ever tasted. If other sugar choices can be provided that would be great. Such as brown sugar, or honey etc on a side 
Two scores lost on service and cleanliness because of the server did not make a proper table setup before sending customers and no cutlery.

We were there for lunch and they had a buffet available. Everyone knows that buffets are not synonymous with quality food, which is fine, but it was more a case of limited options.
There was a limited salad bar, a lentil soup, one rice pot, one type of bread and several desserts. On the dessert side they had a friendly lady make some kind of Indian street food. That was a treat. She was friendly, volunteered information and what she made was good too.
Back to the main dishes there was chicken tikka, two kinds of meat dishes (Butter Chicken and Goat Meat) and then there was a vegetarian station. I think for a buffet they should have more than the two meat stew options. Perhaps another chicken dish? How about a fish dish or lamb dish? Perhaps a shrimp dish? With that said, we were completely full of course.
The other issue with having limited options is that a queue develops and it becomes crowded since everyone aims for and huddles around the same items.
Price-wise it is slightly high, but not by much.

I do appreciate The Host's decoration and attempt at an Indian ambiance.
I also appreciate the staff who were polite and seemed genuine. They cared it seemed, delivered on our requests (water, lassi, ice, refill, napkins, etc.) and were verbally polite.",2017-06-18 00:35:23

Came here with my hubby and 2 kids.  The inside is quite small and something I don't recommend bringing a large party to.  With us 4, I thought we weren't going to have enough room but it was just right.  

With this being our first time here, we each received a free piece of chocolate (except the baby because he doesn't have any teeth lol).  My older son received a beautiful chocolate lollipop and the pic I uploaded shows some damage caused by him.  When he first received it, it was in pristine condition - I promise!

They have a special menu for Sundays, which looks like a more condensed version of the other menus I've seen on here.  I was really surprised to see such a large selection of specialty coffee drinks but I guess it makes sense with this place being a coffee shop along with being a restaurant.  I ended up ordering an iced butterscotch latte and Cornish pasty and green salad and hubby got an iced peanut butter chocolate latte and the English breakfast sandwich.  The butterscotch latte reminded me of a white chocolate mocha, which happens to be one of my favorite specialty coffee drinks, and it was so good.  Hubby really enjoyed his drink - it had a strong peanut butter flavor which I didn't really like but this would be a really great choice for peanut butter lover.

I've always wanted to try a Cornish pasty but never had the opportunity until now.  For those of you who don't know what it is, it is similar to a pot pie.  It is a puff pastry filled with ground beef, carrots, diced potatoes, and celery.  It was a good size and along with the salad, it was a filling meal.  Hubby is a man of few words when it comes to food.  The English breakfast sandwich he couldn't stop talking about.  He said that although it was simple, it was made well and is something he would love to eat everyday.  To me, that says a lot!

We order some extra sides for the older child to eat and I ended up purchasing a paut au chocolate (spelling?) pastry to take home, the bill come out to around $40 after tip.  I thought it was really reasonable and affordable.  

If you aren't interested in dining-in, they have a pastry case with an assortment of treats in the front and in another room they have a wall of UK imported items for sale.  I think it's so worth it to take the time to dine in.  The service is truly one of the best that I've had the pleasure of experiencing and the food is amazing!  The 4 and a half star rating don't lie!  I hope to come back really soon to try out other items.",2016-09-18 23:56:35

The space is very casual and just as we sat down they dimmed the lights and cranked up the KPop music that accompanied the sexy videos on the TV monitors. Unfortunately the music became too loud to talk to each other but the videos did want me to break it down SYTYCD style. 

The menu is modular so you can mix and match meats and sides which all come out in cardboard bowls or metal trays (like pizza). Food came out pretty quickly but not all at the same time. We ordered whole fried tilapia, sweet potato birds nest, Ramen Mac & Cheese, Pulled Pork and Bao Buns. It's not the best place to be organic / soy-free / gluten-free to be honest but I took a half bite of the Ramen Mac and Cheese and it was delicious and had wonderful crunchy toppings that added some robustness to it.  Hungry man loved the pulled pork and the delicious spicy BBQ that he put in the Bao buns. The BBQ sauce is the same sauce as the wings, so I bet those are awesome. The whole tilapia came out and was dramatic. It was glazed in soy chili sauce which unfortunately I can't partake in on doctor's orders, but what I tasted of it, it was quite tasty. However because tilapia is a small fish, there wasn't much meat and it was a bit dry because much of it was stuck to the fried skin. The owner/Manager(?) Tim checked in to see how the meal was and said they're changing the menu every day and taking in feedback. I should note that the sweet potato birds nest  is good but it's really more of a dessert than a side. It's fried in rice bran oil which is great, but it is also drizzled in honey and cinnamon so it's definitely sweet. 

The mixed drinks were quite good- I had the yuzu citrusy ""jar"" which was like a lemonade with vodka and my husband got the closest thing to an Arnold Palmer which was perfect with the pulled pork! 

Next time I'd really like to try the kimchi slaw and tomato salad and we'll probably sit outside so we can have a conversation. But here's how I'll leave how Hungry Man felt about this place.

When I first came, it was decorated for Halloween, which was adorably whimsical. The space is small and intimate. Perhaps because it's right next door to a coffee shop, it shares in those characteristics: very relaxed and welcoming. You can stay as long as you please with minimal interruptions. The dim lights and dark wood definitely create an ambiance that makes lovers want to snuggle up next to each other and share a bottle of wine. 

...A bottle of wine which is either on special or chosen from their great selection. The last time I went, I fell in love with a great Carmenere. The boyfriend got a Bordeaux. And they know their wine - please ask them questions and tell them what you want from your glass. They'll partner you up with something you're bound to enjoy. 

During the winter months they serve hot cider. Which made my experience seasonally charming! 

They have a few munchies and desserts on the menu. And they don't just serve wine - they have a fully stocked bar - so, if you're a Manhattan girl... ;-)

I love it when I can write a review about a great people watching moment... consider this one of those reviews. Woman cries and cusses out her lover since she's had one too many drinks and realizes he won't leave his wife for her. She runs out without her jacket and he goes after her...

I've flown them on short flights within Alberta and also to Hawaii and the experience has always been positive.  The last flight we took was from Vancouver and due to a change of plans, we wanted to fly out earlier than 10PM.  I called the toll free number in the morning to try to change and was told there seemed to be lots of seats on the 5:50PM flight and we could likely get seats if we went to the airport and asked to change our flight.  I was told there would be a fee of $75/person to do this though.

When we arrived at the airport, the customer service rep was able to make the change and she was so nice, she offered to waive our luggage cost due to the fee.  It was a nice offer but we are able to get the luggage fee waived when my husband shows his veteran's card.  This is great perk.

The flights are great and the most attendants are smiling and looking like they are enjoying their job and ensuring flyers are comfortable.  They offered cookies or pretzels along with our trip.  Too bad no in flight TVs but it's ok for the short flight.

I've never had any issues with booking flights and changing them if I have to.  Sometimes, I'm on hold for a while due to volume.  When flying to the States, the cost is usually more than American airlines but sometimes we book with WJ because they can be less hassle and more trustworthy than other lines.",2015-05-13 04:10:38

I've visited a couple of times for cocktails and then more recently for food. The atmosphere, cocktails and overall lay-out is cool, but the food is just A-ok as is the service. 

The service was pretty slow-moving and we soon learned that this is probably not the best spot to stop by if you're on a time limit. The food itself is decent, but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random. I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as, but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto, cheeses, paninis and pizzas. The pizzas are only around $11 and they are easily able to be shared. The salads are also pretty large in size and could easily be shared as well. 

In summary, this is a good spot to have a couple after-work cocktails and maybe stay for an appetizer or two, but I'll probably keep Hanny's at just that for me and choose another location for my meal, especially if I have to be somewhere!

I like the little kettle and teacup they bring out to you. The crispy green beans were decent. The breading is very plain... it isn't seasoned like TGI Friday's, but I guess that's why they give you the spicy dipping sauce (which I didn't try). The spring roll was good, but I had to pick out the chopped up mushrooms. Made a small mess trying to pour the little cup of sweet chili sauce... a spoon would have been smart. The honey chicken was tasty and the rice was also good. I usually expect Chinese rice to be dry and flaky, but it was actually good.

It's kind of odd that it's located inside Palace Station since it's not a trendy casino and which is why it took me a couple months to actually check this place out.

This restaurant is very similar to Pizza Rock and has many of the same menu items.

I had the sangria which was just meh. I wouldn't recommend it. Very sweet. I thought it would be served in a wine class but it was served in a glass you'd serve soda. I would have a beer next time instead. 

I tried the meatballs and they were the same ones that you can find at Pizza Rock. They are amazing and so tender and the sauce is tasty. I would recommend trying these if you had not. 

We then tried the picante pizza. Very spicy as you would think but tasty. I enjoyed it. If you enjoy food on the hot side this pizza is for you.

The food was good- very good, but for the price point, I was somehow disappointed-(we paid $100 for two, getting only 2entrees , 2 wines by the glass, no apps, no salads, no soups, no sides or desserts or coffee).

The entrees- I got the swordfish, which was excellent, with a wonderful savory sauce.  The look of the serving dish was weird- a bowl with a blue rim that looked like a soup bowl that came from a cafeteria. The gentleman sitting 12 inches away had the same swordfish served in a slightly larger, more  elegant white dish. I didn't think this was a good sign, but it did remind me of the old Regent Square style of dishes. My husband got the steak and liked it but wished it was warmer, or the plate hotter. This was probably the biggest infraction of all. Perhaps we should have said something about it at the time, but the opportunity did not arise.

The atmosphere and decor are lovely. Elegant lighting, iron decorative sconces, carved tables, and multiple rooms. This place has a European feel, and a huge improvement over the tiny digs of the RS version. The noise was not a factor but there were distractions. Maybe it was the location of our table ( close proximity to kitchen door and Bar entrance) and the way I felt squeezed in with all the senior citizens and possibly because it was my 56th birthday, I am now relegated to the not cool section of the trendy restaurants.

So, the concept is great; games everywhere, cool vibe, outdoor area, etc. Where it fails absolutely is that it turned into a very young 21-ish hipster dump with people screaming like girls, lots of drunken antics (guys throwing other guys over their shoulders, a little sickness on the side) and a staff that has no idea how to control this unwieldy beast.

Let me address first the bar situation. Sadly understaffed. Will, the unkempt bartender whose ass crack I saw more than I cared to, was rude, inefficient, dirty looking (I mean, scuzzy) and completely biased toward those he served. If they don't fire this guy then he's obviously in with the bosses. Loser.

A girl with a tramp stamp (you can't miss it, it takes up her whole back) behind the bar with her face in the computer for a good solid 20 minutes (that's how long it took us to get a drink and I STILL don't know what she looks like) ignoring everyone at the bar, that she works at, for a living, to do nothing. Perfect. 

Well, that's about it for bartenders on a loud, busy Thursday night. A bar back that we'd asked to help us get oblivious tramp stamp girl's attention snapped at us like we were filthy animals who'd wandered in for a scrap. Maybe a little customer service training is in order. I THINK SO.

On our way outside to the back through the blasting music that was so loud that if you could hear yourself think you would tell yourself to leave, saw a guy passed clean out. A sonic boom couldn't wake this guy. Because that's how loud the music was and he was snoring heavily. 

Finally make it out to see a bunch of seriously young looking kids screaming about Jenga. The fabulous band (with a bass player!) couldn't be heard over the juvenile squeals and blocks crashing of this game that seems fun, but not when you have cool music to listen to. Priorities are not right here. 

We had one great bartender who came over and got us our second drink. She was sweet and very cool. I tried to hand her a tip, but she had walked away (??). I had to call her back. Pretty sure she's not used to that with this entitled whiny crowd. Ugh. I'd die if I had her job. Or, I'd probably go to jail for back handing some of those kids. Where were their parents??

Anyway, avoid until this situation fixes itself, it has so much potential. As of now it's just a joke.

As an aside I'd say to the manangers: if you want to make money it's not by alienating people who have disposable income to spend and allowing the college level brats who make minimum wage to take over. I'm pretty sure they're costing you as much as you're making, both in keeping the older crowd away and with the serious destruction they looked like they were causing.",2013-10-25 15:48:34

I ordered the Signature Clam Broth Shoyu ramen which was very enjoyable. The broth was light but rich (and not too salty thankfully), while the thin noodles were soft yet filling. Surprisingly, the pork was very different from what I usually have at other ramen places. One would expect the thinly sliced, slightly charred pork chasiu belly or shoulder, however, Konjiki's was a light pink color with more meat and less fat ratio, and of course, without that charring. 

As for the ambiance and furnishings, I really liked the table setup of the place. At the center is a rectangular-shaped high table with stools for ""eat-and-dash"" customers to sit side by side while admiring the beautiful centerpiece orchids. Meanwhile, standard four-seater tables line both sides of the restaurant. 

Lastly, of all ramen places I've been to so far, I believe Konjiki is the only one with a dessert counter where one can buy tasty treats.

You can sit inside the cottage or outside under the canopy of trees. Eclectic and sophisticated menu...  might be considered Cal-French?  Great food/wine pairings.  Lovely service.

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.

Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.

Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.

Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.

I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.",2011-01-12 14:26:24

The pool is beautiful, get there early to snag a lounger under a tree. I had the most amazing gin and cucumber cocktail. Perhaps my favorite part of the hotel is how closely it is located to Vdara, Cosmo and Bellagio. We didn't take a cab the whole weekend from the time we arrived at our hotel. 

We were able to secure a good room rate over Memorial Day through Player's Club. The person who checked us in was a disaster and they screwed up our bill and put it on the wrong credit card.

Thanks so much for the reviews! I recently moved to 702 and I wanted to see where I could find a yummy greek spot! After doing a quick search on yelp... The Fat Greek was on my hit list!

I'm a huge gyro fan and after eating at Papa Cristos in LA numerous times over the past 2 years... I was hoping to find a spot in Vegas that could fill my void of having Papa Cristos withdraws.

Came here on Valentine's Day for lunch with my friend visiting town from San Diego. We both ordered the Fat Greek gyro (lamb/beef)... be prepared to get messy! I had feta cheese and talziki sauce on my face the whole time! gyros are super messy! haha.

I'm a huge fan of their fat greek gyro!!! love the feta cheese :)) pita bread and lamb/beef were on point. Super huge... you can split it with someone if you're no that hungry!

I will be back when I'm craving for a gyro!

Indoor/outdoor seating (no wait). casual dining (love the classic bright blue and white theme). private parking lot (no problems with parking). Decent prices.

If you're a Vegas local or visiting... and hungry for greek... stop by The Fat Greek!

The menu has every possible permutation of traditional and new hotdogs including turkey dogs for the health conscious. Even the buns are light as air and stand in second position to the wonderful dogs. This is an excellent value as well with gourmet plates including coleslaw and a pickle at $4.75.

The Spring had less artisans than the Xmas one, as well as new ones. I am finding that most of my home decorations come from here. It is very convenient for me, even if it's a credit card maximization occasion. Does not matter if I grab the artisans' business cards, I will never make my way to some small town (given that I have no car). Plus, you get to see some truly amazing artistic endeavours from Quebecois artists.

I always ignore the fashion and the food aisles (esp this one) b/c I am not keen and it's a stampede of opportunistic people looking for freebies, respectively.

The pottery & glass work amazes me and I would love to own even more pieces but I know it's not functional anymore.

The art featured is beautiful, but I find you need to be in the mood to buy it. Otherwise, you won't have an eye for it.

My favourites are slowly becoming the leather craftsmen and the artisans who make purses (there are cloth ones).  I found an amazing leather carry-on bag (or weekender bag) from a guy whose studio is in Toronto! And I bought a cute brick-coloured leather purse.  

As far as purses are concerned, there is a lot of selection. Personally, I detest tacky branded purses (or worse, fakes), so I find the purses sold here a refreshing alternative to complement your own style. If you are in the market for a clutch, wrist one for clubbing, cosmetic bag, work purse, tote bag, weekend purse, etc, this is the place to go.

On this particular occasion I placed a phone order to be picked up at 4pm. I thought 50% off, can't go wrong with that. So I ordered pizza for everyone. 

1 large thin crust pepperoni, sausage, and bacon.

2  medium original crust pepperoni pizzas.

As a I paid for my order and grabbed my pizzas I noticed that the top boxes were hot but the bottom box was cold.  I asked the cashier if the pizza was sitting out very long and she replied "" I'm not sure but I don't think so"". I opened the cold box of pizza and the pizza looked unappetizing and old.

The employee offered to make a pizza replacement.   So I was left with the decision to wait 15 minutes for one new pizza and allow the two other pizzas to get cold.  So I  made the decission and waited. Once my pizza was ready I headed home.

The large pizza was good the two pepperoni pizza were absolutely terrible.  The pizza were now cold, soggy , and once again unappetizing.  No one ate the pizza and they went straight to the trash.

On a Wednesday night, there were no reservations required as I think the restaurant is still fairly new and it's still pretty slow.  We were accommodated quickly.

I want to note that the service here, while a little bit slow, was great.  Our server was very friendly and there were always people asking us (a little too much sometimes) if we were done with our dish so they could clear it out.  Water was always full.  The GM also came over to chat and to make sure everything was alright, which we appreciated.

Prices are reasonable for seafood.

The food was a little lackluster... perhaps there are still a few kinks to sort out as this is such a new restaurant:

- No bread basket - you have to order it separately and it comes with a nice onion spread.

- Sea Level and Blue Point oysters - one of them, which I assume is the Sea Level, was itty bitty teeny tiny (I'm very small and have very small hands - see picture for scale) - literally smallest oyster I've ever seen.  However, both oysters were fresh (I haven't gotten sick!) and had a nice salty brine flavor.  Comes with all the condiments.

- Squid chow chow - we had no idea what a chow chow was and should have asked.  It's basically fried calamari tossed in peppers and onions in a sweet/spicy sauce.  It was really, really greasy and I felt like I was eating more batter than I was squid.  I had to spit out one that was all batter and no squid.  The flavors were good, though.

- Mussels - these were my favorite of the evening.  The sliced grilled baguettes went well with the butter/white wine/lemon sauce and the mussels were aplenty and fairly fresh.  I would recommend getting these!

 - Lobster roll - unfortunately, both my coworker and I found lots of shell pieces in the lobster salad, which we both bit into.  My piece of shell was quite large and she had many little pieces in hers.  The GM was nice enough to comp both rolls, which was a nice gesture.  It's understandable that they might have some pieces of shell in them since they apparently get these really fresh and make their lobster salads on the spot, but it's still not an excuse - I've never had a shell problem with any lobster roll I've had.  The cole slaw had a nice pickled flavor to it, but I didn't eat much of it.

Overall, an okay place to have a dinner with colleagues as there is a lot of space and it's conveniently located in Hearst Tower, but I think there's still a few hiccups to remediate since it's so new.",2016-02-25 04:32:57

You'll also see the incredibly large amount of wine stored through the glass. 

The menu is pretty standard Italian. Soups, salads, pastas, pizza and the occasional steak are what you'll find here. As per my usual, I ordered the chicken parmigiana and it was outstanding. They smash it flat before they cook it, and when I say flat I mean FLAT. The chicken covered almost the whole plate. That said, it was perfectly cooked. The chicken was still tender and the sauce was super tasty. The spaghetti was pretty standard but I was so full from the chicken that I couldn't finish it anyway. One of my friends got the wild boar ragu and he was still talking about it two days later (which made me somewhat jealous that I didn't get that). Service was pretty great. Pretty attentive which meant my water glass was rarely empty, which I always use as the measuring stick for good service.

The man who greets you often upon entering is surly, sometimes rude, and sometimes audibly a dick to his staff. I presume this is Dan. A note to Dan: Most of the time I like your style and find you funny. Your bitchy signs are amusing, but rolling your eyes when customers are confused isn't cool. I've been here many times so I know the drill, but not everyone does, and don't you want them to return/say nice things about you? Even an institution like yours isn't immune to what a negative reputation can do to it in ever-changing Riverdale/Leslieville.  

The drill: Enter, order at the counter and pay up front, then go take a seat in one of the car-seat booths and wait for your order to be brought to you.

Some people find the car seats dingy, I disagree. It's some seriously cozy eating. 

The glorious diner food is the tops. If grading on food alone I'd give this joint five stars. It does what it does ruhl well. Cheese burgers piled high and greasy. Poutine on thick cut fries. Greek meat options. Perogies deep fried or poutine style. Want an egg on any of this? No. Problem.

Once in the club, we escorted to the main dance floor and comped 6 bottles of champagne, for bottle service. I guess it helps to have hot girlfriends who were partying it up Sin City style. Being comped, from what I've read, is pretty standard when you're a group of girls. But, it still felt pretty awesome to get that many bottles for free.

What happens inbetween the start of drinking and before I got separated from the group, shall remain unsaid....

After losing my friends (accidentally!!), trying to find my way out of the club became an adventure in itself. Try four inch heels, three ass pats, a couple of dances later and, eventually, making it down a whole lotta stairways to get out of the club, in one piece.

When I eventually found my way out of the club (so many stairs! WTF?), I saw half the party noshing on pizza and the other half with the bachelorette who was saying, ""Where's Rianne? Oh, my gosh! We lost Rianne! Rianne never gets lost!""

She really liked dinner here, so she wanted to try out the brunch! We came on a Saturday afternoon with reservation, and it was very busy. Our food took about 25 minutes to come out. The server gave us extra fruits because it took so long, so that was really nice. I ordered the {Lobster Croque Madame} because it sounded delicious ~ It was pretty much like an open faced sandwich/eggs Benedict. The egg was perfectly poached, and had the delicious runny egg porn going on! The house brioche was lightly toasted with the cured ham on top, the texture of the brioche with the lobster tasted absolutely amazing!!   The lobster was also perfectly cooked, still tender with a slight crunch to the bite. The sauce was not too salty and added a nice touch of creaminess to the eggs! The arugula salad was fresh, I loved the vinaigrette with it. The salad was sorta like a palate cleanser, so refreshing. Highly recommend this dish for my eggs Benedict lovers! 


{Caramelized Banana and Blueberry Pancakes with Fresh Whipped Cream and Blueberry Maple Syrup} 
Even though our bride was going to a wedding dress fitting, that didn't stop her from ordering two brunch dishes! She ordered the pancakes because she wanted to try it.  I'm glad she ordered it because it was delicious!! The pancake itself wasn't amazing (because I am biased with Mildred's Temple pancakes ), it wasn't fluffy, sorta just regular. However the flavour of the blueberries really complimented it. The blueberry maple syrup wasn't overpowering either, it only had a slight blueberry flavouring to it. The caramelized bananas was a real treat to this dish, wasn't too sweet too! So yummmms. I could only have a couple of bites because I was so full from the lobster croque madame. 


{Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon Dragonfruit Compote & Maple Gravy} 
Our friend was starving, and so she wanted a lot of food.  Of course I had to try some rightttttt The chicken was juicy inside, but I wish there was some sort of spice on the fried batter. A bit bland, but good for those who don't like spices on their fried chicken. The waffles was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside.

We had to take a friend back to the airport and thought after all we have read about them that this would be a perfect place to eat away our sadness :-)  

Jack Frost offers raised and cake donuts. We had to ask the lady at the counter to tell us what our choices were as they are not labeled.  She did an OK job but she did not really ""sell"" me on any really.  I would have thought me saying it was our first time she might have been more helpful but she wasn't. She did not even point to what was what as she rambled off their names.

In the end we purchased a mixed dozen and a half in order to sample a variety of styles and flavors.   We had some lemon, some turtle, some salted caramel, some maple bacon, some of their cream sticks and some krullers.

I am not usually a fan of a cake donut but theirs are different than most.  When I normally eat a cake donut they are very heavy and crumbly but these had a bit moister consistency to them. I tried the Salted Caramel and it was not super sweet - just enough icing to give it a little flavor. I would have like it to taste like caramel but it really did not.  It did have a bit of salt flavor though.

The Maple Bacon was delicious!  The icing is really delicious and the bacon had a great flavor and not just like bacon bits being used.  It was the one donut out of all of these I think I would want again.

My husband and my sister each had a lemon and they said they were good but nothing as special as we had hoped. 

I was most disappointed  in the cream sticks and Neapolitan we got. The fillings used are very grainy and not flavorful in my opinion. The worst one being the peanut butter.  It was overly grainy and way too sweet.

We also tried their turtle cake donuts and they were not too bad but the chocolate creme on one of them was lackluster. It was a great idea but there was not much chocolate flavor to it so it fell short of its intended goal. The one without actually tasted better because of this. 

I really wanted to like this place I had heard so much hype about it, but all in all it was very average. I might try it again just to see if it was an off day...but only if I am on that side of town for something else.",2017-07-19 21:00:01

Don't get me wrong, the food was v.good. Summer rolls fresh, pad see ew flavorful and not soggy and overcooked like some Thai places I've been to around CLT. 

The manager on duty was always buzzing around...but seemed super down-to-business, and not all that warm. I think I'd be more willing to pay their slightly elevated prices (I say 30% compared to Thai Taste and Dee Jai) if the service was better and the environment more inviting. 

Don't forget, noodle dishes originated as street food, costing 75 cents of a dollar. To adapt them into an upscale restaurant, you gotta make it pop to be worth the $!",2011-08-02 15:05:45

I also like that they have had the same menu since forever, so you always know what to expect, and then of course, you just can't beat bottomless steak fries! My hubby always orders a basket of fries right when we are seated and then he just keeps them coming! This always keeps the kids busy and happy and it beats having to order an appetizer! I will say, I do miss the old baskets and the way they would wrap the burgers, not so much down with the new motif of everything now, but the food is still the same so I can let it slide. 
Another bonus is having the Rewards card because you get a point every time you order a meal, and at 10 points you get a free meal. That adds up really quickly. Plus you get a free meal on your birthday and you can register the kids for free birthday meals too, and that's not to mention all the bonus coupons and freebies they email you!

I also love the small little touches like diffusers in the yoga rooms or color changing lights for cycle.

All of the staff is super friendly and helpful. They explain how to check in, download the app and brief overviews of the classes if asked. They also will help you get back into your locker if you accidentally shut it without setting the code. (oops!)

I love everything about it so far and am looking forward to trying some new classes that are not so much in my comfort zone. If you're looking to try something new, give them a shot!

They are known for their deerioca (handcrafted flavoured tapioca), it's only available on Fridays and Saturdays after 8! 
They're while quanitites last, however.
Expect them to be SOLD OUT usually by 10:30.
I've tried - twice. :(

Their drinks are different - it's something to appreciate, when bubble tea is it's own food group to you, but you're sick of the same milk teas.
 
The Royal No.9 is a fan favorite, and I can see why. It's a mix of comforting familiarity, and surprising sweet notes of blueberry. 
It's nice that the flavors are infused in the tea leaves, rather than an additive from syrups and powders.  

Notable mentions:
Guave Lime Juice - with real lime zest
Kiwi Slush - made with real kiwi!

A tad overhyped, but the Alley is worth checking out!

It even has a similar style of ordering food and they call out your number when it is ready. You can choose to sit in or take out. There is a lot of space to sit inside. We grabbed our food to go. 

We ordered one of the chicken breast dinner and the veggie kabab dinner. They both came with A LOT of rice, salad, naan, as well as a creamy fill sauce and hot sauce. The chicken was in a sauce that was absolutely delicious. It reminded me a bit of piri piri sauce. Very flavourful. The rice is very similar to bamiyan as well. Brown long grain basmati. The salad was a nice way to balance all the carbs and protein. I used the creamy doll sauce on both the salad as a dressing and on the food. It was DELICIOUS. I would go there just for the sauce. The hot sauce was also really tasty. It had so much flavour and it was actually spicy, unlike Bamiyan's hot sauce (which is not even what I would consider mild anymore). I was impressed. The naan was also good but nothing special. 

The veggie kabab was nice. It held together very well. It reminded me of a veggie patty. There were quite a few spices in it and it is a great option for any vegetarians out there. I personally wouldn't order it again, but only because there is one spice in there that I cannot stand, but it is present in quite a few Indian dishes as well. I forget the name. 

Overall the portions were massive for the price and quality of the food was very good. I couldn't even finish it all the 2nd day. I did feel like they give too much rice. It was a little disproportionate. We did wait quite a while for the food, but I didn't mind, as long as the food was being prepared fresh. I would definitely go back, maybe order one dinner with rice and the other without and just split the amount between two people. I highly recommend the chicken breast dinner for those who enjoy a lot of flavour.",2016-12-20 01:18:27

From the street, Nota Bene looks like a super impressive space. But once inside, I was surprised how....boring the decor was. Beige walls and wood. I wanted it to be more modern. But that's me just being a tad picky.

Service was really great and attentive, my water glass was never empty, there seemed to be a waiter around at all times, but not in an annoying way.

Ordered the mediterranean sea bass as a main. It came perfectly cooked, drizzled in high quality olive oil with over a warm salad of cherry tomatoes, slivered fennel, super ripe cubed avocado, and my favourite: panko crusted, deep fried zucchini blossoms. the avocado added a much needed layer of creaminess, the tomatoes a bunch of acid and the zucchini flowers the perfect amount of crispiness and fat. loved everything about this dish.

Sprung for dessert, had the sticky toffee pudding with pecan prailine & spotted dick ice cream. again, perfectly executed. the pudding/cake layer was light a fluffy (not dense like most sticky toffee puddings), the toffee sauce was sweet with a bit of salty and the ice cream was....simply amazing.

The plaques outside of each of the exhibits are also very informative. But if you're not one for reading, it's enough to just look at the animals. 

There's a lot of playgrounds and petting areas for small children. I know that if I had a small child, I'd definitely be tempted to head over to those areas. For another time in my life I guess.

After reading all the reviews, I have to say, the hype is true.  Once I read about the frozen popcorn, I IMMEDIATELY got in my car to visit Popped.  I had to see what it's all about.  

The place is so cute, and the people who work there are very accommodating.  I asked for several samples and there wasn't a thing I didn't like.  The flavors are really saturated and strong, but not in a sickening way that makes you hate them after a while.  I couldn't believe it - the dill pickle flavor tastes like a legit pickle!  We had trouble picking flavors because they were all so good, but eventually we decided to take home a big bag of the 505 (white chocolate and chiles... sounds weird, but it's so good that it's almost WRONG... and fair warning - it's HOTHOTHOT!), a small bag of the Chicago flavor (a sweet one), and then get a small frozen cup of the dill pickle to eat right away.

I was so amused by the smoke pouring out of my mouth that I took lots of pictures with my phone and sent them out to all my friends.  It's sad when you geek out so much about food, but I just couldn't help myself!  Even my fiancé liked the flavor of the frozen dill pickle popcorn, and he doesn't like pickles.  Or popcorn, for that matter.

I order an open box TV on Best Buy's website yesterday and get an email today saying it's ready to be picked up.  The TV I ordered was an open box in certified excellent condition, meaning it has all accessories and the box.

I drive to the Best Buy (which happens to be 20 minutes farther than the one closer to me, but that one didn't have the TV in stock) and I walk up to the online order counter, give the employee my credit card and driver's license, and am told another employee will be bringing it out.  So far, so good.

Then the employee says, ""by the way, the TV has no accessories, no box; it's just the screen and the power cord.""  So I say, ""oh, I thought it was supposed to be in excellent condition?""  She replies with a shrug.  OK.... So then I ask, ""well, as long as it has the feet for the TV so I can put it on a TV stand, that's ok.""  She says, ""no, it literally has nothing except the TV itself and the power cord.""  At that point, another employee comes with the TV on a dolly.  Literally the TV with no protection, just on a dolly.  

So at that point, I ask if I can get a refund.  The first employee says I can do it from the Best Buy app.  I pull up the app and say that it doesn't look like I can.  She takes the phone from me and can't find a way to do it either and grumbles about seeing if she can do it from her computer.  She comes back after a minute and says it's done.  When I ask for a receipt, she says she can't give me one because it was an online order.

Well, I guess I should write again anyway since my review of them has changed. 

For those that lived in California, the name ""Boiling Crab"" goes hand in hand with being known as the best place in the west to get Louisiana style crawfish. I also visited their southern California restaurant when ever I visited that area.

When Boiling Crab opened their first restaurant in Las Vegas, I was one of the first to try. Their seasoning is the same as any other Boiling Crab places, but the similarity stopped here.

A few months after their grand opening, I visited their places a few more times and got disappointed more and more. Unlike their CA restaurants, the quality of their seafood at their LV restaurant was not fresh. There were several times where I bit into the shrimp that was either rotten or spoiled.  

I do realize not many people were aware of their restaurant yet and it will take time to reach the capacity that they have in CA. That doesn't mean that they should keep and served rotten shrimp. Doing this will mean losing customers, not gaining.

I, for one, will go back to Hot N Juicy when I'm in LV, but will definitely go to their Boiling Crab restaurant when I visited Santa Ana.",2012-03-01 22:40:49

In terms of sushi, this is pretty decent.  I'm sure many sushi purists who find themselves living in Las Vegas would agree that this place is probably as good as it gets over there.

The regular omakase was good but not nearly enough to fill us up.  Hubby reserved his belly for more low-budget snacks later on but I went on to order a few more a la carte pieces of fish.  (That's when we found out the prices listed on the little sheet of paper they give you only includes 1 piece - not surprising but somewhat of a turnoff.)

Like many other high end sushi places, they control the flavor by brushing on some soy sauce instead of giving you a soy sauce bottle.  On some of the pieces of fish, I kind of wished for salt and yuzu/lemon to kick up the flavor of the fish.

Nice place but I'll reserve my sushi eating when I'm home in SoCal.  It seems somewhat cheaper for the same caliber.",2012-12-05 21:47:35

Spicy salmon roll: this was delicious! It's usually hard to hate spicy salmon rolls, but this one was definitely better than the average. The salmon was fresh and sweet, and the rice-to-filling ratio was good, not too much rice. 

Spider roll: there was a little too much rice for my liking, but other than that, it was tasty. Despite all that filling, the roll was still well-composed and didn't fall apart easily. 

Dragon roll topped with salmon (we picked from salmon, tuna, and avocado). The presentation was gorgeous! Again, the roll was very well-composed, and everything was fresh and tasty. This was probably my favourite of the three rolls (bonus points for the presentation) and I would definitely order this again. 

Tofu cheesecake: it wasn't one of those super cheesy ones that I adore, but it was definitely unique in a good way. Flavour-wise, it tasted like sweetened soy milk.

I came here recently for dinner with a friend on a weeknight. The restaurant was fairly quiet. VIP is located in the First Markham Place plaza among the stiff competition of many other Asian restaurants. I ordered a large rare beef and tripe pho; my friend and I also decided to share an order of Vietnamese spring rolls. The spring rolls were not great, the filling was barely identifiable and lacked any flavour; their only redeeming quality was that they were crispy and not oily. My large pho was modest in size; this soup would be a medium in most other places. My soup was seriously lacking meat and consisted mostly of tripe and lots of noodles. The beef was not rare enough and was mostly cooked through by the time it reached my table. The flavour of the soup wasn't spectacular, far from the best pho I have had. I also managed to snag one of my friends fried shrimp on sugar cane, the breading on the shrimp was not crispy at all, overall just meh. 

The restaurant itself is pretty run down, and cleanliness does not seem to be a top priority. I usually don't mind a run down place as long as the food is good; however that is not the case with this establishment. The service was non-existent, our order was taken and food was brought to us in a timely manner; nothing more and nothing less. Overall I do not think I will return to VIP any time soon.

For my first visit here, I ordered the two egg breakfast with the Portuguese sausage. The sausage is pretty freaking good. The eggs and hash browns were the perfect food after a long night of drinking. You get your protein from the eggs, grease from the sausage, and hash browns to fill your stomach to settle it. Great breakfast here.

They bagel was fresh, but not the hot you might find at your local bagel shop.

Let me count the ways - You made my dining experience amazing and then some.  I had made reservations for five people to celebrate a birthday.  Parking was valet so make sure you bring cash to tip. When I got there, my party was already seated and once you get into the gates of the Royal Palms, you almost feel like you are no where near Phoenix.  It is such a beautiful resort.  The ambiance is beautiful with traditional contemporary décor. Of course we took advantage of restaurant week specials and we all got to pick a three course dinner.  

First course - venison tartare with sea salt crackers.  I've never had tartare before so I decided to try it.  It had a real unique taste to it.  The texture was wet and sticky and I was only able to eat a few bites.  After that, it left this weird taste in my mouth so lucky for me, on to the second course.

Second course - beef tenderloin cooked medium well.  The beef was flavorful, tender, and fantastic. I've never realized how much I loved beef until that moment when I sunk my teeth into the first slice. I ate every single slice, crumb, and juice that was on that plate. I was full, but not full to not eat my third course - the dessert.

Third course - chocolate peanut butter bar.  It was amazing!  The crunch, the chocolate, the peanut butter, the vanilla ice cream....wow.  I wanted more!  I really did and I realized I had to compose myself.

We came in a group of 7 on a Wednesday night. I ordered the pork ramen. Soup base was flavourful and noodle was has the perfect slightly chewy texture. The pork however was a bit too soft and thin that taste like the over marinated it. The drink I ordered was a iced rose calpis (Japanese yogurt drink with rose petals and syrup). Was a little disappointed when they said they. No longer serve taro soft serve. I heard a lot of compliment online about their soft serve ice cream and the flavour they currently carry are matcha and black milk tea. The server said they changes the flavours every few months. The takoyaki (not in picture) was okay but it's fried instead of grilled which is not the authentic and tastier was to prepare it. This restaurant closes at 9 on weekdays and last call was 8:20 so it might not be a good choice for after dinner dessert with friends. 

Overall it's a restaurant's that worth to visit if you like Japanese cafe style food. I will come back and hopefully they will have some great ice cream flavours!",2017-03-27 23:26:42

Dear Mr. Shields,

I am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your dinner here at our restaurant.  I wish you would have shared your concerns with us while you were here as it is of utmost importance to us that all of our guests have a wonderful experience.  We recieve many compliments on our veal dishes and especially on the lasagna.  In fact, the lasagna is one of our best sellers.  Obviously, people have different tastes and perhaps the items you chose are not made in the fashion to which you are accustomed.  We would love you to give us another chance as I think your experience would be much different.  If you are willing to do so, please introduce yourself to either me (Kerry) or my wife (Zalena). We have many regulars who come several times a week and we hope that you and your wife might become one of those.  If not, thank you for your past patronage.  

Sincerely,

I have celiacs and needed gluten free foods. I ordered gf ribs and a salad with grilled shrimp. All gluten free. But I felt very much like the server didn't care or have much knowledge about gf items. Which is a major turn off. She was very friendly, but when the staff doesn't have a knowledge of gluten, it makes me cautious. 
And I've also been very sick, this next day after eating there, and am feeling like I got ""glutened."" So that is pretty upsetting for me. While their food was wonderful, I didn't feel like my dietary needs were cared for.

Eh, it's good, but nothing spectacular? For a place that claims to be a Korean/Japanese restaurant, I sure didn't see much Korean on their menu. It actually reminded me a lot of restaurant that I used to go to a lot in Ann Arbor (Sadako...but not as good as Sadako).

We stopped in here before our show at Playhouse Square. Service was good and attentive. We ordered a roll (it was okay, Ginko is better), he got the bebimbop (it's more like the dolsot bebimbop), and I got the chicken katsu.

The dishes came with what you would find normally in a Japanese restaurant- a salad and miso soup. It was alright. My chicken katsu..was plentiful, but I was hoping there was something with it...besides just chicken katsu and rice. :P

My boyfriend's bebimpbop...well, bebimbop, is just what it is- it's hard to mess that up! It was okay though.. it is what it is.

Would I go back? Yeah, I probably would. Would I have a craving for it.? Eh. Maybe if they added more Korean food items on their menu.

The ambience and decor is chic, modern, and beautiful. Very detailed design from the ceiling to the tiles on the bathroom. Kind of remained me of Colette cafe, but in pink.

The chairs on the high top tables were very modern and most importantly, comfy to sit on. 

I called to make a reservation because they didn't have anything available online. I left a message and they returned my call on the same day. Points for that! They only had a high top seat for 3, but it was ok. There's a lot of low two seaters, perfect for a date.

The verdict on food:

Punch Americans: sweet and strong. Nothing too special. $15 (B)

Beet salad: very good. A lot of ingredients including pine nuts, hummus, different types of beets, and Persimmon. The persimmon added a very sweet flavour. $15 (A+)

Zucchini fries: very unique. I liked the lemon, sweet crema, but the fries itself was very oily. $11 (B+)

Wild boar ragu: it was essentially ground pork with pasta. Too much meat and not enough pasta. Good amount of taste. It was ok, but nothing special and it certainty wasn't work $21 (B)

Duck confit pasta: I tried this and it was pretty good. Very unique taste and flavourful. I liked this dish more than my main. $27. (A)

Chocolate cake with vanilla gelato: warmed chocolate cake. I liked it. (A)

Sherry is passionate about yoga and upon meeting her, you can easily see why she has mostly wonderful instructors at her studio.

The inside of Zinburger is modern and clean lined. You can feel that they care about beef. I mean they have huge cows on the wall, they must care about it! The only thing that was missing in that picture was a couple of UFOs. 

They had a hamburger on the menu called the Zinburger. I had to try it since the name of the place was Zinburger, so it must be their signature hamburger. It was 1/2 pound of hamburger with grilled onions on top. I was kind of skeptical of the grilled onion combination because I've grown up with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard hamburgers. I rarely eat hamburgers anymore because let's be honest, there is a lot of shitty burgers out there and it is hard to find a good one. There really is a science to cooking the meat right and I think a lot of grillmasters foul it up. The burger I got was cooked perfectly and I was also pleased with the bun they used on the burger. This wasn't just some soggy bun you'd buy off the grocery store shelf. It was so much better than that! It was hands down the best hamburger bun I've ever tasted. I bet they make the bread in house which just shows the extent they go to make a quality burger. 

We also had the sweet potato fries. This is the third place I've been to in Phoenix that has had em. The dip that the sweet potato fries come with really make them taste good.

For starters their rates are much better then APS from what I have seen.  They have a variety of pricing options and plans for everyone no matter what your circumstance.

I personally have M Power and wish this feature was in Michigan where I moved from back in 2005.  Why?  because I can monitor my electric usage, and it saves me tons of money.  Did you know that people who use M Power use 20% less electricity then those that recieve a bill?  Why? Because you can monitor it all the time!  Plus, there's no bill!  I keep quite a high balance on my M power machine since electricity during the summer is much more expensive, and the winter months are cheaper on the electric bills and pocket book.

During the summer of 2010 (June through August), I found myself unemployed after getting downsized at my job of 5 years.   I was lost, and worried about finding new employment, and while I waited it out in the summer heat, I called SRP to see if there was anything I could do to save money on my electric bill while I found a new job and received unemployment.  They told me about a plan for people in my situation that allows people in my circumstance to receive a $17 monthly bill credit for up to 12 months while I find a new job.  You don't have to pay the $17 back, and when you go to the SRP machines to put money on, you receive the credit at the beginning of every month.  I did that for 3 months, and even though I keep a high balance it was the peace of mind knowing that they had my back.  (that was a total of $51 over the course of 3 months in electricity credits!  especially in July, thats like 2 free weeks of electric!)

I also had an outage in September of 2010 due to a meter problem.  I had a new M power box at my door within the hour, and a service man was at my door within 2 hours of that!  SRP completely handled the situation, and got me back up and running between the time I got home from work and the time I went to bed. Plus, their customer service people are always so nice and friendly.
.
I wish other states and electric companies would model themselves after SRP and how they run their electricity business.  So many options with pricing! I also LOVE M POWER. If other states would even pick up something like M Power, we could save so much energy!

Keep up the good work SRP, and you always make me happy!",2012-05-01 22:04:38

I'm certainly glad I called ahead because the place was jam-packed when we got there.  We were given the options of being seated inside now, or outside shortly.  We opted for the latter to enjoy the beautiful night air.  The restaurant bar that we waited at was surprisingly crowded too.  I don't know if they were short-staffed that night, but, the fact that it took almost ten minutes to get the bartenders attention was just and indication of the way the night was going to go.  While the drinks (my manhattan and her mojito) were quite good, they were also quite pricey.  Far more than I thought they were worth.  Whatever, right?  It's for Valentines Day.

Well, that just kind of kept going.  My ribeye was.....fine.  Pretty tasty but....well, maybe I'm just not a fan of ribeye.  The soup, a cauliflower-chorizo blend, was good.  Again, just not worth what we ended up paying for it.  Happily, my girlfriend really enjoyed her foie gras stuffed chicken, at least.

All in all, good, but as a dining event, not worth the $100-ish dollars.  The service is pretty good and the location and ambiance can't be beat.  I'll give it another try, but there is quite a queue of places for me to check first before I rush back.",2009-03-02 21:43:05

They are a bit thicker and taste like they have been cooked a little longer than typical crêpes, but they're still pretty decent and you get a good portion.

They serve both sweet and savoury Hungarian crêpes (palacsinta) here. They are pretty specifically priced at $7.97, and they have a combo deal where you can get soup and crêpe or coffee and crêpe for ten bones. Not too shabby.

They serve espresso here also (49th Parallel) and have free Wi-Fi. Given that ALL the furniture is patio furniture, I'm not likely to spend too much time here to work, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm feeling in a crêpe-y mood.

The first had a smoked duck egg, greens and strawberries.  I am continuously looking for new and innovative dishes, this was one.  The smoke on the egg wasn't overpowering and went so well with the sweetness provided by the strawberries.  As if the next salad could top the first, it did.  It was just greens with crispy pig ears.  The variety of greens provided many different notes, and the crispy ears gave so much texture and saltiness.

After reading the rave reviews and seeing the most amazing spread of appetizers and entrees on the dinner menu, I gathered a couple of my colleagues and went down the street.  I would make a reservation, as this place can get packed even on the weekdays.  If there is a wait, you can wait by the bar that has ample space.

This is a nice place to take a date, but is well-suited for group dinners as well.  The atmosphere is comfortable and kind of has a woodsy feeling.  The lighting is perfect - not too bright and not too dim.

Note that their online menu may not reflect the menu they have for the week, which changes.  Also, they may run out of dishes as the night goes on, i.e, shrimp and octopus.

To start, we got the ceviche, which was perfectly marinated in a tangy lime sauce.  The scallops and yellowtail they used was fresh.  I don't recall seeing any shrimp in it, though.  Comes with a delicate shallot cracker.

For my entree, I ordered the rabbit.  The rabbit was some of the best I've had.  Tasted like it was slightly smoked.  It was well seasoned and soft and cooked to the right temperature.  I've never had rabbit so substantial before - it was so much meat!

Dessert was a highlight.  They were out of the pecan pie and the caramel tart, but to our surprise, their other desserts were just as amazing.  The homemade cinnamon honey ice cream was absolutely delicious.  It wasn't too much cinnamon and tasted a bit like horchata - SO GOOD.  The panna cotta was some of the best I've ever had - not too heavy at all and melts in your mouth. Since they ran out of so many things, they doubled up the chocolate duo dessert for us.  The multi-layered espresso cake reminded me a bit of tiramisu and had a wonderful chocolate ganache on top.  The chocolate semifreddo had a delicious crust and the semifreddo itself melted in your mouth.

Their bakery offers up some very good sweets, including their sea salt chocolate chip cookie. My girlfriend threatens violence upon me if we don't order it during our dinner visits. Their gelato, which is technically a separate company-owned brand (with their own separate Yelp account), is also pretty decent from the few times I've sampled it.

For some reason, the atmosphere was a little awkward and the service was fairly slow, though we got seated really quickly. We spent a lot of time waiting on water refills, which was frustrating because we're in the land of hangovers and I had a spicy dish.

There were no complaints around the table and with good reason! My huevos rancheros was fantastic! It was a combo of rancheros and verdes, which was a pleasant surprise by far. The sauces were great and the tortilla was a perfect combo between crunchy and soaked in deliciousness. The only thing I could have done without was the chorizo. With everything else going on, it wasn't very spicy and didn't really add much to the dish. Some sausage or bacon on the side would have been fine. My mouth is watering just thinking of this again.

Hubby and I were able to walk I on a Friday night and were seated right away. We ordered a miso black cod and grilled sirloin steak bento box and a sashimi set course. Salad and miso soup were brought out promptly. I appreciated that the miso soup was not overly salty. 

Our meals were served shortly thereafter. My bento box was quite filling, and I'm pretty sure hubby and I would have sufficed with splitting a bento box and perhaps some a la carte sushi or sashimi. The sashimi, especially the scallops, salmon, and tuna, were thickly cut and fresh tasting. The miso cod was delicious although I felt as though greater care should have been taken in removing visible fish bones before serving. The beef was tender and flavourful. The tempura was lightly battered and not overly greasy. My only feedback about the tempura was that I prefer a slightly sweeter tempura dipping sauce, but that's just my taste. 

Upon completion of our meals we were served coffee pudding for dessert, which I quite enjoyed. Overall our meals came to $75 including tax and tip.   Inatei is a little pricier than your run of the mill Japanese restaurant in York region, but you get what you pay for.",2016-10-01 03:19:05

Anyways I found the car I liked and asked if they could price match. He said no because they don't do price matches. That's interesting being that I had a car price matched down to the penny last year. Hmmm either way it's fine however he didn't offer to see what he could do or anything like that just a flat ""no, we can't."" My mom insisted he ask his manager so he did. We went inside and waited and he came back and said there's nothing they could do to lower the price of the car. That's where I had the big problem. 1. Why didn't the manager come speak with us 2. They didn't offer any sort of negotiation AT ALL 3. He gave me the paper back and just said ""sorry"" in other words you can go now.

I love that the admission is free, so everyone can see the airplanes and the show.  We did arrive early so we didn't have any issues with traffic or parking.  Everything was very organized.  The show was awesome and the kids loved it!  We will definately be going again next year.

However, there is room for improvement.  The food was good but VERY pricey.  The kid zone was also very pricey and the lines for the bounce houses were awful.  We waited 30-40 minutes for the kids to go on the rocket ship bounce house and they all agreed that it was NOT worth it.  The rides the older kids wanted to go on, were too much money.  I understand they have to make up for the free admission for $10 per kid to go inside of plastic ball or jump on a trampoline, or $4 for a small fry, or $5 for a lemonade - even Disneyland is cheaper.  

Suggestions for visitors next year:  bring your own chair (rentals are $5 a chair and the ground is uncomfortable), bring your own water but don't open until you're inside, bring plenty of snacks, and don't show your kids the kid zone unless you prepared to spend a lot of money.",2011-03-22 22:33:44

Service was polite, food was made to order and packed up for takeout, price ($12) was reasonable for the portion size. I asked for a 6 on their spice scale (1-10) and found it quite mild, but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb.

The interior is very cool. The bar separates the inside & outside and you can see into the kitchen through the glass. One thing I have to warn you about is that it gets extremely loud inside the restaurant. Like, by far the loudest restaurant I've ever been in. If you take someone here on a date, you might take this into consideration beforehand.

We started our meal with the prosciutto bruschetta and it was phenomenal. The grilled asparagus they put on it makes for something different but very good. For the main, I went with old dependable. The chicken parmesan. And boy, it's a lot of food. You get two good size cutlets and a side of parmesan rigatoni. Everything was perfectly cooked and the combination of the intense flavor of the chicken with the more easy going rigatoni was just right. Like fire and ice. 

Service was very good. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about both the menu and the drink menu as my friend put her through the paces regarding their wines. Beer selection is also great. Lots of local and non-local craft goodies for your palate. Also, be aware there will be a wait on peak days. I went on a Thursday evening and there was a line outside the door.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed the garlic-butter-sheened puff pastry as much as the snails, which were light rather than swimming in greasy garlic butter in shallow indentations on a platter as in most presentations of this dish.  I split the 10 snails with a dining companion.  Next time I won't!

Next was savory Onion Soup Gratinee made with delicious Gruyere cheese.  The glompy strands of cheese resonated along with a sweet wine taste in the broth.  This rich and tasty soup was served in a white, lion-headed crock.  

This dish and the country salad following it were enhanced by small pointy baguettes of French bread smeared with butter.  The butter was served in very small dishes, but we ultimately received four of them without any resistance from assistant servers.  The country salad was marked by crunchy half-disks of hearts of palm.  

My entree that I eagerly awaited was Beef Stroganoff, which is not that easy to find at restaurants.  My only disappointment when the entree arrived was its portion size.  It was about half of what I desired.  But the light brown sauce, tender cooked cuts of beef, and egg noodles were all I hoped for.  My wife ordered poached lobster and light french fries that came with lobster sauce.  Her added request for Beurre Blanc was accommodated by our server without any problem, and at no additional cost.  I sampled the lobster, and it was equally delicious dipped in either sauce.  She was satisfied with the size of her portion, but a hungry male diner might have disagreed.  The only sour note for this dish was a Market Price of $72.00 on this evening.

We finished our repast with Pot de Creme, rich gooey chocolate topped with Chantilly Cream.  It was delicious.  Our dining companions' Creme Brulee looked promising as well, and was of the larger variety.

Ambience was modern and somewhat antiseptic.  Our foursome was seated at a half-booth with two chairs in front.  Yet had we wished to brave the heat, we could have been seated just outside with a direct open view of the Eiffel Tower of Paris Las Vegas.  And, just arriving at the third floor of the gorgeous Cosmopolitan Hotel was an enjoyable experience.

Otherwise, I have no complaints, and the meal was worth the $177 tab for two without wine, including tax and tip.

The egg was nicely done but reaaaallly really salty. The portions were okay, but I felt like the soup was better than Menyatai's. Overall, I had a pretty good experience here!

The toast was toasty and crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. It really dissolved in your mouth. Both times that I visited, I ordered hot pot dishes.

Walked in, two girls working. Short hair on one, long hair on the other. Long hair girl only seems to know how to make food, not smoothies or work the register. The short hair girl appears to run the register, make the smoothies and walk them out to people. 

When I walked in there was a woman standing at the counter - I do not know the whole story but it seemed awhile had passed before they starting helping her. The short haired girl took her order and she sat down. Then when I walked up she said it would be a minute. NOT OK. Especially since there were two more women behind me, and another family walking in. So, the short hair girl made the smoothies, walked them out to her. The other girl made her food. 

Then the short hair girl took my order. Then I went to the bathroom but I heard her tell the two women behind me it would be a minute. I came out from the restroom and the two women asked if the girl with long hair could at least take their order because they were in a hurry, she said I shyness I could but wrote it down, didn't use the systems. The short hair girl came and walked my drink out - now back track to when I put my order in, she asked for my name, why she didn't use it is beyond me, it would of saved her some time. 

Needless to say, the customer service was crap. Operations are crap. Both of these ladies need to be trained on everything and quick. No name tags were worn. The girl with the long hair looked so disheveled and her hair was a mess. The girl with the short hair seemed a little annoyed or just having a lousy afternoon. 

I just want the owners/management/whoever is in charge - that my experience was worth the time writing this as I enjoy Tropical Smoothie very much more then Jamba Juice and I'd like to see you stay in business near my home. However it's going to take more then tasty smoothies to keep clientele!!

I am not a fan to go anywhere on a holiday but...it was mothers day.

We sat at the bar, She had her Box and me a Burger recommended by the waiter, food was delicious, took the wife nearly 15 mins to get her wine after the waiter took the order and after eating 20+mins no waiter, no check and no reorder on the wife's wine. 

We did stop a waitress to advise, few mins passed still no one. 

I finally reached out to a manager walking by and he advises he went on break, someone should have informed you, (You think? was my first thought)

Then he did reword it correctly by someone should have picked up the slack and we dropped the ball. 

This mangers name ""CHRIS"", He was a super hero flying in to fix an issue that should never have happened, seamless is the word that comes to mind.

He took our check and charged us and as the Chris is standing there he says ""wait let me take care of that.""

The wife was extremely upset and man I have never had such bad luck with service as we have had since moving to Charlotte and it is always with the wife's food or special occasions.

Yes, it's Americanized and you have to ask for chopsticks. You're in Scottsdale. Consider who lives around here. They're cooking for the neighborhood. Jade Palace is comfort food. You're not going to reach culinary heights, but you'll get dishes you know and love.

The reason I agreed to stay downtown this time was because that this is one of the newly renovated hotels-it used to be Fitzgerald's.  

CHECK-IN
The check in process was seamless.  It was such a quick and easy process compared to the larger hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.  The employee who checked us in wasn't too friendly and she didn't go over anything extra-explanation of Wi-Fi, checkout process, etc but she was efficient enough.  

VALET
The valet service here was good, but not outstanding.  Only about 50% of the time, they opened my door for me.  Most of them just headed straight for my boyfriend's side of the car as he was the driver.  Most times, it didn't take them too long to bring the car down to us and it was a really nice change from the valet at the larger hotels on the Strip.  There weren't any crazy lines or long wait times as there are much more rooms and guests at those hotels.  

ROOM
The room was pretty nice, I like the red color theme they have going on and there were a lot of red accents in the room.  The windows are tinted and it's not plain tint.  The tint has tiny circles in them so it was hard to take a nice picture of the view from the room.  I liked the size of the restroom restroom, it was pretty large but I had some major issues with the shower.  The first night, I couldn't get any warm or hot water and the faucet was leaky so we could hear it dripping at night.  

CASINO
The casino is pretty cool, they have go-go dancers for entertainment near the table games and one of the nights we were there, someone was at the main entrance on the casino floor with a big wheel encouraging everyone to play.  They have a nice long bar in the casino called ""Long Bar"" and everything gets pretty lively on weekend nights.  

AMENITIES
The D has a small pool up front, nothing too fancy.  I didn't take advantage of the pool during my stay because it was 50 degrees outside.  They have an Enterprise Rent-A-Car on site, their desk is next to the Valet.  They have the D Grill (see my separate review), Andiamo Steakhouse, McDonald's and American Coney Island.  On the outside of the hotel, they have D Bar, which is an outdoor version of Long Bar and it's on Fremont Street.  D bar offers the large drinks (large footballs and tall drinks by the yard) by bartenders who do tricks.  They also have go-go dancers dressed in red and black that get up and dance on the bar.  

I would probably stay at The D again if I chose to stay downtown.  The customer service wasn't bad and they've done a nice job with the renovation.  It also helps that when you walk out of the hotel, you can enjoy the Fremont Street Experience with all of the street vendors, live entertainment, other hotels in walking distance and all that good stuff!",2014-02-24 19:07:30

On a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was packed but we got seated immediately.  Our server, John, was nice, but that's about it.  We ordered the BBQ chicken platter and ribs combo and a BBQ salad.  I was actually craving for fried chicken and John was sweet enough to get permission from the kitchen to substitute the BBQ chicken with fried chicken with no extra charge.  I was really (and I mean REALLY) excited to enjoy our meal BUT was utterly disappointed when I took a bite of the salty (YUCK!) chicken.  John came back to check on us and I informed him that the chicken was REALLY salty to the point that I drank a whole glass of my water and asked for a refill.  John's response was, ""I'll let the kitchen know but we brine our chicken overnight -- so it is what it is.""   Ummm... I've had a lot of fried chicken that's brine but hellooo.... I still would like to taste the chicken and not eat salt for lunch. (Note:  the size of the chicken is tiny... so maybe they need to take that into consideration when they brine the chicken overnight.  Just saying....)  :-(    

The ribs were on the salty side too -- and nothing to rave about.  Thank goodness, they didn't add salt to our salad.  Sadly -- I'm still drinking water to quench my thirst as I type this review.

I ordered the two meat combo. It is your choice of two meats and two sides. Comes with Texas toast. I chose pulled pork and ribs for the meat. Cincinnati Fries and Sweet Potato Casserole for the sides. 

The ribs had a dry rub on there that was decent. The pulled pork was tender but had no flavor. I poured the default barbeque sauce that was on the table. The sauce itself was a little bland but at least when you put it on the pulled pork it gave it some life.

The Cincinnati Fries were basically Chili Cheese Fries. The Chili itself is not what im used to. It was a bit runny and not spicy at all. The Sweet Potato Casserole was decent. It was pretty sweet and was topped with pecans.

The total I paid was 24.17 and that's with tax and 20 percent tip. Now as you can see that is bit pricey for the meal I had. Imagine if I got a fountain drink. That would have bumped it to 27 bucks. Their menu is the same no matter lunch or dinner. It would be awesome if they had lunch specials. 

Their location is a bit of find because they share the same building as Doc Holidays. I gotta admit, it is pretty spacious and clean. The service was decent.

Some random info: They play Blues music here. Nothing against it but the whole time I was there, the 6 or 7 songs I heard were all about growing up in the South and people finding the love of their life then breaking up which inspired the song they are singing. The songs I heard were different variations of the same thing. On February 2 they are gonna start a Karaoke thing. I guess that would be better than listening to depressing songs about your spouse and your dog running away. I guess people singing out of tune is more entertaining.

So overall, I wasnt too impressed. I don't usually wanna spend 20 plus dollars for lunch. I hate to say it but having eaten here is definitely gonna make me do that Dickey's Barbeque review. I think their barbeque sauce is what makes their beef brisket and pulled pork even better. AND you dont spend more than 20 bucks for one person.",2013-01-31 03:32:10

Tonight we came in and experienced some of the worst host service from the moment we walked in. A new person was in the front- when we approached him he looked stunned that we were asking for a table for 2 on a Friday night and proceeded to recommend that we find seating in the bar area because it would be a 'long wait' for the dining area. We chose to put in our name and take our chances.  In the next 20 min we sat and watched him proceed to dissuade people from staying at the restaurant and had 17 people walk back out when he went from a 10 min wait to a 30 min wait and the last people he turned away he had told it would be an hour and 1/2 wait. Within minutes of that party walking out our table was ready and we walked into the dining area to see 9 booths open, 3 had couples in them, 1 table was dirty and there was a party of 10-12 people at the back. We proceeded to watch him continue to steer people away from the restaurant. Sad- 
We ordered their new native buffalo fries and their new jalapeño puffs- the fries were great, the jalapeño puffs were absolutely disgusting- see picture below- um cheese whiz type cheese with sliced jalapeños that they put on the nachos wrapped in an overly fried but raw pastry wrap? WTH?

It was $22 and I decided to upgrade to sweet potato fries for an extra dollar. Honestly I felt the price was quite high already considering the sandwich was kinda small. The good thing was there was a nice amount of lobster in the sandwich. I picked the cold version with mayo but next time will try the butter. Pretty tasty! The salad (very little) that came with the meal seemed as though it had been sitting in caesar dressing for a few hours so it wasn't too fresh. But I definitely liked the sweet potato fries. Wish there was more. 

Service was quick! We were in and out in 30 - 40 mins. Of course, it helped we came on a Monday weeknight around 9-ish so it was almost empty.

My top favorite is probably the frozen pizza.  I think it's either 3 or 5 cheese goodness in a box!  I recently tried a new sweet and smokey bbq sauce and bought 2 bottles on the spot.  

The produce is usually pretty fresh, and like everything else is fairly priced.  $0.19 bananas?  Yes please!  The pre made salads are great if you're short on time and need lunch in a jiff. I'm not sure what my favorite one is called but it has currants and couscous (or however you spell that?)  in it,  tastes like thanksgiving. The fat free balsamic vinaigrette dressing is lovely as well.

These tacos are the real deal (Evander) Holyfield. Gigantesco is the Spanish word for gigantic and that is just what comes to mind when describing these tacos. This is one big and beautiful taco. Her juices cascade down my mouth to my beard; she gets everywhere. All over my face and hands. Coriander is cilantro and the air is heavy with it; that heady green aroma envelops my frijoles. That means beans and beans ain't fuckin' around. The smoke and heat of sultry chipotle invites your tastebuds to stay for a while. Take a dip because the water is just fine. Tacos Tijuana promises a lot ... and it delivers. This is a very East L.A. sort of a place. They've got piñatas for sale as well as Jaritos soda.

And that's a good thing, opined the felon Martha Stewart. Two giant tacos for eight dollars and you'll eat like Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias for a week.

The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!

So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. 

We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.
We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. 
We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... 
It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.

They got rid of one of my favourite sauces (the peanut sauce, they said it had too much maple syrup/too much sugar) and replaced it with a healthier version of it (using almond butter and no sugar whatsoever!) and it actually tastes even better! Definitely recommend getting one or two appies to share. I love the tempeh sticks, one-straw sushi, yam fries and cauliflower bites. Their tzatziki is delicious and recommend you try the vegan version (made with cashew cream instead of sour cream). 

They have a very creative cocktail menu that I have yet to try as my favourite drink is their chai latte made with almond milk, it is just too warm and cozy to pass up. I just love the overall atmosphere of the place and hip, friendly staff. If you check them out on instagram you will get a sneak peak of their daily dinner feature. 

This place has expanded my meat-eating palette and urge my other meat-eating friends to also come in with an open mind, you will definitely be surprised!",2017-01-15 07:10:14

At the time that we visited the brunch menu included a deep-fried duck egg's benny with pulled pork, so of course I had that - and holy decadence, Batman. It was really good. We also ordered some house-smoked bacon, which was delightful. Since the menu always changes I can't make more specific recommendations, but I'm confident in suggesting this place to brunch-goers as I'm sure everything is still delicious. 

I could pretty much guarantee we'd be back fairly often when we're in Toronto if there weren't so many great-looking restaurants to try, and actually I'm sure we'll be back anyway. I would also love to try a Sunday Roast dinner.

I somehow stumbled upon Sweet Republic's Yelp page and was amazed at the abundance of 5 star reviews (almost every single one!)... and immediately planned to go check it out. 

My expectations were pretty high, and luckily they were met and then some. The place has this very cool indy vibe to it... the decorations are very modern and the food/ice cream is all fresh and organic; a nice change of pace for an ice cream place. The flavors were quite varied from tried and true to bold and adventurous. We tried samples of two of their more adventerous offerings... first the bacon ice cream; then the basil-lime sorbet. Both sound just a tad revolting but were oddly enjoyable. 

For our actual cups we got one double scoop of peanut butter and mint chocolate chip. Then for the second we got a mixture of desert honey and bananna berry. Each flavor was smooth and fresh... it just melted in my mouth. One thing I noticed is that it felt much lighter than your usual cup of ice cream. When I go to a place like Cold Stone Creamery I usually can only stomach a few bites of ice cream before I get 'sweetened out'. It's different here... maybe it's the fresh ingredients or something; but eating this ice cream just felt good!

Food was good. I even branched out from my normal 'Bertos ordering of the carnitas plate (""It just happens to be my favorite, and I order it ... in every dive I go to in this country""...name that actor that I'm paraphrasing).

I didn't branch out too much - went carnitas taco and 3rolled tacos with guac. Guac was good, a bit less chunky thatn I prefer, but not bad. Coulda been spiced up a bit...I suspect its more of an avocado puree than a true guac. 

Carnitas had good shells (2 soft/warm corn, like it should). Nice crust on the meat. Really seared it well. 

Can't remember what GF had...shredded beef tacos I'd bet. That's her 'Berto's go-to.

During this whole interaction with them, I couldn't help but think how a new-ish restaurant could put such rude, unprofessional staff at the front of the house. First impression FAIL.

The only decent part about this restaurant was the food. Everything else was just a huge disappointment... you are nothing without service!

Anyway, we ordered:
x Roasted Mushrooms (Cipollini Onions, Herbs) - probably my favorite of the night. 
x Spanish Octopus (Salsa Verde, Roasted Red Pepper, Preserved Lemons) - bursting with flavor and so tender. Super good with the cheesy bread, but almost better separately.
x Yellowtail (Sweet Mango, Jalapeño Salsa, Radish, Micro Greens) - BLAND. The fish was very dry.. needed some sort of citrus or liquid component.
x Lobster Tortellini (Squid Ink Pasta, Soffritto) - another bland/dry dish. I was super excited to splurge on some unneeded calories, but this failed me :( The tortellini itself felt under cooked and the sauce was lacking in flavor.

The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.

Anyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.

My problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with ""daily specials"" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.

Also, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!

I only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food. I just wish they had a better lunch time menu and that the service would pick up a bit so we don't spend so much time waiting and paying for our bills.",2012-08-15 19:09:05

we ended up getting the combo C that has 1 pound of shrimp 1 pound of clam and 1 pound of mussels. it also included a corn potato and sausage. from the blend we chose to order the good catch sauce in medium heat because it is the only lactose free option. 

the combo C was shared between 3 people and it was $43. they placed it on a platter which was cool! all the seafood taste really good and the sauce was a nice blend of savoury and spicy and a seafood taste to it. the medium heat was perfect for me but not for people who can't take spice. overall for free poepl we all ordered rice and after finishing it we weren't completely full but it was still yummy 4/5

The calamari was a very small portion so I would not recommend it for the price. it was just average but had a nice sauce that came with it 3/5 

the chicken wings were bigger than the average chicken wing and had a lot of sauce on it . the one we got was the honey garlic. it was very tender and juicy. the fries are super good and thinly cut!! would def recommend this 4/5

However, since I was in the suburbs, I never got a chance to dine here until recently.  I went here with my bf, who actually used to come here a lot when he was younger with his older cousin after a few WoW raids.  In all fairness, I was blown away.   I always had a penchant for liking breakfast foods, but Fran's outdid many of its competitors in my book (eg. Markham Station, Cora's, Sunset Grill, Eggsmart, Panagois, Golden Griddle, etc.).  It maintains a 50's diner aesthetic with regard to the furniture, uniforms, and lighting.  I personally enjoyed the aesthetic, as it was a nice break from the ""hipster"", trendy landscape found at many restaurants now.  

My bf and I ordered individual breakfast platters with all the works (eggs, toast, home fries, sausages, peameal, coffee, bacon, and pancakes).  Each platter costed about 12 dollars, which was a fair price because the portions are good enough for two with a smaller appetite or one with a large appetite (like me!).  I will not say this was the healthiest breakfast, but the sauce, oil, and carb-centric items titillated my taste buds throughout the meal.  It wasn't one of those experiences during which everything tastes exceptional at the beginning only to have grease and saltiness get to you midway. I loved the maple sausages and pancakes the most. The sausages were thicker than normal and hosted a party in your mouth with every bite.  The pancakes were actually fluffy, a quality that I don't often find at all-day breakfast joints.   This is also my bf's holy grail for breakfast foods, and I will definitely be returning!  

I completely understand the hype over Fran's and I encourage anyone who has any adoration for breakfast foods to come here!

It's a pretty good wing place, but suffers a few deficiencies.

The Good: Service is great, atmosphere is comfortable. Price is good, particularly on Tuesdays when you can get 10 wings for $7.45. Size and meatiness of wings is good.

The Bad: SUPER limited in wing choices. Basically you're asking how much heat you can get and maybe add honey or bbq sauce. No dry options, unless you get plain with sauce on the side. Also, we sampled the armageddon wings, which are supposed to be crazy spicy. They were pretty spicy, but I've accidentally made food this spicy before and been able to eat it all. I was hoping for something that would destroy me after one wing, with the strength of my will (and internal organs) being the only thing to keep me going.

So if you're looking for run of the mill wings, this is a great place to go. If you want some creativity in terms of flavour, or some face-meltingly hot wings, you may have to go somewhere else.",2013-03-20 15:09:41

I remember going on field trips as far back as third grade, when I moved to Lakewood and spending whole days there as a youth, just for fun. Friday Night Flicks was movie night held every Friday night at the stage in the front of the park. I'm not sure if they still hold it. Fourth of July fireworks show is by far the parks biggest attraction to this day. We would run around causing trouble, not too much but some. Sometimes we would sit on the hill all the way in the back and just watch ships go by and enjoy the scenery of the Great Lake Erie. They recently put a new walkway system in the back, replaced the whole thing, put nice stone in. Better than the rocky path that used to lead down there. A scope to view downtown has also been added, it's pretty cool. 

Lakewood-Foster pool has always been a place I've went to in the Summer, still do actually. I like to catch some rays and jump off the diving board every now and again. Back in the day, the Summer following 7th grade I worked as a swim instructor there. Teaching little kids to swim can be a rewarding experience and I'm glad I got to do it, even though at the time I didn't want to I was forced to. 

The Park/Playground has been redone about 5 years ago now, maybe even more. Time flies. It's a fun place and peaceful. There's a war memorial, wielding a huge cannon. It has tennis courts, a skate park, two baseball fields, stage for movies, walking/running track, pavilion for parties, volleyball courts, women's pavilion, kids court and the Oldest Stone House. Beyond all this, like I said it has beautiful scenery, throughout. It's a truly amazing place",2013-10-07 15:26:06

There was a ton of mushrooms and bleu cheese on mine and lots of bacon and cheddar on his.  So much so, that he was able to share some bacon with me.

We ordered the Tom Kha first but it arrived last.  It was as I expected but the chicken was chewy like rubber.  It tasted fine but the texture threw me off quite a bit.

We also ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and Ginger Beef plates.  The beef was excellent but the chicken was not what I expected.  I've had Lemongrass chicken before and the taste was more like a curry flavor than lemongrass.  Perhaps it was my lack of understanding in what this type of Thai food was; if so I will have to educate myself further.

The prices were not too high and the selection overall was very good.  The sandwiches I was told are excellent and great for lunch (it is close to work, so I may have to go back).  The location is kind of hard to find in the three story shopping center on Spring Mountain (its in the far Southwest corner of the building on the second floor.  The electronic sliding doors to the restaurant are a weird but nice touch (don't have to get any germs by grabbing the door).

Not here. The food tasted fresh, and while it was pricey for what was casual food, the location and the execution sold me. One hummus appetizer (which was beloved at the table), four entrees, one bottle of wine and three beers added up to $80. In the great scheme of things, maybe this wasn't pricey after all.

Those of you who love beer will appreciate the number of tap lines in the bar. From the mainstream to the obscure, there is something for anyone who fancies a beer with their food.

The Kalbi was a huge disappoinent as it was too chewy. The fat around the bones was inedible because it was too gelatinous.

It was definitely up there with the best burgers I have had, ever! Not just in Pittsburgh. I like the simplicity of this place. Simple burgers, simple bar, everything from seating to ordering. 

I had the Denny Double blue burger cooked medium. The meat tasted really super fresh and the burger was cooked to perfection. nice and juicy and not compacted. The meat was super tender compared to some other burgers where the meat may be cooked correctly but the patty was packed together too hard. The buns also tasted really fresh. 

The special lady had a veggie burger, what a bore. Just kidding I tried some and would even consider getting those in the future. I said to her, this almost tastes like falaffel (not sure if I spelled it correctly and spell check didn't figure it out). And apparently that is what some of the ingredients are. 

They have wine, they have whiskey, they have beer. All the components that I need to come back on a regular basis it wasn't overly expensive either.

My friend and I shared an order of turkey meatballs (6 pieces) and they were tasty. However, my entree, a chili rub pork tenderloin, was overcooked, so the pork tasted a bit dry. My friend ordered a brick oven chicken breast and it was also overcooked and dry. 

I actually liked the sides (shaved brussel sprouts, grilled pears, and fig mostarda) that the pork came with. The fig mostarda was especially delicious. The brussel sprouts gave the dish that crunch factor. Had the pork not been overcooked, this would've been a really good dish.

I still like the place overall. Love the set up and the decor. Good ambience. Good service. Convenient to get to. Plenty of parking.

The verdict: mixed.
Their new location has tons of seating and it was packed. They must be stealing all of Indian Spice's customer's down the street because they only got this busy on a Friday. I guess people are preferring the 38 cents in savings ($9.62 with tax). So, I sampled a few things that they had in the buffet. The only thing that jumped out at me was the Tikka Masala Sauce. It was pretty darn good. Unfortunately, I could not say the same about the chicken that was cooked in it. The chicken was way overcooked to the point that it was dry and interfering with the chewing motion of my jaw. The righteous solution would be to take a plate of sauce over to IS and use their chicken.
Service was non-existent, but I am not sure if it supposed to be that way. If it is, fine, saves me from having to tip which makes this even more cheaper than IS.

About 40 minutes after we ordered (wings, chicken tenders, moose balls and a breakfast skillet) they informed my friend they were out of hollandaise sauce - fine, no big deal.  Ten minutes after that they brought our food out and, as he was setting our tenders down, informed us they were out of moose balls.  We only ordered two appetizers for two people so not having one of them was a bit of an issue.  Our tenders were missing the fries that the menu said they came with.  My friend's wings were so dry even sauce didn't make them better.  My other friend's skillet was disgustingly crunchy and her eggs were hard when she ordered over easy.

Service was excellent, the lady over the counter was extremely helpful in helping us choose our meal. She offered extremely helpful input on whatever we had to ask. Food came quickly and with a smile.

Ordered the apple & maple grilled cheese with a fried egg and a side of wedges. I realize now that I'm not a huge fan of combined sweet & savoury flavour, I like them separately, but it was still delicious! 

Environment was so cute! Very clean and bright, I loved it. Mood was happy and it kept me happy. They have signs in the booths where you can change up the letters, and we spent a whole 15 minutes writing our message.

They have some of the better water rides I have ever experienced and the water was a perfect temperature everywhere.  The problem is, it is just too expensive.  The cost of the ticket is one thing, but they nickel and dime you every step of the way.  You have to pay $7 to park and there is no getting around that.  The least they could do for that is build a garage or have some shaded parking.  There are none of those bags for valuables you get at a lot of pools or water parks, so you either have to carry your stuff around or spend another 7 or 8 dollars on a locker.  Concessions are sky high, but not a surprise for a theme park.  The tubes are like $6 too.  What really made me upset is there are two family rides that seat about five or six passengers.  The lines were named for the rides, but we had no idea which name was which.  These lines move the slowest for some reason (you would think they would move faster with more passengers) and they are mostly in the sun, also all of the misters are on the stairs on the way up where no one is standing and none are on the actual line.  We lined up in the line to the right because we wanted to ride the ride on the right (made sense to me) and got to the top to learn we were in line for the ride on the left and could not change.  They could have done a better job of labeling it or had a little courtesy towards our misunderstanding.  I am glad I came and rode the rides, but in the future I would probably never return.  I have heard how packed it can be during peak times and could imagine waiting for tubes and rides.

So we talk about food and so far we have both steered each other in the right direction comes to new spots. I was looking for someplace new was in the area and remember about Biscuits 2 Burgers. 

Other yelpers have mention it. It was more ghetto before then put up permanent sign (one that really cool, nice logo not just words of the restaurant but screams personality). The outside never believe the type of establishment find once open the front door. The area itself really nothing else much open in that small shopping area and most of the other spots are empty or feels like ghost town. Like I said once you walk in be surprise! It had nice clean, totally new restaurant look, and really nice small cafe feel for me. Each table have fresh flowers something that you hardly see in restaurants. It very much open air feeling between the open kitchen, the country decor, and one of the big artwork or art on the wall. It plate with two eggs and smiley bacon strips. Great saying that I forgot. =((( The lady that was hostess/waitress was fabulous from the get go. Friendly. Answered any questions I had about the menu. Good fun talking stories with her. I was the only one in the restaurant. 

I decided on breakfast (I do plan on coming back again for lunch). I had the banana nut pancakes with side of turkey bacon (it comes with sausage or bacon; craving turkey bacon so cost more). Talk about nice portion. Not that I love my go to breakfast spots where the pancakes portions sizes enormous. It was refreshing change look at the plate have three decent size pancakes with nice toppings and presentation had clean simple look. The taste was great! The pancakes was right between dense and fluffy. I like. The turkey bacon on the side was nice crispy and delicious. I also ordered the fresh orange juice. Yelpers that good call!!! The juicer machine thought was pretty cool looking in the kitchen. Just observation. It does the good that for sure. It tasted fresh, not concentrated, or juice get at buffet or any hotel restaurant out of gallon jug. The whole meal for me was fabulous. I look forward to trying the lunch menu and the burgers.

You order and pay at the counter and then take a number and wait for them to bring your food to the table.  The french toast was absolutely delicious and incredibly filling.  I'm sure it was high in calories though because if I closed my eyes, I would believe without a doubt that I was eating a scrumptious dessert.  The table agreed that my meal was hands down the best.  If you see this on special one weekend, order it!  

Here's what I didn't like...my post dessert, dessert.  I had a lilac cupcake and was truly disappointed.  I had their macaroons at an event recently and they were to die for.  The cupcake, I could have left behind (but of course, I didn't.)  The cake itself as well as the icing were incredibly dense.  I like my cake to be light and fluffy.  The cupcakes reminded me a bit of Dozen's which I was never a fan of either.  I also sampled a bit of the lemon pound cake a friend ordered.  Now that was melt in your mouth deliciousness.  

The atmosphere in here is interesting.  It's a bit eclectic and almost feels a little unfinished.  It's a small place and was packed on a weekend. Our table was really close to where the coffee creamer and sugar stand was so that was a little annoying but overall good experience.

The venue as a whole appears cleaner with new floors or maybe a paint job on the floors, regardless, it looks 100x better. The front of the house/foyer/lobby has fun chandeliers and custom paintings of famous rock n' rollers along the ceiling edge. The bar has great decorative lighting (P.S Diet Cokes are $3) and the bathrooms don't look like I will contract hepatitis anymore, yay! They are adorned with cute swervey mirrors (does that make sense?), automatic toilets, and the fancy Dyson hand dryer.

The control booth is still in the center of the audience pit (yes pit, its standing room only), but there was so scaffolding so I am wondering if they are building a balcony. I've never been to a show here where they would need more room for the audience so I am hoping they will move the control booth up there. Also, they have giant fans on the ground to help keep the pit cool. Anyway, there still is a smaller bar to the right of the stage for those that are interested in drinking, but still wants to stay in view of the band. 

There is an outside patio that now has chairs lined up against the wall, but don't expect to get fresh air, this is (and always has) been where one goes to smoke. Even though study after study show that smoking is bad for your (and those around you) health , Marquee has decided to put a stand on the patio that will sell you cigarettes so one can stop bumming off of other people (yeah right).  Oh, at this show they also offered food - well pizza slices for $3, that is new to me and beneficial to those that frequent the bar.

The employees were all very friendly
They have a pretty big menu but I had noticed that they had an Orange Chicken special which came with rice and a egg roll for about $6 so I chose that
I also got a Dr pepper can
Came out to a decent price
The food took about 15 minutes to get ready which was pretty quick 
They were nice enough to double bag it and toss in some soy sauce, hot sauce, and napkins...
Oh and fortune cookies...

Getting home, I was sort of hoping to see the cool little red/white boxes that Chinese food usually comes in but they were in a cool black plastic container
It smelt really good and I was looking forward to the taste
Pretty good
The brown rice is good
The orange chicken is very flavorful and cooked well
The eggroll was a little dry but the sauces came in handy

Having spent lots of time in Viet Nam, and never having pho prior to going there, I came home to Vegas searching for a place that could even slightly come close to the pho I had over there.

I judge pho mainly on the broth.
So far, Pho King is the closest thing to the real deal that I've found on this side of town in Henderson. I know there are tons of pho places, and I've tried maybe 10 of them. 
The only other one that I love is Sunflower Vietnamese Restaurant all the way in N. Las Vegas on Craig road.

I would definitely, definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for legit, authentic tasting pho. They also have Cafe Sua Da there, the Vietnamese coffee made with condensed milk, and they even used the old-school drip system like they still do in Viet Nam. I took one sip and it was like omg I'm back in Viet Nam. It was awesome.

The place is in a super convenient location, and the owner is very sweet and very enthusiastic about sharing Vietnamese food and culture. He went to Viet Nam to get the paintings that decorate the walls in the restaurant, and everything is very modern and nice in there. The wait staff is very friendly and it's super affordable!

Here we go: Basically skip the extras and choose sliders wisely.
Spinach Artichoke Dip - kind of a spinachy mess with huge strands of spinach in an odd colored cheese sauce that did not end up tasting too great. Only $5, but poor quality.
Loaded tater Tots - it looks pretty, but was pretty much a standard order of tots topped with some kind of brown meat gravy and sour cream. 6 bucks.
Sliders - The traditional beef was the best with onions and cooked well done as per our request. The beer battered shrimp was a major disaster as the breading fell off the shrimp to reveal an undercooked piece of shrimp. The hort rib slider was loaded with decent meat, but nothing that was included on the sandwich gave this any taste or punch.
  Did have my first Mule drink and that was good for $7. Watch out for the waitress/bartender though, she has a way of making you order something that your on the fence for and that is a compliment, along with her excellent service.",2015-09-10 14:54:53

i stopped by on a tuesday evening, when they unveil their smaller brews each week and enjoyed a tasty duble.  five and some change for such a beer is more than reasonable.  and everything that has crossed my lips from the brewery has been quite tasty, actually.

i really like that fact that they have expanded their brand beyond what is considered NoDa and are garnering success throughout the CLT.  they also make it easier to enjoy their product elsewhere with growlers to go for about fifteen bucks.

i am going to have to stop back and grab grub from the food trucks that they have stationed just outside to provide vittles while swilling delicious suds.  and courtney is always a breath of fresh air on the other side of the bar...",2012-02-01 15:53:02

Was about to order the edamame as an appetizer until I saw it at the next table over -- I've never seen dark brown edamame before and suspect it wasn't fresh. We ordered the lettuce wraps and thought they were a poor imitation of PF Chang's (no crunchy element, chicken/veggies chopped so large that the lettuce wasn't really necessary). Their plating and table settings also left a lot to be desired (seriously, and I am usually wowed by the creativity of restaurants when it comes to plating). Drinks were reasonably priced, and they had a good beer selection (though they were out of at least 3 beers on the menu by the time we got there ... not sure if that's a regular problem).

This is a great location and could be a great restaurant if they refine their menu a little more. As it is, it's a decent (though small) bar area that sells overpriced sushi. I think their biggest problem is that they offer too much -- jack of all trades, master of none.",2013-12-09 15:15:58

I called in a take order, we ordered 1 Sultani kabob ( 1 skewer of tenderloin and 1 Skewer Sheesh Kabob,with Salad and Naan, and Choppan kabob ( 3 Lamb Loin Chops, with Salad and Naan, also ordered 3 Bolanee (home-made lightly pan fried naan, stuffed with potatoes, green onions and herbs, served with a side of homemade yogurt) I always order this item if an afghan restaurant has it on their menu. ( 1 order of Bolanee could be shared by 4 people ) 


Okay now comes to the quality and taste of the food; I have to say it was good, fresh, flavorful, the meat was cooked well and on the well side as well, but not over cooked
The Bolanee was awesome but little bit spicy, if you are okay with little bit of chili flakes you should be fine.

Customer service could better, that being said it was not bad per say but odd.
I asked over the phone ( as it was a take out order ) could I please get some extra hot sauce?, the reply I got was ""it comes with your order"", I know its comes with my order, but I wanted extra, really did not get an answer. So I was like Ok I'll just ask when I get there, I did ask how long would it take? The girl taking the order said 15 minutes.
She did not ask my name or phone number nor did she give me an order number, I found out later why she did not ask any information. they make their customers repeat their whole orders. 

So I get there 15-20 minutes, a girl working at the cash asked what did I ordered, so i had to repeated my whole order, paid, and I asked again can I please get some extra hot sauce, she replied, ""ask the back when you pick up your food"" to me that is not a providing a good customer service, all she had to say was I'll let them know, write notes, tell the expeditor, tell the cook, find my bag and set it aside. You could do tons of things to make a customer  dinning in or take out or pick up very happy, but in their case the girl did not seem to care.

Then I went the back, took a sit, and waited for 5-10, I asked for the ""hot sauce"" again to the back of the house, and they obliged, at last one guy came from the back with my food, and says the food was ready all this time but......( he never finished his sentence ) I am not sure what that meant, they forgot to pack my order?

At this point I am hungry, all I want is to grab my food and get out, so while I am grabbing my bags the guy states, ""always check your order"", No buddy! That is your job, as I am the customer, I should be confident that I would get my order correctly. it is kind of expected when you go to a good establishment.

Sorry guys' customer service is huge to me, that being said the girl at the back (expeditor) was really polite, and a gentleman working the grill came to the front was also polite and courteous

Service was excellent, our server made suggestions and talked us into Mac n cheese bites. I had the fried chicken meal and he had gumbo and jambalaya. The mac n cheese was a lil different but alright, dip them in ranch. Personally, I didn't love the fried chicken,  it was a little over fried so the chicken was dried out. The hush puppies were pretty good.  The fiancé wasn't a fan of the jambalaya, he ordered it extra spicy since we were told it isn't that spicy and it didn't have much bite.

John Curtas claimed that Holsteins pork belly buns were almost as good as Momofuku's in NYC (http://www.eatinglv.com/2010/12/holsteins-has-got-it-goin-on/) so we had to try them out.  A lemon meringue shake and a Korean burger rounded out the order.  My husband and I were starving from driving around Mandalay Bay and Luxor for an hour trying to find parking and getting stuck in traffic.   Our very nice server quickly took our order.

The food came out very, very fast.  Which was great but also a little disconcerting.  They can cook that fast?  LBS, Holsteins sister restaurant at Red Rock Casino, takes forever!  And we weren't the only ones.  Our neighbors all got their food within 5 minutes of ordering.  Crazy.

The pork buns are NOT ""almost as good"" as Momofuku's.  Not even close.  Maybe because Holsteins can see John Curtas coming a mile a way in his all-white suit, he got a better version.  But these were just ok.

The Korean burger had a good flavor to it but there was too much liquid involved and the bottom bun was pretty soggy.

The lemon meringue shake stole the show.  It's sounds weird but salted caramel in a lemon shake with Grand Marnier - brilliant!

We figured our modest order and half-starved state would leave us enough room to try the infamous China Poblano next door. We were wrong.  The fat content of the food combined with the shake made us full very quickly.

Let me tell you, I am glad I tried it!  Not the best chicken I have had but definitely good.  I really wanted to try their monthly sandwich, the Chicken de Mayo, a fried chicken sandwich with chicken nachos, salsa, chili lime sour cream, cilantro and more on top.  It was a mess but also delicious.  I did take my time eating It though which made the chips go soggy but that didn't bother me too much though.  The meal came with fries which were great, a tiny thing of ok coleslaw, and a drink.  All of their pops are apparently homemade which is pretty cool.  I tried the black cherry, a personal favorite of mine and it was top notch, the ginger ale which was just ok, and the cream which was darn good.  I also got two wings on the side.  Although they were $2 a pop, I believe they were worth it because they are ""whole"" wings, with three sections.  I honestly found these better than the sandwich and didn't feel like they needed any sauce or flavored honey.  The meal was relatively cheap but when you go a la carte it gets pricey.

2 large orders of dumplings (18 total) - classic pork and chive and pork/shrimp combo:

Sothy Seang, the owner of Donut Hut on the east side of town, is living the American dream.  An immigrant who came to America in search of a better life, like millions of others have done before him, Mr. Seang's story is a fascinating one that has been documented in a recent feature by vegasinc.com (thanks for the tip, Nik O.): http://www.vegasinc.com/business/2013/dec/06/donut-rambo-cambodian-refugee-finds-success-friend/?_ga=1.243919811.754996307.1382033796
A bookmark for a while now as I aim to visit every donut shop in Vegas, the boyfriend and I paid a visit to the hut on a recent Saturday night around 8:30pm.  The Cambodian Rambo was there behind the counter and we greeted him like a long lost friend; after all, we had the advantage of knowing his life story from the article.  The shop is decorated with pictures of Mr. Seang with local law enforcement, his biggest fans, and rightly so, with his donuts and patriotism winning them over years ago. A friendly and humble man, we congratulated him on the feature article and he asked us how to find the story on his smartphone since he was still trying to figure out how to use it.  In exchange, he served up some of his delicious donuts.  I went with my usual crumb and coconut cake donuts, while the b/f had a blueberry donut and a French cruller.  I sampled his blueberry donut, which was still warm, and if that wasn't the best blueberry donut ever!  I don't normally have that flavor, but Donut Hut's version has won my heart, or stomach.  Actually, I'd have to say both.  It's difficult to come away from meeting the man behind the donuts, knowing how he survived the horrors of Pol Pot's regime, fought in the resistance, lived in a refugee camp, made his way to Las Vegas, and ultimately took ownership of this little donut shop and not feel like his donuts are something special.  It's just my opinion, but I will gladly return here to buy more donuts from a man like this and support his business with pleasure, as I try to do with other local donut shops similarly run by Asian immigrants such as Mr. Seang who probably have fascinating stories to tell, as well.  The donuts are great, but Mr. Seang is amazing.  I would encourage anyone who likes donuts to stop by and give Donut Hut a try and meet its fabulous owner.

PS:  Both the crumb donut and coconut cake donut were delicious, as well.

I am usually not a fan of oyster bars good, I come for the oysters but don't really enjoy the rest of the dishes they usually serve at oyster bars. We were supposed to go to the movies but that didn't work out so decided to eat here. We came in around 6 on a Monday night, got sat at the bar and our waitress took our order immediately. 

We used to go to the oyster bar at SouthPoint but was so disappointed by it the last time we were there, this one was so much better. We got the seafood sampler and half dozen oysters, Shrimp and Scallop Rosa and my sister got the Pan Roast I think. Food came out super quick, oysters were cold and big, really good cocktail sauce. Seafood sampler was ok, the ceviche was very bland, almost tasteless. I would skip this sampler. 

The pastas were really good. Huge portion, tons of seafood, great flavors. Overall really good dishes. Service as good overall, drinks are constantly re-filled, staff was attentive. The staff seemed very fluent with what they need to do, the restaurant was pretty busy but drinks and food came out super quick. Everyone helped each other, everyone did everything that needed to be done. It was a plus watching the staff work and having good laughs with each other. 

Although...one of the staff, I think the manager of the place was way too loud. He seated us so we thought he was the host, but then saw the staff asking him questions about the checks and comps so I am assuming he's the manager of the place. He was talking to some guests and staff and kept yelling and screaming...made me jump. He was having too much fun, I don't mind people having fun and enjoying themselves but he was SO loud that it made us stop in the middle of our conversation, very unprofessional of him. Also he kept talking and laughing when guests were waiting to be seated and checks needed to be closed. The staff kept calling him to close out some checks but he kept on talking and screaming, very annoying. 

Overall I think the staff here really knows what they are doing, operation seems to run very smoothly from what I saw. Food came out quick and tasted great. Will be coming back for more.",2017-06-29 02:36:13
dLyeI2xfACEFHdyvv_C9kQ,g4xr80W9n71ZrFV2JYzJ5g,qQOysPSAXDMs1rLy6KOiMw,4,7,4,5,"Of the four Toronto climbing gyms, Rock Oasis is my top choice. This is primarily due to location - I'm a short bike ride away. There's lots else to like (and a few things to dislike).

LOCATION: 5/5
Located at Carlaw/Gerrard, it's actually quite easy to get to if you live/work downtown. The Carlton/Gerrard streetcar drops you off right there, it's a relatively short walk (or bus ride) from Pape station, and it's a delightful downhill bike ride (good luck pedaling home though, after a three-hour session.) Free parking round back, and there's a car2Go lot near Broadview. Overall, it seems to be the easiest to get to if you live central/North Toronto

CROWDEDNESS: 2/5
Oasis can get really busy some nights, but there's lots of wall space to work with. You won't often wait for a wall, but you will often find yourself belaying shoulder-to-shoulder with someone else, or waiting on a route for someone to cross up ahead of you. It's a nice social atmosphere sometimes, though you may want goggles for all the beta you'll get sprayed at you. 

SELECTION: 4/5
The routes change pretty often, and there's always a vast array of difficulties. Not to mention the self-belay wall has 12 extra routes. I love the self-belay wall, because it forces you to send it's routes cleanly, teaching you resting skills. Especially good for when your buddy is caught in traffic/lying about being caught in traffic while still at home getting ready. Lots of overhanging and straight walls, but no slabs.

ROUTES: 3/5
There's often a fair balance between routes which are challenging and interesting, and features moves that teach you balance and efficiency tricks...and finger training exercises. There was a 5.11 a few weeks ago that featured nothing but tiny little footholds and crimps the entire way up. Ugh. There's lots of variety though, and you can always skip ones you don't like and find something better. They had an incredible 5.10 overhang that was almost exclusively dyno moves, which was accessible and crazy fun for intermediates (if they used the dyno and skipped the last move) but was also crazy challenging if you instead skipped the dyno and moved with stable balance. Sadly gone now, I wish it had been a permanent fixture.

BOULDERING: 4/5
They used to have a pretty weak bouldering gym, but they just got a mega upgrade - new padded floor, new holds, and a vastly improved grading/separation system. I haven't explored it fully yet, but I did a couple routes last week and was very impressed.

UPDATE: I have since explored, and definitely the upgrades are pretty extensive. There are a lot of routes to explore, and it's really well spaced out. You never need to be in someone else's way.

PRICE: 5/5
At 15 bucks, it's the best in the city. The 10 pass ($135) doesn't expire in 6 months like everywhere else, which is logical and fantastic and thank you Rock Oasis for not being ridiculous. 

STAFF: 3/5
There's a good mix of friendly, unfriendly, helpful, inexperienced, surly. Depends on the night.

GENERAL FACILITIES: 5/5
Great selection of gym equipment in the bouldering section, wi-fi, tons of change rooms, lockers (with free use of locks), washrooms, and a few private showers. I once got out of a shower only to realize I had forgotten to bring a towel. You didn't ask for a story, but if you've ever been in a post-shower, towel-less situation, I know you will sympathize with me when I say that your change of clothes do not make an adequate substitute, and great now you're still wet and you have two soggy t-shirts to deal with and it's cold outside and what a perfect time for that aforementioned uphill bike ride.

Note: This summer there was no A/C, but rather lots of humongous fans. There were some pretty unbearable days. Hopefully they're working on making it a little cooler in there.

MUSIC: 3/5
Sometimes 90s rock, sometimes Indie/Alternative...last time it was mostly weird dance/electro. Just once I'd like to hear them pump some classical - nothing will make your climb feel more majestic than some Mahler/Wagner. Oh wait, something will: Alan Silvestri's theme from Back to the Future.

UPDATE: The music has upgraded a little bit. I've noticed a lot of great modern tunes, both popular and a little obscure, so that's cool. 

Overall, it's a solid gym, lots of choice - highly recommend!",2013-12-09 17:52:54

This is not even close. It was aweful. I still have not found a place on the West Coast that makes good authentic Shawarma sandwiches.

Shawarma is lamb or chicken that is spiced and cooks while it turns on a ventricle roaster. The cooked meat is cut off as it turns and then rolled in pita bread. The meat shawarma usually comes warped with onions and tahini sauce with pickled turnips. The chicken is rolled with a garlic sauce and pickled cucumbers. Both sandwiches are then placed on a panini grill to toast the bread. That is a shawarma sandwich.

Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.

I happened to be looking for furniture and didn't see much along those lines (but they did have a couple of basic rocker/ottoman sets). I only ended up buying a pair of very fairly priced maternity pants and was surprised they ended up being on sale at the check-out register. If I would have known they were having a sale, I might have tried harder to find more stuff. And, BTW, it's a very crowded store and the bathroom doubles as a fitting room. 

They had some baby bjorns for about 50% off retail that I would have considered if I could have figured out how to put it on without the manufacturer's instructions. My one and most serious complaint is that I overheard a store employee talking to a customer about car seats. Buying a used car seat is already a little risky and her response to reselling the seat was ""We ask that your car seat hasn't been in accidents, but, you know,...""

This experience was nothing like I've ever had at a Chipotle. How many people can say they want to a Chipotle and had a burrito and left hungry? Well, tonight, my son did. C is a picky eater but he loves Chipotle. He gets a Burrito with only Steak and Cheese. That's what he got tonight, only for some reason, the staff translated his order from a Burrito with Steak and Cheese, to a ""Steak 3 Pointer"". I have no idea what that means but that's what got rung up by the cashier. From what I saw, it translates to ""kid size Burrito"". I was only charged $5.75 instead of the normal $7.50 so again, I think they made him a kid sized burrito. I never even knew this was an option. C has had this Burrito from 3 other Chipotle locations and this is the first time this has happened. C liked the burrito well enough except for the grissly pieces of steak and he said it was a bit spicier than the other times he's had it. He also got one of those little cartons of chocolate milk, $2.30. O.K., this is for Chipotle Corporate. Seriously, $2.30? C pays 40 cents at his school & McDonalds can sell 'em for a buck. You know they're mostly going to be sold to parents buying milk for their kids. Why beat up the parents for getting their kids milk? 
I ordered the Carnitas Bowl. $6.95. The pork was very tender, the pico de gallo and corn salsa were fresh and tasty. I also added Black Beans, rice, Cheese and Lettuce. I liked it. I can't remember a time when I haven't liked it. There was an annoying customer behind us in line but that's not Chipotle's fault. What is Chipotle's fault is the messy dining room. From the time we walked in the door and got in line behind 6  other people to the time we paid for our meal, no one had gone out to clean the dining room. There were a number of tables that needed bussing which was making it hard for people to find a place to sit. C & I just decided to sit outside which ended up being where I found the busser. The table we picked was dirty of course but he had a towel in his hand so I asked him to wipe it off. He did and apologized and off he went.

In 1983, They started serving banh mi, Vietnamese style sandwiches from their catering truck by San Jose State University to the students and residents in the area. It became an instant hit among the community. Wanting to create a more permanent location and expand the franchise in over 3 dozen areas including Las Vegas and Henderson.  They opened the first Lee's Sandwiches location on Santa Clara Street.

In addition to the traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, they added Euro-style sandwiches, fresh baked baguettes and croissants, an extensive line of drinks including the famous  Lee's Coffee - ca phe sua da and can be expressed in regular, caramel, mocha, or vanilla blends.

Lee's Sandwiches attracts a diverse crowd, from traditional Vietnamese-Americans to a younger crowd, all ethnicities of all ages with the extensive menu that offers a unique dining experience for everyone's preference. 

Lee's Sandwiches is heavily involved with the communities. They have contributed and helped raised additional funds for many tragedies including 9-11, Hurricane Katrina, the floods in Vietnam, earthquakes in Mexico, and other local charities such as donating food and sponsoring various community and non profit events.

As for my experience, I always utilize their space to do my college studies and homework in privacy because they stay open 24 hours and the owner is very supportive of my goals. I sit on the foyer part of the restaurant/ cafe so that I wouldn't take up space on the inside where people could dine. They also have a private room used for events. You can go in and ask if that room can be reserved. 

What I love to order on their menu is #5 - Grilled Pork and #6 - BBQ Pork with extra mayo packets and vinegar on the side. This brings out more flavor and softens up my bread because that's just how I like it. To go with your meal, you cannot skip on their famous coffee. I love it because it's thick, creamy and keeps me awake when I study.

It's not on the menu and our waiter didn't even mention it, but it really is a great meal at a great price. The only other place it was mentioned was on the board outside the restaurant.

We had the endive salad, the hanger steak with corn succotash and mashed potatoes, and a raspberry chocolate dessert. I was really impressed with the salad, steak, and sides (not really a dessert person). Everything was flavorful, well-balanced, and tasty! The only problem was that service was never around even though there were only like four tables! We kept trying to flag down a server and they would just be standing around conversing in the corner. The wine was okay but not spectacular, but at unlimited refills I am not complaining.

I'd definitely recommend this place for a meal. The food is excellent (and with unlimited wine to boot!) and memorable, but just be wary of the service (which is why it's a 3 instead of 4).",2012-10-10 00:55:03

After not visiting for several years, I decided to go on Christmas for some warm cozy soup after a friends recommendation. So this is what I've been deprived of? Wow, the matzo chicken soup was hearty and delicious! It has a wonderful homemade taste and feel and really hit the spot! A dash of pepper and you have a very fulfilling meal. And of course I had to have a bagel - a jalapeño bagel with cream cheese and it was scrumptious. Ask for a sample of their delicious high quality cream cheeses, there are so many yummy flavors. 

My boyfriend had the corned beef hash and he said it was the best he ever tasted. The meat was very lean and the portion was decent. He loved the coffee too (and he's picky about coffee). 

I finished off the meal with a slice of german chocolate cake. Unlike grocery stores who sell sickly sweet cakes, Chompies emphasizes the coconut and almonds while keeping the sweetness in check so I was able to enjoy sweet and savory. The cake is so awesome I plan to buy a whole sheet. Good job Chompies on taking pride in your cooking and baking. I will be back to try more and more dishes!

I've been here for lunch and dinner many times. Today I came with a group of friends for their first ever Drag Brunch. Food and a show? Count this piggy in! 

We started with a brunch buffet. I gorged on the breakfast favorites- scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and home fries. Eggs were seasoned well, home fries were cooked with onions for that extra oomph of flavor and bacon, well, bacon is never bad. 

Then add in brunch the Vida way - chicken taquitos, mushroom sopes, carne asada y arroz, chorizo tacos and cheese quesadillas. Oh my goodness. No, I'm not even done yet. Throw in some pastries, cornbread, fresh fruit and countless tequila shots. Yep, that's how I Brunch! 

Everything I ate was delicious but the chicken taquitos were by far my fave. There were 4 different salsas - but no chips. No worries, I sopped up the salsas with my meal. Well, meals. Let's face It, I probably had 4 full plates of food. Cheat day, ok?

The only downside is that it's a lot smaller than Cora so if you're waiting for a seat, you might have to wait a while.
The number one reason why I like this restaurant is because of the variety of selections they offer - sandwiches, burgers and breakfast food. I decided to stick with breakfast food the day I came here. I got the omelet which came with a side of fruits, toast and hash browns. I was particularly pleased with their hash browns because they seasoned it so that it didn't taste like potatoes that you get at any other breakfast restaurants.I also couldn't help myself and ordered French toast. They added cinnamon to their French toast which really elevated the flavour. I appreciate the extra spices that they add to their food which makes them stand out from other breakfast restaurants.

As a foodie and local food supporter, I have heard so many good words about this place. I have been wanting to try it out during my 5 years in Madison. We finally made the move this year. 

I came out the restaurant being somewhat disappointed. 

Don't get me wrong. Everything was fancy. The staff was very professional. The ambiance was really classy. Food was delicate. 

 I come in with full preparation of the steep price (otherwise I would not wait for 5 years). However, I can hardly justify the experience with the $90 per person bill. It is pretty clear to me that L'Etoile is overpriced. 

In terms of food, 4 of us got Charcuterie, Pork Belly, and another beets dish for appetizers. They are all good, but without any true highlight. The portion is smallish. After I ate the pork belly, I somewhat really missed the pork belly I had in the A Pig in the Fur Coat...

I had Branzino for entree. The fish itself was pretty delicious, but standard. The vegetables on the side has a slight hint of brunt smell that I found pretty odd. 

My brother and his girlfriend had lamb rack and scallop. Very average dish that you can get in an upscale restaurant. 

The biggest trouble of the night came with the steak for my wife. Since she is pregnant, she could not take raw meat. Therefore she asked the steak to be medium-well, but the steak came on the table being medium-rare. She had to ask the kitchen to re-do her plate. I guess such thing always happens but I was not expecting in L'Etoile. 

For dessert, we shared a Creme Boulee. It was, again, very average and with too much cream on the top. 

I could not find a memorable dish from the dinner. The food was delicious, but it failed to surprise me. When I pay close to a hundred dollar per person for a dinner, I really hope to see something more exciting. 

Nor do I understand the numerous 5-star reviews for this restaurant. Maybe this is something not meant to be enjoyed by poor students. Overall, classy, delicate, but somehow empty and overpriced. Thus a 3 stars.",2014-03-15 01:15:25

As many of you know my palate runs from the somewhat eclectic to the totally bizarre and all points in between. Whether it is crawfish, frog legs, or snails I never hesitate to ""give it a try"". Andrew Zimmer watch out! That is why I am giving Food City of Chandler my top pick for one of my favorite breakfast foods in the whole world.  ""What might that be?"" you ask. MENUDO! Hot, spicy, brothy, flavorful, salty, and yummy morning menudo. I'm a Scotch/Irish American and I believe my love for menudo comes from my ancestor's love for the traditional Scottish fare known as haggis. Sheep's stomach is not much different than cow stomach and tripe is the main ingredient in menudo. As a result I've been a menudo lover for several years since trying it for the first time in 2004 and guys this is the best menudo that I have found ANYWHERE in the world. I've had it in Cancun, I've had it in Mexico City, I've had it in Phoenix but ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, if you want the REAL DEAL then look no further than Food City in Chandler on the northeast corner of Ray Rd. and Arizona Ave. If you have a hangover I STRONGLY recommend this place as the one stop cure for what ails you. Spicy and delicious and steaming hot this amazing elixir is served up only on Saturdays and Sundays which makes the wait that much more meaningful. Their menudo is also served with the traditional limes and chopped onion / cilantro garnish and is recommended highly by ""your's truly"". Also if you like traditional marinated Carne Asada then look no further than the Carniceria at Food City (that means butchery by the way!) Take this home and put it on your grill and you'll be having a party when you taste this amazing marinated skirt steak. I have to commend the manager of this Food City. He's always around and smiling when he sees you. The staff is always friendly and happy to be of service. I LOVE my Food City. Don't ever change guys!",2010-05-16 18:08:22

Everything from here wasn't too bad, we order an appetizer to start - the baked goat cheese. Wasn't that great... Anyways, onto the entrées - my girlfriend ordered a pasta and for myself, a burger. The pasta was average, nothing special. Burgers like the one I ordered can be compared to ones like at moxies or pickle barrel because they're just a burger with a fancy name cooked well done and with a side, except this one tasted terrible. I don't know who thought some sliced smoked ham would taste good in a burger - terrible combination.

I can't remember the name of the tea company but it was really caramelly and rich, just as it was described on the tea menu. The cornetta was very big and pretty yummy. The only problem was that I ordered it ""for here"" and it was served on a little wooden cutting board lined with a napkin. I thought it was a very cute presentation but the cornetta was almost bigger than the little board and was not a practical serving device at all for a flaky and crumbly pastry like that. There are lots of nice food offerings including pizza and pre-made salads, and gelato! I'd like to try something else next time. 

The staff are pretty new and are learning, which is nice, but there was someone in the back area near the pizza counter talking very loudly; sounded like they were training a new team member.

It took away the illusion of a seamless bakery business the way a theatre performance would be ruined if you saw the dirty tricks behind the scenes... It wouldn't be so impressive after that.

I think the Blue Coyote refers to my mood and my belly hollowing and being hungry.  They ran out of a product and they had to switch it up which is not a big deal.  They made it work and that's what I appreciate.  We ordered the Drums of Heaven which I heard was really good.  They didn't have the right Chicken but substituted with another.  I thought it was pretty good since the brown sauce is usually really salty, but this one wasn't. 

My sister and I each ordered a burger.  Mines was well done, real.... well.  It was somewhat dry in the middle plus I didn't care too much for the condiments.  I actually had to add ketchup, which I generally don't when ordering a hamburgers.  I would say the fries were my favorite.  Steak potato fries are yummy, but my I'm sure my love handles are screaming at me!

The ambience was pretty strange.  It had that truck stop cafe feel with some modern pop.  The Sushi bar really made a difference to the feel, but it was really awkwardly placed.  I didn't think it really belonged and it should just branch out on it's own to attract more customers.  Blue Coyote Cafe doesn't really scream sushi to me.  

The service like I said was slow, but I don't think I can blame our waitress.  She did a great job of making us feel welcomed and was really polite.  I think there was confusion on who was supposed to serve us in the beginning and with the missing ingredient; really slowed the serving of the food.  - Enjoy!",2012-12-05 20:42:21

Love everything the do here food wise. Normally it takes only a little while to work out what I feel like ordering but with the menu at Coop I deliberated for a quite a while before making my choice. In fact my boyfriend and I made sure that what the other was ordering was something we wanted to try.

The boy had the Thai Pizza - they use a tortilla shell as the base topped with peanut satay sauce, chili flakes, smoked cheddar cheese, smoked tofu, green onion, black sesame seeds, inca fire salt and scallions. The tortilla shell is lovely and thin and stay crisp through to the middle. They pile the toppings on so even though a tortilla shells sounds like a small meal the toppings get you fill fast.

I had the Chow Mein Unplugged. Noodles with a ton of seasonal veg which also included purple cabbage & kale, delicious garlic-juniper sauce, all topped with applewood smoked oyster mushrooms - amazing! Love these mushrooms. Who thinks to take mushrooms and applewood smoke them? These guys. Applause! Good size portion and filled me up.

Their drink menu is extensive - one page all non-alcholic and different teas, the opposite page all great sounding cocktails.

They dont take reservations but we were told that if you generally arrive around 6pm its not too long of a wait. We were seated next to a couple at a 6-top table so we had some space between us and didn't feel like we were crowding eat other.

The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about all menu items and wine pairings with menu items.  The bread basket was delicious, including some Passover friendly items.  I had the mozzarella, basil, tomato salad (let's just call it Caprese, though that isn't the official name on the menu).  The aged balsamic vinegar was delightful, as well as the basil.  The rest was ho-hum, but by no means bad.  Just average.  I partially blame myself for ordering a tomato based salad not during tomato growing season.  My mom and I split the lobster macaroni and cheese as well as the green beans.  Both were delicious and well executed, though my mom felt like the green beans were a little undercooked.  Dessert was the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was good, but didn't knock anyone's socks off.  What DID look amazing and tasted awesome was the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake.  It was also HUGE and would easily serve 3+ people.

Ambiance was wonderful with low lighting.  I could have used a few less dead animal heads around the place, but I get the vibe they're going for.

When we arrived I stated to the hostess that I was here by Yelp invitation and they knew exactly what I was referring to.  After getting seated I asked our waitress what the details and or restrictions were for my invite.  She confirmed with the manager that anything I ordered would be on the house.  I jokingly said ""one of everything on the menu then!""  I didn't ask if alcoholic beverages were included since I did have to return to my place of work after lunch.

Appetizer:  You can't go wrong with the oven baked soft pretzel.  Soft and buttery with a side of horseradish mustard I believe.

Entree:  I ordered the pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage with four cheese blend pizza.  It was as delicious as it sounds I promise.  My wife ordered the Brussels sprouts quinoa with chicken salad.  Tasted fresh and it was amaze-balls!  We also ordered a side of fries to treat our glutinous appetite.

No desserts, but I sure did want to taste them all.

Service was great and I even asked our waitress to charge my card for something so that I could leave her the 20% tip she earned from the total bill.

Pizza is better than other in the neighborhood that I tried but the salad and the cheese steak don't rate as high for me.

Longer Story

After purchasing not so fresh fish for dinner from Whole Foods we needed something for dinner and my husband suggested to try Stevie's NYS Pizza. They told us an hour for delivery or 10 minutes to pick up so he picked up. The pizza had a good quality cheese and a tasty sauce. I liked the nice thin crust but I thought it was a little mild flavored. The pizza was good but not oily like a true New York Pizza.

We went back and had a cheese steak, Chicken Caesar Salad, and something unusual that Stevie's offers called rolls sort of like a smaller Stromboli and we tried a spinach one. Out of what we tried we both liked the Spinach Roll best. The roll was bigger than we excepted for $4.00 and can be a meal since you can pick meat options. I thought it needed a little salt and pepper to taste better and the roll came with some tasty marinara sauce. The high light of the Caesar Salad were the three garlic knots that they give you with it but the romaine lettuce was very fresh. The cheese steak came on a decent roll.

This place has the weirdest seats I ever saw in a pizza place. They were called beard seats and looked sort of like car seats. 

Worth a try for pizza or the stuffed rolls!

My top favourites are the:

- almond croissant (not too sweet) 
- chocolate croissant with custard inside 
- cinnamon roll with custard and Belgian chocolates

I recommend getting their Danish coffee as well ($2.50 for a large). Very smooth, with sweet berry notes. 

The only thing missing here are savoury pastries. Lots of sweet options but nothing salty.

Location is pretty convenient as it's located on Kingston Rd. where there's street parking or you can also park on one of the side streets.  Place isn't very big but it's good for a small group.  Staff are also very courteous.  

I had a Bacon Burger with Cheese which is one of the simpler ones even though they have their specialty burgers.  I personally like to try the most basic burger when trying out a new spot just to see how that would taste like without all the fancy fixings.  The burger patty was nice and juicy and was also quite flavourful.  A lot of times the patties are so bland but it seemed like they first caramelized the onions and placed those in the ground meat before grilling them.  I could also just be making that up.  Either way, the patty itself was good and I wish it was a little bit thicker.  The bacon was perfection.  God bless that magical animal.  With my burger I ordered No Bull Chips with parmesan seasoning.  Chips were freshly made and cooked to a golden crisp.  Was a little on the salty side but it was nice.  Want your taste buds to get all trippy? Dipped those chips in ketchup.  It'll taste like you're eating pasta! 

My friend had the Redneck Burger which was also very good.  The battered peameal bacon alone was very good.  I would've eaten that on its own.  

My other friend ordered a regular poutine on the side and that was also very good.  It's all about the gravy and the choice of cheese and No Bull ain't bulls**ing you with cheese other than curds.  It's all about the gravy and curds, man!!  I personally can't stand it when poutine is made with other types of cheeses.  

Although we didn't have any but an added bonus was the fact that they serve Kawartha ice cream.  I can only imagine what their milk shakes taste like.",2015-01-05 03:13:17

There is no better Fillet Mignon you can buy to make at home.  The bacon may look like that in other supermarkets, but it's way better.  Fresh, never frozen.

I just, well, 2 stars to me means I won't go back.  Not unless someone insists I go with them.  And even then, I will more than likely try my best to talk them out of it.

I mean, it wasn't all bad.  The bun was really good.  And the hot dog, just plain, was good.  The duck fat fries were tasty.  And the packaging for my to go order kept my dogs warm until I got home.  

But some of it was bad.  The New York dog, eh.  Definitely not the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  And while the fries were good, it looked like I got the last batch as it was mostly very small pieces.  I also tried the chili cheese dog.  First, it needs more cheese.  If I have to look for the cheese, there's not enough there.  And the brisket chili did not appeal to my taste buds and had an odd texture.  

The best part of my meal would have to be the root beer I drank out of my East End growler where I stopped before Station Street.  Sigh.  My entire order was $15 + tax.  In my recently hot dog tastings it seems like we're getting farther away from just the classic dog.  Station Street has a kimchee hot dog.  Is that necessary?  Not, it's not.

One of these shops was The Chocolateria. Since I'm a huge fan of anything sweet (especially if it's covered in chocolate) it was an obvious MUST for me to visit this store.

When we first entered the shop we were greeted by the sweet aroma of mouth watering chocolate. A friendly staff member (whom I think is the owner) also said hello and offered us assistance however we didn't require any help since we were just there to browse and buy.

The shop itself is rather small in size. A few tables were set up in the front (which I presume is for patrons to sit and enjoy their house made ice cream) and there were walls & tables of chocolate covered goodies placed strategically throughout the store - plentiful but organized.

For a small space, the shop has an impressive inventory offering delightful treats such as house made ice cream, potato chips dipped in chocolate, cocoa powder, and an array of truffles. That day I purchased the dark chocolate sea salt caramel turtles. This palatable candy consisted of bittersweet dark chocolate encasing a smooth and creamy caramel filling. There was some sea salt sprinkled on top which was a subtle salty taste that complemented the sweetness of the chocolate & caramel very well.

The pricing of the products are comparable to other local chocolate shops in Toronto (ie. they are a tad on the pricey side) but the quality of the product is what you are paying for. Overall, delicious chocolates. I have not tried enough of their products to say it is the best in town but it is definitely worth a try if you happen to be in the vicinity.",2013-02-23 17:23:00

I was staying at the Silverton with the kiddo and really the breakfast options aren't great there. I saw Cracker Barrel was in close walking distance so I thought it would be a great idea to head there for a nice breakfast.

You walk in to Cracker Barrel and into a nice country store full of gifts, candies and even Raiders memorabilia. Off to your left is the entrance to the restaurant. We were quickly seated and greeted. We received drinks and made our order. I went with the biscuits, gravy & bacon and the biscuit, hash brown casserole and fried apples plates. The kiddo got the three pancakes plate. The food came out really fast. Very nice. The biscuits and gravy though, were disappointing. Especially coming from a country style restaurant. You get three biscuits and a container of gravy to pour over them. The biscuits were somewhat crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. The big issue was the gravy. It was pretty bland and I had to add salt to it (!!!). The hash brown casserole was different but I liked it. The fried apples tasted like pie filling to me. But the skin was still on the apples so it definitely wasn't out of a can. The kiddo liked her pancakes. I had a couple of bites and they were decent.

On the other hand our server was great, very sweet and caring but this stupid camera guy came up to us and just stood here didn't say a word then says ""would you guys like a picture, it's free"" we took pictures I bought 2 and he was just so weird and awkward I felt so uncomfortable then this kid says that his feet hurt...I told him he has an easy job and he should be fine. I don't think anyone should complain about an easy ass job like come on. My burger wasn't even that good, my boyfriend got steak worth $30 he asked for medium rare and it was over cooked...we left and of course left.

I feel like we didn't get enough attention compare to the other tables our server had. I did come in work out clothes, socks and slippers. But that shouldn't explain the poor service. 

Ok let's talk about it-
got seated and they dropped off 2 water glasses with no ice and a vase of water. I guess they don't like their water cold here. So I asked if we can have ice with our water and he comes back with 1 glass of ice, so my girl and I shared this one glass of ice water our whole dinner. So dinner..

We ordered:
-New England fry
-kurobota pork chops 
-scallops
-asparagus
-Mac n cheese
-kids chicken & fries 
-garden mule (cocktail)
-Brookie (dessert)
-Dutch chocolate ice cream

let's start with the New England fry. It was basically fried calamari and whole bellied clams. It was good but nothing spectacular. The batter didn't adhere to the seafood well.

We ordered a garden mule to share since we just went bar hopping last night..one drink won't hurt right? We weren't very fond of it. she chugged it so she wouldn't taste it lol. 

Entrees: 
Lady ordered scallops with cauliflower purée and greens. We both liked this dish. Seasoned well and plated beautifully. I had the kurobota pork chops which were pretty bland and it didn't help that it was dry either. I had to ask for more sauce but even that took forever because our server was never around. the only good thing on that plate was the slaw but that's not the reason I paid $27. I was unhappy with my entree and match it with neglected service, it was pretty much downhill. 
We also had Mac n cheese and asparagus as side items and both were pretty tasty. 

Dessert:
'Brookie' brownie and cookie combo topped off with salted caramel chunk ice cream. Sounds good enough right? while, the idea is good...the execution could've been better. the brook was a lil hard. I was expecting moist and soft. That salted caramel ice cream is to die for! Best thing I had tonight other than our one & only glass of ice water. 

Our dinner wasn't crazy expensive but at that price point..I'd expect more attentive service and staff actually coming around more often checking on us, filling our water. Instead of dropping off a pitcher & food and not see a server til check time.

I am a huge fan of gyros, and often go to M&T's downtown.  However, when in Southside, when choosing between M&T & Lesvos...I have to go Lesvos.  They're as authentic as you're going to get in Pittsburgh.

The owners are off the boat Greek.  They're friendly, and will talk to you about anything & everything if you'd like; I usually sit at the ""bar"" and chat.  They do a special that includes a gyro, fries & a drink for something like $7 or less.

Here's how the competition between the two stacks up -

Meat - Lesvos - I've only had chicken, but Lesvos wins.  It's well marinated, and freshly grilled.  M&T tends to char theirs too much.  

Pita - M&T.  They toast theirs with a bit more oil/butter/unhealthy goodness.

Sauce - tie.  They're different, but I can't choose a winner.  Lesvos is more authentic, but M&T has a sour-cream-crack quality about it.  

Fries....Lesvos.  No contest.  They're fresh-cut, dropped when you order.  M&T use frozen bagged fries.  The fries are the deciding factor between the two.  

I really encourage you to try Lesvos if you're in the mood for a gyro.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.",2011-03-21 03:59:42

Those experiences definitely left a sour taste in my mouth and I didn't return until last weekend (after a year). Being overcharged by $8 the first time around was okay as we chalked it up as a server's miscalculation. However, being overcharged by a few dollars ($10+) on each of the other two visits (on separate occasions) has gotten me concerned about their practices so I didn't bother to return. Instead of Rol San, we usually alternate between these three; Rosewood, Dim Sum King, or Noble Seafood in Chinatown. I am not the only one who have had this issue, as there are quite a lot of online reviews out there that have indicated this as well. 

Despite their lack of service or final bill discrepancies; Rol San has remained a popular dim sum establishment in Chinatown. I can definitely see why as they do offer all day dim sum, and the food was tasty here. As an added note; tea is an additional 60 cents per person.

The prices are relatively standard to a restaurant offering all day dim sum, and our meal was a little over thirty dollars. I actually did enjoy the food here as I found it rather flavorful, and the shrimp that they used for both the shrimp dumplings and rice rolls were plump and delicious. As for service; the main server didn't do much as all he did was stand at the front counter, and lurked around.

As a non-smoker, I enjoy that they have full separation, yet easy access to the bar portion.

Inside the restaurant the music is extremely loud plus the abundance of chatter makes it very difficult to hear your brunch mates. Perhaps that makes me sound old, but I don't get to see these guys all the time so when I do I'd like to be able to converse with them. 

Sitting outside isn't really much of an option in the summer either. There didn't appear to be much shade or misters to try to beat the heat so unless you enjoy becoming a melted burnt mess inside you go.

The service was alright, but the servers definitely seem overwhelmed with the crowd of people. We barely saw the poor thing who was busy running around. Did I mention the place was slam packed? 'Cause it was. That being said the wait time to get in was only about 20 mins.
 
I wasn't overly impressed with the food I ordered. My potatoes were not crisp. (I like my hash browns to have a crispy seer.) Also, there were some gross soggy pieces of bacon fat in my dish. I took the most of it home and reheated it in a skillet with some butter and that did turn out delicious. 

The pancakes are where it is at though! We split a pancake flight and I have to say all 3 different kinds were fantastic! They were light and fluffy and full of flavor. They each were so good individually I don't think I could even pick one favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend trying the ones we had: Strawberry Fields, Blueberry Danish and Peanut Butter Cup. I have a feeling the rest of the pancakes and the french toast are probably equally was tasty as well. 

Oh yeah, did I mention the pancakes? Get the pancakes!!",2015-07-04 20:43:23

I won't tell you how much I bought, but I will tell you that it's probably an amount that I should be ashamed of. I was so excited. 

They also have grinders for fresh peanut butter and almond butter and the like. Have you had fresh almond butter on toast with honey? It's really good. Banana on the side. Or on top if you're crazy. Okay, I'll stop with the suggestions.

We were hoping to get in for happy hour, but it was packed. Bummer, but not a strike against the restaurant. 

We still wanted to stay for some drinks and dinner. We requested a table for 7. Mind you, our party was standing in front of the host stand.  Most of us are about 6' or more with the crowning jewel of height is my step father, clocking in at 7'1"".  They stuck us at two tiny, pushed together tables, 7 of us, in the main walk way from the kitchen. Even if we all were at a more comfortable table, or we were smaller people, you don't put people in the walkways from the kitchen.
 
My sister and I were constantly getting shoved in the back, but chose to sit there so our parents weren't the ones assaulted.  I had to sit with my purse on my lap since I couldn't hang on the chair with the traffic going by and there was no floor space to spare with our tangle of legs. 

I grabbed the margarita menu hoping that ordering a couple would help save the quickly falling mood.  DAMN DRINKS WERE $10+. At a bloody restaurant, during happy hour.  Oh but happy hour doesn't apply to the dining side.  A few of us ordered a drink, still.  My mom's came with just a piece of lime rind, my upgraded margarita looked like a regular and came in a smaller glass and I just got excuses from the waiter that they are the same ounces. (Bullshit and we pointed it out with the empties after the fact but he didn't care.)  I was still charged the $12.50 for the shorted drink. The food was ok but not much of a selection.  I shared a meal with my sister to off set the cost of our drinks. 

It was very disappointing and my mom was crushed that the only evening we had to visit a Mexican restaurant, during my visit to Arizona, was such crap.",2012-01-04 19:59:14

We've been to the College location a number of times and had 'the usual' - good pasta, good pizza, etc. I think the food is actually quite good - a solid 3 stars, especially for a chain restaurant but it's not fine Italian. At this price point I shouldn't really expect it. 

The problem is that it's a delivery and take out place and the front of the house is a distraction and the poor step child to the rest. A steady flow of Uber delivery bikes shows this to be the case. The wait staff is inexperienced, inattentive (eg 15 - 20 min before taking drink orders, not circulating to check on basics like water, not bringing the bill) that makes eat-in dining painful even for a casual drop in dinner. 

We went when it first opened and chalked up the uneven service to opening jitters. That's not the case.  Unless you are in grade 11 going on your first date - don't bother with the dine-in option.

I don't blame the wait staff (only one) - she's spending 90% of her time packing takeout food silly!  The reality is that there is no one running the front of the house.  Actually, I don't even think there is a manager of any sort - some sort of egalitarian cooperative seems to be at play. Stuff gets done eventually but no one is really running the place (basics like here are your menus, waiter will be with you shortly, did table 2 get their bill, did you ask if they want dessert, maybe you should bring a glass for the drink,...) - you know, like a restaurant. 

All told the food is ok (skip the awful salads - dump and run of too much green stuff with some sort of gelatinous dressing), minus one star for 'it feels like we just opened this week' service and AWOL management. 

Take it for what it's supposed to be - a delivery and takeout joint.",2016-07-26 02:21:10

Ordered the Pulled Pork plate with the House Baked Beans as a side. Pork was overcooked and was served on a plate that trapped the rendered fat to the point that the meat was swimming it.  The pork was tough and stringy.

Baked Beans were undercooked and way to sweet for my taste and the Hickory Smoke Flavoring added to the beans was overwhelming.

HJ93FssGYaImtkIeDpz8xg,bfCyqpNNOL0tO5TmlHOxAQ,eQfYZrSuzE6B4vkmu74H6w,4,1,2,2,"My review will focus on the Arizona State Fair, as I attended many events at this large fairgrounds: Maricopa County Fair, dog shows/adoptions, concerts @ coliseum, book sale, DeafNation, so forth (all with positive experiences).  I have attended the State Fair over the years with free admission and will be reviewing mainly this year's attendance...

I went to the State Fair last Thursday on the 22nd and took advantage of their free admission between 12-1, which saved me $10 (not counting discounts offered on other days), as well as avoiding weekend crowds.  I walked around and looked at various exhibits, mingled with livestock, purchased a couple fair souvenirs (postcards, pennants, photo taken w/ fair logo over the years), and ate a typical fair snack (funnel cake).  I don't go on rides so I won't be reviewing it.  I love photography so I took quality photos all over the grounds, just a little of most of day, evening, and night ones.  There's lots to see, but I didn't expect much knowing it's Arizona.  Just do a price comparison because it's not your typical fair prices so make sure to watch your spending.  Downstairs inside the coliseum used to have various vendors either to educate or sell something; nowadays, it's just one big themed exhibition that they change annually.  This year featured Vintage Sweets sponsored by Sears, showcasing various famous candies, gums, etc.: Wrigley's, how caramel's made, as well as selling various sweets (Jelly Belly, lollies,...).  Exhibit halls featured displays & the winning ribbons: food, craft, sewing, cake decorating, photography, even collecting rocks/minerals.  Live food shows with free samples given out, as well as various like hypnotist were done periodically throughout the day.  There is one other exhibit I usually avoid: junk selling junk and especially that would be more convenient to purchase elsewhere like a mattress(!)  My favorite being an animal lover is the livestock arena where you pet / walk with zoo (baby) animals, look at small show roosters, goats, as well as sit & watch 4-H live shows.  They even added sinks for you to wash all the germs off ;)  Sheryl Crow was this year's concert lineup for that evening, so I watched her in the evening before heading home.
I appreciate that fair officials have kept in the tradition of keeping the fair going on the same grounds annually since the founding.  The fairgrounds used to be a horse racetrack until they eventually built the Veteran's Coliseum and added the fairs (state & county) and then over time included other non-related events.  That's how the fairgrounds is kept successfully in business.  The rugged southwestern 'charm' is also what keeps the price down a bit and keeps the fair looking like, well a typical fair with the livestock & food scents wafting in the air.  Relocating would kill the vintage-y history and drive prices up even more at a new location.  I never drive & park there and use only the city bus where the stops are right in front of the entrance; parking is a bit expensive and my bus fare is free so I didn't have to deal with the high price and worry about what happened to my car in some sketchy neighborhood.  The fairgrounds and some restrooms were pretty much kept clean and litter-free and when litter/spills did happened, it got cleaned up ASAP.  Remember, the grounds is a large property with so many colorful fairgoers that the hired staff could only keep up with.  I prefer using the coliseum restroom.  The air conditioning inside the coliseum was bit on the chilly side, which is not good for the body when entering from the warm outdoors.  Bringing a light sweater for this could be an inconvenient to carry around, and also an umbrella due to limit shading all over.  I usually hang around inside buildings until the sun finally set for me to mill around outside afterwards.  As for the fairgoers in general, they pretty much keep to themselves so they didn't cost trouble and being that this is typical of Arizona, alot of them looked, umm, alarmingly unkempt.  Casual dressing for fair-walking comfort doesn't mean looking like you just got out of bed under an overpass and zoomed over to the fair without eating something or brushing your hair first.  Sorry, but ick.  I know the fair doesn't have a dress code (sans nudity / barefoot) and that it's not their fault for attracting these type of people.  It's...Arizona.  I didn't choose to move to Arizona (Mom's) so it's obvious.  However, for Sheryl Crow's show, some of the people who showed up at the fair exclusively to see her and not attend the fair did look nice.  Whew, there IS hope!
Despite the fair's positive and negative history over the decades, I still think it's a nice place to attend with the special people in your lives and just GO and have a good time with positive vibes and IGNORE the bad.  There's security patroling all over.  Just have FUN and don't quibble over the little petty eews- just GO and have fun and bring home memories!",2015-10-24 19:22:40

But as you can guess, the quality of the food is not the best. If you're looking for the best value for hot pot, this is definitely THE place to go. If you want higher quality food, go somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, the food is edible and very delicious. Each person gets 1 free plum drink. 

The Menu:
Fatty beef defines a typical hot pot experience. They also have chicken, pork and lamb for meats. They have various dumplings, vegetables, tofu, and noodles. The menu selection is pretty standard. 

The Place/set up:
I actually like the flexibility of making my own soup base. This way, I can't blame the restaurant for poor seasoning and it saves the restaurant time. Most importantly, I can make the soup as strong/mild as I want. Don't worry, they have recipes if you don't know what to use. 

The Food:
This is where I can start to list some flaws with certain items, though most of them were decent. The beef is not as fatty as I'd like. But it's still delicious. The chicken was fine. Didn't get pork or lamb. The various balls (fish, squid, beef) were fine. I really liked the home made squid balls. 

The biggest problem was with the dumplings. The so called shrimp dumpling was stuffed with a lot of ground pork. I understand shrimp is more expensive and you can save $$$ this way, but that doesn't explain why the chive dumpling also had pork inside. I thought chive is cheaper? 

The fried fritter was terrible. It was fried maybe 2-3 hours ago. It was hard. Not edible.

There were only 2 of us and they serving of vegetables was too much. They used a basket and filled it up. 

Overall: 
Like most Chinese places, don't expect much in terms of service. They also screwed up our order once by adding rice cake to our order of udon. But at such a good price, all these can be overlooked. Just don't overlook your bill because they include gratuity in the bill. Recommended if you want value.",2014-03-15 18:00:04

""It's too small. They have nothing good. It's so cheap and dirty. It's a shit mall. You're better off going to Arizona Mills or Arrowhead.""

Like the people who drive all the way out to Westgate and still manage to muster the inanity to complain of how it isn't Scottsdale, these same jibbajabberers clearly have no grasp on the area and its economic status. They don't live here (surprise), and make a point to mention EVERY TIME they visit the west side how much they hate it.

Yeah, fuck you too.

Sure, Desert Sky is ghetto. Because IT'S IN the ghetto.

There's a reason so many people take the bus to this mall. It's not because they're environmentally aware. 

To better illustrate the socio-economic climate of Desert Sky, I have prepared a neatly compiled bullet-point presentation. 

* At any given moment, one or more stores in DSM is going out of business. Some don't even make it over the 6 month hump. So if you see something in that smoke shop you really like, better get while you're there, because next year it'll be a perfumery. 

* They can't even afford decent food court food. Other malls have Orange Julius and Hot Dog on a Stick. They get Flaming Wok (who carries the exact same menu as Panda Express but still manages to somehow be less authentic) and a Subway counter staffed by seemingly invisible sandwich artists. 

* And you thought the ""free samples"" guy at your mall was annoying. DSM has the most aggressive kiosk workers in all of mall-hood. Their cell phone plan is such an affordable value that they're willing to barrel through other patrons and ambush you behind signs and walls to let you know how awesome their deals are. Sure, you didn't want that sugar-coated nut, but at least nobody was injured in the process. Except maybe the underpaid workers whose nut-harvesting skills were exploited by their cheapskate employer. 

* It's pretty common knowledge that one of the department stores (hint; shares it's name with an island and a type of blue-colored liqueur) will issue you a store credit card on the spot. No application process. No waiting period. No wonder everyone comes here packing heat. All these people in holey shirts and torn up jeans walking out of stores with brand new stereos and speakers, their faces shifty with looks of guilt and/or disbelief. 

* The ""special attractions"" here blow. Business is so bad the caricaturist is closed on weekends. ON WEEKENDS. I went to the mall yesterday and the Santa they brought in had ONE kid waiting in line to get their picture taken. One. People can't even afford to TELL Santa what they want for Christmas. Woe upon the world.

* The Steve and Barry's here is closing down. How FUBAR'd is the economy when not even the combined endorsements of Amanda Byrnes, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the WWE can sell your 9 dollar jeans?

* I have on more than one occasion been asked by fellow patrons not to eat my Pretzel Time in front of their kids, or they'll be forced to explain to them why they can't afford such snacks. I would have given them my pretzel, but being originally from Philadelphia I douse mine in yellow mustard, and 99 percent of the people I've come across find it repulsive.

* Did I mention that this is one of the only malls (if not the only) in the whole state that can only afford to have ONE story?

So please, before you pass judgment on this calamitous and downtrodden mall, please take into consideration the geography and economy of the area and its consequences on neighboring businesses.

After browsing the menu, we realized that the tasting menu would be the best and most creative option for us.  Our waiter, Tate, suggested that we choose the vegetarian and omnivore option in order to experience  more of the menu.  Obviously we agreed. 

To start we both were served the Vermont raclette plate which was amazing melted cheese and pickled vegetables.  Incredibly savory yet had a bite of the brine.

For the second course I received a grilled escarole salad and Rich enjoyed the butternut squash soup.  Both were flavorful and consumed in their entirety. 

Our main courses were the most impressive - perfectly cooked scallops in a balsamic reduction or a cheese tart with tomatoes and lentils.  I truly cannot express how delicious each dish tasted.  All I know is that I haven't had scallops that tasty since I left New England 5 years ago. Wow!

To end the night,  Tate brought a pumpkin cake with vanilla ice cream and pota creme... pot de la creme?  I don't know exactly what it was called but it was heavenly!  Carmel and creamy and savory... I felt like it was doing pirouettes on my taste buds.  I couldn't have asked for a better ending to our meal.

I tried on several occasions to just stroll in and eat but failed every time. (Me! Vivek! I know, right?) Now normally, I would say Eff this Ess and throw my hands in the air like a princess and possibly even leave a flaming surprise on their front steps, but I didn't. I just heard too many good things and was determined to sup here. I made a reservation.

Even on a Tuesday night, the Woodlot was bumping. We rolled in at 21:00 for a 21:15 reservation and by some luck we were seated right away. As we walked upstairs I took in the glorious decor. It's simultanously open concept and split level, with high ceilings, a bar and communal dining table on the main floor, and a proper dining room (that seats about 30) on the mezzanine. The dining room was delicately lit, decorated with native art and had the perfect rumbling for a date. I believe this sound level is most accurately measured in Sexy Decibels (SdBs).

Right off the bat we were offered the choice of vegetarian or normal (you heard veg-heads, bring it) menus. Beatrice Y nails it when she says that vegetarians can legitimately dine here without the indignity of having to work around standard meat-filled options. Some of the options on vegetarian menu were downright tempting, but I knew exactly what I wanted. 

The ox tongue terrine with fig jam was a brilliant start. Not too salty, very tender and pretty enjoyable spread onto their house-baked bread. We eagerly moved on to our mains. My DC ordered a wild boar papardelle and I manned up to the chicken and ham hock pie. Both were motherflipping incredible. I have been comparing every papardelle I have had since to the Woodlot's version with its tender noodles and slathered in that delicious boar ragu. And the chicken and ham hock pie (besides being fun to say; try it) was incredimous. It just had this palpable homemade quality that is hard to describe. It was good trust me.

If there was a low-point in my evening it's that my sazerac wasn't perfect, but seeing that typed out makes me feel like a douchebag. Simply put: the Woodlot is a fantastic choice for an intimate dinner, prepared with excellence and without pretension. I like it.

Obligatory Title Pun: I'm getting a LOT of WOOD just thinking about it.

Menu Readability: Even the paper feels house-made. Courier. Smart.

1) Honestly this is my fault for not listening to the waitress, but the pig head mortadella plate was huge! As my dining companion wasn't really interested in it, I was left to myself to devour it (and devour it I did). Definitely more an appetizer for 4 people.

2) The truffled duck fat french fries poutine was amazing, but on the salty side (and I love me my salt). Crispy thin-ish fries (my preference), real cheese curds, a light gravy (as opposed to the dark beefy gravy that is popular in Alberta for poutines), slight hint of truffle. Yum.

3) Mains were very good - my dining companion had the half roast chicken, which was perfectly cooked with crispy skin, and came with a side of salad. I had a thick rib pork chop on a bed of I think it was cheesy bacon barley grits. Pork chop was perfect - cooked medium, was still a bit pink inside and very juicy with a nice char on the fat layer. The grits were good, very rich - it was a neat texture, a little like saucy mini spaetzle bits - but again it was on the salty side.

4) Another reviewer mentioned this as well - the food is very rich but there aren't many other healthy and cheap options to balance it out. I know the menu changes regularly but when we were there, the salad options were expensive, leading me to think that they would be a full meal, and there wasn't really anything green in the table sides - there was the poutine, I think also a sweet potato option or maybe it was squash, which to be fair are vegetables that I don't really like to begin with. It would have been nice to see something like pan-fried Brussels sprouts or garlicky spinach or braised carrots.

5) Service was really spotty even though the restaurant was probably only a third full. 

6) Decent wine list including lots of by the glass options, but on the pricey side.

7) I love that they have an after-dinner cheese list. If only I had room to eat some. 

Overall, I liked Charcut a lot and would definitely try it out again.",2014-05-27 17:01:46

For those of you who avoid museums because they're often filled with screaming children, the Aga Khan is certainly the opposite of that. Without any interactive displays, this isn't a museum directed towards small children. This is a calm, clean, and refreshing space. 

And for those of you who balk at the entrance fee, a Museum Arts Pass (MAP) is available for the Aga Khan at some public libraries. You only need a library card to get one! Check the libraries on Saturdays, when the tickets are handed out on a first-come, first-served basis.

They pretty much only have hot dogs. I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but the Tokyo dog sounded really intriguing.

The Tokyo dog is a brat with daikon radish, wasabi mayo, and an egg. It was pretty good. I would definitely go back.

Aside from the dogs and brats, they also have waffles and a PB&J waffle sandwich. A girl ordered the PB&J while I was there and I have to say it smelled and looked delicious. I may just have to try that next time.",2011-03-20 23:29:48

Both locations offer a Yelp check in discount which I took them up on.

My two cupcakes were peach and a red velvet/Hostess flavor. The red velvet with cream filling and chocolate ganache on top was very good. A nice moist cake with chocolatey richness. My husband loved the peach cupcake I brought him.

The cake pop flavors that day were Lemon and Chocolate. Both were so good! I love the chocolate shell, moist cake, and frosting combination. The chocolate was very rich which is why the cake pop size is perfect.",2016-08-13 17:22:13

Expect it to be busy mainly on weekends and even more so when it is a long weekend. It's a huge stop for tourists/out of towners regardless which location.

I've become well acquainted with the staff here, who genuinely wish for their guests to have a positive experience and a delicious meal to go with it. 

For a newer pizzeria, they've worked hard to perfect many aspects of this young establishment, not excluding the menu and the flavours of each item. The chef/owner in charge of this place definitely puts his passion on display and listens to feedback, as I've experienced first hand. I've brought many a guest to dine here and they all have nothing but good things to say about the 'za.

Must-try items:
Soppressata Marmalade
Truff-ghi (Mushroom & cremini pizza)
Homenaje
Double Pepperoni
Sergeant Peppers
It's Not Good, It's Grape (not on menu)

I've had every pie they offer (and even a few creations that aren't regular menu items), so I consider myself enough of an expert to say that they make killer pizzas here. Not everyone is going to love this place, as I've realized, but that's okay. Can't please everybody. Don't let that stop you from trying them out, though. They've got a nice selection of beer, cider, and wine, the odd dessert surprise, and a nice view of Leslieville. 

It's always crowded here, but well worth the wait if you ask me. Over and above all other reasons, it's the pleasant and friendly service and unpretentious atmosphere that I enjoy most about coming here. I'll be a loyal customer so long as they remain in business. Shout out to all past and present members of the Descendant crew.",2016-06-13 04:28:06

My DD is not vegan, so I do end up coming here from time to time for her, but it's always via curbside takeout.  DD enjoys their grilled salmon, tilapia, Bloomin' Onion, and Alice Springs Chicken Quesadillas.  Occasionally, I'll order a house salad, no cheese, with their Tangy Tomato dressing, a baked potato and a side order of broccoli.  Vegans be sure to omit butter from the potato and the veggie sides.  They have a variety of green veggies from which to choose. 

Everything was fine until the day a large fly was found buried in my DD's salad.  Poor baby lost her appetite for days after that. I reached out to the manager who apologized and took my contact information. (He was going to send me something.)  I decided that I wanted my money refunded instead, so I went up there.

It took us 20 minutes to get our last pizza. She was cutting pizzas one at a time and delivering them.  We saw all three of our pizzas come out at the same time but she cut other peoples pizzas who ordered after us and skipped ours.  They were out of all the teas but one.

mUeSuK2zq_osz_AkvQt-DQ,oDftpTXngPupJl4HuVX29g,UidScb9HFDSD3NBw8MLuGw,5,2,0,0,"This is a five-star review in praise of a single dish:  the enchiladas.  I first started getting Pasqual's enchiladas (always the blue corn tortillas;  always the green sauce; always with the black beans) decades ago.  I've fallen off the wagon many times, and then thought, after a period of years - - hey - - why not stop in for the enchiladas at Pasquals?   Well, it is time to fully give them the praise they so richly (and I do mean 'richly') deserve.

Are there better enchiladas anywhere?   I think not.   The toothy-ness of the blue corn shells, smothered just enough by the sauce and cheese are pure perfection.   That the enchiladas are lurking in the middle of the plate,  in a sea of bold black beans, flaky savory rice,  zesty sauce, and just the right amount of gooey smothering cheese - - this is sheer excellence.

I made a little mistake,  after decades of getting one cheese & one chorizo enchilada, to get one with grilled veggies this time.  I suppose the grilled veggies were good for me, but it kind of broke up the orgy of sensual smoldering smooth rapture - - just a tiny bit.  I also asked for that particular enchilada to be served with the mole' sauce.   I don't think they are up nights slaving over a large black kettle with chocolate shavings and arcane spices to produce the mole' - - but I still kind of like it.   The chorizo enchilada with the green sauce, was, however, so completely sublime that words cannot describe it,  but I will continue to attempt to employ words.   What's remarkable is that their chorizo is not the dark, biting, acidic stuff you might be familiar with - - it is instead a deft, flavorful, mild but still richly satisfying savory sausage, that goes with everything else on the plate like Tristan goes with Isolde.

OK, I'm going a bit over the top here, but, for me, the enchiladas at Pasquals are a totally iconic meal.   It is simply a whole that is massively more than the sum of its parts, and a complete masterpiece of the enchilada ouvre,  pardon my French.",2017-11-07 23:46:46

Don't get me wrong, I love the DJ spinning some awesome jamz while we enjoyed perfectly cooked steaks and toasting to the night! But come on! We had to yell across the table to make conversation and I lost my voice by the end of the night.

Food was spot on delish! Tried the French Toast and Foie Gras and loved the grilled apple on the side. So good and just enough for our small table to share.  The bread and butter they serve is very yummy, so don't pig out on that before your fabulous food arrives.

I had a filet and it was PERFECT! it had a beautiful char on the outside and melt like butter inside your mouth effect! I usually love to eat my steaks with truffle butter but I opted for some simple horseradish sauce this time and it was bomb. The table also ordered filets, porterhouse, bone in filet.  All good.  Sides: carrots that were sweet and plenty, the mushroom pot pie was not as flavorufl as I was expecting but it was a huge portion as well.

We went tonight for dinner. Probably the first meal I've had and didn't take one pic! Epic fail on my part.  They were pretty busy so that was a good sign. 
We started with summer rolls and chicken wings. The summer rolls were pretty tasty and love the dipping sauce. Chicken wings were lacking flavor. It comes with the sweet chili sauce. But I feel it needed some seasoning on the chicken itself. They were big pieces of chicken though. 
Meal wise. I ordered the pho tai extra beef and a sushi roll. Husband ordered the sticky noodles and a shrimp tempura roll. 
The soup broth was ok. Lots of beef. But it was thick sliced and chewy. But $9 for soup? And $4 for extra beef is steep. 
Sushi was just okay. Not enough fish for the price we paid.

I live in Los Angeles and there is a location there as well that is close to my work. I have heard incredible things about it from people who I work with. Although, I never got a chance to try EggSlut in LA - I was definitely very excited to try it the next morning while me and my fiancé were staying at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. We were looking to grab something on the go. We stopped at Va Bene (review below) for coffee and then we headed to Eggslut to brave the line for some to-go sandwiches. Every time I ever passed EggSlut, no matter if it was morning noon or late night, there was always a line wrapped around the place. Probably the reason I have never tried it. My fiancé and I strategically woke up early one Monday morning knowing that the weekend rush may have subsided, and to our satisfaction - we did not have to wait in line at all. We went right up to the register and ordered a sausage egg and cheese sandwich for me and bacon egg and cheese sandwich for my fiancé. I was trying to make small talk with the girl at the register, but she wasn't really having it. In her defense she did say that she had worked the overnight shift and that they are busiest overnight from the people getting out of the club next-door. We put in our order and had probably less than a five minute wait. The place was busy, but not so busy that we weren't able to get quick service. We took our sandwiches to go and headed upstairs to our balcony suite to enjoy them. Or so we thought. The expectations were so high about this place because I've heard about it for years and never tried it, plus the fact that we were both starving - I had to remind myself to lower my expectations in order to enjoy it. They were served in a cute little to-go box, (photographed below.) we were very much looking forward to taking a bite. My first bite, egg yolk splashed everywhere. I found it to be quite ironic because of the name. Also photographed below. To both of our dissatisfaction, our sandwiches were terrible. I know, that is probably not the direction you saw the story going. My sausage, was so hard - I could barely get my teeth through it. I took one bite and then tossed it to the side. The bread was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly, but that sausage literally and figuratively put a bad taste in my mouth. Also, my fiancé does not like ketchup and there was ketchup all over his sandwich. In what world does a sandwich come with ketchup already on it? We were both disgusted and it killed our appetites for the entire day. That pissed me off because I really love Las Vegas dining and we were so excited to try this place. Pure dissatisfaction. If you have to satisfy the urge to try this place because of the hype, do go ahead but go on an off day so you don't have to wait in line. I think you would be more pissed off if you waited in a long line for that gross sandwich.",2017-07-29 17:44:12

I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.

At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. 

Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. 

When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.

Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. 

The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!",2012-09-11 04:20:33

Love the space which is bright and sunny with super friendly staff and are all happy to offer samples. After hearing they have Durian gelato, I just had to give it a try

They offer Non Diary flavors which is different and perfect for lactose intolerant people  

 They use traditional Pozzetti Cabinet which keeps the gelato free from contaminants, air and sunshine; keeping it in its original form longer. 
Plus all of their bases are made in house and aged for 10-12 hour.

 We got a Medium for $4.25 and choice of 3 flavors.

~ sold in street carts and snacks shop, this gelato totally capture all the flavors
Durian
~ A bit lighter then the actual fruit but still very flavorful with bits of fruits in it, so good that we end up buying a whole container home. Stinky goodness!!!

The menu offers pastas, pizzas and sandwiches, but the pastas really are the highlight. It's made to order and sort of a build-your-own type thing where you can choose the pasta type, the sauce and the accompanying protein. I chose a rose sauce with the chicken.

The pasta comes with a bit of salad and some garlic bread. Taste is great! The pasta itself has good texture and the sauce is generous. Nicely seasoned.

Mr. Mama's is located about 10 minutes away from the strip, convenient if you need to fuel up (both yourself and the car) before heading out go town. It's on a block with auto parts stores, but will be easy to find because there will probably be people waiting outside when everything else is closed. We ended up waiting about 10 minutes at 9 AM, but the crowd grew bigger and bigger as we ate.

My standard breakfast order is biscuits and gravy, but I decided to mix things up a bit (just a teeny bit) with chicken fried steak. Our waitress asked if I wanted to sample the gravy first because it was a little different - made with sausage and maple syrup. The gravy is a little different, very thick, with a hint of sweetness and a bit of tang. Still delicious though on top of a very crispy chicken fried steak. The hash browns are to die for - quite possibly the best hash browns I've ever had. Super crispy, like how did they get this thing so freakin crispy?? Pancakes are really fluffy and the French toast is made with huge thick cut bread.

0.5 STAR for the View

I made a reservation for Friday night on the day of. We arrived at 9:10pm for our 9:15pm reservation. We were seated at 9:30pm.

The dining area is located in the dome directly above where the front valet entrance is for The Plaza. The dimly lit circular dining room provided a front row seat to the Freemont Street Experience. We were able to enjoy the festive light shows and people watch all throughout dinner.

There is definitely room for improvement when it comes to service. After our dinner, we were asked if we would like dessert. I said yes. Our waiter disappeared for 5 minutes only to return to tell us that he could not find a dessert menu. (The restaurant was not full. There were empty tables. So how is it that they ran out of or somehow he was not able to locate a dessert menu?) When it was time for our check, our waiter was nowhere to be found. The assistant waiter told us our waiter will be back in 3 minutes.

Onto the food:

Lobster Bisque($8): Mediocre. A bit on the salty side.
Fish of the Day ($32): It was the Bass and and it was bland. To be honest, I didn't even finish it. It tasted like something from a cheap buffet. Very disappointing.
Creme Brulee ($7-8): Mediocre. The caramelize finish was not really achieved. The actual creme part lacked vanilla. However I did enjoy the fresh fruit (strawberry, raspberry, etc.)

Now what about the ""broads?"" I mean, it is in the name of the restaurant and I too was curious about this. As soon as we were seated, it was quick to see who they were. They weren't skanky looking or anything. Just a pair of girls, looked like any other girls you would find walking around at a club wearing their little black dress. They sat down at a table with 3 guys and they had a couple rounds of drinks and then they got up and left. Didn't really have any effect on my dining experience. 

However, I would recommend dismissing the broads and using that capital to focus on the dishes, which is sadly in need of work. To be charging main courses from anywhere between $25 to $40+ a plate and having it taste like something from a dime a dozen buffet line is a real shame. 

Would I recommend this place? I think not.

I went in test drove a car, they ran my credit and told me they would get back to me because the finance manager wasn't in. A few days later, still no call, dealer isn't answering my calls. I'm thinking their playing games. All they had to tell me was no. Why mess around and leave me hanging. I can handle the truth! So I just went somewhere else and got myself a car. 

Second time here was last week. My husband and I were looking to get a brand new 2012 Chevy Tahoe. This was the first place we went because our friend said he could get us a deal. We came here, filled out an application and they told us once again that the finance manager wasn't in, so they would get back to us. A few days later, no call and the salesman isn't answering my husband's calls. Once again, I get the same feeling as I did the first time I went there. It feels like their playing games. Finally, we hear something and they tell us they can't get us a Tahoe but they can get us into something cheaper like an Equinox or Traverse. We tell them that's not we want and go somewhere else. If that was the case why leave us hanging? It doesn't take that long to get a yes or a no. 

We went to Findlay and surprise, surprise we got our Tahoe. We didn't have to wait days and days for an answer either. It took Findlay a few hours to get us what we wanted. Don't waste your time and go somewhere else.",2012-06-29 14:46:46

One of my favorite dishes to order here is the green curry with tofu or pork. It's flavorful and they always set the spice level exactly at what I order. Never intolerably spicy and never too bland. I have a number of other dishes from their menu and although some have been a miss, for the most part I enjoy just about everything I have tried, minus the bland soup they now serve instead of egg drop.

Scheduling was easy and got an appointment within a couple days. Once he arrived they were running late and asked him to reschedule for an hour later. He showed a slight look of disappointment so they took it back and made his initial appointment work. Not sure why the fuss.

The salon itself was professional. He took a photo in of what he was wanting. The stylist listened attentively. When his hair was styled, it looked great!

I am very pleased to see a great cut! The best part is that he bought some product (we love Aveda products) and got a hair cut and spent what we would have paid for just a hair cut at a nearby salon. I love saving money when I can, especially for his haircuts since he goes in on a monthly basis...I'll go in next and see if they do women's style as well as a men's style.

One of their drawing points though, is also their downfall. I love that they serve food and alcohol in the theater. What is better than eating fries and drinking a beer while you watch a movie? However, some guests seem to think it's a tapas bar and order food and refills constantly throughout the movie, which can be distracting. During one movie, the couple next to me ordered 7 things plus three separate drinks, and then sent one of the drinks back.

One of my favorite dishes was the beef carpaccio (don't think it was on the menu when I went back tho). The flavor and texture were perfect.

Ending result was an amazing torso length cut that had a feathery texture typa ends (instead of choppy). Gabe explained to me that he gave me invisible layers, he cut my hair to where no matter what side I flipped my hair it would have that short to tall length starting forward to back, or if I wanted my hair parted in the middle he made sure I had a frame. He washed my hair right after and gave me a blow out. I couldn't wait to show my family and friends my new hair do, it was cute! On top of that for cutting my long hair I paid $45, a very reasonable price compared to other places who would charge me $100+.

I have never met a set of hair dressers who truly listens to their clients and cares about the work than the CriStyles team! After this experience, I will never trust anyone in Vegas with my hair except for Gabe (THANKS GABE!!!), he has gained a long-time, regular client!",2016-08-13 23:06:30

The chicken is a great size - it's hammered flat so that the breading-to-chicken ratio is swung more towards the breading than usual. The meat was surprisingly soft and juicy, and the batter was the right thickness. If you're craving fried chicken I would have no qualms recommending you come here and buy a piece.

However, there are a few drawbacks. The drinks are very expensive ($4 for juice, iirc) and there is not much seating. The lines get very long at peak hours as well. Lastly, to make it spicy, they just add spices to the chicken after it's fried, so that it's basically dusty with cayenne. I wish they had come up with some other way of doing this. 

I understand that the menu will be improving in the near future as well.",2016-02-25 19:35:17

 I was greeted by a man and a kid at the counter so I would assume that this is family owned and told me that they've only been open for 2 months now. I, myself, have tried a lot of Halal food especially in New York. 

Today, I ordered the Lamb Chops combo for to go- rice, 4 lamb chops, half a tomato, yogurt salad and 1 pita bread for $15 + tax + tip, total of $18. I wasn't really impressed as the meat was dry- over cooked on the grill I guess, and it was bland. It didn't come with any white sauce in it and the yogurt salad was just ok. The pita bread didn't come with hummus and you would have to add $2 if you want one, which I think was not a good idea. Pita bread comes with hummus and hummus comes with pita bread! 

Overall, this combo is very expensive for the area that they're catering for. In comparison, a Lamb Chop combo in NYC would only cost you $10, and the same box would give you overflowing rice and salad, 4 lamb chops and falafel! 

They still have a lot of room for improvement. My suggestion is to lower the price OR increase the amount of 1 serving. Also, get a guy who really knows how to cook Mediterranean food. My lamb chop, as well as the meat on the grillers, were dry and bland. :(",2015-12-23 03:33:24

i am not vegetarian and this was my first time to a vegetarian restaurant.  fell in love and went again 2 days later.  the main takeaway though is the damn quinoa onion rings! holy they are SOOO good. whatever main i get whenever I go now, I will get the starter of onion rings to MYSELF, not even going to share. note that its $6 and they legit only give u like 5 rings. whatever, well worth it!

the grilled veggie n pesto wrap is my fav. SO good! like who doesn't like pesto right?! I have tried it in the tortilla and on a bed of lettuce.  I think the portion is smaller when its not wrapped in the tortilla, but who really knows. the side of kale slaw is nothing great. The fries are also amazing here! shocker - the regular ones are better than the sweet potato fries.   The BBQ burger is also great, but im super biased cuz it has their onion rings inside, so really im going to think anything is fantastic if they shove those in lol.  the bun was DRY tho, i think it would be a good option to get the burger on a bed of lettuce instead.

Do not get the cornbread ever though, its dry and nasty.

I went to see Blues Traveler there last night (with opening act, the local band Simplified).  BT is one of my favorite bands of all time.  I'm going back on Tuesday to see Queensryche, and next month for Train ($10 tix!).

Maybe the venue was too new when she went.  The place has no less than FIVE bars, all full service.  Cocktails, beer, wine, soda, etc.  Very friendly and accommodating service.  The Fillmore is large, open, clean and very nicely appointed.  I do have to admit the crystal chandeliers in the ballroom and the restrooms seemed a tad out of place, but may be a tribute to the original Fillmore in SanFran.  Not a bad viewing angle from anywhere, unlike the ""L"" shaped Neighborhood Theatre.

Yeah, the place was crowded.  I wouldn't say overly so, but it was a full house.  I found myself defending sovereign territory, up by the stage, from late-comers who attempted to jam themselves in front of me, but such is the nature of a general admission show.  Not unique to this venue, by any means.

The generic artworks to which Kristin referred are actually framed posters from famous acts and appearances at the original Fillmore over the years.  I was coveting a Pete Townsend poster as well as a Clapton.  I didn't check, but I'm pretty sure they were screwed down.

The restrooms (at least the men's room) are large clean, and well equipped with plenty of ""workstations.""  The hallway was wide and clear.  There was actually an employee whose task it was to keep the perimeter walkways clear... preventing people from loitering, hanging out and blocking traffic flow.

The only reason I didn't give five stars, and my only point of contention is that there is NO seating.  At all.  Except in the VIP section, for which you apparently have to have paid $25 in advance.  If you prop your butt on a railing, one of the staff will eventually come by and, quite nicely, ask you to remove said butt from the railing, lest you fall and bust your head wide open.  By the end of the evening, my feet were killing me.  Note to self:  Next time, don't wear the Harley boots...   It would be nice if they had some bench seats along the back wall, outside in the smoking area , or something.

I'm looking forward to a long and enjoyable relationship with this new venue!!  A little hard to find the first time, but now that I know how to get there, it is very easy and quite convenient to I-77!",2009-10-16 12:52:35

Well, first off, I LOVE IT. I lived right down the street for many years and wandered around a lot. There's areas to sit and read and a water cooler by the restrooms. The book selection is huge! I mean, they really have something for everyone. When I feel like a good psychological thriller to keep me up at night, it's there. When I'm feeling maybe a manga or comic book, it's there. And when I really need some sickeningly romantic junk to make me feel spicy, hey, they have that, too. There's also always a hefty line-up of speakers and different workshops that are held on location, as well as book signings. Exciting!

Aside from the books, they have tons of other things. The children's selection is just too cute. Resting on a raised platform, it's crammed with toys, books, stuffed animals and racks of Folkmanis hand puppets. I have a formidable collection of them! 

Changing Hands also boasts a selection of artisan made merchandise like toys and  dishes that truly are unique and beautiful. They've showcased different local designers and are always changing their displays. Way to stand out!

Close to the entrance, they have isles of different things like bumper stickers, pins, charms, cards, toys and whatever else to keep you entertained. When I'm bored, this is usually where I end up.

The location is lovely as well. It sits right next to and is linked inside to a gorgeous Wildflower Bakery. How convenient! I can get a flaky breadbowl and have something to read!

They also had an old school cocktail menu, so I enjoyed dinner with a couple of Negronis.  I hadn't planned on dessert, but I was talked into it, and was glad I was, even though I didn't finish and had to take the cannolis home.

It's only about 12 miles, so Megan and I say, what the heck, let's go.

Megan's French Dip sandwich was great all the way down to the au jus.

Initially (okay, so maybe for the last 25 years) I've felt that real dim sum was only served when they roll around the little carts of food. Not so. I stand corrected. I've been here twice in the past two weeks. Both times I've ordered the fried squid tentacles - fantastic! I've also ordered the deep fried taro with meat, steamed bbq buns, har gow (half moon steamed shrimp dumplings) and the turnip cakes. Because everything is made to order (unlike some of the cart dim sums, where the ladies carrying the last plate are trying to convince you to take that last sad, tepid dish that's made the rounds for the past hour), it's hot and fresh. There are three things I'd do differently here: 1. I'd have the bills printed in English (lots of non Asian people have caught onto this place) so that people can see what they ordered and the price. 2. I'd have photos of the dim sum dishes for people who don't know what they are (I didn't need them, but the people I was with had only been a few times, and could have used seeing a photo to remind them). 3. I kindly request that the owner go to Tap Phong or Dollarama or somewhere and get a soy sauce dispenser that has a proper seal so that it doesn't leak at the seam (and out all over you and the table).

Located inside the Cosmopolitan on the Vegas Strip this club has it all!

The set up is similar to Kress in Hollywood, 3 stories, with a rooftop area only the club is better and bigger! But it's Vegas so of course it is!

To start, get there EARLY, we got there around 830/9 and the line was already long! If you can tryy to get on the guestlist to get guys discounted ($45 from $60) Sheesh! I know! .. I don't know how much they normally charge girls because we were on the GL.. Very important though! The ratio of girls/guys needs to be EVEN! They will not let any guys in without an equal amount of girls! It's just how they roll! lol (Honestly, I prefer even ratio, it's way better than a bunch of one sex runnin around) 

TIP: Go at 8/830, get your stamp, go back to your room, drink, pregame, w.e and then come back around 11.

The security is insane and the line has all these different areas for different things (VIP, GL, Bottle service, etc.) BUT they are very organized and OMG the bouncers and elevator guys and stair people are sooo nice! I was in shock! They were even goofing around and would conversate with you instead of just give you looks... at one point the elevator guys were competing on who had the most girls! lol...

So the club interior is off the chizzain! It's ultra fresh and the outdoor patio! OMGGG! lmao I'm getting excited talking about it... There was lights, wind (natural, which I liked cause it made it feel tropical), jacuzzis, pools, bars, cabanas! Shit you name it they got it! The outside are is more for lounging, chatting, drinking, as there is no dancefloor, but it's an awesome area to chill out and relax!

The dancefloors were packkedd! They only had two that I saw, not too big, but decent, find a spot and dance your little heart out - they had one techno room and one hip-hop (I was in hip-hop) .. The music was great, I danced for hours straight! :)

You know Vegas, so I wont talk about parking, if you're there take a cab, etc. I stayed at Vdara which is next door so we just walked over. Very convenient!

The only thing is when you leave it's a bitch to get out and you have to go back that way if you leave and return, not through the main entrance.. its pretty confusing and kind of a long walk, not gonna lie! So ladies bring some fast flats! :)

Overall you really should check this club out! When I go back to Vegas I will be going back! ;)",2011-06-29 21:42:13

The Omakase tasting menu is either a seven course or eleven course dinner with dessert.  It's indulgent and worth every penny (at $85 and $130 respectively).  The plates served to you are small, but honestly not as small as I thought they'd be and the desserts, seriously, massive!  

We had the salmon tartare, sawara seared with hot sesame oil, fluke sashimi, black cod with miso, tuna shashimi rock shrimp tempura and an array of sashimi (toro, snapper, salmon, tuna and saward).  Honestly everything was fantastic and fresh, just like fish should be.

Finally a new restaurant in Summerlin that actually has good food, tasteful decor, and reasonable prices!  This space has had several restaurant turnovers, but I think Ohjah will be calling this place ""home"" for a while.  

We were greeted by host as soon as we walked in. Although it was packed on Saturday night (2/16), we were seated immediately. While polite, professional, and attentive, our  server quickly took our drink order and said to call her back when we were ready to order, however we already knew what we wanted to order but she was already off taking care of her other customers.  Since it was busy and to her defense she was continually taking care of everyone and not wasting a moment, it was hard to get her attention.  We didn't order for another 15 minutes or so.

While waiting, we had the chance to take in the ambiance. Viewing from the front the restaurant, there is a drink bar to the left with TV. The sushi bar is in the back side of the front section of the restaurant.  Between the drink bar and sushi bar, there is a hallway lined with tables leading to one hibachi room and the kitchen. There is another hibachi room, off to the right side.  I could hear the crowd in the hibachi room in the back, although based on the hibachi room off to the side there is a door to muffle noise, but I guess the door to the back one was not closed.  Otherwise the noise level was restaurant was average.  The restaurant is softly lit and tastefully decorated in red, black and gold/tan. 

The menu touches on alot of different Asian cuisines- Chinese, Japanese/Sushi, Thai, and Korean.  My husband order three handrolls, and one deep fried sushi roll.  I just ordered the kimchi stew which came with the option of miso soup and salad. Our food can within a reasonable amount of time.

Rolls were standard, nothing out of the ordinary, but decent.  However, serving plate for one roll was so big (on the verge of being obnoxious) it had to be put off to the side, even in a four-person booth with just two of us.  My kimchi stew was well seasoned and was a generous portion that had tons of beef and tofu.  I was really surprised that it tasted so good. 

Again it took a while to flag down our waitress, so we ordered an eggroll and also asked for the check. We left the restaurant, everyone said ""bye"" and the manager came running out to us with a $10 gift card.  How nice and unexpected that was?

I'd heard they'd gotten progressively less nice in comparison to the other wonderful dining options now available in the area, however Kyle loves their beer and I was curious to go and see if they'd stepped up there game at all. I can now say I think the Lawrenceville competition has been rather good for them. Things that bothered me on my last visit when compared to the numerous great experiences I'd had previously weren't issues any longer. 

The service was great from start to finish, unlike the rather awkward experience I had there before taking a break. I'd always loved coming to the CBW with out of town friends or on special occasions for slightly less greasy pub food, and in that aspect I think some of their menu changes are working well! The new chicken options are delicious, and the pulled pork looks way better than what I ordered last time. I went with the Maui chicken sandwich on this visit, and the massive slice of grilled pineapple was a nice touch. There are also some vegan dishes that seem promising. 

For drinks we got the beer sampler on this trip, and it was such a great deal. Only the Christmas ale was lacking in character. The other seven beers were wonderful. I don't think I'll get anything other than the sampler in future honestly. I do hope the CBW continues in this promising way.

Some of the bad experiences:
-Once ordered a chicken quesadilla took it back to work and there were bones in the chicken. I called and let them know because it would have been pretty awful if someone got one stuck in their throat or something. The manager was apologetic and said the next time I was in my meal was on the house. Next time I was in it was really busy and I just let it slide, my meal that time around was good so I really didn't mind.

-Ordered a seafood soup a few months back and it was overly salty and yet flavourless.

-I ordered steak and potato soup recently and threw it out after two spoon-fulls. The potatoes tasted old. If I had more time I would have returned it, but I just could not be bothered to go through calling again. 

The good:
-Lots of choices, you can pretty much get just about anything. Salad, lunch and dinner entrees, pasta, sandwiches, sushi, smoothies, snack plates, etc. You can get a good sized meal or just a little snack or something to suplement a home style lunch. This is a restaurant/grocery store so there is tons to choose from.

-I like the grab and go case they have set up now, you can pick something up without waiting for someone to get it prepped for you out of their deli case. You can just grab something and head to the check out.

-Their Kale ceaser salad is really good when it isn't over-dressed. I've gotten it a few times and it has WAY too much dressing on it. I've even taken it home add added more of my own kale in order to make it edible.

All in all, I am getting less and less interested in visiting Bite because half the time the food has been pretty gross. I just can't be bothered to risk wasting $10.00 on a lunch when I am not sure if I'm going to throw out the majority of it.",2015-02-16 21:55:34

Two of us arrived early and decided to enjoy a cocktail at the bar while we waited for the others.  I decided to order one of their specialty cocktails, the strawberry blonde martini, so good.  I noticed too that you could enjoy fondue at the bar.  A nice bonus if you just want to come and enjoy a cocktail, glass of wine, and some fondue rather than an entire meal.

Once our whole party arrived we were seated and walked through how the evening will work, courses, fondue options, etc. and our drink order was taken.  (BTW, 1/2 price glasses of wine on Thursday night).  Tricia our server was so sweet and gave us ample time to look over the menu.
With six of us we were able to choose two fondue options for each course. For the cheese course we ordered the Wisconsin Cheddar and the Spinach & Artichoke.  The Spinach & Artichoke was by far the favorite among all of us.  The cheese course came with apples, tortilla chips, bread, and some veggies. Loved!
The salad course was next and it seemed we all ordered different ones, I chose the house salad and loved it! So fresh and just the right portion.
For the main course we chose the court bouillon and coq au vin cooking styles. I ordered the signature dish, which came with tuna, chicken, pork and steak. The perfect option to allow you to taste everything.  Note: They do have veggies platter and can do anything vegan, if necessary.
The main course was fun, cooking, mixing with the variety of dipping sauces and coming up with the best flavor combinations. We received broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes along with the course.
On the dessert, OMG! We decided to go traditional for one, Milk Chocolate, and fun for the other, Smores.  The dessert course came with the most options for dipping, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows, chocolate chip brownies, pound cake and a few other things. Heaven!!! And, I am not even a chocolate lover, but it was just right!
I am already thinking about when I can go back!

Tricia was great and I think we all enjoyed the food and experience very much!",2016-08-05 12:32:14

But I will not be revisiting Nacho Daddy, so this review is from our one shot last night, and I think a more appropriate rating is 1.5 stars.  I came back after a few days working in the middle of nowhere desert  and was craving nachos.  Even after reading a slew of mediocre (at best) reviews, I figure I'd like to check it out for myself.  We downloaded the menu, made our selection, and called in a pickup order.  The voice on the other end was none too thrilled to help us with the order (strike 1), but, I've had plenty of experience with disgruntled front desk staff at perfectly good dining establishments.  We ordered two nachos, the loaded chili cheese, and we had a hankering for the taste of wings, so we ordered the ""buffalo hot"".

The loaded chili cheese nachos came as the chips covered in some wilted green onion slices, with a side of the chili and the nacho cheese (nice of them to want to keep the chips from getting soggy).  They forgot the sour cream that comes standard, and my addition of guac (strike 2).  The chips were light and flaky and the chili was tasty with a hint of spice, but the nacho cheese was just standard roller-rink style canned orange nacho (I was hoping for something more like white spicy queso, since it's title is ""que bueno cheese sauce"").  So, meh, definitely not worth $10.

The buffalo nachos were missing the BUFFALO part (major strike 3)!  There was none of the promised buffalo sauce, cayenne pepper, etc, so it was just nachos, mozz cheese, fried chicken bites obviously dumped out of a bag, blue cheese and celery (a nice touch).  Seriously, how can you forget the buffalo sauce on the buffalo nachos?!  Not cool....

That is $ 25 everyday. They didn't have a week pass like other hotels. And because it was July, running outside wasn't an option. It was like running in a microwave oven - literally. 

The restaurants inside are nice however. No complaint to that. There is a bar right in the middle of the casino where you can be stone throw away from the next millionaire. Be nice to the gamblers, they might throw a hundred thousand chip to you if you're lucky (hasn't happened).

Also, their security staff is verbally abusive and downright misogynstic. I was called an asshole by one of the men in the security staff who was short, bald, and white. Sort of looks like he just got out of prison. I plan to call and complain.

Yes, the service was good and our waitress was kind and polite.. But not more than that. We went on a Friday, and it was also a clear sign that they were short staffed. An Irish Pub on a Friday short staff.. Not at all a good impression. Keep in mind this location recently had a shooting during a fight on a weekend night.
We had ordered fish and chips(We were told that's their specialty) and a French onion soup.
The French onion soup tasted like salty thick water with colour. The bread which the soup should have, was not toasted, therefore it was a soggy old tasting piece of bread. The onions were not fully cooked, therefore they tasted crunchy. The cheese was a lump, not beautifully melted as it should be.
The Fish and chips, were incredibly greasy. Yes, I know it's fried food. The level of greasiness was simply absurd. It absorbed through the paper and dripped a bit from the one piece of fish. Yes, just one piece. The batter on the fish was slipping off each time it was cut, to only realize how much grease there was in this dish. The fries were Ok, if you like fries that taste as if they were warmed up and ,not freshly made.
Luckily our waitress never asked us how our food was, nor if we needed anything else. Otherwise, I would have shared these exact comments to her. I know it's not her fault.

Coffee counter offers Lavazza and subpar baked goods, sandwiches and pizza slices can be assembled or heated to order, froyo flavors are predictable, asian station is slightly above your usual food court vendors (healthier option with fresh veggies!), and the aforementioned sushi counter does offer a prepacked sashimi plate. If you're only a little bit hungry, or with a group, this area is probably an economical option to satisfy all cravings.

I wanted to treat my dad for Father's Day to this concept, but Fogo de Chao was booked solid yesterday. Boooo. Okay, I find an alternate and find Carvalho's and they have availability! Hot dog!

I RSVP and we drive our merry selves to the restaurant. I walk in and the venue is pretty quiet and smaller than I would imagine. And, no gauchos weaving through the dining area! What?! I panic and ask our Server where these meat-pushers were in a high-pitched frenzy.

She politely answered that this restaurant is a Brazilian Kitchen, and they do offer similar cuisine, but don't have the same concept as others do. I nod nicely but pout/sulk after she leaves. I feel like crying a little.

After some internal dialogue and to not spoil my dad's special day, I pull myself together and make the best of it. I'm sure it's good, right?

I quickly learned it was even better than ""good""; it was fantastic! Comp plaintain chips were presented quickly and a genuine smile started appearing on my face. Dad and I ordered the same - Picanha Grelhado (grilled steak). 

It was SO nicely done and had a superb flavor of spices and was grilled to perfection (but still rare, like I like it!). Was served w/Brazilian potato salad and grilled pineapple ring. Plus, 2 hearts of palm (OMG, num!).

I love sushi, but I wasn't feeling the zen in this place. I showed up not knowing about their all-u-can-eat plan, so for me this was a bonus. When I received my first roll, I asked the chef, ""Where's the meat?"" My roll was 99% rice. I offered to pay extra so I could get more meat ... because that's what I came for... fish meat. LOL. She replied with something like, ""Everyone always asks for more meat ... more meat. And I tell them - This is it!""   Honey, if everyone is asking for more meat, you clearly don't put enough meat in your sushi rolls. Charge an extra dollar and put more meat in it. And their sushi roll list lacks creativity as well.

First of all, the place was filthy. I understand that they may have been busy, but I almost expected a rat to scurry across the floor at any given moment. I don't think I saw anyone run a washcloth over the counters or tables the entire time I was in this hole. 

Second, the service was God awful! There were 2 people serving/cooking. The guy came up to my companion and I, asked what we wanted to order, then before I had half a second to open my mouth and utter a sound the ""server"" walled away and served someone else. He did this no less than twice. I would have walked right out if this hadn't been the only place open to get a bit to eat within a reasonable walking distance from a concert venue I was attempting to visit. There was a woman making the food, and she didn't change her latex gloves between handling raw meat and cooked meat or rinse her hands when she handled meat to grabbing the coleslaw by hand. She seemed to know which orders were which, but the guy was having trouble keeping them straight. Maybe he could have TRIED to write them down. 

And lastly, the food. I had ordered the roast beef and an extra side of loaded fries. The bread was hard, not toasted hard, stale hard. The beef was just OK, but not bad. But the fries, the staple of a Primanti sandwich, were disgusting! The oil that they had been fried in tasted like it hadn't been changed in over a year, which I am sure is not the case...I hope...",2011-03-21 01:59:26

That's exactly what happened during our recent visit to Kiin. The place is certainly selling itself as a fancier than average Thai place, with its somewhat lavish atmosphere and obsequious wait staff. And indeed, I have absolutely no complaints about how we were treated all night. (Our water was literally topped up every few minutes or so.)

I should also note that the restaurant was celebrating Songkran, the Thai New Year, by handing out free drinks. (I opted for the cocktail, which was admittedly delicious.)

We decided to order three things:

Pandan Chicken (""marinated chicken wrapped in pandan leaf, sweet chilli sauce""): This was probably the most disappointing dish of the night, ultimately. The biggest problem was that the chicken was quite dry and flavorless, although, admittedly, it tasted okay once dipped in the tasty sweet chilli sauce.

Pork Jowl (""grilled pork jowl tamarind, roasted rice, mint, roasted red chilli, Thai kale stalks""): And this was my favorite dish of the evening, though I wasn't blown away. The grilled pieces of pork jowl were all cooked quite well, while the various accompaniments complemented the dish perfectly. This tastes like an almost prototypical Thai dish, honestly.

Kua Hang Gai (""braised chicken stir-fry with lemongrass, Thai garlic and buffalo basil""): This plentiful dish is certainly quite edible - the chicken was cooked well and the extremely mild flavors work nicely together - but again, nothing stood out about it.

For the prices Kiin is charging, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect more than just a completely average meal.",2018-04-16 11:43:35

This shop not only sells ice cream and boba like their name says, they've got Seasoned Fries, Shave Ice, Snow Ice, candies, snacks, and LOTS of it!
They have an extensive amount of ice cream that is made in-house, and I was immediately drawn to the Asian flavors.

I got Avocado and Taro because those are my favorite Boba smoothie flavors as well, and I also got Lychee and Black Sesame. Wifey got Some Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries and a Boba Milk Tea which she enjoyed. I thought that Fry machine was pretty cool, and how it worked, totally different then your usual french fry set-up. My lychee and black sesame Ice cream was good, but the texture of melted and re-frozen ice cream is what the avocado and taro tasted like...:(

It's situated on Queen St so parking can be an issue at times. 

The atmosphere is different but nice. 

Let's get straight to the food. 
The platters that were brought out were pre selected for us. 
Although they tried to do a variety of items, it was all primarily an abundance of meat. 
Ribs, roast beef, fried chicken, steak... I almost felt like we were at a Brazilian restaurant. 
The other thing I noticed was that the other selection of items all contained dairy. Dairy dairy dairy..... 
Although they tried accommodating my dairy sensitivities, I still felt that the alternative should of been a healthier choice. There was only one vegetable plate and it was small. 
I would definitely suggest more vegetables or some sort of carb to compliment all the meat. Maybe some sweet potatoes, baked potatoes, Jasmin rice, asparagus, salads etc. Something more than just platters of meat. 

The next day everyone wanted to sleep in because of how heavy the meal was. 

I feel that this place is better for drinks and appetizers.

I would suggest that the staff step it up a notch with some sort of uniform or maybe all black but not their own t-shirts and jeans I feel that lacked professionalism, even if is meant to be an individual concept.

It wasn't busy at all and the hostess took me to a seat immediately and gave me a menu.  She came back quickly with a complimentary copy of the Review Journal for reading then or taking with me.

My server came by the table quickly and asked about coffee and i soon had a hot cup of coffee on that cold morning.  It was refilled several times in the time I was there.

I ordred the fried green tomato Benny--eggs Benedict made a different way.  The base is not an English muffin but two slices of green tomatoes, breaded and fried, topped with lump crab meat, and topped by two poached eggs and a remoulade sauce that had a nice zing.  The Benny was served with a small field green salad.  The breakfast was very good.  I liked having a Benedict done a different way.  

The thing that got me about Stewart + Ogden was the staff.  Everyone worked together.  Although I had a server, not one person went by with a coffee pot that didn't stop to ask me if I needed a refill.  Also, the staff were all very polite and pleasant people who seemed genuinely happy to have you in their restaurant.  It was a very nice feeling.

Stewart + Ogden is a little pricey--it's not your bargain breakfast, but if you're looking for something different and outstanding service, I recommend Stewart + & Ogden highly.

This year's menu included chilled pea soup with crab, burrata and tomato salad, Wagyu steak with poached egg/bone marrow fried rice, mashed potatoes and veggies, and white chocolate cheesecake with candied hazelnuts. I loved the soup, which was both delicate and hearty, and the burrata was fresh and tasty. My husband was a huge fan of the fried rice, but because I HATE poached eggs, I took a few small bites and was done. Although we both ordered our steaks medium rare, mine was a little tough. And while I thought the dessert was good, my husband proclaimed it one of the best he's ever eaten -- if only there were a few more of the candied hazelnuts. (Again, I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, so I'm not the best judge.) 

Although the food was great, the real draw is the unlimited wine pairing. We each had several glasses of the red and a bit of the white. The staff was attentive and not stingy on the refills, which is always a plus when it's ""all you can drink.""

A side note: Although this was a special menu for Restaurant Week, there's a different 3-course ""Cut of the Week' each week for $48, and it also includes the unlimited wine pairing.

People were cutting lines left and right, be it trying to get your name in to get a table, or getting yourself a bloody mary, customers often were oblivious or deliberately ignoring the lines the rest of us had formed and the wait staff did nothing to provide service to the people who had been patiently waiting in line. That in itself was my first disappointment.

At the table, I'll cut my waiter some slack since the restaurant was basically at the point of chaos. We got the huevos rancheros hash, which was delish, but the apple pie pancakes were just okay. It was a stack of four plain pancakes with apple pie fillings and crumbs on the top. However, the bottom three pancakes were pretty dry and I found my little cup of syrup empty in no time at all. I do really appreciate that our waiter noticed this and offered to bring more syrup, though unfortunately, I was basically done at this point.

All in all, decent experience but I'm in no hurry to stop by for a weekend brunch since the crowd is just off-putting.",2017-02-20 05:05:27

Unfortunately, this past week, I made the mistake of going there for the all you can eat pierogi night.  The pierogi were totally dried out, shriveled and cold.  The people I brought with me were so disappointed and wondered how I raved about this place for so long.  I was very embarrassed.  It is a good deal at only $11.95 for unlimited pierogis (4 flavors), soup and a simple salad, but when you can't eat them, it is worthless.  If they want to continue this special, they really need to prepare the pierogis fresh to order.  We ended up doing that at the end, since they ran out on the buffet, and what a difference it was.  I wish they would have told us that we could have done that from the beginning.  Pierogis just can't sit long in a warmer and be edible.  I had my favorite schnitzel and 3 salads and 1 potato, which were all excellent, as always, but the potatoes were cold.  I sent them back and they were going to get me hot ones, but they never came back until I was finished eating.  At this point, I asked to box them up and take them home.  Service was very slow that night, and it wasn't even busy.  All in all, I would still go back as their food is good quality and all made from scratch, but I certainly wouldn't return for the all you can eat pierogi night, unless they started making them to order.",2016-09-19 16:41:58

The miso soup was put in its own brown paper bag to prevent any spills to the other containers. The soup wasn't too salty or watery and it did taste like authentic Japanese miso soup (though it was missing a few tofu pieces). Hosu also has some great lunch specials too.

I like the food and concept but when it comes to execution of customer service the star rating falls to one.  Places with food like this are everywhere and customer service is what makes a business stand out. This business does not stand out except in negative ways.

Out of the 12 or so employees working not one was smiling. As we worked our way down the assembly line each employee seemed almost callus or at least not engaged/friendly. There wasn't a ""manager"" or anyone in charge ""leading"" this team to success and as a result, in my opinion, they failed. 

The biggest failure was in the dining room. All of the shift focus on this day was on the ""line"". No one was looking at service through the customer eye. Tables were dirty and trash cans were overflowing. The regular coke was ""out"" and it took 20 mins from the time I sat down before an employee cleared tables and did a trash run.

Instead, we asked for extra bread and did it in a more civilized manner! But wow, was it ever good.

The place is big, but I like the layout b/c the sections have a separate-like feel that flows well. The bar is spacious, with plenty of seats and eating room. In addition to their regular dining tables, there's a separate, large dining table for large parties, and cute little intimate 2-person tables too. The decor is a sort of rock 'n roll, meets construction zone, meets French provencal (mirror, chandeliers, bathroom), but it works! I also like the little touches, like paper bags as place mats and tomato sauce cans to hold silverware. The kitchen is that exposed Italian pizzeria style. I wish I could do a better job at explaining the layout, but you'll just have to go and see it.

The food is really good. The calarmari was damn near perfect. Ok, I can't say a bad thing about it. It was perfectly crisp (I hate soggy calamari). There's 2 ways you can order it, Traditional or Calabrese Style. I got half and half and both were just delicious. Calabrese style is the spicier version. I got the house salad. A basic, no frills, salad. But the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh. I was pleased. The pizza I chose was the PROSCIUTTO E POMODORINI. So good! I do wish the prosciutto was a little crispy (like my favorite pizza place Lucifer's does their's) but it was still a yummy pizza! Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. 

For dessert I got the Tiramisu. Ok, first I want to say, I am not a huge fan of Tiramisu. I've tried it several times at different places, and it never blew me away. But during my last trip to Italy with the husband, he would always get it, so it became our Italian vaca thing. Tiramisu at every restaurant. So I began to appreciate this dessert. Back to Pizza Rock's Tiramisu... AMAZING! It was a large piece, my first reaction was, ""Oh I'll never finish this."" My husband had about 3 bites of it because I couldn't stop the food beast inside me.

I didn't try any of their drinks, but they do have several beers on tap, wine and a full bar.

Another cool thing is they have a walk-up pizza window that people passing by outside can order pizza by the slice from. Awesome!

The staff is all very friendly. Service was great. I am excited about this great place so close to where I live. And I highly recommend trying it out.

For appetizers, I ordered the gnocchi and Hubs got the salad.  The gnocchi was just ok but drowning an a heavy, bland bolognese sauce.  It was supposed to have been tossed in a Parmesan wheel, and we did see them doing this, but there was no flavor infused in this process.  Also it came to my table cold.  The kale salad on the other hand was very good.  


For entrees, I had the lamb and Hubs ordered the sea bass.  This time the lamb was excellent, cooked to perfection and juicy, with a wonderful truffle polenta.  The sea bass on the other hand came out a bit overcooked and dry, and the sweet pea risotto was very bland - tasted like rice and peas boiled in just water, no seasoning or creaminess.  Also the corn sauce served under it was ice cold.


Dessert choices were limited - creme brulee or panna cotta (both vanilla).  Meh to both, but the panna cotta also had a strange texture - more yogurt-y than pudding-y.

Went here last night after hearing so many good things about it (mostly from fellow Yelpers like yourselves).  The fact that pizza was featured was a plus, because I can't not eat pizza if given the option.  I also knew about the great wine selection here.  What I hadn't realized prior (but should have; I've passed by enough times) is that McNulty's Bier Markt (a Belgian beer bar) is the other half of this place, and that they feature their entire beer menu as well.  HELLO!  Wonderful.

I know absolutely nothing about architecture or design, so I will refrain from making any technical comments about the decor, but I LOVED it.  I really liked that there were a ton of different rooms, each with a different feel.  It seemed more open and airy in the front, and more warm and cozy toward the back.  We sat right across from the kitchen which we always think is fun because then we can see all the food coming out.  I also loved how the tables were set up in a low-key, but thoughtful way: a wine glass filled with extra water; a baby carafe of olive oil; little tin buckets holding paper towel napkins and silverware, and a brown-paper sack of rolls.  So cool.  We almost missed the rolls and weren't sure if the water was actually more olive oil because it was in a dark green bottle, but we liked how we had to sort of investigate more closely to find out.  (Good thing we didn't pour water all over our bread.)

I was in a beer mood, and went for the Avery White Rascal (it's sort of a blessing in disguise that the Blue Moon was kicked, because it gave me a chance to try a new beer).  My husband, over the course of our meal, tried three different beers, all of which came in delightfully awesome glasses of various heights and shapes.  Like they should. I love that!  He got an Oktoberfest, a beer that tasted like cherries, and the last one whose name I actually remember because it was so weird: Gulden Draak (10.5% alchohol!). 

But wait, the food!  I can't even explain to you the happiness I felt from start to finish.  Let me try.

-Meat Plate (Small): My husband had this, and it looked great, but I am not a meat plate type of gal.
-House Salad: Looked appetizing, tasted very good, although would have preferred a little more variety in the greens.  Nicely dressed, very light, with parmesan on top.
-STEAK FRIES.  Are you KIDDING ME?!??!?  I haven't had fries this good since....since.........get the point?  Thick sprigs of rosemary and whole crushed cloves of garlic tossed in.  The fries are served with a traditional paper cone on the plate (made from a menu) with ketchup and three different mayos: garlic aioli, curry, and chili.  The rosemary was intoxicating.  I have never had better fries.  Seriously!  They have single portions, but when you get them for the table, they call them ""Super Frites,"" which conjured up Rick James and therefore made me laugh.

-Pizza: We ordered only one, thank god, because after those fries (which were a meal in and of themselves) I couldn't eat much more.  We got the wild mushroom, which came with pancetta and thyme.  So crisp, just the right amount of cheese and oil....so good!

For dessert we got the ice cream sampler (very steep at $9; we didn't expect to only get 4 teeeny-weensy scoops).  I'd avoid this when the rest of the desserts were only $5.  Still, the ice cream flavors (root beer, salted caramel, smoked chocolate w/marshmallows, and goat cheese w/cherries) were innovative and delicious.

The fact that we ate like pigs, got 5 drinks between the two of us, AND had dessert was sooo worth the price tag of $72.  At any ""fancy"" place, we would have definitely been paying well over a hundred bucks.

We thought it was closed for good but apparently they were just renovating.  Funny, because the restaurant is definitely not shiny and new by any stretch.  It is bright green however!

At any rate, today we sat on the patio and ordered so me bruschetta to share, which was truly delicious.  Then we each had the veal parm panini with Caesar salad on the side.  The sandwiches were well made and tasted great.  The Caesar was a bit of a disaster, not mixed well at all, with stale croutons (is that even possible?) and randomly placed globs of dressing.  Oh well, you win some, you lose some!

The service... The waitress seemed quite disinterested in her job, and wasn't too quick to please.  One person at our table asked for a Shirley temple and was told that it couldn't be made but san pelligrino would be their closest substitute... Not so close.  We also asked for some extra sauce on one of the sandwiches and she made it seem like that request would be hard to fulfil.

After a combination of a mono-rail excursion, then a little bit of street hiking (shout out to Eugene L) along with good ol' fashioned Casino hopping, we arrived at the fancy-hip casual dining of Holstein's. Was it worth the trip? Eh not so much...

The Urth Burger itself was quite tasty. It had the faint flavor of a Thanksgiving Day stuffing. I actually liked it by itself. Unfortunately the thick bun, and toppings overwhelmed the flavor of the main ingredient. It's not bad by any means, it's just nothing special.

The thick cut fries that came with it were very good. Crisp & well seasoned, you can't ask for much more in a deep fried slice of potato. Unfortunately the Sweet Potato Fries that we ordered on the side came out cold as if they had been sitting out until we ordered them. 

When our waitress was asked to replace them with a fresh order, all service was halted to our table after she brought out a much better tasting fresh batch. She refilled the water glasses at the table next to us, while leaving mine nearly empty. She didn't offer to refill it until she brought the check at the end of the meal. By then we were ready to go.

With a mediocre burger, piss poor service, and lack of a Vegan shake (No more Guava Float according to the waitress) to match the tasty looking alcoholic milkshakes that piqued my interest, I would rather hop on The Deuce to find better Vegan options elsewhere.",2013-03-19 14:38:56

We came on a week day afternoon, before it got too hot, and sat on the patio. The venue is small but cool and we will definitely come again. 

I had the Bear and my daughter had the Lady. We ordered two sides of the fried pickles but the server shared that the restaurant serving size was larger than that of the food truck so we changed to one order to share (kudos to the server!). 

Sadly, our food did not live up to our experiences with the food truck. Perhaps it was an off day or the hour (late afternoon, between typical lunch and dinner). We both though the flatbread in our dogs was dry and tough and wondered if it had been sitting out. Likewise the fried pickles were off a little and not as crunch nor tart as those we get from the food truck. I am a huge fan of the local beer and they had a good selection and mine was fresh and cold. 

We have gone to the food truck a number of times since visiting the Sit and Stay location and have continued to be thrilled with the food from the food truck.

We would have been much better off driving a little further to Joyride instead.

We should have known things would be bad when we arrived to an almost empty dining room 8pm on a Saturday night. It was just us and a guy sitting at the bar. Three staff members sat at a nearby table chatting it up while they were doing some prep work.

Our waitress was sweet and earnest, and she definitely kept this from being a one star review. My paloma cocktail was completely unremarkable, but my husband thought his whiskey cocktail was decent. The food was totally disappointing though. The street corn tasted like it came straight from the can or freezer which likely explains all the accumulated fluid at the bottom of the dish. The jicama and watermelon salad was pretty flavorless. At least it came out quickly. My cucumber and avocado torta didn't have any cucumber and just a few pieces of under-ripe avocado. It also had some tomato, onion and mayo but that was it! I can't believe they didn't put any queso fresco or jalapeno on the torta. Needless to say, I've had much better tortas for half the price ($9). My husband got the $16 steak entree which he thought was way too citrusy. The beans and rice on the side weren't even as good as what we  make at home.

Meal came with complementary bread. No butter for some reason but still tasted good.

For appetizer got the lobster poutine $13.95 - didn't really like the taste at first but it grew on me and there was a healthy portion of lobster meat which made me happy.

Prime rib dip with mash potato $15.95 - looked small but by the time I finished the complementary bread and lobster poutine and this sandwich I was quite full. Good portion of meat. The dip was pretty good but definitely had better dip sauce before. 

Lunch special sandwich and soup of the day $12.95 - basically a BBQ sauce sliced beef sandwich and creme of mushroom soup. BBQ sauce was a bit sweet and once again a good portion of meat. The soup was really good but got a bit boring towards the end. Maybe I was feeling too full.

It was definitely the perfect amount of soup especially for the semi-high price tag of $6.95. It was essentially three medium-sized matzo balls, vegetable broth with small bits of carrot and celery. The vegetables were nice and crunchy, not soft and overcooked. The matzo balls were really good and held their shape well, they didn't fall apart easily.

I also like that they have a menu with more than just the basic bar food and pizza and everything is fairly priced as opposed to jacking up the cost simply for being at the movies. 

The place is well kept never been into a movie and it not have been cleaned really well from its previous screening. The service is great there's multiple servers for each theatre and if you light up your service button someone comes right away. There's parking available in the parking deck below its not free however SMG will validate your ticket so you don't have to pay for parking but don't be like me and leave it in the car. It's also easily accessible from the parking deck with an elevator that takes you to literally the front door of the theatre. 

The only thing that frustrated me was that I had some groupons that expired and you are allowed to always use them for the price you actually paid for them. They stated that they couldn't accept them since they couldn't locate the barcode when it was scanned and didn't offer any suggestion for it granted I'm not sure if this is a groupon issue or an SMG issue and I'll have to look into it I suppose.

The South Hall is the newest wing and there is the monorail station right outside of it across the parking lot. Most of this convention center has been maintained well, is fairly clean, but lacks any charactor, or updated amenities. Kind of bland which is the opposite of what Vegas is. At times I have sweated my ass off in here, and at others I have been chilly. You never know with this place.

The food choices range from lame to mediocre. For the crowds that accumulate at these events it just seems as if there are just not enough food options. The Starbucks is always a long line. The food court is always packed for lunch and the selections are not the greatest. The normal food stands around each hall pretty much suck. There never seems to be enough seating for everyone. Also, everything is way over priced. A bottle of water is $3.  With a sandwich it is usually around $13. What a joke. A good idea is to walk over to the Hilton and grab lunch at their cafe / restaurant there.

It is easy to get to by the monorail, and most events have shuttle buses running to the hotels, so avoid the long lines waiting for costly cabs. Most of the biggest trade shows come here as it is a facility able to handle them with large amounts of attendees. Overall, it's a decent convention center in a fun city to attend a trade show.",2011-09-26 01:45:53

I've been frequenting the Food Truck Fridays for lunch at Phoenix Public Market recently and finally made it back around to sample another Short Leash Dog. Originally, I tried the Beer Hot sausage, Aiko style (mango chutney and other goodies) and was blown away. I now know this is the real deal since I tried the Bratwurst Sausage with swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island Dressing... also crazy delicious! While not a traditional German emulsified weisswurst, these brats from Schreiner's deliver on taste.

Can't say I'm too crazy about the Corn Pups. Couldn't really detect the jalapeño and cheese too much and I prefer a sweeter corn meal batter to counteract the tartness of yellow mustard. But do try the deep fried pickles if you get a chance. They have a great crunch... and (surprise!) they're sweet pickles, not dill!

They were out of Loyalty cards, so I'll have to pick one up next time and have them add these to the account.

It is also a good location to read books to your kids, and sometimes, other people's kids.  There are lots of events.  It's as if they are promoting reading, and not just so that you buy their books.  There are events for kids, events for adults, and lots and lots of book club meetings.

They are currently offering a well-curated selection of cheeses (lots of bloomy rinds at the moment), a rotating selection of fresh meats (chicken, pork, lamb and beef) and sausages, cured meats and daily lunch specials. There are some other things for purchase, but like Liz B said, the pickings are slim.  

I chatted with one of the collective owners for a bit and learned that they are waiting on a license from the USDA to offer canned goods such as pickles and jams as well as a license to sell beer and wine. They also are very willing to work with the customer for custom meat orders because they're butchering whole animals.  As far as I know, that is pretty unique to the downtown/near east side. 

Even without the full smattering of offerings, the store seems very promising.  The meat prices are reasonable (certainly cheaper than Whole Foods and about the same as Willy Co-op), the selection - though small - is well thought out, and Underground makes some tasty eats.

Happy hour is from 4-7 but for locals it's all night long.  Happy hour includes buy one get one free drinks (same drink) and half off appetizers. 

Our waitress was really nice and got our multiple drinks and food orders. As a group we got the dirty martini, aloha Felicia, Moscow mule, lychee martini, old fashion, Manhattan,and angry cucumber. For food we got the pizette, lollipop chicken wings, wagu beef tacos, meatball sliders, poke cones. 

The view:  5 stars. Amazing views and atmosphere. Very classy. Since the lounge is on top of the restaurant, they don't blast music which I liked so I can hear our conversations. 

Food : 3.5 stars. Better than most happy hour places but it's definitely a small portion. You probably need two or three to fill you up. The pizza is more like a tart. Chicken wings and tacos were good though!

Drinks:  4 stars. Some were really good. Some tasted funny. For example the lychee martini had no hints of lychee. The Moscow Mike could have used a little more lime. The angry cucumber was really good though. It's only for people who could tolerate spicy. 

Prices: 2 stars. At happy hour... The prices are decent. Still a little more expensive than other happy hour places but I would gladly pay for the view and atmosphere.

Great (and surprisingly fast!) service, all organic and fresh ingredients, an enormous menu with plenty of options to customize as you wish, and delicious end products!

I was immediately and politely greeted when I walked through the front door. I decided to order a Power juice and asked if I could get ginger added to the juice. The response was an enthusiastic, ""Absolutely!"". No problem with customization - AWESOME!

I'm actually a bit of a health fanatic, in philosophy if not always in practice. I've spent an awful lot of time preparing organic juices for myself, so I know what goes into it and I appreciate the ability to customize, especially with such a large ingredients list!

I was also (pleasantly!) surprised that my bill for a 12 oz. juice was only about $6 after tax. That's a whole lot of fresh, organic energy for only $6!

The juice arrived quicker than I expected and tasted really good. Not quite as heavy on the greens (spinach and kale, in this case) as I would have gone myself, but I'm always going for body-boost not flavor. The flavor of this juice could appeal to anyone.

I'm really very pleased with the total experience today here at Grabbagreen. They've got the whole Chipotle-build-your-own salad thing going on, which I LOVE; and they even bottle their juices for you fresh, if you like! (Bottled juices sell for $8 - still a deal!)

I'll definitely be back - maybe even for lunch today. I've been meaning to replace my every-morning coffee with something more energizing (and more healthy!), and I think this just might be it.

Nothing worst than waking up one morning to find your tire flat when you've only purchased the used truck not even 2 weeks prior. My husband with my little princess in tow went to Superior tire for the very first time to have them check it out. I must say from my husbands reiteration of his experience, they are aptly named Superior, because that's exactly the kind of service you get from them. They told my husband that unfortunately the tires had to be replaced and showed him exactly where the problem spots were. Since we needed special tires that they don't normally carry in store, they told my husband they were going to send a courier to pick it up at their Northwest location to speed up the process and save him the hassle as he had our daughter with him. 

Shout out to Brian (Manager) and Mark (asst. Manager) for giving us the royal treatment and Managers discount, and to all the wonderful staff of Superior tires. Kudos to all of you for going above and beyond and for running an amazing establishment that people can run to for their needs and not be pressured about getting a product or service done or stressed about being ripped off like how other places operate.

Despite the many ramen joints in Toronto, Konjiki stands out for being a Michelin star Japanese import known for its clam based broth. But does it live up to the hype? 

It's hard to miss this place even if you've never been to North York. Mostly because there's usually a line out of it at all hours. When we arrived on Saturday around 1pm, we were told the wait would be around 40 minutes to an hour (Tip: you have to put your name on the waitlist, and the waitress may or may not come outside to tell you if your table is ready). 

Luckily it was worth the wait. The interior resembled more of a bar than your typical ramen place: there was a large communal table for solo diners and a few tables along the side for groups. It was crowded, with servers running around but overall things ran very efficiently. 

I tried the Shio signature clam broth while my friend had the Shoyu which has a heavier soy sauce base. Upon the first sip I already fell in love with the light broth. It was unlike any other ramen broth I've ever had, at once light and savoury, tasting distinctly like the sea. Although their broth also uses the usual ingredients like pork and chicken, what you taste immediately is the clam. It was light and savoury, not bland at all while the shoyu was more on the heavy side (so it really depends on your taste). 

You can really tell that each bowl of ramen is made with a lot of love and care. All of the ingredients used like the bamboo shoots, mushrooms, chasu, and truffle oil really work together beautifully to create a great bowl of ramen. There have been complaints that the portion is too small but I found it comparable to most other places and was full when I finished. 

I think out of all the ramen places in Toronto, Sansotei is still my favorite but I would definitely come back to Konjiki once the hype dies down for their clam broth again and to try their take on Tonkatsu. 

Oh, by the way, egg is extra so make sure to ask for it when you order!",2018-01-21 23:52:31

I had checked out the menu online so that I didn't hold up the group, and we all wound up ordering the black bean burger ($12).

The kale chips were almost a little too crunchy since they kept falling apart when I'd pick them up, but they were tasty; however, I didn't get a BBQ flavor. The fingerling potatoes were grilled in olive oil and garlic - yum! The cucumber water was also a nice surprise and very refreshing.

Our waiter was attentive but seemingly a little peeved about their flatbreads - when we asked about the spinach artichoke flatbread, he gave us a monologue about how their flatbreads aren't really flatbreads since the bread is too thick, blah blah blah. Um, okay.

Saddle Mountain was a worthy stop with a standard selection of no frills, solid beer. We also enjoyed some juicy burgers to fuel the drink train.

This location is the first micro brewery in Goodyear in which the owners, Jacob and Laura Hansen, had to go through a long, painstaking process of changing the city ordinances to allow the production of beer. Open for just over two years, you'll see indoor and outdoor seating, servers that have a pin up look, and pictures on the walls that show the owner's love of planes. The affection of planes is so great that his line of craft beers is named after a World War II plane, the Traildragger.

The beer list the day we were there consisted eight of their standard beers and three seasonals. A flight of six beers of your choice will cost $9. Beers ranged from a strawberry blonde to an imperial red called 300 FT Steve. This beer definitely stood out with an IBU of 90 and and ABV of 7.5. It started out surprisingly sweet, then had a very strong hoppy finish but it didn't linger for days. If we would have hung around, I would have enjoyed a full beer of this flavor. But whatever your style of preference, Saddle Mountain has it  and I'm sure you'd pleased with their take.

The food menu consists of a starters which includes a brewers board, pizza, salads, sandwiches, and skillets. Pairing suggestions are given with each entree. We each enjoyed a burger and I had a little sweat on my brow from the fire burger. The burgers aren't cheap with my brother's bison burger topping out at $16.50.

Service was satisfactory and our server did well as she was bum rushed with tables of mostly Indians fans trying to get some lunch before the game. Total for the flights and burgers was $53.

The trouble is consistency... you are never quite sure what day it'll be until you have ordered your food.  At times the food is very good and fresh tasting, but at other times (like last night), it tastes a bit ""old"" and reheated.  This is especially true with their chicken and pork dishes.  Nothing like the distinct flavor of microwave tasting reheated chicken in breading.  I'm not saying that is what they do, but that is how it tastes to me from time to time.  The people are nice and it seems to be a nice family run business, but I can't say it wouldn't be a regular stop for our family if it were any further away.  If they could simply figure out how to keep the food (chicken and pork) tasting fresh and not reheated on a day to day basis, I know we would go more often.",2017-03-27 15:49:01

It's VERY busy and the waiting area is quite cramped. One star on the review is purely because they have a huge menu. There is a menu for drinks and desserts and another for entree. Despite MABU being a dessert place (I hadn't actually known this) there are many good options including small personal hotpot and hot sizzling rice plate. 

It's a bit pricey for the portions given: $16.99+ for a personal hotpot with only hot sauce on the side and no noodles or rice (it does come with clear vermicelli noodles which are not filling). It's of note that the menu pictures do not look like what comes to your table. Both items we ordered did not look like the picture, but thankfully they taste OK.  The average quality of food is accompanied by pretty attentive waiters - something that's hard to come by in a busy asian restaurant.

The decor is unexpected - rustic wooden tables and a fancy lit bar on the side.  There's a wall painting of Jiufen on one end which adds a nice touch.",2017-05-01 16:36:31

Costco accepted my prescription on a Monday after a 7 minute wait. During this wait I watched three techs serve three customers patiently and compassionately. The woman who helped me was knowledgeable and friendly. She corrected her initial quote to me by offering a cheaper pair but stating that the lens would be slightly heavier. I decided to splurge the extra $ 22 for my first pair of readers. Welcome to my late 40's. The glasses were ready that following Friday. The man who delivered them was super conscientious about explaining to me that there would be an adjustment period and to ease into wearing them. I was so glad that he mentioned this with such sincerity as hours later I knew what he meant. The glasses are gorgeous. They look designer; maybe they are. Who cares?!

We ordered fried mac n cheese as an appetizer and I couldn't stop eating it.

My wife ordered a fried chicken sandwich, which I tasted. It was crispy and delicious.

I ordered a mojo burger with sweet potato fries. About 30 minutes later, our food arrived. My fries were cold, but my burger was pretty warm. The patty consisted of sausage mixed with beef and it was a little tough. It was tasty though. I found myself longing for a 100% beef burger though. So next time, I'll order one.

Think fries should be in its own food group?  Perfect, you're in luck because Primanti Brothers nicely fits the bill.  I give them credit, Primanti's sandwiches have become synonymous with Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh fare.  They've done a great job promoting their little empire of eateries.  

Unless you grew up in a cave, you know the components:  your choice of meat/cheese with a layer of vinegary cole slaw and handful of fries between two generous slices of Mancini's Italian bread.

The sandwiches are OK, and they are not inexpensive, most are about seven dollars.  The slaw and fries make up over half the filling, and the bread gets soggy.  Service is consistently gruff/brusque.  I'm sorry you work in a dive, working the line and putting handfuls of slaw on sandwiches, but don't take it out on me.

If you are coming in from out of town and want a great Pittsburgh sandwich, I would not recommend Primanti's.  Go to Tessaro's or the Smallman Street Deli or the Thin Man Sandwich.  Less hype and much better sandwiches.",2016-06-23 01:31:22

So many memories! Evil Jungle Prince, eating beside Ja-Rule, the time my girlfriend and I ordered 15 chilis and almost died. 

My heart broke a bit when they gentrified, cleaned up, went handheld devices and communal tables. It did. And my Salad King consumption declined as I graduated and moved on.

Coworker and I, hungry, wandering on Yonge, visited Salad King for dinner after post works drinks on a Thursday evening. Everything is shiny and modern, and I am happy to report, just as good as SK of yesteryear.

Bonus Points
- my adorable and friendly server was actually Thai. (fun right?) I got to practice my pathetic broken Thai phrases on her. 
- Thai Basil noodle 7 chilis is EXACTLY the same as it always was. Amazing.
- There were plenty of choices for my DC who does not really enjoy pan-asian cusine.
- Prices were fair. I had a meal, and took two to go for my jealous SO and friend, and my bill was $34. 
- Only Salad King gives me food as Spicy as I like it. 7 chilis was, and always has been, perfect.

""Bellwoods Brewery is a new Toronto microbrewery, retail store & café coming to 124 Ossington Ave. early in 2012. 

We intend to produce a diverse range of craft ales and fermented elixirs for both wholesale and retail customers. 

Bellwoods Brewery will also operate a small indoor picnic-style cafe in collaboration with local chefs for lovers of craft beer. We're happy to have Guy Rawlings (Brockton General, Cowbell, Black Hoof) as a friend of the brewery. Guy will be consulting on menu design and curating the first indoor picnic offering. 

Bellwoods Brewery hopes to collaborate with a number of local chefs and local food suppliers to keep the cafe offerings relevant to season, and to provide options that match well to the various brewed products we'll be creating in house.""

Until last year, it was a garage by day and an art gallery by night. This will be a patio out front.  It's cute and comfortable inside.  There is also some seating upstairs.

They served us sample of four of their beer.  The first was Bellwoods Common, a pale ale that is 5%.  This was my favourite.  Next was Farmhouse Ale, their saison that is 6%.

We were served snacks. Food will be shared plates. They are hoping to have a grill on the patio and perhaps serve jerk chicken (yum) and oysters.

The third sample was Toil & Trouble, their Belgium Double, which is 8.7%.  The last sample was Witch Shark, which is an American imperial double IPA with was 9%.  I didn't like this one at all and gave mine to Gord.  This was his favourite.

I received my burger and the plate was garnished with a few what seemed like freshly made pickle slices that were tasty. I go to take a bite of the burger. I can't bite into it because it's to wide for my mouth. I remove half the bun and I have to eat it open faced with a knife and fork. It's mighty delicious and still a big sloppy mess. The burger has a tasty caramelized outside and the inside is big with flavor. All together they made this taste like the best potsticker with dipping sauce I ever had.

The manager generously ask us to take the salad home for free but we declined. It turned out for the better because the burgers ARE VERY FILLING. Both of us were full and really couldn't eat anything else anyway.

The only other thing I'm not completely happy with is the decor. The place is nice but they have a big picture of beautiful cows in a pasture. It makes it hard to stomach beef when you gaze at the beautiful cows.

Anyways-

If they prepare the Bruce Lee and Diablo Burger the way they prepared ours was I can say they were really delicious burgers that you should be happy with.",2017-09-10 12:51:58

The diner is pretty small with intimate seating and the lounge is out of this world with the fire pit off the bar. Very cool atmosphere.

Service was a little slow-I mean they came out for drinks from the bar immediately but it was another 15 minutes before anyone stopped back by since we're NOT drinkers.

We ordered sandwiches and an appetizer since we were extremely hungry & didn't wanna wait long for them to re-invent something in the kitchen. I ordered the Gyro plate, the wife had Hot Pastrami n Rye and the boy wanted macaroni & cheese with Fruit!!

The food came out quickly, the appetizer was not what I expected but was good nonetheless.(could've used more bread & cherry tomatoes)

The Pastrami & potato Salad A+-Huge portion, great pastrami and fresh & tasty potato salad.

The gyros were great but the pita was a little dry. The Onion Rings were good but straight out of the freezer NOT handmade.

The macaroni & cheese was good, the fruit was fresh.

-_bwdpxP3FVDNmEQqwVcmQ,U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,4tiFtmGNFcvKRSPXPVT8Hw,3,4,4,4,"I only tried out alcoholic drinks and the chips and salsa the first time I went to Mercadito. There were only 5 beers on draft - I tried the Tailwagger wheat ($6), which was a-okay (but I'm no beer connoisseur). Next, I tried the Paloma Picosa ($11). The server noticed I wasn't really drinking it, and offered to take it off the tab and find me a drink I liked better. I went with his recommendation and got the Auntie Ox ($10). Ugh. The drink looked exactly the same and I didn't really like it either. Too strong and the rim was doused in whatever that Mexican Candy is called that looks like cayenne pepper. I gave up. 

My husband tried the cabernet sauvignon ($9), chardonnay ($10), and sauvignon blanc ($9.50). He didn't like ANY of them, but proceeded to drink the wine anyways lol. His statement was, ""They all taste like shit and are low quality wines"". Service was 5/5 but drinks were 2/5. Regardless, it was Industry Night and we got a whopping 50% off the bill. Yes, please. 

The second time my husband and I went was before the Dirty Derby event, which happened to land on a Tuesday, Industry Night. We were disheartened to learn the discount had dropped to 30%, but hey, that's still a pretty large discount. The prices at Mercadito are steep compared to most Mexican restaurants, so you'll want to take that into consideration as well. 

CHIPS AND SALSA ($3.50): The tray the salsa comes in is awkward, especially because they put mini spoons in it that just gets in the way. Salsas were pretty good, as were the chips. 3.5/5

CHEESE ENCHILADAS ($18): I ordered them with the guatillo red sauce. I liked the extra kick of the sauce and appreciated that it looked homemade. The entree came with a side of black beans and rice. The black beans tasted hideous, and the rice was completely bland with random chucks of avocado and carrots in it. 3/5

NACHOS ($11.50): My husband ordered these with steak, which costs an extra $3. He said they were just okay and he wasn't impressed at all. He said the meat tasted like it was low quality. He threw up later that night, so there's that too. But I don't know the inner workings of food poisoning, so who am I to say his violent vomiting could be attributed to Mercadito's??  2/5   

SERVICE: I thought our server was above average. She was nice and refilled our chips without us having to ask. She delivered the check quickly too. 4/5

ATMOSPHERE: I love the ambiance here. I like the bar area better though because it's more open and I like that it opens up to an outdoor patio. 4/5

TLDR; Great service, not cheap, mediocre food, blah drinks, Industry Tuesdays for 30% off your bill. 

Worth a Return Visit?
My husband says nay but I still want to give this place one more chance. I'd like to come by for Happy Hour and try their vegetarian tacos.

The food was pretty solid... we ordered the Pork and Cabbage Boiled Dumplings, Beef Pancake, Shang Beef Noodle Soup, and the Pork Belly Noodle Soup.

Everything seemed like it was made with great, fresh ingredients! They didn't do anything ""wrong"" per se.  Unfortunately for us, the taste was a little less flavorful for our liking. Even when dipping the dumplings in the sauce they provided, which was a nice sesame oil mixture with maybe shoyu or soy sauce.  Are we too used to super salty foods now???

I do tend to like more bland food, and my husband likes more salty food, but even for me, I thought the food was .... okay.

We liked the pork belly noodle soup better than the shang beef noodle soup, because the broth was a little more flavorful, and the fattiness of the pork belly really made the bites taste good. Also, the way the Bok Choy was cooked perfectly, they had a nice crisp to them.  

I personally liked the chewiness of the hand pulled noodles, and my husband liked the size of the hand shaved noodles. The other reviewers were correct that you should be careful biting into the beef pancakes, my husband took a bite and the juice squirted across the table onto me! Good thing I was wearing black. I suggest taking a small bite out of the skin, and then when taking the next bite making sure to close your lips over the pancake so that if it does squirt, it'll hopefully squirt into your mouth and not across the table lol.  My husband ended up using a napkin to cover his pancake so that it would squirt onto the napkin and not across the table.",2017-01-29 08:28:27

For me, one specific dish has intrigued me for a long time just because of how bizarre it sounds....their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.

I've waited a looooooong time to try their Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun.  Mainly because I guess it's a seasonal dish and it's been on and off the menu.  Last time I was Vegas, it was off the menu and I was devastated.  Like Harold and Kumar devastated when they discovered that their closest White Castle turned into a hot dog joint.

When I arrived at Comme Ca it was for a late lunch and the place was pretty much empty by then.  That's a good thing for me since it would mean that I'd get extra attention from my server.  Her name was Britney and she was awesome!  I loved how she read my mind and knew that I was there for the Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun when I said I wanted something unusually different and waited a long time to try it.

So here it is!  Duck Confit Cinnamon Bun with smoked bacon frosting, huckleberry, and Pork Belly
http://bit.ly/Vn2SCt
Was it worth the hype?  You betcha!!!  It's funny how this is listed on the menu as an appetizer.  The taste is really unique when you have the sweetness from the bun and huckleberry and then combined with the smoked and savory flavor of the duck confit, bacon frosting, and pork belly slices, you have a kaleidoscope of flavors all over your taste buds.  Despite being an appetizer, it was really rich in that whole thing can fill you up.  It's like breakfast, lunch, and dessert all in one!  This definitely ranks as one of the best things I've ever eaten on the Vegas strip.

Yeah it may be a little too premature to give Comme Ca 5 stars based off of one lunch dish, let alone an appetizer, but the whole experience with the nice view of the strip, awesome service, and enjoying one of the one of the of creative dishes I've ever eaten, it totally says 5 stars all over!

I've never been thrilled with their burgers, but then again it's been difficult for me to find anything in the US matching the quality of burgers with ""the works"" from Artarmon Seafoods (http://www.eatability.com.au/au/sydney/artarmon_seafoods/). We've been to Red Robin several times, probably for the same reason as lots of other people (we have a kid, they have balloons and kid-friendly food). I haven't had a problem with the place up until our last couple of visits. Time before last, they forgot my kid's meal completely - where we usually say that we'd prefer the kid's food out first with our appetizers if at all possible. Last time, the dude just didn't seem to care - we got our food on time and the usual ""how is everything?"" a couple of minutes later, then absolutely no attention until the bill was dropped on the table, despite our glasses emptying out pretty quick and despite them BEING empty at the time of bill droppage. When he returned to collect the ticket we had to ask for refills in to-go cups. Now, I've never done food service in my life but we all know how it works, right? Take drinks and appetizer, deliver them, take orders, deliver them, and continually scan and visit the table for refills and any additional requests as appropriate whilst smiling and at least giving the appearance of caring. There is also the potential to wring an extra dollar or two out of us for interacting with the 2-year-old and keeping knives and hot plates out of his way when setting them on the table. The guy barely missed a penny tip.

For some reason this place's quality is starting to slide. Considering the lack of food options on the far west side that's a big concern. El Paso is closed, Ritters is closed, the kebab place on Reems closed ages ago, Rio Cafe is mexican crap, Amuse Bouche charges like a wounded bull for pretentious French food (ditto Big Buddha, except their food isn't pretentious per se, just overpriced), Macayo's gave about four people from my work INCLUDING ME food poisoning, that Hawaiian place on corner of Reems and Bell actually had a waiter go M.I.A. while serving our table, Red Robin is turning to shite - lights are winking out in Surprise and I'm not pleased about it.

When the checks arrived on clipboards, we each paid our tab accordingly but there was still a mix up. Myself and a co worker were waiting for our receipt and change after our entire party had already paid and received receipts. After multiple attempts with getting my receipt and change, somehow my coworker paid my bill and I received her change, since it was too much money I was getting back, I knew it wasn't mine and reminded them of my name and order two more times and they had to research what happened, which took another ten minutes.

I made a reservation from the hotel and was greeted by a friendly waiter who took our coats and gave me a special message.  It was a hand written letter from the Chef Jerome Ferrer, I've never been given anything like that to begin a meal, I was impressed.

Looking at the menu I was a bit disappointed.  I have a mushroom allergy and could not eat most of the entrees, and I hate being a bother.  I settled on a dish called Morue which is fillet of cod, homemade tomato ketchup tapenade, potato espuma and peas emulsion.  Well I'll never say settled again....it was phenominal.

Color Me Mine executes the paint your own pottery in an excellent fashion.  The pottery choices are varied and include masks, banks, plates, tea light holders, popcorn vases, and some disney and pixar characters.  The paints are well organized and there are many colors and brushes to choose from.  What stands this place out from others is the staff.

Thankfully, the manager noticed me staring in awe and was nice enough to come over and see if I needed any help. He directed me to a rotating bin full of $5.99 and $6.99 bottles. Awesome! The wine selection is small in size, but not short on quality options at diverse price points: from $5.99 - $100.

I also took advantage of their lunch special: a grilled cheese sandwhich and a large bowl of soup for $7. You can choose the type of bread and 2 cheeses. I ordered American and cheddar cheese on honey wheat bread and added tomato. It was good. It's no Papi Queso, but it's good. 

I had the jerk chicken and black bean soup. It was delicious. In particular, the broth was AMAZING!! With every sip I felt like I was back in Jamaica. HEY MON!! Seriously, they should bottle the broth and sell it. 

I also purchased a fresh cheese Danish. My plan was to take it to work the next morning for breakfast, but it looked so inviting that I couldn't wait. I ate it after I finished my soup and it didn't disappoint. Delicious! It was so soft and fresh.

I also got the blue cheese and bacon penne pasta (clearly I shouldn't shop while I'm hungry). I ate the pasta the next day and it was great. If you like blue cheese and bacon, you can't go wrong with this dish. It's served cold with just enough mayo to coat the penne. It could function as a snack or meal.

I was planning on seeing a matinée at Desert Ridge with some girlfriends on a Sunday and we were looking for a place nearby that offered happy hour on a Sunday. Humble Pie has happy hour every day of the week. YAY!

After our movie, we drove across the street to Humble Pie. It is a wee bit smaller than I expected and a little cramped. It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the patio. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the HH prices. Bud lights for $2 and ANY other draft for 2.50. And while they don't have an extensive draft selection it is a good one. Specialty drinks were only $4. My friend and I had a cucumber gin/vodka drink that was very refreshing and delicious. My other friend had a cranberry martini. I usually don't like cranberry martinis but I tasted it and it was really good. They sprinkle cinnamon on top which I think is a fantastic touch. It tasted a bit like Christmas! 

For food we ordered 2 orders of fries and 2 happy hour pizzas, one margarita and one cheese. Their fries are to die for! They rival the garlic fries at Gordon Biersch. Smothered with garlic, Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Yum. The pizzas were pretty good. Thin crust, flavorful sauce and cheese. We ordered pretty basic pizza so I'm pretty curious about how their more adventurous pizzas taste.

So what was the damage for 4 girls with 4 drinks, 2 pizzas, and 2 orders of fries? Under $40. Such a good deal. And the staff was super nice too. You know how girls can get.

Their famous line is that takoyaki takes 20 minutes to prepare, but in reality its usually around 10 - 15 mins.

The venue can get really humid in the summer, and its small enough that it fills up quickly for lunch and dinner on some days. Also when the owner is away, the service tends to slow down.

Note: They have a combo option where you can get any dish + takosen (pretty much three takoyaki pieces) + salad / soup for $3 extra. This is much more worth than getting their takoyaki imo.",2017-08-29 17:02:23

The first time I visited about 8 months ago I got a bit tipsy on the sangria, so go easy with that stuff. The problem was that it made me forget what I had eaten.

This time I was much better about the sangria consumption, just one glass. We did three dishes between the two of us, the Tortilla, the Spinach with Garbonzo beans, and the special that night of Eggplant layers.

The Tortilla is like a Quiche of Egg with Potato and is okay. The Eggplant was very good, but the winner of all was the Spinach and Garbonzo beans.

I have just recently in the last 4 months gone vegetarian/vegan and am saddened at times by the removal of Pork from my diet. When I started in on this dish I was concerned that I was violating my culinary discipline because the taste of Pork fat was very prevalent.

The owner brought out some for me to try and I just had to order some and they were soooo good!!!! The green beans were really good. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad or the cole slaw.

I'm not going to tell you who I have dined here with because it is none of your business and get real, you are only here to hear about the food. Me, too.

Chef Marc is doing it big at his Trattoria. Fresh pasta, fresh bread, and hand picked ingredients from meat to veggies. When he talks I listen and drool a little. You can see and taste his passion with every dish. Nice touch was having Chef Marc call to confirm my reservations. 

The staff is polished and actually appearing to not hate being at work. At no point in any of my meals did we feel rushed or processed. Our waiters remembered our names and used them throughout the service. The stealth busser quietly removed used wine glasses, plates, crumbs without any sign that she had been there which is how it should be. 

The food: Oh my goodness. Every once in a while I will stumble upon a restaurant that pretty much ruins other restaurants for me. This is one of them. Now, when I crave Italian I cannot think of anywhere else I want to dine besides here. The Bolognese is complex and every chew brings a new welcoming flavor that stimulates my taste buds. The homemade breads are moist and garlicky. The fresh, homemade pasta goes down like BUTTA and doesn't leave you feeling like you just ate a bowl of Elmer's glue. The pancetta is worth every dimple it put on my thigh (shhhh). My latest love is the Limoncello cake. Nothing short of sensational. On all occasions the seafood dishes are a huge hit with the table. I wouldn't know because of my shellfish allergy. See, I am human.

I am not saying if you have traveled all around the world or lived in Italy for 100 years that you will love this place. I'm not saying that because you could still be an uppity prick with no palate.

There are TVs all around so it's a nice place to catch the game :)

Anyways we tried a small thin crust with pepperoni and jalapeno and the garlic knots and 2 hefeweisen's and the bill was around $26 without tip.  The garlic knots were a lot of food for $5.  The pizza is on the smaller side but decent.  The beers were average, nothing spectacular but not bad.

Mike our server from Maryland was very nice and quick to help us out.  When we sat down someone actually came out from the kitchen right away and asked if we wanted menus.  Maybe the service is bad when it's more busy but the other night it was great.

But today, I visited the deli for lunch after checking out their menu online. I walked in and was promptly helped, I told the girl taking orders I was between two sandwiches, a main staple on their menu and one of the daily specials. She convinced me to get the daily special and boy am I happy I did (see photo). The sandwich was called ""Spicy Turkey"". Basically it's turkey, sriracha, jalepños, banana peppers, red peppers and ghost pepper cheese. Yes, it was spicy, but also delicious! Once you order you can peruse the store and pay at the front, I went during peak lunchtime so there was a bit of a wait while the sandwich was being made, but I had nowhere to be so I did't mind.  I will definitely be back another day!",2016-04-12 17:01:48
EpbLmqTpbmv0cmNw3o55bA,Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,gMUAn6xcuE-TbY1seFw_Ww,4,39,28,36,"Presto Calzone Bakery is a tasty little gem. They offer a variety of calzones, pizzas, baked goods and have a large selection of Italian sodas. After I took a look at the menu, I decided to get some calzones to-go that I could bake at home. You can eat inside, but if you'd rather take your food home, then you can choose to either have them make your food ready to eat and pack it up for you, or they can pack up your order and then you make it at home yourself. The guy who took my order was very confused about the menu, pricing and several other things. He seemed very nice, but definitely confused. When I told him I wanted to order a couple fresh, not yet baked calzones to-go, he said I couldn't do that and that I could only order pizza for take and bake. Huh?? The menu straight up says that you can take the calzones home and bake them yourself. He said he'd ask the lady making the calzones that day if she'd do it. She gladly said she would do it and even said ordering the calzones fresh, not baked or frozen, was her preferred way of having them so that you get the calzone baked fresh and right out of the oven instead of it already being baked and reheated or frozen. Not that those ways aren't good, it's just that they have different options here at Presto Calzone Bakery to try and fit what the customer wants. 

Garlic Parmesan Calzone ($6) - The calzones are made fresh from scratch right onsite. This one has a garlic Parmesan white sauce, mushrooms, spinach and provolone. Since this was a fresh calzone, it had to be baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. They sure didn't skimp on the fillings inside. I cut into the calzone and tons of yummy stuff came oozing out, so delicious looking. I wanted a side of red sauce for an additional $1 charge, but the confused guy who took my order said I wouldn't want it because the calzone I ordered has white sauce in it. Huh? I personally don't mind a bit of both sauces, but just decided to go without since I wanted to take his suggestion. While the calzone was extremely tasty, I was glad that hubby had a goof amount of ranch with the side he got for his calzone and he shared some with me. I'd order it again and would like to try some of the other calzones they have on their menu.

Orange Ricotta Mini Loaf ($2.25) - This was very good! It tasted so fresh, which makes sense because the guy who took my order said they bake all the bakery items from scratch. 

Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25) - This cookie had a fair amount of chocolate chips, but really lacked flavor. It was very soft and the size was nice, just not something I'd personally order again. 

Lemon Cake ($3) - Wow! This tasted great! The cake had just the right amount of lemon flavor and the lemon cream cheese frosting on the top was oh so good. I'd totally order this again. 

When the guy gave me the total, it seemed way off. I asked for a receipt and he said I couldn't have one because I paid in cash and not with a debit or credit card. I thought that was very strange, but just took my order and went home. Once home, I discovered that the chocolate chip cookies I ordered were missing and looking over what I had, there was no way my total was what this guy charged me. I called the store immediately and was impressed to find out they have an option to press for speaking directly to one of the owners. I ended up speaking with one of the owners, Shane. He was near Presto Calzone Bakery, so he said he'd stop by and sort things out. He was extremely bothered by the fact that they hadn't given me my full order, but also overcharged me the amount the amount they did. He offered to drive directly to my house and refund me, but I felt that was too kind and not necessary. He said he didn't want to hold my money, so he'd like to at least meet me half way to correct the issue. I could tell Shane genuinely cared about the situation and wanted to fix it the best way he could. When I met up with Shane a short time later, he was very courteous and explained that I was indeed overcharged and he had a receipt for me with the cash that was to be refunded back to me. He also had the missing chocolate chip cookies packaged for me that was missing from my order. Shane explained that he spoke with the guy who took my order and agreed that he was indeed confused and was truly sorry for the mix-up. I appreciate the effort made by Shane and apology. 

They have seasonal fruit calzones that I'm eager to try. They use fresh fruit from nearby Gilcrease Orchard to make them, how cool! This place is out in the boonies for some, but if you have the chance to give Presto Calzone Bakery a try, do it!",2015-02-04 05:33:22

However, this location does get 5 stars for one reason -- Service!  They were very gracious in accommodating my large party.  Especially, on a free UFC fight night like they have!  Yes, free UFC here!  They went above and beyond what they had to do and they my friends; that's an A+ regardless of their food -- I'll eat your wings because you're awesome!

l8lSOwqr6gggafKia5azng,-hUgrj7Lzir3yLUYrMYQ4g,ejKXczjEkm1gzyRdblQm8w,4,0,0,0,"A bunch of my friends are vegetarians, and whenever they come into town, we go to Fresh.  There's 3 different Fresh restaurants, and they're pretty much the same wherever you go.

Being an omnivore, I don't really go out of my way to go to Fresh all the time, but it is on my list of restaurants I like to go there every once and a while.  Reason why?  Sweet potato fries.  They are AMAZING.  I think it's mostly because they bake their fries which makes them pretty good.  Add in some miso gravy and you got the best thing that's ever been in your mouth in the potato french fry family.

So word to the wise, they do have vegan stuff on the menu, but definitely nothing meat oriented.  Personally I don't really mind, but one thing that I don't like at all are the baked goods here.  I tried the cornbread once and... gah...  The cornbread here is definitely not very good.  Also, the cakes are a little bit dry because they don't put any butter and or eggs in it.  

A bunch of the years ago Fresh had a vegan cheesecake that was actually exceptional.... well, for having no cheese in it.  However, Fresh got rid of the cheesecake because they said that it didn't last very long.  Pity, I wish they still had this around.

The thing I usually get when I come here are the bowls.  Most of the time I get the macro greens.  I've had other bowls, but I kinda like this one the best.  Mostly because I can put whatever dressing I want depending on how I've feeling that day.  The other thing that I always get whenever I'm here is the marinated grilled tofu steaks.  I find them a nice contrast to the vegetables as they are a little more solid than the vegetables.

Fresh allows you to mix and match as well incase you want to ""create your own bowl"" as well as substitute your rice for soba noodles.  Personally I never usually get the soba noodles because it doesn't really remind me of soba noodles (Guess that's just me).

Another thing is that they have daily soups that they keep changing up.  I've had times where they had some pretty fantasmic soups, so if you land on a good day and the soup is to your liking you may luck out.

Fresh is one of those places that's good for everyone.  If you haven't tried vegetarian food then this is probably the best place to lure you in.  Hey, even if you have it's definitely a good place to have a good time.",2011-02-16 00:35:50

We ordered all veggie dishes, and I find that at many Indian restaurants, they kind of blend together.  Nothing really distinguishes the taste of one from the other.  In this case, the flavours were distinct and delicious.  I especially liked the dal.  Great naan too.

We were a party of 4, and two of us had a very bad experience with the food, while two of us were satisfied with the food. Matzo ball soup was good, except for the large chunks of chicken bone in it. The meat on the Jewish sliders, as well as the potato pancakes on the Jewish sliders, had WAY too much salt in them.

Regarding the hostess with the awful attitude that another reviewer mentioned, her name tag said her name was Sara, and her attitude with us was remarkably bad. The rest of my party got there a few minutes before I did. When I walked in, she just glared at me (no greeting, no ""Welcome to Chompie's"", no nothing except for the glare), so I said ""I'm meeting some people here"" and kept walking, her response was a snotty ""whatever"" as she turned her back to me. When I got to my table, the rest of my party was still talking about how rude she was to them when they arrived (we had the audacity to ask for a baby seat, and ""Sara"" was not at all pleased about having to get one). I noticed her crappy attitude with other people as she was seating them too, so she seems to be in need of going back to Hostess school (or being given the opportunity to be successful elsewhere, like a dentist's office where people already expect a painful visit).

That said, our waitress was great: good attitude, helpful, attentive. She did a great job, and her tip reflected it.

In short, I had always wondered what all the hype was with Chompie's. Half of us liked our food, so it's not all bad, and the other diners appeared to like their food, but given the bad experience I had with my food and the requirement to get past the Dread Ogre Sara before I can be granted access to the mediocre food, I'll probably stick with one of the myriad competitors in the marketplace.",2013-11-14 21:31:42

Sushi Tei also offers Lunch Specials until 3pm, even on weekends, so that's definitely an incentive for people who don't want to eat fast food, but are on-the-go!

While service isn't the definition of pleasant, it is efficient.  Your tea/water will be refilled on a regular basis and there are a few waitresses who service the dining room.  So it isn't difficult to flag someone down.

I dislike their take on some of the simpler rolls so I usually go for special rolls here but they all involve tempura and often garnished with mayo so going here is a treat for me to want to go in.

I've never waited for a table here even though it often seems quite full.  It's  a major attraction for celebrations and they will bring the staff out to sing and that can happen several times during any meal so it's not a quite evening out.

There are staff dedicated to entertainment called pocky men.  They bring pocky to the ladies and children and will try to embarrass the guys.

The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, ""How could you not order this?"" while we waited for our table.  

My friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  

Once seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)

We surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. 

But if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.

If for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand.

This is a much better situation than the poor person my friend saw pitching a tent at 11:30PM the night before. Joke's on that guy because even the people who were standing at the very very end when they opened couldn't have waited more than an hour to get in. 

We have gone on every ride, including what used to be the Bombay. From the top, it looks like the old Bombay. From the bottom it looks like kiddie crap, but this is no joke. Be warned that your suit will ride incredibly far up your bum and you will almost feel violated. Ladies, also beware that your top may fly up, so make sure to tie it tight. My son LOVES the mats & half pipe ride, neither of which move that slow.

Du4mNKZH6f8wVqxHkhommg,8zXgNCkusOHMwh5Tj_8yCQ,hTdJAjSZtHWwqqh5cCeAfA,2,4,0,0,"I haven't had Red Lobster since my first year in college. I learned there are more awesome restaurants out there than to pay $30+ dollar on entrees in a chain restaurant especially in the city. Perhaps the rest of the America is learning too which explains why Red Lobster is closing its door soon. 

After hearing the news that Red Lobster might be no more in the near future, we decided the cheddar by biscuits were enough to worth one last visit. We arrived around 9PM and although the restaurant was half empty, the manager came to the hostess and specifically requested her to make our party wait because the kitchen was backed up. So our party waited by the freezing entrance for a good 15 mins - not quite sure why they couldn't just seat us and perhaps allow us to order drinks. And when it was finally our turn  -  although my soon mother in law was in crutches hopping through the dining room and there were many available same size tables towards the front , they decided to seat us far into the back corner. (On management alone, no wonder they are closing.) 

The working environment seemed quite hostile. Our table could hear workers bickering over who should get which table and manager talking down to the servers. Our poor server seemed extremely anxious/nervous. From explaining the specials to pouring our water, he seemed very fidget-y.  

4 of the party went with the $18 four course special (soup choices of clam chowder, broccoli + cheese, minestrone, house/Caesar salad, the Habenaro fried shrimp, 2 shrimp + scallop linguine, and chicken in mushroom sauce,  dessert - 2 caramel cheese cake, (traded the last 2 desserts for 1 molten cookie a la mode), and an added side of snow crab legs. I love my share of seafood so I went with the fire grilled seafood entree (lobster tail, garlic shrimp, and scallop). 

Our basket of warm, buttery, fluffy biscuits was served soon after. They were much better than I last recalled (more herb, less salt)... And that was basically the highlight of our meal. Soups- the clam chowder and tortilla chicken were overly salted. The cheese and broccoli looked much more like a dip. Salad - thank goodness I asked for my dressing on the side, everyone else was drenched.  Entrees - should come with a warning of hypertension - what? there are other seasonings aside from salt? someone should inform the chef. $30 dollar seafood entree, I was only able to eat the roasted veggie medley, steamed broccoli, and 2 scallops. None of us could even stomach the lobster tail. Desserts -  my fiance and his brother shared the molten cookie but were quickly sweetened out. The cheesecake was your generic store bought cake. Overall a very disappointing meal. 

I guess I didn't miss out much the last 7 years; there are many many much better seafood restaurants out there. Also, I recently learned that you can actually buy the cheddar bay biscuit mix from the grocery store! Now I definitely don't see why anyone would want to dine in Red Lobster. Food? service? ambiance? it offers none of the above.",2013-12-30 21:30:25

That said, I needed to bring something dessert-y to a dinner party.  Where?  After a quick search, I learned that there is a cupcake shop close to UNLV (where I work).  Gigi's is fairly easy to find and has a lot of parking, as it's right in the huge Target complex on the NW corner of Flamingo and Maryland Parkway.

The smell of buttercream hits you as you enter the shop.  Lovely!  I chose to buy one dozen cupcakes (I decided to get one cupcake/flavour).  The cupcakes looked beautiful and the amount of buttercream was at least as high as each cupcake itself.  Not that that is a problem for ME!  (For other folks, just scrape off the buttercream tower.)  The cupcakes were all large enough to be cut into quarters, allowing partygoers to sample several flavours.  I found the cake itself to be moist and flavourful; I tried the lemon dream supreme, Texas milk chocolate, and the red velvet and all were quite good.

The cupcakes aren't cheap; you will pay $3.50/cupcake or $3/cupcake if you buy a dozen.  You can sign up for the Gigi's loyalty card and earn points for each purchase.  I did, and with my purchase of 12 cupcakes, I've already earned 36 points (50 points gets you a $5 credit).  When you register your Gigi card online, you get a bonus $5 credit.

I'm excited -- and scared! -- of this place being so close to work!!  ;)",2012-03-04 16:34:18

- Kinton 2 offers a wide range of chicken based ramen (shio, shoyu, spicy, miso)
- Can choose between thick and thin noodles
- Kinton 2 does not offer vegetable ramen (sad face)
- Kinton 2 is spacer than Kinton 1

For me, Kinton 2 just doesn't provide the familiarity and and friendliness of Kinton 1. My favourite vegetable ramen has disappeared from the menu. Although it is not a popular choice, it is definitely my must order at Kinton 1 since I often feel overwhelmed by pork chasu and pork stock. I went with my usual, spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles. The thick noodles are a tad thicker than the regular noodles at kinton 1 and is a bit chewer. The soup, in this case, was a huge disappointment. It lacked flavour and definitely was not what I'm used to at Kinton 1. 

The music is now even louder, and the service not as good... There are definitely some improving to be done.

The show was really good!  :-)

Her entrance was super cool, I don't want to give it away, so I'll plead the 5th on that junk. 
It lagged a tiny bit for a few songs and then she brought out a personable, down to Earth side, which I loved.  She walked around in the audience interacting with fans.  Brought up a few of them to sing with her ""around the campfire"" & take pictures.  She got sexy, she got hip, it really covered a good spectrum of her repertoire.  

I will say however, she seemed still very fragile and held-back a bit, but everyone who knows her story is compassionate & understanding.  Her voice wasn't as strong, but she pulled out an excellent overall show. It seemed like they cranked up the background music to overlay her singing.  But I didn't care.
I will suggest this, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan, you'll love it!!

The only thing that makes me laugh are her ""backup boy dancers"" LMAO!! These gogo dudes literally were plucked out of a gay nightclub. Not that there's ANYTHING wrong with that!!!!!!  I personally embrace that, but, they were in cowboy outfits attempting to be macho and manly.  Since most of her following are actual REAL cow-folk, I'm sure they would agree with me, it was quite comical. haha!  But then again I could be dead wrong on that....just my personal opinion.

It was very good, ENJOY :)",2013-04-11 22:01:12

Once it opened, I heard about the long lines and decided to wait until now to check them out.

My friends and I arrived around 5:15 p.m. on a Friday evening and the wait time was minimal (maybe 5 minutes max). The hostess was decent, but I was just thankful to be seated. 

Our server seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. While I can appreciate prompt service, I know when someone wants to quickly turn over a table. Regardless, our food came out promptly. We were served warm buttery biscuits, but failed to serve us their famous apple butter on the side. Two of my friends ordered the (cod) fish and chips, which included coleslaw and fries. The portions were enormous! Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak and it included three sides. I had the Old-timers breakfast - 2 eggs, 3 slices of turkey bacon, cheesy grits, and a side of the hashbrown casserole. Their idea of cheesy grits is taking plain grits and throwing some cheddar cheese on top. I mixed it myself and doctored it up with some S&P. The hashbrown casserole was extremely crunchy on top and lukewarm. Once you get past the tough top, it's rather tasty. My egg beaters were supposed to be scrambled hard with cheese, but it resembled a small omelet. My eggs were very bland too. 

We were celebrating two of our friend's birthdays and this was the first of my four pals. Their first impression of Cracker Barrel was not positive, but I assured them that this is not how they typically do things at Cracker Barrel. 

Before long, we had our checks. Our party of five were in and out in under 60 minutes.

As far as the food goes it's diner food at it's best! They have several breakfast specials, but some only run 7am-11am. On our first visit for breakfast I ordered the Veggie Omelet with hash browns and their famous biscuits and gravy! The omelet was huge, filled with cheese and veggies and cooked perfectly. My husband ordered the pork chops with over easy eggs, hash browns and the biscuits and gravy. He said the pork chop was a little over cooked, but very flavorful. He loooved the biscuits and gravy! The gravy has the perfect amount of spice. This morning we went in again for breakfast and I knew exactly what I wanted something I have on very rare occasions chicken fried steak with hash browns, over easy eggs and biscuits and gravy. OMG sooo yummy!! It was a huge meal. I had to take most of it home. The chicken fried steak was crisp, but tender in the center. My husband again ordered the pork chops and said they were cooked perfectly today!

I've been to lunch here with my mom as well. It was just as tasty as breakfast. I ordered their Turkey melt and fries. The turkey was stacked high and the bread was still toasty. My mom decided on their French dip sandwich with potato salad. The sandwich was filled with meat and the broth for dipping was perfect. My mom did say and I agree that the potato salad was way runny with mayo. Next time fries.

I really enjoy this small casino diner. You may have to wait for a table, but it's totally worth it. The servers are very friendly! If you get a chance to sit in Renae's section do. She is excellent at her job! We will be back for sure and definitely going to come for dinner.",2013-12-30 00:47:16

Upon walking in, it was pretty late in the afternoon and the dim sum carts had ended at 2pm. After a few minutes of waiting (and they weren't busy at all), we were seated and chose our selection of dim sum from the glass display. 

Our orders:
Three orders of har gow
Three orders of cheung fun
One order of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce
Total price: $29

The FOOD took some time to come out, but came hot and good sized portions. The shrimp in our dishes were plentiful and filled us up. The SERVICE from the woman serving us was very nice and went out of her way to offer extra toppings for our dim sum and kept our waters filled. Overall, I think Yum Cha is one of the better restaurants that have filled this space which seems to have a history with high turnover. 

At the end of our meal, the woman (maybe owner?) gave us a description of each dessert and I almost laughed because it felt like home when your mom makes you eat a lot of food. But in a good way.

They have a good amount of choices that you can have hot, blended, or over ice.  They have milk substitutes such as coconut milk, almond milk, hemp milk, and soy milk.  They also have smoothies and teas.

:Old Montreal: 

If Hughes' restaurants were women, Garde would be a red-lipped blonde wearing a Mackage leather jacket toting a Louis Vuitton; Le Bremner would be the fresh-faced brunette in skinny jeans, holding a Chanel 2.55.  It's just how I see things.

If the analogy was lost on you...I'll be more explicit: Garde is a trendy, loud and slightly chaotic hipster place, while Bremner is more of a reclusive bistro with a classy but comfortable feel.  Both play groovy tunes.  Both have cute guys, although Bremner's staff had more personality, which makes you want to stay a while and flirt a little.

If you recall, I didn't LOVE Garde, I liked her.

I LOVED Bremner.  Stop here if you wish, but for you inquiring minds, keep reading.

Yes, I saw Hughes. That's right, he works his line. It was a nice surprise because I can count the number of times I've actually seen celebrity chefs in their restaurant, working, tasting, and schmoozing. Two. Chuck was the second.

Bremner opened in July and it's still bustling. Noteworthy mentions include the terrasse.  I took a quite peek during a bathroom break, and it's gorgeous. The cocktails, mixology wonders not bar mixes, were amazing. (Specifically the pampelmouse one, or O-juice, if you will.  It was a balanced mix of vodka, sake, mint, fresh grapefruit and some other stuff.  It was O good, it was addictive.)

The menu is divided into seven categories: Chilled Items, From Outside, Bread & Cheese, From the Stovetop, From the Broiler, Vegetables, and Dessert. Order, as you wish. 

My sister and I started with the kimchi snow crab because its reputation preceded our visit. Now, you should know that we are kimchi experts. So we were both pleasantly surprised that this dish wasn't a wishy-washy fusion concoction of pickled cabbage and spices calling itself kimchi. The flavours were actually reminiscent of actual kimchi. The dish was almost a perfect hit, but for the rice cracker/cookie. It was too big.  I think (emphasis on think) I know what Hughes was trying to replicate here, a Korean dish called norengie. Norengie is the rice crust at the bottom of a stone bowl pot. If you add a little water or tea it releases the rice and you eat it.  My unsolicited advice to Hughes would be to make the cracker half the thickness because conceptually I agree that the delicate snow crab needs a chewy/crunchy counterpart.  

The culinary adventure continued with lamb meatballs that were soft and meaty with rich flavours.

The spicy bass with edamame was a favourite.  It was delicate and deep - that's the only way I can describe it.  There was so much going on in my mouth and it was all wonderful.
 
Another one of my favourites was grilled asparagus with poached egg.  There was a lot going on on this plate and I liked it.  Together it worked.  Separate, not so sure.  It was a bit like a mishmash song on Glee - unexpected harmony.

Dinner, however, ended on a sad note. Doughnuts were implicated (I am aware I have a problem with doughnuts.  I'm in the contemplation stage of seeking help).

Due to my obsession with doughnuts, you can only imagine how crushed I was to learn they sold out.  My poor sister, I whined about it for a good ten minutes, and pouted for another five.  Then, after letting out le sigh of tout sighs. I got over it and resolved to go back on my next visit.

Dessert: they have the best honey toast in town, it is little pricey, but I think it worth the price. The green tea crepe cake is very good in here too; they will give you extra green tea sauce and green tea powder on top of the cake.

He loves Bucca Di Pepo, and every second rate buffet in town, that gives him free or half priced food, and in his case, someone else was buying.

I had to see for myself. I can only sum it up one way;

On Anthony Bourdain's programs, he always tastes the food and then raves how good it is. If he has nothing good to say, he just doesn't say it. He talked with Mayor Goodman about the ""old days"" of Las Vegas, and did not say one thing about the food.

I make appointments in advance and came in a day early, it didn't seem like they could squeeze me in so I came back on the actual day of my appointment and the woman that usually does my nails, who I booked my appointment with, was busy. I had someone else do my pedicure and while the staff was really apologetic, that's still annoying. What's the point in me making an appointment if you're not going to honor it? The manager was the one who offered to have someone else complete my pedicure and then almost seemed surprise that I accepted his offer.

And for my money, there's no better place to get a delicious, grocery store apple pie than Aj's.

However, here's a useful tip should you decide to try one.

1. Never buy the large pie. 
I've found the apple / crust ratio is less than optimal with its bottom crust often soggy and the apples too few. 

2. The small pie, (app 6"") features a thoroughly cooked crust along with a high apple content. Perfect for two people. But you'll need more than one. 

3. Buy three. 
One for your dinner. Since all you ate was a lousy bean burrito. 
The other for around midnight, when you wake up and think, ""fuuuuck was that pie ever good!"", stumble into the kitchen and inhale it in one squirrel-cheek mouthful.

The third? 
That one is so your spouse (or significant other) has something to go with her coffee in the morning without your getting bitched-out. Ordinarily, I'd blame the second pie's disappearance on the kids or the dog or something.

But the dog died last year and the kids are in college.",2014-03-15 14:04:01

They offer flights if you'd like to try a few beers available on draft.  Staff is friendly and I've learned they go through a tough training process (that includes trying different kinds of beer).  I've been here a few times, most recently with a group that made arrangements ahead of time so tables would be available.  The staff at The Beer Market happily accommodated us.

There are a few cons.  It can get crowded when there's a Pirates game.  And by crowded I mean don't even try.  If you are lucky enough to score a seat at the bar or a table on Pirates home game days, don't try ordering a flight.  Depending on the beer ordered, it can also be pricey.  The bartenders will reluctantly serve you one, but they will also complain about it, too.  There's no food.

For the burger, I ordered the billionaire burger with foie gras and added lobster. Of course I would order the most expensive burger and make it even more expensive by adding lobster LOL. Regardless of the price, the burger was very flavorful and the foie gras made the burger juicier than it already was. The burgers are a nice size as well so prepare to be stuffed.

They have many spices on the rack and a freezer with more meat options.  I found the buffalo meat (pre-packaged) I was looking for in there!

I've passed this place dozens of times for the last year or so, and have always wanted to try it. It never popped into my head though when thinking of a place to eat. But, finally, when craving breakfast food last week, I remembered and stopped by. 

Still on my mission to find the best chicken fried steak in Las Vegas, I closed my menu as soon as I saw it on there. Easy choice. Upon ordering, the waitress asked me to try the homemade gravy sauce that was to be smothered on my CFS before I ordered it. She informed me that their gravy in particular contained a little but of honey and wanted to make sure I would like it before I ate my meal. How very nice ! I did indeed end up liking it, and stuck to my order. 

As far as the food went, it was pretty good. The sweetness of the gray paired well with the savoryness of the CFS. The batter was good and crispy and thin. The scrambled eggs were cooked great. Was it the best CFS I've had in Vegas so far ? Nah, but it'll go to the near top of my list.

All in all, I'd go back. I definitely want to try some other things and I can't get enough breakfast foods. Service was also great. My coffee never went below half and all the waitresses had smiles on their faces.

There is a lot of stir-fry (a staple for Chinese cuisine) so most entrees are served with chopsticks. The quinoa onion rings are to die for.  Portions are just right!! My only issue was that my entree was drenched in sauce (it was a good sauce, but it was like a soup near the end).  The solution, ask the waitress to tell them ""easy"" on the sauce. Second, was that I asked for some extra cilantro and was told I'd be charged an additional 50 cents for it, so I passed. The second time I went, the dish didn't even come with cilantro, so when I asked, they gave me a huge bowl (double the amount the first time). 

Facility: Noisy and crowded. I'm stilling nearly elbow to elbow with the party next to us and can definitely hear what they're talking about.  Washrooms are okay, typical of downtown. Wait time to be seated was minimal but the place was pretty packed.

Additionally, they don't only have gelato, as they also have several desserts available such as cakes, cupcakes, waffles, etc ...  J and I went out to eat dinner with his cousin, Jannie, at Grand Electric, last weekend. We decided to find a place for dessert, when Jannie recommended Dolce Gelato. The establishment was small with only a few tables, but it was bright and clean. Dolce Gelato has a ""pay first"" system, so you'd pay the cashier first, and then go to the encased glass to get your ordered gelato (don't forget the receipt).

I am starting to really love pistachio, so I was happy to see it as an option for the gelato. I ended up getting the medium 2 flavors cup ($5.50) - pistaccio sicilia and espresso. The girl behind the glass case was kind enough to offer me a taste test of their candied pistaccio (very bright green in color) as well. I thought that the candied version was decent as it was ultra sweet, but I liked the one that I got more. The pistaccio sicilia gelato was rich, creamy and full of flavor. The espresso had a good coffee flavor to it, but it didn't really go well with the pistachio sicilia when eating it at the same time. 

As for customer service, I thought that it was excellent. There were two ladies behind the counter (one on cash, and the other scooping the gelato).

To clear up a few things to express my point: 

-Long lines: this is a part of going to the airport. Get over it or deal with the several-times-longer method of surface transit
-Delays: this is another part of the airport experience. So what if it's sunny and gorgeous outside. Your flight began in Atlanta, where there are thunderstorms and tornadoes. 
-Cranky people: air travel may not be as easy as you think. In the year 2009, the questions people still ask surprise me. *Fun Fact: Did you know an E-ticket is exactly that? An ELECTRONIC ticket. Yeah, you can book travel and go to the airport with nothing but your government-issued ID and you'll get a boarding pass. You REALLY don't need anything else. Little kinks in the grand system and little things happening in people's lives can make them a bit cranky
-Uncomfortable seats: airplanes are metal tubes run by people who want to cram as many people in as possible in order to make a profit. This is a capitalist society and that's just part of it. Lower-quality seats are cheaper to purchase than plush velvet.

That and more make up the curse of air travel. Now, I will focus specifically on Southwest. They are a ""closet hub-and-spoke"" airline, as in they consider themselves point-to-point. I will admit that they do offer a fair selection of some point-to-point routes. However like all airlines they have hubs and focus cities, Phoenix being one of their hubs. This means that it is likely that if you live here, or visit here frequently, you will use it for a domestic flight. They are decent for Vegas or Southern California cities, but aren't a great option for many large cities east of Arizona, especially those with two or more commercial airports, as they typically service the most inconvenient ones for vacations, such as BWI, Dallas Love, Chicago Midway or MacArthur Islip on Long Island. 

Their flight attendants remind me of preschool teachers and it seems they get end-of-the-year bonuses for acting like clowns. They're nice and friendly, but a bit overly perky and bubbly. The unassigned seating is a fiasco and this airline more than any other American carrier seems to be the de facto family carrier. I haven't been on any other carrier that attracts as many children, and I've been on a long list from American to Continental, from Cathay Pacific to Thai, from Asiana to AirFrance. Southwest  does offer competitive rates, but you will get what you pay for, including a flying day care and mystery seat. The whole A,B,C boarding process is ridiculous, as you really have no say in where you sit. For a weekend trip to Vegas or Southern California, from Phoenix, your options are US Airways, Southwest or United Express (LAX only) and in my opinion, unless Southwest offered an unbeatable deal, I would pay a little more to take either of the other two.

I could prattle on about specific experiences, though those could happen on any airline. In short, the structure and policies of Southwest are its weakest points. I will say that it isn't the worst airline I've ever been on (Aeroflot is the absolute worst and most likely will always be the absolute worst) but I would definitely look at other options, even choosing a layover on a different carrier though Southwest might offer a non-stop option. As I said before, I would fly it again, but only if the difference in fare between it and its competition was significantly lower.",2009-05-29 03:22:32

FOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. 

DRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.

What's good: 
- The ambiance - The place is stunning, with lots of rustic and modern touches kind of mixed together.  There is a wall of bourbon and whiskey bottles behind the bar, many of which are accessed with a library ladder.  Lots to look at and enjoy at this place.   
- The service - Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.   The only criticism I had was that when several of us ordered two appetizers as our meals, her default was to serve them together.  I get it, the place is packed and you turn tables over faster that way, but I would have preferred an option and she phrased it as a ""this is what's going to happen unless you want to object"" kind of thing.   
- The variety - The menu was filled with yummy looking things that I wanted to try.   

What's so-so:  
- The food - or rather, the consistency of the food.  I ordered the Crispy Pig Wing, which was downright delicious. The bone marrow, however, was less than stellar.  Further, it was TINY.   Maybe a tablespoon of marrow on a single bone.  I honestly think that bone was just cut unevenly, because one of my companions had a bone with a much deeper groove.  She probably had at least 3 times as much marrow as I did.  They ought to know better than to serve such vastly different portions to the same table (or at all really).  The skimpy serving ruined an otherwise really tasty dish.  Both dishes also could have been a tad warmer.
- The value - I don't mind small portions at all, but some of my companions had dishes that seemed pretty skimpy for what they paid.  The burrata for example, was very small.  We had considered splitting it as an app, but I'm glad we didn't because it would have been about a bite each.   For $12 or $15 or something...can't remember the exact price, but I do recall thinking that it was outrageous once the dish appeared.

Mind you, I went yesterday, the day following the big teenage riot. The area does look very scary.  It's a rough neighborhood so be careful where you choose to park. We found close parking for $10, other places were charging $15. There was hardly any line to get in (pleasant surprise #1), we were literally inside within just a couple of minutes. Ladies do need to have their purses checked, so leave your weapons at home (half kidding).  

There may have been added security following the violent night before.  Plenty of po-po's all over the place, as well as a specific gang unit, so at no time inside the fair did I feel unsafe. While there was a good amount of people inside, we never had to wait in a line more than a couple of minutes for food, beer, rides, or bathroom (very pleasant surprise #2).  Oh, and let me touch on the bathroom-  I don't know the term for it, but it was so much nicer than a standard porta-potty, it was larger, had lights, running water sink, and get this- an air conditioner! Yes, that would be pleasant surprise #3. 

As far as the food, we had to try at least 1 fried item, and decided to go with the deep fried Reese's peanut butter cup, which was interesting. Not bad at all.  Chili cheese fries, beer, and a polish sausage dog with peppers were also on our shameful menu for the night (no judging please). 

The fun night ended with a kick-ass country concert (Justin Moore).  The admission is actually free with standard fair admission, though we bought tickets for better seating (only $20). It was well worth it, and the crowd was great. I had heard so many negative things about the fair, and am very glad we decided to come check it out for ourselves.

Although, it has a rather stark modern interior it does have a comfortable vibe. 

It may, all, in fact, be due to the baked goods in their showcase. Incredible and inviting with not only warm pastry but small, snack sized and I must say, rather adorable sandwiches. I tried the chicken sandwich and a mini apple turnover. Just enough to tide me over until dinner.

There's a multitude to choose from. It has its work cut out for it but it has managed to stick around despite places like Portland variety, Nadege and other bakery and cafes in the area. 

It's nestled a little bit away from all of them to make this a nice alternative from the rest. Worthwhile in every respect.

The fried chicken was SO flavourful I did not even need the sauce that came with it. The waffles were a jalapeno cheddar waffle that was once again, good enough to eat by itself, although it came with a side of maple syrup and hot sauce. There were some cubes of watermelon on the side, drenched in hot sauce. Great combination! The fresh cold watermelon was a really good complement to cut the rich taste from the chicken and waffle. This entire plate was such a FLAVOURBOMB! 

We also had some okra on the side. It was good, but not as phenomenal as the fried chicken and waffles.

Yes, indeed, this is by far the coolest, well made, highest quality coffee shop, that was truly needed in CLE. FINALLYYYYYY. 

So, before this, I swore by my drip coffee. I loved my intelligentsia/blue bottle drip coffees.. sad that CLE didn't have anything that measured to it.

Until Rising Star.

Tucked away in the old CLE Firehouse, Rising Star is crazy cool. You walk in, and are greeted by smells of coffee, as well as being able to view their roasters (yes, with nerdy computers and all) in the back behind them.

They have three different types of brewing machines- drip, aeropress, and vacuum pot. Me, in my normal snobby-ness, would normally get my pour over drip coffee. However, I asked them what the differences were between all the brewing techniques, and boy, did I get a scientific explanation that appealed to my nerdy side.

1.) Drip coffee (normally seen in the ""higher"" class coffee shops in NYC and LA)- the  hipster guy behind the counter claimed it gives coffee more an acidic taste, and that it's your ""normal cup of American coffee."" hahaha...normal?? Oh man, what a comment that blew my mind!

2.) Aeropress- This technique gives more of a sweeter, smoother, syrup-taste.

3.)  Vacuum Pot- a crazy looking beaker like contraption that gives a taste between aeropress and drip.

I chose the aeropress (mostly because a vacuum pot serves 2-3 ppls). I chose the great Ethiopian brew. It was crazy watching him make it- he measured out the grounds by a WEIGHT SCALE, then poured in the water, and then used a filter and aeropressed...even timing himself (yes, a timer!) with the amount that he stirred.

And WHOAAAAA, that coffee was good. Smooth, warm, giving the true description of being ""sweet, fruity, and wine flavored"". And best of all, no aftertaste! I was just super impressed how crazy SMOOTH it was.

Oh and spend a drop load of money off tickets alone then another drop for snacks and drinks. 

I personally enjoy bringing chairs, popping the trunk open to set our last row of seats into tailgating seats or laying it all down and having a bedding where the kids can slumber while watching the movie. I can change diaper on site and basically feel at home. 

It saves so much money to come here, plus, we bring our own feast so it sure makes for a fun family night out. We have never run into any problems like some of the other reviewers have experienced. We usually just bring cash because for less than 20 bucks, we can get a large popcorn and cover all our entrance fees.

If your car battery happens to die out, they offer free jumping. Some people worry about that so now you don't have to worry! Sound quality isn't an issue as it's transmitted to your car radio.

The only downfall is that if you're facing the screen that has you parked facing the casinos.. it's quite distracting because of the casino lights along with the drive in entrance lighting and signage. Helicopters do come through and it can be quite distracting for many. But seriously...it isn't that bad.

There is room for some improvement with their service, as well as the amount of rice they serve with their curry. Take-out, however, seems to have portions that are more generous. My favorites: Massaman Curry- rich flavor, not to sweet. Pad See Ew- perfectly balanced sauce. Tom Kha Gai- wonderfully balanced as well. Pad Thai- not too tangy, not too sweet.

I had lunch there today and I noticed something that disappointed me a bit. I don't know if its from the economy and cutting costs or what ,but my 1/2 sandwich, soup and a drink was $9.14 + the bread bowl had been filled with about 6 or 7 spoon fulls of soup. 

There is a time and a place for a lunch that cost $9.00 - 10.00 + and In my opinion... This isn't one of them. I know plenty of ""Deli's"" that would blow this place out of the water for less. 

Atmosphere is OK... Not much too it. Lunchtime gets very busy and can be difficult to find a spot to sit. Patio seating is available as well.

I ended up ordering an enchilada and two flautas.  They were average- nothing to write home about or to be angry about.  Just, eh, there.

Have been back twice since first visit and the food is on point. But the service is consistently incredibly slow. It doesn't matter if it's 2 people or 11 ( like we had last night for my MILs birthday). We waited 45 minutes, 45 MINUTES from being seated until we got our first cocktail. Our server was doing her best and her manager should have been helping her out. There was no apology or anything. Plan for a minimum of an hour during non peak times and more for a Saturday night. I had made a reservation for our large party and it took them 15 minutes to seat us -- no apology. What's the point of making a reservation? When I made the reservation, they knew it was my MILs birthday and said she would get a  complimentary dessert but that didn't happen. Bottom line--the food is great but I won't come back until they get their sh*t together. 

This is a cool spot and I can't wait to go back and try dinner. Breakfast was pretty good! They were really short staffed but our server hustled and really did her best. That was all I could complain about.

I had the frittata of which was good. Lots of fresh veggies, a nice sausage and cotija cheese. I'd eat cardboard if it had cotija cheese on it. While I liked the frittata, the star of the show is those rosemary brekkie potatoes!! Wow! They should make an entree with those as a base with runny eggs and some sort of gravy. That would be sassy.

The hubs had the Benedict. We came here because my SIL has been coming here and found out the chef used to be at L'Auberge de Sedona and we used to dream about their benedicts! He was not disappointed!

The child enjoyed her pancake. I had a bite and it was light and fluffy and they use real syrup so that's always a good sign. 

Good spot, will def return!",2017-01-15 15:47:50

This was the first show I've ever watched in Vegas, as well as my first Cirque du Soleil show... and I do believe it set the bar too high!

I was mesmerized... at least while I was awake.  Sadly, I had worked the night before, and was going on my 23rd waking hour -- my eyes simply closed on its own.  I think I had to have nodded off 4 times toward the end.  But this only means I can enjoy the show a second time someday, as if I was watching it for the first time!

*Nerd alert* If you're a fan of RPGs, I swear these French guys got a lot of inspiration from Final Fantasy X.  Think: lost at sea and washing ashore, to find yourself on an island with weird monsters with cutesy music int he background.

The show has a lot of ""martial arts"" influence, but those who do study it may be displeased to see how ""weak"" the fight scenes are.  This is no Jet Li movie.  If you can appreciate that they draw inspiration from martial arts to include it in their dance, then you may be less disappointed.

Oh, and if you're not in Vegas often, and don't see shows often... you might as well splurge for good seats!  You're probably never gonna see it again, so you might as well enjoy it with the best view you can afford!",2011-07-29 18:08:44

The BBQ ""pork"" buns are tasty and you won't miss the real pork. Their mushroom pastry is also delicious. They are light, crispy and oh so flavorful. It's served with a huge western salad which is a little weird, but it does compliment the dish. Other standouts include the squash soup, asparagus rice rolls and the vegetarian fun guo.

Peri Peri (or piri piri) is the portuguese name for the African Bird's Eye Chili (which on further inspection, looks nothing like a bird's eye...or a bird...or an eye...).  And consequently, Nando's is a chain hailing out of South African where Nando's Peri Peri Sauce is a local celebrity.

This particular Nando's was recommended to me by a friend.  I was expecting a Taco Bell type of establishment but was surprised at the set up.  The design is very user friendly and the staff is very polite and all smiles.  The operation works with you making an order, being provided a number and then finding a comfortable seat to await your order to be delivered to you.  A very balanced fusion of restaurant and fast food.

The menu itself seemed simple enough, focusing on chicken and level of spice you want.  Either you can have a pita or a chicken plate.  The sides range from spicy rice to fries to salad, the regular assortment found at most establishments.

To the chicken...I didn't try the pita but my friend raved about it and the portion size (filling).  I had the quarter chicken (breast) plate with fries and a salad.  The chicken looked weird from the start (see picture), like an overgrown but scrawny chicken had wandered into nando's looking for what the big fuss was about this bird's eye chili, only to end up on my plate.  

However, the chicken was great.  I got hot and like to think that over the years of force feeding myself hot chicken wings, I could handle a little spice...but that chili is HOT!  I sucked back my tears and ate my chicken, which outside of the heat has a great taste.

If you aren't big on spicy food, they have milder versions and also have some pretty good side sauces that can be applied (pictures).  

Overall, I'm a fan.  The concept is simple, the location clean and the staff is friendly.  I look forward to discovering the other locations in the west end...",2011-05-30 12:41:22

From the general appearance of the place, without the patio seating area, it has the vibe of a salon. I think it might be the lips and sparkles in the name branding, but every time I passed this place, I wrote it off as a hair salon. That changed when a friend suggested we go here for some wine and a light meal. Looking at the menu, I was a little scared. I don't know anything about wine, I have no idea how to order it--I just know that I like drinking it. Luckily, my friend helped with a bit of her knowledge and we ended up with a really tasty and refreshing bottle. Now for those bruschetta boards. WOW. The amount of food is perfect for two if you're not famished and the flavors are fantastic! Between the two times I was there, I had the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone; smoked salmon, boursin, and capers; brie, apple, and walnut; white bean and kalamata olive tapenade; and pea, feta, and mint. All were super tasty, but I have to say the brie and pea ones were my favorite. Just writing about them right now is making me want them again...

As for the service, I feel like I had two very different experiences. The first of which was not the best, so it's a good thing the food and wine are so stellar. The minute we walked up to the place, we were a little confused and ended up trapped on the patio because a server was standing in the doorway. That same server very brusquely told us to go inside...but didn't move. When we went inside and requested a patio seat, we settled in and were thankfully greeted by another server. Unfortunately, this server was a little disinterested and I think she really didn't appreciate our decision making skills or little side jokes. The second visit was a different story, with at least three servers happily tending to our table, making jokes, and engaging us.

i find it totally lame.
if you thought my organic food was bland, i'd much rather you tell me, talk to me about it so i could attempt to make it non bland for you....i wonder what you ordered?
no you have to spew negativity into the world.
curious if i was the barista that made your carmel latte???
regardless if you care enough to come back to drip i'll attempt to make you a beverage that suits your tastes.
if it was easy i guess everyone and their brother would have a cafe.

At the 12-1pm mark, the lineup was reasonable at waits of about 10-15 minutes for pairs or small groups under 4 guests. 

The food is what I think you'd expect - $16 bought me a bento box containing - 6 pieces of L.A. ribs, a small portion of tempura (one each of shrimp, squash, broccoli, and a couple others that I can't remember at the moment), a couple gyoza, a heaping bowl of rice, and a miso soup.  Our lunches also came with a freebie serving of cold tofu and four small side plates of the usual banchan (like bean sprouts and kimchi). 

L.A. ribs were tender, tempura was fried in well-maintained oil (unlike some other places where you can taste that the fry oil needs changing or that they didn't wait for it to come to temp before frying). 

Plenty of booths, seating is spacious enough to be relatively comfortable for a short stay. Decor is...ehhh, nobody's there for the view anyway.

Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix on E. Camelback Road in what seemed like the business district of Phoenix though I might be wrong on that assessment.  It just seemed the restaurant was nestled among business buildings.
Lots of available parking but do note thatme of it is either restricted (not sure why) or is valet parking.  There is a parking lot a couple of yards away from the restaurant that does offer free 2-hour parking if the parking is validated.
The restaurant will validate the parking token if you do ask as I did.  The waiter also reminded us to have it validated as well.
Interior decor is interesting as there was a large picture of a grass meadow and, if I remember correctly, a cow which I assume has something to do with the fact that the restaurant does offer burgers from grass fed cows.  Interior was also really spacious with a bar, and lots of exterior/interior lighting.  Noise level wasn't bad.  Dress is casual.
There were outdoor seating with misters which was also good. 
Seating was adequate and comfortable, and the dining areas was clean.  

Menus - both dining and drink menus were easy to read and understand.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.        

Service - on entering the restaurant, staff pleasantly greeted us, and was prompt to show up at our table to take our orders.  Even the wait time for the food wasn't bad.    

Food - I had the Zinburger itself which is a certified Angus beef, with Manchego cheese, Zinfandel braised onions, lettuce and mayo.  If you want to make the beef grass fed, it's $5 extra.  The burger tasted great -- really fresh; cooked to perfection and as I had asked -- well done; juicy; and really well seasoned.  It certainly didn't taste like your ordinary ground chuck you pick up from the supermarket.  Even the buns seemed lightly buttered and soft and fresh.  My only complaint was that the burger appeared small.  I guess I was expecting a tower of a burger...something I couldn't hold with both hands and certainly couldn't fit in my mouth.  This burger I was able to comfortably hold with both hands and was easy to fit into my mouth (-1).
The vanilla malt shake was very rich and creamy as it should, and came with a straw and spoon, though the latter wasn't needed throughout the meal.    
The sweet potato fries were fresh, warm/hot, and not soggy or limp, but actually very crispy.

It's questionable if I'll be back, though the burgers tasted great, they were kind of small (in my opinion) for the price; however, it is definitely worth checking out for yourself!",2016-09-07 00:06:37

The Graveyard Special are breakfast entrees for much cheaper prices from 12am-6am. Steak and Eggs (steggs as call by the locals) is $4.95, my coffee $2.95 =/

The service: The line is long. This is a popular steggs location. The service is friendly, but a bit disorganized. So 4 stars for service.

The food: Bleh. There were 6 of us. 6 orders of stegg medium rare. Steggs is 7oz new york steak, 2 eggs, a side of hash and toast. We received 6 different quality of steaks. 1 medium rare, 4 medium, 1 well, 1 almost rare. My steak was well and very dry. The eggs: I asked for scrambled and the waiter asked "" Do you want real eggs"". What there are fake eggs (probably egg substitutes and the like)?
Real eggs scrambled = country scramble. The hash: very typical. A little bit crispy on top, but mostly mushy. The toast: I got sour dough and I thought it was the best part of the entree. I liked my coffee though, but I was just happy to have decent coffee.

My new favorite pho place in Arizona!

My parents house is only 20 minutes away from Little Saigon in Cali so I've always had my pick of good Pho. This place is pretty darn good, beats my usual pho spot, Pho Thanh in Phoenix. The broth is very flavorful and they have a good assortment of Vietnamese dishes. Prices are standard for this area. 

Normally I get the rare beef with flank or brisket, but I got it with just flank this time. Flank was more fat than meat so not sure if I'll get this here again. Maybe they just didn't have much meat today. Last time I got the rare beef with brisket, that was tasty . Regular size bowl is plenty of food, I usually can't finish it all. Got the Banh Xeo  today and though it was very flavorful and packed with shrimp, sprouts and onions, it was undercooked in some areas :( We've ordered the spring rolls before to go and they were good. 

My favorite thing here though is their Lychee smoothie, its soooo good. They must put ice cream in it or something, its amazingly creamy and flavorful. I know they have many flavors but I always have to order this when I'm here!

The burgers (and BBQ chicken sandwiches) at The Chuck Box are DELICIOUS!  If you like burgers & can care less ambiance/atmosphere then come here.  If ambiance/atmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review & ignore the five stars.

Like I said the burgers & BBQ sandwiches are fantastic (and according to my mom and sister the hot dogs are as well...they're served cut in half on hamburger buns).  Everything is grilled to order so it all tastes fresh.  A couple things at The Chuck Box that I think get overlooked because of the burgers are the sides....particularly the fried mushrooms & zucchini.  I don't know what it, but the mushrooms in particular are to die for!  In addition there's a large condiment bar w/plenty of fixings w/anything you can think to put on a burger including ranch dressing, which is perfect for the mushrooms & zucchini.

I was SOLD on the youthberry and wild orange blossom tea blend then, and when I saw they were giving out samples of that here, I just HAD to go in a buy a cup.  They did ask if I wanted to buy some of the tea to make at home, but I mentioned to them when I did that before, I can never make it the way that it tastes in the store, so I rather just buy it already made there.

I agree, and on Thursday nights, it's all you can eat perogies here at Beaver Choice.  For one small price, you can scoop up as many pan fried and steamed perogies as you can eat.

Of course, you're not limited to the perogi feast.  They also have their regular menu--a selection of Scandanavian, Polish, and Canadian dishes, with a sprinkling of other tastes as well.  Everything is very fresh!  I recommend the schnitzel.

You don't see food like this very often.  Rest assured, when you have it here, it will be of the highest quality and served up by an ultra-friendly staff.  The owner loves what she does, and it really shows.  My wife and I are glad that we decided to start coming here.

For the price of $46 plus tax and tips total $56. We got 2 donburi, 4 bowls of ramen, 2 sides and two desserts.

Idk if it was because of groupon but they told us we only had 2 of the sides to choose from and the slices of cake was a bit tiny.

The ramen was mediocre the meat was kind of dry. The donburi was actually really bad... the rice felt like it was left over rice and the texture had harden on top but they covered it up with the meat. 

The sides we got, the potato and fried chicken. The Fried chicken was not really crunchy but the potatoes were very hot and fresh.

Asked for the desserts they were a bit smaller than what I expected but for that price I guess that's what you get. The cheesecake was very delicious but the other slice was a tangerine flavoured Millie crêpe and it tasted a bit weird.

Also we had to ask for water, the waitress wasn't too attentive. The weren't rude but just not much service provided. The seats were quite uncomfortable as there's no back rest so you couldn't put your jacket. However they did have a coat rack.

There's so many in town and each have their own preference, but Ramen Tatsu is definitely a good option.  This place serves their ramen a little differently where you can add the ingredients as you go rather than get a full ramen soup.  I ordered the spicy tonkatsu with added spicy sprouts and corn.  The base was actually quite spicy which is nice as most of the time I need to drench the soup in peppers or hot sauce to get a good kick.  The noodles were of the very thin variety and just ok.  The chasu was very good, with a nice line of fat for better flavor.  I'd say the broth was the best part of the meal with the chasu placing second.  The rest of the accompaniments were just average.  Not my favorite ramen in town but a true contender.  My entire meal was a little over $10 which is on the cheaper side for this dish.

From the reviews I had read, I knew the restaurant was about more than just sushi, and I was really impressed by the sight of the kitchen staff building a charcoal fire in the open kitchen (flames, sparks and the whole nine). The invite literature mentioned ""prime cuts of lamb and beef steak grilled over a charcoal flame"" so everyone in my party was looking forward to trying those proteins ""Robata style"".

Cold sake while I wait at the bar for my peeps to assemble? Right on. 

We were all seated at the comfortable and impressive sushi bar with a clear view of the chefs at work at their stations. Say hello to a bowl of edamame, everybody! Various things were being grilled, sliced, prepared with steam, stacked into ceramic vessels with rocks and shells and ice and other garnishes. No plate left a chef's hands without being visually attractive. 

I thought the abalone mushroom could have passed for actual abalone, and with the way it was sliced and grilled, you could fool a good portion of the public into believing that it's some sort of seafood. Especially when it's garnished with pea-sized salmon eggs. One of my group is not such a great fan of foods that once swam, so he was disappointed in the salmon eggs, salmon tataki and the diver scallops we were offered. The scallops were on the rare side, and one of us (not me) remarked that they were a lil too gooey inside for her. I didn't mind, because they were grilled and seared on the outside and dabbed with a lil bit of wasabi-lime-green apple sauce.  

There were small cubes of pork belly that were juicy and fatty and grilled perfectly with just the right amount of char on them to enhance the natural flavors of what is essentially uncured bacon. Powerful tasty.

Niman Ranch Strip Loin came my way sliced and looking a perfect medium rare. It was seasoned with a little sea salt and had a robust beef flavor and a buttery texture. I could have eaten another small plate of it, easy, and if I had really wanted to, no-seafood dude is also well-done dude so his steak was available because it wasn't done enough for him.

I was not a huge fan of the Duck Confit and Foie Gras Rice Hotpot with Perigord Truffle. In my humble opinion it did not stand up to the previous courses. It looked and tasted a bit like a hash I might make with a leftover skin-on chicken thigh and some sticky rice. It was definitely made with upscale ingredients (truffles and foie gras) but it didn't taste decadent enough to match the description.  

Perhaps the most talked about and enjoyed item were Brussels Sprouts. Described as ""Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Japanese Mustard"", they were phenomenal. The sprouts were quick fried to a crispy brown on the outside and Japanese Mustard needs to be a standard condiment everywhere.

The dessert course was an ""Orange Blossom Honey Chawanmushi w/ Strawberry & Lime Foam"". All you need to know about that is in the name, and that Chawanmushi is an egg custard and sorta like soft-serve ice cream.

I tried a Latour Chardonnay and a South African Pinotage with dinner and I'm now a fan of both.  

Service was impeccable. Their staff should train everyone else how to present and remove and refill. I enjoyed letting the chefs at Roka Akor take over and the rest of my group did as well. Except for that one guy who doesn't like seafood or anything less than well done steak. He had to stop for a hot dog at a gas station on his way home.",2013-03-19 19:06:34

Being that it is the lunch menu and which is common to some other AYCE places the menu is different for lunch than it is for dinner and the price is less as well.  Items such as sashimi, red tuna nigiri (white tuna nigiri is available), etc are not offered during lunch.  On the menu, dinner items are denoted in red so you know that those are only available at dinner.

To start off they have the offer the old way of choosing  your AYCE from the menu.  You have to use a pen and paper to say what number the item is and what quantities you want.  As usual items are told to you how many of each piece(s) per order.  Nigiri I believe were one each while some other items like the maki rolls were told to you usually in 4 or 8 pieces per order.

We both started off with a hot and sour soup.  The soup was good and I sort of missed having that soup as I hadn't had it in quite some time.  I also ordered an edamame and we each had a wakame salad.  

For hot foods we ordered tofu, sesame chicken, house rice (mix of various meats, veggies and egg), kalbi (6 bones per order, nice!), mushroom beef rolls, chicken katsu and udon soup.  All the hot foods that I had tried were very good.  The kalbi was much more generous that when I went to say Heart where we'd asked for 2 x order of kalbi and were given 2 bones.  Moon gave us 6 bones in one order.  6, not 1, 6.  

Everything is pretty detailed in the menu as to the quantities so there can't be any mistake really.  

As far as nigiri, maki and other special rolls on the menu the presentation we got for the served plates was not something I necessarily expected to see at an AYCE place.  The presentation was more your a la carte type.  The Las Vegas roll we had for instance which was a crispy inside with cream cheese (really rich) as well as salmon on the outside came on large plate with drizzle shaped like flower petals and a single salmon roe at each tip.  Seriously you don't see that in AYCE at least I never have.  The main plate we had with nigiri and maki cut also had a nice presenation to it. 

Overall the food here is above average and the prices were good for lunch.  After taxes with the 10% off our bill came out to just over 15 dollars each.  That's not bad.  Even if it was without the check in discount it would have still been less than 20 dollars.  The quality and service was well justified for the price.  

I would like to return for dinner so I can experience the whole menu.  Overall I liked this sushi experience for a lunch AYCE and I'd like to return again.

The food is good, it's a good value and the service is good as well.  All positives as far as I am concerned.",2014-12-01 17:43:35

The food was OK, and maybe in another city this would be the best resturuant in town....but Vegas has so many outstanding steakhouses, that Oscar's seems to be mediocre in comparison. My dinning companion and I both ordered the same thing, crab cake appetizer, and NY strip steak with a lobster tail. The crab cakes were good, and so was the steak. But at most high end steakhouses in Vegas, the steaks come out perfectly seasoned, where you don't need to put anything on it at all....that was not the case with Oscars (you will definitely need the salt and pepper shaker for this entree). We also had the steaks topped with mushrooms. The mushrooms were good, but they were not sautéed, so they were a little dry and lacked some seasoning. The lobster tail had a slight unusual flavor....it is hard to describe....but I would say it had a hint of woody/nutty flavor to it. As for the location and decor: We ate in the main dinning room, overlooking Fremont street (by the way, anyone who is a fan of the movie Casino will recognize this place immediately, as one of the resturuants the Robert De Niro character has a big fight with his wife at). The resturant's view is not as good as it used to be, as a large two story platform was built at the end of Fremont Street, which blocks a good portion of the resturant's view of Fremont street (I am not sure if this structure is permanent or temporary, but it definitely is a view blocking eye sore). The interior decor is nice, but nothing exceptional (certainly no where near as elegant as some of the high end resturuants on the strip). But it does have an old world Vegas charm that you may find appealing. Overall, this is a decent resturuant, but there are so many better steakhouse resturuants in Vegas (in the same price range), that Oscar's would not be my top choice.",2015-10-26 04:49:17

After a long (and sober) day at the Encore Beach Club my girls and I needed a stiff drink and some hearty food, what better place than Holsteins Shakes and Buns?! I really didn't know what to expect, my friend had found the restaurant through Yelp and I'd seen a few signs so wasn't prepared for the sheer awesome that was this restaurant. It wasn't crazy busy yet (5.00pm-ish so we'd beat the dinner crowd) so we were given a nice booth-style table in the back with no wait time whatsoever. Holsteins decor is chic meets cute- murals of cartoon cows interacting various foodstuffs like sexy pickle ladies and meat patties with eyes and limbs line the walls, sounds weird but its really cute!

The menu is pretty vast but honestly don't even try and go healthy while you're here. They are famous for their burgers and shakes so you need to order at least one (or both if you have the stomach) of these items! I could not physically stomach a huge milkshake at this point in the day but the ones coming past our table looked RIDICULOUS in the best possible way so I lived vicariously through the other tables.

To start, my table ordered Mexican Car Bombs and the Lobster Mac & Cheese for appetisers. Sadly, I could not have the latter as I am highly allergic but the Mexican Car Bombs were the absolute BEST jalapeno poppers I have ever taste in my life. I wished there were more of them as they serving they gave just didn't seem like enough deliciousness!
Both my friends got the Gold Standard Burger (one with a side of Onion Rings) and I ordered the Al Pastor. My burger was incredible! Juicy, flavourful and tender it was all the good things a burger should be. I couldn't stop eating even though I was getting incredibly full very quickly and I totally had to roll myself out of the restaurant. Also shoutout to the cocktail menu- I grabbed a 'Couples Retreat' which was super refreshing and very much what I needed after a long day at a pool party.

The milk bread served to start the meal is incredible. If you don't eat gluten, consider changing your ways if only to taste this bread. It's perfect.

Our server, Kate, was awesome. She asked us to tell her a story, got to know us on a personal level, shared info about herself, and then recommended a bunch of options with pairings. We ran down what we wanted and she divided up what would come out in waves 1 and 2 of our meal.

Wave 1: pickles (INCREDIBLE), beets (FANTASTIC), fried oyester (AMAZING), gem salad (LOVELY), beef taretare  (I'M RUNNING OUT OF ADJECTIVES HERE...), duck fat potatoes (OMG). Everything was paired with sauces and seasonings that were PERFECT.

Unfortunately a very bad storm blew through Davidson and the entire street lost power. The staff at Kindred couldn't have been more complimentary. They served sparkling wine free of charge for the inconveinence (like it was their fault!). Once they determined that the kitchen could not be turned on they politely checked us out and sadly we were on our way.

I would have given them 4 stars the first time and 2 stars after the 2nd visit. (I can't give them 5 stars because of the mimosas) 

My strongly complaint is that the food was inconsistent. The flavors were great the first time and poorly done the second time. I even tried the same dish and it didn't taste the right even though the ingredients seemed the same.  They seemed to vary the amount added to the crepe. 

For me personally, the mimosa suck. I couldn't drink the trio. It's filled with artificial flavors and if you like that... it's perfect. I expected fresh juices but that's not their fault. I think you just need to be aware of it so you can decide if it's what you want. 

Prices are very reasonable but they seem disorganized and need a better system for seating. 

They did a great job with attention to detail... The water is flavored nicely and the worked very hard on the menu.

Conceptually, it felt like I was getting a drink, mind you a well made cocktail, at a post-apocalyptic bar out of a Mad Max movie.  Since we were there the week before Halloween, the drink menu reflected the season.  I loved it!  I had the Hannibal's Revenge ($12) made with a Maison Rouge Cognac, Giffard Peche de Vigne, St. Elizabeth's Allspice Dram, Chianti falernum, orange, and garnished with candied fava beans.  It was a visually appealing, complex, yet balanced, but most importantly, insanely tasty drink!  The wife had the Dying to Go to Camp-ari (appropriately priced at $13) made with Apostole Gin, Campari, peach purée, and lemon.  Oak & Ivy's bartenders were on top of their game, making high-level, original cocktails, and providing excellent service.

Everything is overpriced normally, but much less so when it's half off. Even half off it's a bit pricey, but the view is legit incredible. Given it's 7 bucks just to go up to the top with no rides... would you rather see this crazy view of Vegas for 7 bucks, or would you rather get 2 cocktails for 17 and basically the same view? I tried the Bonsai in the Sky - it's nothing super crazy, but it is well mixed, tasty, boozy, lychee-y, and again, comes with a side of 107-story view of Vegas. 

I also tried their take on an ahi poke cone. For 15 bucks, I'd feel it was pretty overpriced. For 7.50 on happy hour, I'd call it expensive, but reasonably so- you get 6 little cones, so not cheap, but I've had that sort of thing for more, without, again, an amazing view.

Bamboo Buddha is a prime example.  Pricewise, they are great, however the food itself is hit or miss.

Guiltily, I must confess that I order from here whenever I want the cheap kind of Chinese takeout, aka, stuff that really isn't true Chinese food at all.  Think fortune cookies, and bright red sweet and sour sauce on stuff covered in fried batter.

On that count, they're pretty reliable - best chicken balls I think I've eaten in the city (as I type this, I do realize I am talking as if chicken balls are a food worthy of review and am sufficiently embarrassed).  I like the fact that they also offer egg rolls in addition to spring rolls - somewhere along the line, food snobs like me almost drove them into extinction.

Fried rice and chow mein noodles are no better than okay, and they suffer from the too many veggies (let's face it, a decision for takeout Chinese is usually not made on the basis of, ""I want something healthy""), and said veggies are cut too big (in the case of mushrooms, not at all), and sometimes taste kind of bitter.

Ok - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn't believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.  
 
The decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there. 
 
So after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That's not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there. 
 
We ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn't do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn't even that it was ""crispy"" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it's still a little chewy. 
 
The charcuterie plate never came.
 
Over the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.    
 
At the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible).
 
Not worth it.
 
Worse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I'm allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn't go for the seafood).  
 
So there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.  No reason to return, whatsoever.",2007-12-19 18:23:07

The owner came and sat with us a bit to make sure our sammies were to our liking and to tell us the history of his family business.

They apparently sell 150 pounds a month of the stuff and after one bite you'll know why. It's classic and good!

Ambiance. CLEAN! Enough with the typical dirty and less than pleasant Asian joints...Galleria is bright and clean (it bears repeating...) I am not Korean nor am I familiar with a wide variety of Korean dishes so it was interesting to come here. I find this is the TNT equivalent for Korean goods. Some items such as soy sauce and seasonings were Japanese and Galleria does carry some North American goods such as Pampers and Fillip Berrio olive oil...but the majority of products are Korean.

FYI! If you are looking for a healthy and low calorie snack, try toasted or salted seaweed. As unappetizing as that sounds, it actually fulfills my craving for something salty or crunchy...but without the fat! Most of the seaweed snacks I buy at TNT are one brand, but Galleria carries a lot. Essentially these are toasted seaweed sheets that one of my co-worker said it was what he fed his fish...(am I really selling it here?)

Galleria also carries other products (not just food) such as pots and pans, bedding, mini dresses, dishwashers (Samsung of course!) and special machines for Kimchi? There is a bakery towards the other end of the market and a ""food court"" where you can purchase prepared food items.

Because I am not familiar with most Korean goods, I probably will not be shopping here often. But it is a nice addition to this area and there is a Dragon Pearl Buffet right next to this place!",2011-05-30 18:29:06

I had to wait about 25 minutes for a table but the host was really good about keeping me updated with how soon a table would come free, which I thought was really helpful.

I ordered a glass of the house sake, an order of pork buns, and the tonkatsu ramen. The sake was fairly bland. I was told that the pork buns were award winning. I have to admit that I am always surprised to know that there is such a competition. But as such an award might suggest they were really delicious. The pork was nice and tender. And the bun went really well together with a nice hoisin sauce as well as a fresh crunch from the cucumbers. 

As for the main reason I was here, the ramen was just okay. I was hoping for a little bit of a richer broth. Instead it was a little salty. The noodles, egg, bamboo shoots, and seaweed were all fine but to me the broth is the key to ramen greatness and it came up short in that area.",2017-10-13 01:41:07

Sometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.

Postino Winecafé is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.

At the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.

As I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.

I was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.

A small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.

Snacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.

The Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.

Panini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.

The salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.

Bruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!

The Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.

This is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night.",2010-03-19 04:07:40

Many large cities in North America saw the boom in the last while based on the popularity of Sushi then Izakaya.  Ichifuku is a strong contender for top echelon ramen in MTL. Located on St Cath W there is a plethora of Asian restaurants. I decided after trying Yokato Yokabai to come test another ramen joint, so I came here.  

The first thing you notice as you enter Ichifuku is the industrial looking noodle machine at the front of the restaurant. It's a clear indication of serious intent to bring fresh ingredients and quality to the establishment. In Japan (when I visited 16 years ago) Ramen is taken seriously. It's akin to how North American carnivores (and usually men) take steakhouses seriously. The restaurant is brightly lit and clean and feeling like it was a diner in another era. 

For my lunch I went with the Tonkatsu kuro mayu soup. At $11 it's very reasonably priced. It came out piping hot a few small slices of pork, scallion half soft boiled eggs and a beautiful milky buttery garlic broth. Overall the soup was a strong 3.75/5. I did find the soup not as hearty as other ramen places. The noodles were a good texture of chewy and definitely fresh. I was a bit dissapointed as for condiments it only came with shichimi togarashi (dry chilli). It would have been nicer with fresh condiments. Go ahead and charge me $2 more the fresh condiments would be better. Overall with tax it came to $12.65. I would come back here and try another soup as they had lots of selection on the menu.

Got a seat at the counter along the window without any trouble- place was only half full.  Menu and teapot arrived quickly.

Compared to other places I've been to, Pho Cali's pho options are heavily weighted toward tripe.  It took me a good five minutes to figure out that they didn't offer a plain old beef flank bowl of pho;  closest was the #8, with flank and eye of round-- and no tripe.  Went with that, size small.

Service was quick.  Bowl was uninterestingly presented.  Broth was not too salty, and was spiced interestingly.  Lots of meat in the bowl.  Noodles were fine, but not memorable.   Ate all the bits of it, felt moderately happy.  It was tasty.

Restroom was one of the cleanest I've seen on St-Laurent.  Paper towel dispenser was inoperative, however.

Overall, a very clean joint, serving a perfectly good bowl, at a reasonable but not remarkably cheap price.  I'd gladly give them a fourth star if they'd done or cooked anything out of the ordinary, aside from keeping a clean floor and loo.

I'd say it's on par with with some of the better ramen places in Toronto but definitely not mindblowing. The tonkotsu broth is very creamy and the charsiu is thin but very flavourful and fatty. Definitely not a healthy meal. Also the broth was too salty to drink unfortunately. One more tip: they only take credit card if you spend over $10. I had to order extra charsiu and also 75 cent green onion to reach the $10 mark. Big mistake with the green onion. They put enough green onion on top to fit 4 meals probably. Yikes.

They have a great drink list with daily specials

The first thing we had was the tortilla chips with dips. The dips included guacamole (good), a spicy bean dip (very good) and a corn salsa dip (tres bien). We had the Avocado Mango Salad and the Mexican Street Corn which was very good with a Mexican Crema and a spicy ancho chili powder. If you like corn on the cob and have never had Mexican corn on the cob this is a good start.

The tacos we enjoyed included the ""In Cod We Trust"" with a deep fried piece of cod (very good), the ""Tostada de Ceviche"" with an albacore tuna (who doesn't love a good ceviche?), the Beef Cheeks (my fave) and the Pollo Loco (special of the day, very good)

We chose to forego the restaurant desserts as right next door (attached by an internal door) was their sister restaurant Sweet Jesus that serves up some special soft ice cream dishes. Save room for these.  

Note - They have a lunch special with 1 dip, 2 tacos and a dessert for $15. If you are eating alone or maybe with one other this is a great option.

While it may not have been the culinary apogee (that distinction actually goes to Picasso which is of course Julian Serrano's other restaurant located in the Bellagio), the food here was nevertheless absolutely amazing and the service was absolutely the best I've had in Las Vegas.   While it was my Birthday lunch which might cloud my vision a little, our waiter and the whole staff truly made my meal here one I shall remember fondly until the end of my days.

My wife and I walked in last Friday at around noon.   While we had no reservation, the staff greeted us kindly nevertheless and sat us near a TV, as I was following the Villanova - George Mason NCAA basketball game.  Our waiter approached us immediately and suggested we try the sangria.  It being my Birthday, I happily obliged him and I had in fact 3 of them by the time the meal was done.   Let me tell you right now the drink was crisp and very tasty and left absolutely no headache later on (something Sangria is typically notorious for in that regard)

As far as food is concerned, we started out with the Spanish Charcuterie Platter, Fried Calamari, White Ceviche and Crispy Pancetta Iberica.   Of those 4 dishes, the Fried Calamari came out on top, followed by the White Ceviche.   The Charcuterie platter was delightful too, while I must say we were not blown away by the Pork Belly (Pancetta) dish.

We followed up these dishes with 3 more tapas:  Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, the spanish chicken croquetas, and the Flat Iron Steak.   The first 2 were absolutely divine.   The third one was just so-so.

By that point, both my wife and I were absolutely stuffed.   Still, the waiter would not relent on us getting dessert, especially after he heard my wife was a Pastry Chef and it was my Birthday.   We nevertheless declined dessert, being completely full at that point.   Still, the waiter brought us a Crema Catalana on the house.   Since the dish was there, we had to eat it and indeed it was one of the best Creme Brulees (my wife's expected, of course) that I've ever had.   The dessert is served with a pineapple sorbet which is so clean and beautiful that it tastes like you are biting into an icy wedge of Hawaiian Pineapple.

Simply amazing dining experience.   The moment we were out of the restaurant, I tweeted to all the people who were attending the same conference I was that if they had no dinner plans, they should absolutely check out Julian Serrano.   I don't know if they took my advice, but this is a great restaurant and I plan on coming back here many times!",2011-03-21 22:52:52

I ordered pretty standard items - the steamed dumplings (xiao lung bao), deep fried pork noodles, and fried dumplings.

I was sadly slightly disappointed  I was looking forward to such a good meal, which turned into an ordinary ""ok"" meal. 

When it was finally time to choose what I wanted to eat, nothing really stood out to me but I figured I should try something I wouldn't normally get. Soooo I got a mini hot pot (I only eat hot pot when it's buffet style). I got the Korean style hot pot with a variety of seafood, napa cabbage, luncheon meat and ramen. It was good but definitely looked better than it tasted. 

For dessert I got the matcha cheesecake (I'm obsessed with matcha so of course I had to try it). It looked so good seeing it at everyone else's table. Aaaaand again, it looked better than it tasted. It was good but not as creamy as it had expected. 

BUT I did like their Taiwanese style popcorn chicken and grass jelly bowls! The chicken was crispy on the outside, hot/juicy on the inside and had great flavour! The grass jelly bowl was a big portion that had lots of toppings. What made it even better was the coconut milk!

I'm not typically a duck fan so that was a great surprise. The skin was crunchy and the meat very moist, not fatty at all. The bouillabaisse was our least fav dish.

No upgrade to the Executive suite! Just a regular room good 500+ square feet. Less than $200 per night, it's a very valuable deal. 

The bathroom sink = fail. When I wash my face, water blast all over the place!

- Plenty of stocked wines & Champagne but no wine glasses.
- 30 minutes in line for check in.
- No security at the elevators two time, & this trip I only stayed for a day & half!
- Now I have tried all the top 5 fine dining restos here in a month, great, but now exceed expectation compare to Bellagio restos services. 

Good thing, the broker paid for the trip! Will I come back to pay for my own, nope!

If you are a player & expect certain lever of service, you won't get it here! If you want a newest place with futuristic modern design & doesn't care much about the service,  for a rate that less than Bellagio, Wynn,  & Pallazo, stay here!",2010-05-17 03:44:42

Open kitchen, large patio dining, full bar, and well lit. I love the cool vibes here. The staff was friendly and fast. Ok, down to the food. The jerk chicken & waffles with mango was delicious. The sweet and spicy sauce works harmoniously with the savory fried chicken breast. The mango brought a little sweet and sourness to this dish. The waffles, well, waffles are never not delicious:). Dish two was shakshuka. It was perfectly cooked. Very light, and visually stunning. My favorite was the grilled pulco (grilled octopus). Cooked to perfection and perfectly flavored. This dish is on their dinner menu, but I was told that chef will accommodate if customers ask for it. 
Ok, here is what I love most about this place. Thur stay open until... wait for it... 2 am!! Yup, you heard it! This means delicious food literally in the middle of the night into early morning.

miOoyLCIVYQ8T-kvTt5ZzA,Ds5QqJe24SKTdEShqRaORA,SxqNnm4piAlFNNiBaXM0kg,4,0,0,0,"I received a random follow request on IG from Taco & Dilla Parlor and that's really the reason we decided to check them out.

LOCATION:
Right out of the gate the location is a bit tough to work with, parking is scarce and if you're not a fan of strip malls then you'll probably want to steer clear. Getting past that, inside is a lot bigger than I was expecting, there's plenty of room to sit and the decide is what you might expect from an urban, Mexican spot. Luchador paintings mixed with some religious imagery

FOOD:
in order to be sure we could provide a fair & balanced review, we waited to make sure the sample size was adequate. We ordered

*Tacos- 2 pollo, 2 carnitas, 2 shrimp 2 asada
*Dillas- Mac Daddy ( Mac & Cheese w/ Chorizo)
*Chips & Guac
*Mango Madness & a Lemonade

Here's the breakdown: Pollo tacos were a little bland. The serving was very generous but the seasoning seemed to be lacking. Carnitas were along the same lines, and little on the dry side. Still, a good crisp to them and with salt and lime, they were not bad. Shrimp was good, especially if you get some with a lite char to them. Carne Asada were by far the best tacos (which is huge) as the staple of tacos, it was important to get these right and they did a great job. Juicy and tender meat, good seasoning and just enough char. When it comes to the best thing we ordered; Mac Daddy Dilla takes the crown! This unique take on a quesadilla was packed with flavor, the Mac was cooked just right, the Chorizo was spicy and moist, the jack cheese added another layer of salt and spice that tied everything together. They do offer Dillas with all of the taco meats so if you're one that appreciates flavorful cuisine (like me) I would say that's the way to go.

VERDICT:
Taco & Dilla Parlor seems to be very much in a growing phase and like any new business it's experiencing some growing pains. However, there also seems to be a lot of potential here and with a few solid items on the menu I would definitely recommend giving them a try. I will confess that there is a lot of ""negative"" remarks in this review, but I wanted to be sure that I highlighted the positives so I'm giving them 4 stars because I really think they have the ability be great.",2018-07-08 02:04:54

We got a table near the kitchen, so it was kinda loud, but we made the most of it. We were greeted by our server, with waters as soon as we sat down. 

After reviewing the wine list, which offers a great selection of Italian wines, I had narrowed my selection down to a few, so I asked the man standing nearby, who clearly not a server, his thoughts. It turns out, Fernando is the owner.  He steered us to one of the wines, a Vietti Nebbiolo, which was outstanding.

Our server told us about the specials, including a grouper and also an Osso Buco, which both sounded great, but you need to be hungry to tackle a Buco by yourself.

We ended up going with the Tortiglioni Portobello dish and the Veal Saltimbocca.  My veal was great and I would order that again.  The veal was wrapped with prosciutto with a sage seasoning. The fresh veggies added to the dish.

Every time I go, there is something new.  Sometimes some of the flavours are extremely unusual.  Yesterday, it was balsamic-beet.  I passed on that one.  If you want to be adventurous with your selection without being THAT adventurous, try the chocolate chili pepper.  It's awesome.

I also particularly enjoy the dark chocolate orange, ameretto, tartuffo,  black licorice, banana, white chocolate coconut, and Zuppa Inglese (English trifle with sponge cake soaked in liquor).

Main entree we ordered the porterhouse to share. This steak was ginormous and cooked to proper temp despite being very thick. The garlic mashed potatoes were quite good, as well. Because we were celebrating my husband's birthday, they gave him a complimentary creme brûlée. Thought that a nice touch.

We've been coming here for over ten years, and the food and service is consistently excellent.  Not many places can live up to that kind of claim.  All of the servers we've had the pleasure of dealing with here were top notch as well.  Attentive, friendly, competent, and truly professional.  And they know how to cater to the elderly or fussy children too.  Last night, I truly enjoyed their creamy chicken dumpling soup, cheese ravioli (with very fresh tasting marinara sauce), and lemoncello dessert in a 'shot glass'.  And of course, I love the salads and breadsticks they bring to each table as well.  Nice mix of both crunchy iceberg and leafy romaine lettuce.  My only minor negative point is that they need to put much less salt on their breadsticks, which remind me of one of those street vendor pretzels that is often drenched in salt, to the point where you have to rub some off (which I do with a napkin)!


UPDATE: November 2015

My family has not been here in a while, so we decided to come back.  The food was good, our server was nice, BUT I was very dissapointed in that we did NOT get the table salad and breadsticks that we usually get when dining here!  We were sitting for about 10 minutes (maybe more), when finally we placed our order with still no salad or breadsticks brought to us!  One of the appeals (to me) of The Olive Garden is the large 'community salad' with breadsticks that they usually bring to you when you sit down (at least in the past they did).  This time, when finally ordering food, the server asked us if we wanted soup or salad, and I was a bit confused.  I said ""salad"", given the fact that one was not brought out to us, but I really wanted soup, *IF* they had done what they did in the past, and brought out the 'community salad'.  Being I did not get our large salad by the time we ordered, I went with my salad, but couldn't help thinking how cheap they got because they had, in my estimation, discontinued their large 'community salads' and breadsticks!  Bottom line:  I was very unhappy with this visit, since we did not get our large salad and breadsticks when we sat down.  The confusion that ensued made me order a salad with my meal (he eventually brought out my salad and breadsticks), even though in the past I would order a soup, having ALREADY been served our large salad for the whole table.  Now, I don't know if they are 'cutting corners' here to maximize profits or whatever, but this was a HUGE 'turn off' for me, and I think I will take my business to Brio's or Carabba's next time I want Italian food.  Olive Garden Management, if you are reading this, large table salad and breadsticks for everyone at the table was one of the appeals of dining there in the past.  I've dined at Olive Gardens in NY, NJ, CT, and OH many times in the past, but this time I was not happy.

UPDATE: January 2017

I had to take 2 stars away, because clearly the quality of their chicken in the chicken dumpling soup has gone down!  The last 2 times I was here, the chicken was rubbery and slimy like an oyster!  It didn't look or taste like quality chicken at all.  In fact, I bit into a few fatty pieces that I had to spit out!  Not sure if I want to come back any time soon.",2013-07-15 05:22:33

The cheese crisp and chimichangas served with salsa, guacamole were good. I was a bit disappointed by the mini tacos. They were okay, but not great. Seemed like something you got at Costco, dropped in the fryer and served. Not much behind them.

The service was really good. Our drinks came out quickly after each order. The food took longer though. Given the food was just appetizers, I thought the food should arrive quicker. The food took upwards of 20 minutes.

Red Square is this hip restaurant in Mandalay Bay Casino - they are known for their vodka speciality drinks - I tried one of them (can't remember the drink but it was red with sugar rimmed all around it) but it tasted like it barely had any vodka in it. 

We had the calamari (very good), tuna tartar (very tasty), and tomato salad for appetizer.  My ahi tuna entree was tasty but rather ordinary - it did not make me say anything close to ""wow, this is amazing!"". 

I do have to say that service was very responsive - one of my friends had her steak overcooked and they immediately took it back and shortly came out with another that was cooked as ordered. 

Some other menu items that were interesting but we did not order were: a selection of different caviars and a monster lobster and fruit platter which I saw another table have.

(Even though I have been here before, I do get a bit weary when I haven't been somewhere in a while.  I almost expect things to go downhill.  And last time, although the flavours were good, my dishes were quite heavy on the salt.  Very common when dining Indian.)

Meal started off with pappadums with 2 sauces (1 tamarind, 1 coriander chutney - spicy) and we ordered a Mulligatawny Soup, Chicken Mirch Tikka (came with naan), Kadai Paneer (came with rice).  

After ordering, the waiter came back to our table and said that the soup wasn't available.  However, the chief (/owner?) returned shortly, apologised, and said that he DID have the soup.  I only tasted it, but it was a nice, rich, lentil soup with coconut milk.  

What was impressive was the chief doing the rounds, greeting people as they entered, even seating patrons, and giving them menus.  I like this 'cause it showed that he was humble, didn't think he was ""too good"" to do tasks a waiter would do!

Chicken Mirch Tikka were 6 large kebab chunks of marinated goodness...straight out of the tandoor oven!  The base was a coriander and yes, it was spicy.  :)  The chicken was not only nicely presented, it was moist and not dried out.

Kadai Paneer - was a sweeter dish, good flavours, and came with lotsa chunks of paneer, not 2-3 pieces swimming in gravy like a lot of places.

A coupla groups of people did come in, asked if there was a dinner buffet, and left after they heard it was only a la carte for dinner.  (They do a nice lunch buffet for like ~$10!)  I thought this was a shame 'cause I'd rather eat a nice a la carte, than pay more $$$ to stuff myself silly with mediocre food!

If you're craving Indian in Mississauga, don't want anything too heavy or greasy, and enjoy fine dining without paying the price, Bukhara Grill is definitely a safe bet!",2013-08-07 01:27:09

As we were walking through we decided to eat at Virgils because it smelled amazing and my son loves BBQ. We went inside and was greeted by our host (forgot her name) who got us seated quickly since it was pretty dead inside. As we were sitting near the server station we over heard a server asking a question to David (got his name from the hostess) and the way he replied back to this girl baffled me. The way he answered her was just unnecessary and very condescending! The girl looked like she wanted to tear up and cry and I commend her for just bitting her tongue and walking away. As for David here's some advice for you.. just because you're a manager doesn't make you better or give you the right to speak to your employees in the way you did. Learn some manners and treat them with respect because without them you wouldn't be able to run your establishment! Anyways the food was good and our server Julie was awesome!,2017-09-11 00:07:02

The eggs, as I said before, are perfect. But, there's so much more to this place!! I finally tried the crepes and they are fantastic. While they're not traditional, they have their own flavor medleys and twists that are great for stuffed and filling crepes. The roasted portabello mushroom is so full of rich flavors that I almost couldn't finish it...almost. The smoked turkey is like a perfect lunch sandwich, crepe style. 

As far as the desserts go, don't ever not get the cupcakes. Even if you're getting something else (macaroons are delicious), you'll want a cupcake later. I promise. The red velvet is delicious, but my favorite that I can't seem to pass up now is the lemon and raspberry cupcake.

Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:

Whether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  

I've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!

I'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!

Can't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!",2008-08-23 17:03:20

Most of the wait staff are from Japan which adds an authentic touch that is missing from most AZ sushi joints. 

They also offer Asahi Super Dry from Japan in giant cans,  not that Canadian wanna-be bottled Asahi found everywhere else. Decent selection of cold Saki,  including the cloudy Nigori. Nice!

The egg roll was good, but it's a good thing that I'm not allergic to shrimp - there was not mention of shellfish in the egg roll and I assumed that it was pork. The dumplings were okay - appropriately doughy and chewy, but the dumpling sauce was also very, very bland. Finally, the chicken and broccoli was bland and slightly too sweet. Again, I threw most of it away. The portions are large, but what good is a large portion if the food is not edible? I was happy that they do have brown rice.

One star less because I found the price a bit too high. 1 corn add on is 1.25 and its only 1/3 of a corn. I kicked myself for getting it considering I found corn for 15 cents each over the weekend.... :(. I think potato is worth the add on since it's filling and they give you a full potato lol.

We got shrimp and claims with those add ons and had calamari and Cajun fries on the side. A bit too much for 2 people, could've skipped the fries. Came to 60$.

All the taco's were delish! The music was fun and the location was cool. 

The price for admission was $12 per person, all that got you was in the gate, a little obnoxious! It is cheaper to get into the fair and I am risking life and limb when I go there. They should cut the price in half; maybe $6 to get in and tacos should be no more than $1 (they were $2). The point was to try as many as you could and choose which is the best right? I need to be able to try more than 3 or 4 to make an accurate and informed choice. I gave the admin people all my money so I couldn't get all the taco's I wanted. 

The biggest flaw... the voting process. Yes, we are in a tech area, BUT not everyone has joined in just yet. Not everyone has a smart phone, and not everyone that does will take the time to down load a random ap they will never use again to vote on some stupid taco. I had a smart phone, and would download a new ap just cuz, and I did.... but finally gave up when it took me 15 minutes and still wasn't able to figure the damn thing out. Epic fail on their part for not making the process more user friendly.

Also, I understand they just opened but this wasn't really a quality issue as much as a quantity issue. However, the food or should I say the lack there of, was actually quite insulting. Charging $8+ for a small chicken finger on a bun and trying to pass it off as a chicken sandwich is downright criminal. Worse? How about $7 for a large fries. Yup... $7 for fries with no toppings or anything. Just fries. Plain fries. $7. For a portion size no bigger than you get in a large fries at McDonalds. Back to the sandwich... ordered ""The Rancher"" which states bacon & ranch dressing. Received ""0"" bacon. Also had asked for no cucumbers but they were on there. This is OK actually as I mentioned they just opened and these are kinks that need to work out... I'm OK with that. Not part of why I gave two stars... it only added to the frustration of the portion sizes and pricing.

The taste was pretty good... enjoyed the fries more than the sandwich but that also may have been out of pure anger with the size of the sandwich. Actually enjoyed the sauce options that I tried as well. The Chipolte Honey had a nice kick. 

Maybe I was over-hyped for this place? I see some folks enjoyed their meals. I felt robbed and won't be back until they fix the portion sizes.

I could not even eat the chicken in the dish. The lamb rojan josh was ok. There was way too much gravy and the flavor was very concentrated making it not very enjoyable. The tandoori platter had mixed reviews. Some items were good like the salmon but others were dry such as the chicken. At the end of our meal, we both concluded that there is much better Indian food available in Pittsburgh. Honestly, will probably not be back.",2018-02-12 22:19:19

After having almost a week to let my thoughts process, I would have to say that although the product is fresh, I wouldn't consider Cowfish a true sushi spot but an Americanized version.  I also think overall Cowfish is lost in its trendiness.

The first time we attempted to go was on a Saturday night and showed up to an hour and a half wait.  Cowfish doesn't take reservations so we decided not to wait it out.  We later showed up on a Weds night and there was still an hour wait.  We eventually managed to grab 2 seats at the bar and just made it a night there.

The items we ordered were Blackened tuna nachos, Southpark roll, and the King's Roll.  I have to say I really liked the tuna nachos, but they aren't sushi.  The King's Roll was the better of the two rolls.  I asked if they had miso soup, and sadly, they did not.  The wasabi was also the squeeze kind that is never hot enough.

The part I didn't like was it felt much more of a bar scene than a restaurant.  When I went to Nikko, I didn't downgrade them for the club atmosphere, because it really didn't interfere with the meal.  Definitely not the case here.  People were everywhere, especially hanging over me while I ate.

My parents had also attended the festival with me, they both pointed out how the monkeys enclosure hadn't been updated since their last visit 25 yrs ago. There were absolutely no trees in their enclosure & it was surrounded by a stagnant, dirty water mote. While it has a fake rock formation with tiny caves they were small & offered no protection from the sun. The monkeys themselves couldn't have looked more bored as they require high mental stimulation & had nothing to play/interact with. 
 There are many other enclosures that were just as disgusting & disappointing. Take the seal exhibit, the bottom of the aquarium was covered in algae & it was very dark. Again, seals also love to play & they too went without toys. Worst of all was the rhino enclosure, it truly broke my heart when I expected some resemblance of their natural habitat to exists & found a slaughter house like building instead.  The landscaping was also clearly not a priority as the majority of plants are dead & in bad need of some very basic pruning. 
 I comprehend how much work & money it takes to maintain one enclosure yet alone an entire zoo but you can't honestly tell me that they don't have enough money to at least upgrade one enclosure per year. Also, (when Noah's Lost Ark was still in business) there were plenty of people/companies that would gladly volunteer supplies or services; Noah's had a special section on their website to do just this. Locals would come & drop off free building materials or volunteer to build shelter for the animals. It also help keep cost down. 
 Even my own company upcycles everything we possibly can, recently using pressure treated wood from an abandoned green house to build new duck cages- it isn't hard! I'm not sure who is in charge of the zoo overall, but if you are confused about what it should be try visiting Bearizonia (this place is everything a zoo should be).",2018-09-26 02:04:43

Though I see a dedicated staff cleaning after people's tables, no amount of wiping will make this dated, grimy diner clean enough.  The tables and chairs feel sticky to the touch, the wooden chairs look like antiques, the overhead lights have dust/bugs all over, the list is endless.  Also, as I walked in today the place was very smoky to a almost hazardous amount, though i see that this is not mentioned in the other reviews.  This could be a one-off incident but I genuinely worry about the staffs' health if they work in the same smoky environment every day.

For all the reasons listed above, the prices here are cheap for what it is - a 16oz steak dinner special at $17.99 including a side of salad/fries.  (This seems to differ from previous reviews that it's supposed to be $14.99 which would have been an even better deal) Your pick up your food on a cafeteria tray.  We ordered medium rare and worried slightly that we might get sick.  In the end, quality for everything is passable - steak was fairly juicy and the fries were better than expected.

IT IS SO CUTEEEE. 

My friends and I were having way too much fun taking pictures for yelp than looking at the menu. Waitress came back a lot to ask if we were ready, which I guess is a lot better than being ignored. We got the half carafe of sangria. You had the option of red or white wine but the waitress recommended red, so we went with that! The carafe was about 5 glasses of sangria, so it's a lot more cost efficient than ordering a single glass of sangria by itself. The sangria is served in wine glasses, which i thought was kind of weird since there was a huge straw sticking out of it. But still, it was very tasty. The sangria was very sweet. I liked it!!

I ordered the eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was very tasty and rich. The English muffin was buttery and perfectly crispy. All in all, one of the best benedicts I've had in my lifetime. I also got a bite of my friends' foods. My friends ordered the fried chicken sandwich and the breakfast pizza. The fried chicken wasn't super crispy. It was slightly sweet which I didn't mind. The sandwich also came with a Caesar salad; I think the dressing also had some lemon in it because it was very bright. I liked it. The breakfast pizza was cheesy and eggy goodness.

Last night, we went, and the food was meh.  Some of us ordered off the main menu, others went with the chef's tasting.  I got fried rice with escargots as my starter, and it was underwhelming.  I prefer escargot with tons of butter, and serving an Asian person fried rice is just insulting (I'm actually kidding a bit here, but I'll admit that I'm snobby about the fried rice).  My next course was salmon on carrot puree, which was excellent, and the highlight of my meal.  Next up was wild greens, which was a good salad, but nothing special.  Last course was skirt steak on pureed celery and glazed carrots.  And that was seriously overcooked.  As my tablemate said, it tasted like beef jerky.

So, I'll admit that I feel kind of bad, since I should have just sent it back.  But, I also don't think that the onus should ever be on the customer.  It's just a bad position to be in.

From now on, I'm taking my business elsewhere.  Salt is in this same price point, and infinitely more exciting and consistent in terms of quality.",2012-02-03 18:23:34

Pros:
+Decent sushi (Las Vegas roll, Eel roll, and Alaskan roll). I personally really liked the Alaskan roll.
+Good Martini, especially the White Cosmo and Kobe Pear
+Also tried the Hoisin BBQ Ribs, omg, they were so goooooood! The meat was tasty, sauce was lightly sweet, yummmm~
+Great service

Cons:
-Music was not so good, and during our three hours, there were at least 5 songs probably repeated 3 times... really?
-A-Okay crowd around the bar. But you still hear babies crying and kids screaming from the other side.
-Not so friendly hostesses..

- Blueberry Banana Pancakes - made with an egg based crape style French recipe; not the typical over fluffy box crap. Very good but if you like ""fluffy pancakes"" this isn't for you. 
- Eggs Benedict - one of the best in the city. Not drenched in sauce like some places, instead well crafted delicate flavors. I love the smoked salmon and pickled asparagus. 
- omelets: all great!

Dinner:
- The burger is fantastic, so are the tacos, and the fries are cooked right. Ask for Sweet valentine sauce with them! It's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy but not fire hot.

It's located on the west wall depending on where you enter the casino.  Not sure why the reviews on this place are so low; yes, people smoke inside this casino, just like all casinos, but not in the restaurant, so get over it.  It's dark too, so bring a flashlight...kidding.

I've written many reviews on many great restaurants...hidden gems in Henderson/Vegas and Images is one of them.  In fact it may be better than any other bar/casino restaurant I've reviewed due to one fact: the price.  The average bill for two persons will be somewhere between $17 - $25.  It is impossible to beat this price anywhere when you add food quality in.  The food is fabulous: breakfast, lunch, dinner, you can't go wrong.  Large plates, you will be taking leftovers home and this is awesome.

This is my new haunt because of one thing: the SAUCE.  If you order bisquits and gravy, cordon blue, etc., there is a sauce they put on top of your order that can be described only by one word: HEAVEN.  You will dream of it at night.  You will want it again and again and again.  If you want to try it to make sure you like it, order a side of it and dip some fries or vegi's in it.  Amazing!

The staff is super courteous and helpful.  You can tell they know the locals and they treat everyone great.  Food delivery is quick, however this place can be busy with a line out the door, so come with patience if it's super busy.  It's worth the wait so play a game or something.

The casino is fun and you can actually win money here, unlike the Las Vegas Strip, which may pay for your dinner... a win, win.  Parking is outside along the street, there is a large parking garage in back but never parked there.

We went last night with a group of friends and my wife and I were the first two there. We put our names in for a table and then went to the bar to grab a drink.

The beer menu was crossed through all over the place with beers they no longer had, so I consulted the ""specials"" menu that was a separate flyer. Problem was that they no longer had the beer from the specials menu that I wanted. Womp womp. I ordered something else and got on with my life.

When everyone arrived we got seated quickly and (using my Yelp! check-in) got a free order of bruschetta, which was very good. The table agreed that the bread was firm enough to hold the goods, but soft enough not to slice your mouth open like bruschetta bread at most restaurants. I ended up ordering the Pacific Rim - ham, bacon, onions, pineapple, and jalapeños. So good. I devoured a couple of pieces and saved the other half for a later lunch. 

Overall the service was good, outside of the initial neglect at the bar. Food has never been a problem at this location, but they obviously need to work on the beer situation.

Ordered myself the Beef and Tendon Noodles in Soup and the Stinky Tofu. Noodles were really good, nice and tender with the soup base with a good amount of flavour. The beef and tendons were both really good. Hard to find a store that gives you quality in both those, as usually a store is lacking in one or the other. The Stinky Tofu was absolutely great. Now, you either like it or you don't, and I'm definitely a fan! Nice and crispy on the outside and warm on the inside, with a good amount of sauce and veggies on the side!

I don't mind the smell of stinky tofu, so it doesn't bother me much, but if you don't really like that smell, you may find yourself having a hard time getting yourself here. Service is great, as they were super busy for lunch, but still able to meet everyone's needs.

Come on.. it's not like you had a slew of hot dog connoisseurs in line waiting for the next big wiener.  I felt a bit embarrassed about the whole experience and upset at that so I decided to call the manager the next day. When I spoke to the Manager, he stated he had heard about the feedback and since I'm calling again, I must wanted something for free. WTF, I'm not bitching about a $10 happy hour cheese board but the fact that you have ridiciously slow service and to have that attitude when a customer calls in to let you know their experience.

Very easy to order - get in line at the counter, grab a menu, drool over the baked goods and debate over which (plural) to try, order at the register, then find your seat. Lots of communal space and everyone is willing to squeeze! The vibe is also spot on, I always feel good just sitting inside, admiring the style & decor and positive presence of the DTLV and local folk attracted there. 

Their egg dishes deserve so much praise, the brekki sandwich with avocado is easily the best egg bfast sandwich I've ever had, the brekkie burrito is AWESOME, as is the garden benedict. Avocado toast is also solid. Can't go wrong with any of their sweet options too, the waffles, for instance, had great flavor and were super crisp and unique. Only thing I was ever underwhelmed by is the oatmeal, but not sure  why I was feeling boring that day anyway. They have awesome lunch options too, great bowls, sandwiches, toasts, salads, veggie burger, etc. I can't forget to plug the coffee/tea bar too! Awesome lattes, really great quality espresso and nut milks. The mint matcha latte with cashew milk and iced oolong tea are my personal go-to's. They list a few specials by the register, try them! 

I cannot rant & rave enough about the baked goods. I've tried almost all. The scones, blueberry especially, I get every single time, period. They're delicious and so soft (due to cream cheese in batter). I also love the cinnamon roll heated up and the cookies. Go crazy. Please.

The space isn't much to look at, but the staff is friendly and efficient, the sushi is decent, and the prices reasonable. Beer and wine only.

- Greeted with two pieces of complimentary seared tuna salmon sushi while we read through the menu. I don't usually go for cooked sushi, but it was a nice gesture and actually quite good.

The rolls are large with fresh fish and pretty purple rice. If not the best I've ever had, it could be because we chose poorly.
- Harumi roll- love the crunch of tempura shrimp, stuffed with a lot of krab salad which was just ok.
- H3 roll- this was my fave- spicy tuna and salmon, avocado, cuke, topped w/ eel sauce and spicy mayo
- OMG roll- the server brings this foil wrapped package to the table and waves it over a flame a few minutes before opening. I like eel sauce, but this one was just too sweet for my taste.
- Sashimi salad- good amount of tuna and salmon tossed with cucumber, avocado, and a bit of lettuce. Next time I would ask them to go light on the eel sauce.

This is a real puzzle considering the quality of everything else.  Perhaps this is not their best item.

I am getting pretty selective as to where I bestow five stars, and Tommy V's did not have that Wow! factor that I usually want to see.  But it got straight A's in almost everything else.

Located in downtown Scottsdale, Tommy V's is a modern space with not much of an Italian look.  But it is bright, clean, not too noisy, comfortable and has a pretty good view for an ""urban"" kitchen.  The service was perfect -- quick, friendly, but not overbearing.

Everything we ate was at least pretty good, and the Pappardelle and the Cannoli were excellent.

But without anything to make you jump up and down with glee, Tommy V's also had to score well on value to justify the top rating.  And it did.  For the area (note qualification), it is quite reasonably priced, including even the drinks.

I was slightly disappointed to see that they didn't have the rolling carts, but I got over it quickly. Despite the plethora of seafood and meat dumplings on the menu, ordering dishes for the vegetarian in our midst did not prove challenging in the least. We probably ordered many items that are not ""typical"" of dim sum (e.g. no har gao, no siu mai, lo bak goh, etc) but there were plenty of delicious offerings in the form of crispy tofu-skin rolls, steamed vegetarian dumplings, plain cheong fun rice noodles, flaky custard pastries and melt-in-your-mouth fried sticky rice balls with black sesame. The meat eaters also sampled shrimp and veggie dumplings and BBQ pork buns. We all left completely stuffed for $10/pp. I'm withholding my last star for next time when I try the more typical dim sum dishes, but dang it if they didn't all look mouthwateringly good.",2010-08-25 00:01:07

I was surprised to see an older female at the stove tending to whatever was in the pot. Another woman appeared and took my order. She was very pleasant and informative when I asked her what they put in the tacos. The first thing she said was that the tacos are not spicy and they don't put sauce in them.  What a relief ! !! Anywho, I got the number one which is your choice of any two tacos, plus a side of rice and beans, and a drink.  This meal only set me back 7 dollars. The corn tortillas are home made and they are the best tortillas you will ever eat. I got a fish taco and a taco de asada.  After picking off the cilantro, I dug in. Both tacos were delicious!  The fish and asada were perfectly seasoned(not salty), the rice was not soggy, and the beans were so fresh. I checked in on Yelp so that I could get a free churro with my combo meal. My only complaint is that they don't make their own juices. If you want authentic Mexican food, go to Abuela's Tacos. I promise you won't be disappointed.

It's right in the downtown core so don't expect to find parking. You'll have to be very patient or put your car in an over-priced lot. 

Service: None. I mean, really. There is no service other than the clerks who assign a change room. There's never anyone on the floor to assist you. Also, the change rooms are the size of my high-school locker and trying to move around in there is the equivalent of that magician guy David Blain trying to get himself out of chains while submerged in water, in a big plastic box. 

Stuff: Personally, I have no patience to sift through a pile of generic crap while being pushed and shoved by other customers. There is nothing exceptional about what they sell here - you can probably find the same or better, at Winners, Target, Sears etc. Also, the layout of the store isn't coherent. 

Cost: It depends what you buy; if you're going for the Simons brand, then prices are fair. If you're going for a brand like Billabong, Puma and so on, then you're paying the same thing as you would at Sports Experts.

The food is incredible and all but the service is even better! They were probably pretty understaffed and were all rushing around but they were very apologetic, engaging, and down to earth. Some people might complain about slower service but you didn't come to Denny's you came to a family owned place with charming people who don't run like robots. You get people who talk to you and care about if you enjoy your meal. They love it when you get creative or risky with what you order! I am not a chorizo stuffed waffle kind of person normally! I had many wonderful conversations and I really felt like I belonged there in an authent

Both of the waffles were delicious but they were a little thick for my taste but most people love that, it's just a preference thing.

My husband and I will be back many more times to try EVERYTHING ELSE on the expansive menu but mostly for the sweet servers and the biscuits.

Biscuits are still delicious 

Got a quiche Lorraine that was very good and WOW what a Benedict. New requirement: YOU MUST GET THE GRILLED MUFFINS! I don't know why someone thought they were from Costco?

Arrived at around 6pm. Didn't get seated until 9:45...yeah...it was THAT packed...

Overall the buffet is well balanced between things that work and things that didnt. I cant throw my arms up in the air and just cry out that every was delicious and how i wish to go back every chance i could but realistically i can't. Instead i'm just going to list things i've had and comment on them in my usual review fashion. (Hint Click the 'Useful' button)

- Hard Cider -
Wanted the Root Beer but they were all out, darn kids... so went for the hard cider. Was carded upon request but stopped taking offense after i noticed the woman working the drinks was carding everyone. Wow this stuff is good, very light in taste, doesn't have an aftertaste or linger, very refreshing.

- Ginger Snow/King (yeah i don't know which) Crabs - 
Everyone was assaulting the cold/warm legs and i didnt feel like waiting to pick off what ever's left. My buddy found these in the Chinese section. They were pure WIN. Perfectly seasoned, still warm, juicy and fresh tasting.

- Prime Rib -
When i got to the prime rib station the hunk of meat was nearing the end and the handler was struggling to get cuts of the meat correctly. i requested the hunk of dark meat with the fat. He was glad to get rid of that part for it was much larger then the rest due to his 'excellent' slicing skills. Wow...the end piece was perfectly seasoned and almost melted in my mouth. Totally made that 3.5hr wait worth it.

- Chicken Florentine -
Dry, tasteless, dry...more dry...more tasteless...epic fail

- Steak Grilled something something... - 
Wow just WOW these were good. Forgot what it was called because it had an unusual name but looked like grilled steak covered in gravy. The steaks were well done but wasnt tough or stringy. They had a VERY nice grilled taste and the gravy wasnt overpowering at all.

- Bamboo Mahi Mahi - 
Had an unusual flavor, i can only describe it as 'woody with a citrus background' but the flesh was just so dry

- Shrimp Cocktail - 
Hit and miss. Some shrimp had firm tails, some hard, some nearly dissolved. Cocktail sauce was heavy on the horseradish.

- Here i go again - 
is anyone even reading any of this?

- Red Seafood Curry - 
Wish they offered Indian curries. Anyway the curry had more of a seafood flavor then a curry flavor. Spicy but with no flavor so it was just a spicy seafood taste.

- Chicken Teriyaki - 
Tasted like steamed chicken with sauce poured all over it. Would have claimed this to be fail but the chicken went along great with the beef red curry sauce.

- Hummus -
The first time i went to this buffet i remembered the hummus to be the most disgusting dip i've ever seen but ended up the best hummus i've ever had. This trip was the complete opposite. The hummus looked average and tasted...blah. Tasted like gritty cream with no flavor.

- Pizza Bread - 
Dont know why i got this but so glad i'm did. Pretty much topping and sauce-less pizza dough in pizza slices with cheese on top. Tasted awesome.

- Roasted Lamb -
Overcooked and tasteless. Tough and a bit stringy. Salt couldnt fix the lack of flavor.

- Mushroom Salad - 
oooh these little marinated mushrooms were bomb 

- Pistachio Shooters - 
Whoa these were good, Pistachio pudding with raspberry puree at the bottom. Very nice

- Tiramisu Shooters - 
Eh not quite the epic tiramisu i've had at CPK (of all places to have tiramisu...) but they were...alright

- Oreo Cookie Shooters - 
Eh...Why? with the Pistachio and the Tiramisu why even have this? It's like putting a musket behind a machine gun. obviously one is vastly superior then the other.

Last bit was the experience. I know it's thanksgiving and i know the entire buffet shuts down and starts booting people by 10:30. But COME ON. It's Thanksgiving and we've waited in line for 3 and a half hours. I know the staff wanna go home to their families but COME ON I WAS IN LINE FOR THREE AND A HALF HOURS!!",2010-11-27 10:42:50

The downstairs is a typical casino, but with low minimum bets, and professional, kind dealers. 
I enjoyed the fact that they have girls in skimpy outfits shaking it on little platforms where the pit bosses hang out. They grind and twerk to the music, which gave me lots of inspiration to keep gambling! 
The dealers were great. I really enjoyed the helpful guidance of Harry and his trainee, Kevin on their three card poker dealing. They explained the odds, and the bets you can make, and even told stories about the crazy kind of stuff that happens there. 
Upstairs is where this casino is different. They have a ""Vintage Vegas"" area upstairs, with old school slot machines, and a horse racing game that was really cool! The horse racing game had horses on a track that ran around, and you place your bets with quarters, based on the odds displayed on the base of the game. Unfortunately, the machine crapped out, and it ate a quarter of mine, and didn't pay out on the winning horses, like it was supposed to. In the event of a machine malfunction, I guess you don't get your wagers back, which was kind of a bummer, but I guess it was just a quarter. I really enjoyed the old slot machines that didn't have a computer running them, with the rotating drums spinning wildly every time you pump a quarter in. They also had on display some really, really old, beautiful slot machines that looked downright historic. Unfortunately, you can't play on those. 
The drinks kept flowing here- in tall highball glasses! They weren't watered down, and were quite welcome. They had a wide variety of casino games, all with low minimums, and a huge selection of entertaining slots to play. 
Yes, there were some shady characters who showed up around the 4am mark. A few of them had to be thrown out when they challenged the dealer at the blackjack table. But I guess that just adds to the casino experience. I was approached by a guy wearing latex gloves who claimed to be with security who was most interested in my cigar. However, the real security showed up and threw him out, which was a relief. 
The Long Bar was a nice bar, with very reasonably priced drinks. It seems that they missed out on some real good humor by not calling it the ""Long D"" or something like that. The puns seem to write themselves for that one. 
I was unimpressed by the Players' Club area. I stood in line for 15 minutes waiting to get a card, and finally gave up. Oh well.",2015-09-01 04:37:24

After knowing how much time the crowd waited in line to get into this nightclub, I think everyone had that mindset ""What ever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.""

This place by far, has the most social-able, friendly, go-getter crowd I have ever experienced in comparison to other lively nightclubs. (It might of been just this night)

Maybe the outdoor scenery with plenty of cabana seatings or the unique large lamp shaped heaters around the breezy opened area or the (Thunder Women) show above the dance floor, made an influence to the crowds attitude... Haha, but with every nightclub, there are some down points to mention...

For instance, this club was said to be one of the biggest clubs, maybe cause of the extended walking paths to the restrooms, dance floor, entrance to the club made this place seem wide and bigger. I say, that was my down fall of this club! 

Waiting in a 2 hour line around the edges of Marquee, soon to enter another line into the elevators heading above into the club, first seeing a bar and deciding which path to take (outdoor, indoor) then asking for directions to the restroom, walking a mile back into the small dance floor... Is just too overwhelming to imagine. Right? (I felt sorry for the ladies)

Overall experience:
_Must at least come once for the experience
_Be prepared for getting around the area with its long walk-ways
_Need to enjoy the whack ecstasy music 
_Enjoy the unforgettable outdoor area
_Get ready to mingle since this place isn't really happening...

I have been meaning to write about our experience a while ago, but after dealing with so many customer service issues and communication problems from this place, I wanted to leave it alone for a while till we both cooled off. 

Our salesman was a guy named Travis. trust me when I say this, he is a scumbag. He only cares about his commission and tries to act friendly till you sign your papers. My boyfriend and I ran into some problems about their ""amazing inspection,"" the third day the car was guaranteed or your money back. They clearly did not fully inspect the fluids of the car we purchased and after going through their corporate offices and speaking with so many ""managers"" to figure out the issues of the car, we wound up going through our own insurance to figure out what the problem was with the vehicle. the power steering fluid was completely dry when my boyfriend started to head to work on the third day we had the car, and he completely lost control of the car because the steering wheel locked DURING THE DRIVE!! and he got into an accident. They promised all the fluids and inspection points were cleared for driving till the next oil change, but that was a complete LIE. He could have been seriously injured due to their negligence! they did not even change the oil and we found out about the lacking maintenance of the car when we took it to an auto shop to get it looked at!!! 

Carmax and TRAVIS kept promising to call back, but they kept pushing their help and communication lines till depletion of the third day of their money back guarantee offer. So many broken promises and horrifyingly bad communication on their part to help us with their lack of servicing our vehicle. This place deserves ZERO stars for their lackluster customer service, and NEGATIVE ratings for their overall desire to help their customers with their faulty maintenance guarantees. I don't recommend this place to anyone. 

You may luck out and have a valid, working car by the end of the deal, but if you are truly looking for a place that backs their customer service and ideal maintenance team, you are not going to get that here. Worst experience ever and at the end of it all, they are lucky we did not press charges for their faulty maintenance guarantees. We fixed the car up through insurance and decided after our lawyer consultations that draining more time from our lives and wasting it away with such a terrible group of people was more than we could bear. I honestly hope this place improves because after this experience, we will never go to, or recommend a CARMAX in any location we will ever be at. I convinced at least 3 of my friends to avoid this place for a reputable car and hopefully with this review, you guys will research before buying a car from this terrible place.",2017-05-27 06:55:23

Their omelets are out of control.  They are GIGANTIC!  It was super tasty too!  It comes with a side of some awesome hashbrowns and 2 pieces of toast.  I got sourdough and it was perfect....they even butter up the bread for you too so all you have to do is apply the strawberry jelly.  I washed it down with a gigantic chocolate shake.

I assure you, this place is no beer farm, whatever the hell a beer farm is. I would assume a beer farm would be a place where high-quality delicious beer is born or maybe even served.

I had a hard time trying to figure out what to drink here because of that. So, I drank liquor. 

I can't say anything about the Mesquite Grill part of their name because I didn't eat anything on my visit. Drank my dinner, thank you very much. 

Came here on a really crowded Saturday night. The place wasn't too bad overall. I would have liked it a bit better had I been able to walk without bumping into people and having to say ""excuse me"" every 5 seconds. 

Best thing about this place is probably all of the fun games they offer. Many people say it's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults. True. Not as many games as Dave and Busters - but close. I didn't partake in any of that sort of fun but I wish I would have.

The service was pretty good for an extremely crowded Saturday night. Plenty of bartenders to go around and they were all friendly.

I could see the feeling of being cramped if this place was busy and I was at a table, but on a Monday night it was nice and relaxed so you couldn't go wrong no matter where you sat. The bartender was super friendly and knew his stuff, and I soon had the Holy Elixir in my hand.  Holy god was it delicious.  And strong.

I talked with some of the other serving staff while eating and everyone was friendly without so much as a hint of pretense.  For a place with food and drinks this good, that was a pleasant surprise.  

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't tried any of the major entrees. (If you just want poutine and delicious cocktails then yes, easily 5 stars.) Prices aren't bad, especially for a kitchen that's 100% from scratch, but on my social worker salary this qualifies as expensive.

Hubby & I line up, we're waiting in the cold vestibule between the outside door and the restaurant doors. 

Line doesn't move for 20 minutes, yet we see several people leave (meaning tables free up) during that time. 

We're still waiting. I go into the restaurant and tell a staff member that clients have been leaving, yet the waiting line is not moving. A group of 4 comes in behind us (remember this for later). I asked her if people were being seated. She told me they were cleaning the tables. Ok, fine. I go back into the cold vestibule. 

As time passes they slowly, and I mean slowly, start seating the people lined up in front of us. We make it into the actual restaurant. Ahh, it's so much warmer now, but hubby & I are still waiting. 

A table for 4 becomes available real close to us, but I watched the guy and he spent, it must have been, 5 minutes prepping & resetting the table. If that's how long it takes to reset ONE table during peak business hours.... 

Finally once the table was ready, the hostess went behind us and seated the group of 4 who arrived after my husband & I. At this point, my husband totally snapped and we left famished, after waiting uncomfortably for 30 minutes, watching the turtle slow workers, then being skipped in line.

Having a seat on a very small patio during the ""OpenTheSteet"" festival where Bloor was blocked off, on a beautiful day set the perfect stage for a great breakfast.

Receiving a so-so Healthy Fat breakfast with 2 poached eggs, 2 pieces of avocado,some salmon and old mushy tomatoes, took down the experience a notch and receiving your breakfast with 2 plastic containers of butter and one of honey sitting right on the food takes the review way down. I don't understand how restaurants think it is acceptable to place those plastic packets, (that have been handled through shipping and distribution and exposed to who knows what kind of bacteria) right on top of the food! Is it really too much trouble just to bring them on the side?

The meal itself wasn't great. The best part was the two slices of multi-grain toast. The poached eggs were so soft they looked like they glanced at some hot water. The smoked salmon was okay however the tomato slices, which I would have liked to have eaten with the salmon seemed to be garnish for the dish. Overall, at $14.95, this was not good experience.

Service was okay, albeit a bit ""clinical"". I walked inside to go to the bathroom and can't say I saw very many happy faces...you the kind faces saying, ""where's my meal"", ""I can't get any service"", and ""the food is not that great"". Just an observation on my part.

The place is getting dirty and lacking proper upkeep.  I had to go to the ladies room upon my arrival, and after the sight I saw, I almost wanted to leave the restaurant.  I won't tell you about the floaties in the toilet, but aside from that, you can see the bathroom had not been restocked in days and there was no toilet paper, paper towels or seat covers and it was filthy.  There is obviously no professional crew that cleans those restrooms, most likely a lazy wait staff on occasion.  And I mean rare occasion.

The happy hour buffet was out, unbeknownst to us.  Most was cold, dried up and /or inedible.  Took a few items to three of us at the table, everyone had a bite here or there, and no one ate any more.  Those full plates sat on our table for about 15 minutes with at least 3 or 4 staff walking by, and no one removed them until we asked.  And it's not like we didn't have them almost hanging off the edge of the table for all to see.

Our server Nico was pleasant, but definitely was not on top of his game that night.  Service was extremely slow.  Only one side of the restaurant was busy, the other empty.  Observed the busboys and can't decide which one was most useless.

My daughter's gyro platter came out cold.  Then when we sent it back, it came out hot, but the meat was too tough and dry for her (or anyone else) to eat.  She left it and they happily removed it from the bill.

My Greek salad was as good as always as was the Grecian chicken.  We ordered our dessert early in the evening and only at the very end did they tell us they were out of it.  They graciously offered us another dessert of our choice at n/c, but of course we were all disappointed because those Loukoumades (honey soaked dough balls), are amazing and usually worth the trip alone.  How can you run out of dough?

Overall, the place and people are still pleasant and warm, but the food, service and cleanliness left a lot to be desired.  If this were my first visit, and not 7th or 8th, I would never be back.  Since it's my first bad experience out of many, I will try once more and hope for the best.

Needless to say by my rating, this place sucked pretty bad.  Let me give you a little run down...

The burger was ordered medium but it was WAAAAY overcooked, not even pink in the center.  It was so overly salted that I couldn't even enjoy the meat.  The cole slaw that they slap on top didn't help either, relegating this burger to Diner status, all 20 dollars of it.

The escargot was mediocre.  Although they try to trick you by giving you 15 escargots in one dish, all of them are flavorless and dry.  Could it hurt you to add a little bit more butter?  Even a hint of garlic would have helped ...

The lamb shank was pretty tasty.  It's fall of the bone tender and was seasoned correctly.  One extra star for this dish.

Currently, if you check-in on foursquare, you get a free dessert.  I opted for something bizarre so I chose the Olive Oil Parfat.  This was very tasty but I wouldn't want to pay $10 for this tiny little thing... (that's what she said?)

Service was decent, but it seemed that the waiter didn't really care too much...just seemed like he wanted the day to end quickly.

I experienced mini versions of these sweet cuppin' cakes at a Yelp event earlier in the Summer, and so entranced was I in these wee edibles, that I vowed to: ""Get thee to a Cupcakery(TM)!""

And so I did.

Admittedly, $3 bucks a cake is a bit much, but I did notice a sign that Nevada apparently no longer applies sales tax to baked goods, it was a flat $3.

I tried the PB Jammin' cake, which was peanut butter with a hint of grape jelly.  Everyone is bemoaning that these pastries are dry, but mine was moist and flavorful.  I personally liked it, as it reminded me of one of those little Crustables sandwiches, but it was a cupcake.

Max Rimaldi and Grant van Gamaren are proving that vegan food can have a large and impactful space in the Toronto food scene. As a restaurant that was envisioned since 2004, pulling the trigger now is not just a ""finally"" moment, but also good timing in the wake of the number of vegan restaurants now showing you can be successful. 
 
Where Grasslands didn't live out its true potential, Rosalinda (and Planta for that matter) show promise in proving that vegan food can have big flavour and doesn't need to be faux meat focus to be successful, or be served from an alley  store in Kensington market. Rosalinda has large open space with sophistication and luxury (think greenhouse chic). There's also a significant focus on bar service and cocktails, which adds to one of the many reasons to visit Rosalinda.     

Still there's room for improvement here however. There's a little bit of a consistency issue in the dishes from one visit to the next (the mole carrots will change your life one week, and will be a vinegary mess the other), there's no cappuccino service due to kitchen space issues, and service is a bit inconsistent ranging from unbelievable servers who go above and beyond in explaining dishes and their story, to servers who are just there to serve you and make a tip. A few more tweaks and a heavier hand in maintaining service standards will change things in the time to come.",2018-06-20 14:09:03

K8eEOqut-ubAICSxId_Jow,ZYdPYCi5UP75TrcGZV1FjA,bUIvPsnRRbDc4kaHHVV-RQ,4,2,2,2,"Babystop was another random find while I wandered the Agua Caliente shopping center the other day. This new location apparently JUST opened within the last two weeks and it is lovely! 

It is a nice, roomy space lined with shelving that is stuffed with various toys, books, and baby accoutrements. The showfloor itself is arranged with little vignette setups of different nursery and bedroom ideas. Everything is beautifully styled and the furniture is high quality and pretty. There was a LOT of bling and I was struck by the predominance of girly and gender neutral nursery options with fewer boy options (at least at my first glance) 

The thing that stood out to me most was actually the customer service of the saleswoman in the store when I visited. When I entered, she was helping an expectant couple consider various crib and bedding options. She did take a moment to greet me, which I appreciated, but then returned to her conversation with them (which I proceeded to eavesdrop on since I was the only other customer in the store and couldn't really avoid doing so) Her descriptions of the features of each crib, the options for different colors, finishes, and bedding as well as her suggestions and upselling of various elements - plush animals, decor - were all spot on and convincing. She took time to talk with them and feel them out about what they were looking for and then made recommendations based on those preferences. 

Having been through a similar process at Babies R Us a couple of years ago, where the sales person I worked with was basically a glorified order taker for my $2000 purchase of nursery furniture (a person who was surly, distracted, and slow), I truly appreciated seeing someone take the time  to really make the shopping experience a good one for these guests, even before the customer chose to buy from her. The pricing is likely a bit higher at BabyStop, but between the quality of their products and their staff, I can believe that it is worth it! 

Their selection of toys, books, and gifts was unique and they had a great selection of Petunia Picklebottom diaper bags displayed front and center at the entry. I can imagine this being an excellent choice to find a special shower or baby gift for a friend or loved one. 

I used to shop regularly for baby items at Giggle at the Scottsdale Quarter and was so disappointed that they closed a month or so ago. Although the aesthetics are very different (Giggle being more modern/minimalist, Babystop being more classic/elaborate) I would definitely recommend Babystop and plan to check it out again the next time I need to make a baby related purchase.",2013-04-13 06:27:15

They have a great condiment spread laid out to customize our sandwiches and received our order within about 5-8 minutes of placing our order. We both really enjoyed the food, my burger tasted like it was off the grill in a backyard bbq, which I really liked. My husband was not a huge fan of the ""frank's red hot"" sauce on the sandwich but the chicken was juicy and the portion was large. We came back a week later and sat in the bar. Similarly lackluster customer service experience in the restaurant and in the bar, My husband ordered a hot dog which came butterflied.

The place has a lack of good signage and by the time we saw the sign, we had passed the only entrance to this place. Anyways, so we we got inside and the place looks nice, but is really dimly lit. Like really really dark. The furniture and whatnot looks modern though, and I liked the feel of the restaurant (wish there was a little more light though). We started with the pork belly. This was the best thing we had here. Oooo it was sooo good. Now, it was pork belly, so it's hard to mess it up, but this was especially good. I just wish it were bigger. They also gave us a small loaf of warm bread with butter, balsamic, and some pesto -y stuff that kind of tasted like parsley. The butter was good, the parsley pesto was kind of weird. For dinner I had the chicken and the BF had the short rib (oh, like other reviewers said, the menu online is not the same menu that they actually have..... sad for the BF who really wanted bacon wrapped pork tenderloin). The chicken was meh. It was a big portion, but the chicken was on the bone (I prefer off the bone... easier to cut and whatnot) and it was kind of dry. The sauce was nothing special. It came with mashed potatoes which were ok and some greens that tasted like... parsley. The short ribs were fine, again short ribs are something that pretty much have to be pretty good due to their overwhelming fat content, but the sauce that they were braised in was kind of weird and tasted like... parsley. This restaurant really likes parsley.... a lot. Maybe it was on sale or something this week, but man... kind of weird. The short ribs came with some really good polenta.... I usually don't like polenta, but this was really good... extremely creamy. Anyway, so we were really hoping to get dessert being hallmark day and all, but when the time came, we found that the dessert menu on their website is also not the real menu. The one on the website has like 6 choices, but there were only two choices tonight: A brownie and Beignets. Neither sounded all that awesome... who wants donuts or brownies from a nice restaurant? I wanted the chocolate overload.... but nope. So we skipped dessert *tear*

Beware normal bowling fans, Red Rock Lanes will be a completely different experience for you, especially if you go for the Cosmic Bowling nights. This is bowling at a club. You will not find anyone over the age of 40 bowling here during cosmic bowling, that's for sure.

I celebrated my ""early"" birthday here with a gathering of friends. We got a lane for two games. Each game costs $13 (that includes shoes). Well, that's a bit pricey in my book for bowling, BUT it was my birthday so splurge! In all honesty I would probably bowl elsewhere (for cheaper) had it not been my birthday party. The ambiance is hip, there's a plus with a really nice bar, and the music is fun - but really, when you go to bowl isn't it more about BOWLING and talking with friends/making fun of their poor bowling skills? This is kind of a hard thing to do when you have strobe lights in your face and a booming background track of music.

It's a HUGE facility and even on a Saturday night around 9 PM we did not have to wait for a lane. I think with other places you'd probably end up waiting around a bit for a lane to open up just because other alleys are much smaller. 

There's a multitude of pluses about this place, but I think the real downside is the expensive price tag they put on it. Bowling should be for the masses and should be cheap! Of course, that's just my opinion. Overall, good time, but I think maybe I'll just go to the base and pay $5 for unlimited cosmic bowling....",2012-04-30 16:35:37

The restaurant itself is next to a Sweet Jesus and shares a space with Good Fortune Bar (which is downstairs). The vibe is what you would expect from this ever growing taco joint - hip hop music blaring from the sound system as well as platters of delicious tacos enjoyed by many. 

I've been to La Carnita plenty of times (whether it is the uptown location or the two downtown locations - on John St. and on College St.), and have come to like their food. Recently having gone again to this location, I noticed there were a few differences in price and portions. Sadly, a cod taco now costs $5.79, definitely an increase in price since previously. The menu has also expanded to have a few more items but overall, the price of the food has increased and the portions of the food have decreased. Although the flavours of the food are still on point, I am somewhat disappointed by the pricing and portion of the food. There comes a point where you realize that sometimes, the food is not worth it for the price...and I came to that realization this time going to La Carnita. There are other taco joints in the city which offer similar options for way less.

First of all, from the outside, this place looks ""crazy""...it reminded me of a trailer park or actually of my neighbor down the street that puts everything they can find that is tin in their yard and calls it good landscaping.  This place was like a junk yard with a fish theme but it was cool and certainly down to earth.  The inside decor remained consistent with the exterior.

Our waitress seemed really happy to be there and even sat down at our table to describe the specials and featured items on the menu.  I got the ""act"" but it was over done and I wasn't much in the mood for it.  I can just picture the staff meetings in the mornings..""ok do what it takes for shock value, just act crazy kids!! Make it a super fun environment.""

Nah, it didn't bother me too bad and it was ""fun"" but my real pet peeve surfaced when the only menu choices she reccommended were the most expensive.  She went on to say ""really for your first time in you have to go with one of the specials.""  

Against her wishes I went with the blackened tuna tacos that came with their house slaw and pineapple salsa on top.  They were decent but not amazing and maybe I am wrong in saying that for blackened tuna I expected it cooked through but it was really rare and cold...it just didn't work well as a taco.  I chose the squash casserole as suggested for my side and it was ok but lukewarm and not overly thrilling.

We ordered the cheesecake brownie ala mode but there was nothing cheesecake about the brownie...pretty standard, nothing special.

I give them credit for their creative menu and friendly environment but I won't make a habit of returning.  I will say it is worth going mid week when their tacos are half off...that may be more of a justified price.",2012-12-08 21:42:46

However, you better like it just the way they make it (and that's with or without peppers) as you can't get it any other way. I like hot peppers on my Italian sandwiches but only in small doses so I asked for them in the side so I can ease my wuss self into the pepper zone properly but....can't get em or anything on the side when it comes to the sandwich. You can't add mayo if it doesn't normally come with mayo.  

Ok, now I still like the Italian without the peppers too but my kids, they don't like all that stuff on their sandwiches.  Well guess what?  Can't customize sandwiches at all, so you gotta order a ""slim"" which is meat and cheese and bread. I asked for a slim with mayo, nope....but they can give you a mayo packet to apply the mayo yourself.  Okay....

Now,back to the fact that all sucks...the taste of the sandwich and cost of the sandwich are good, thus earning three stars. Plus they are turbo fast at getting the sandwich into your hand (because....no changes)!  You dint get a sack or napkins unless you ask, but that's no big deal I guess.

For better tasting sandwiches at higher price and longer wait, try Capriottis or which wich.  It all depends on your budget and time available",2014-04-23 22:48:38

TGoyP9TV7v4OHSQhcFdBfA,7KlKHdsrKVwPAWuFJYXpwQ,oJxuSZOoFprrjm0Dvwdc-A,2,3,2,1,"In my neverending quest for the greatest burger in all of the GTA, I've had the privilege of sampling q wide variety of burgers that range from abysmal to top notch.

Mississauga is not known for its burger restaurants as it seems like every other corner there is a McDonald's or a gas station. Culinary delectables are far in between for this city. 

I thought I had found a unique burger joint in Mississauga, however its not all quite there.

Union Burger is situated on the ground level of a newly built condo, part of the remarkable skyscraping housing boom in the centre of Mississauga in the last 5 years. Here you'll find more concentrated condo units than anywhere else within a 20km radius. 

The restaurant is new and clean, the seats and booths are comfortable cushions.  Even the ordering system is high tech, opting to utilize the pager system as it takes 5-10 minutes for them to prepare your meal. They also have a fancy soft drink machine offering a variety of Coke infused products and other Coca Cola products such as Dr. Pepper and Fuse iced tea.  Of additional note is that they offer beeeeeer!  I cannot think of any fast food joint that offers beer as a refreshment!  Other burger joints should take note.

However, that is where the positives end.   The burgers leaves a lot to be desired for and could definitely use a much needed improvement.

The patties are overcooked, and dry bland taste. The initial visit did not seem that bad, but on the second visit it felt like eating bland cardboard. Or at least, what one would imagine eating cardboard would be like.  I found it very underwhelming, not seasoned enough, and just did not taste as good as it looks.  The buns also do not help as it too was dry and hard to bite into.  I think they may be using pre-frozen patties?

It is important to mention that I did not completely finished my burger both times as I could not bring myself to finish it.  

In retrospect, McDonald's serves a better Quarter Pounder burger, even if it's frozen unhealthy crap. 

Union Burger showed so much promise - with its clean and sleek lines in their dining room, the offer of beer on the menu, to the fancy soft drink machine.  Alas, if only their burgers were as good as their physical restaurant presentation.

The quest for an even better burger than the last continues..",2013-10-08 07:39:06

My girlfriend and I met up for a walk on the rail trail one day and at the end of our walk we decided to stop in for a juice. We each got a delicious pressed juice and said we would have to come back for food on a later date. 

We'll that date came! And I was really impressed. The server was so sweet. She offered us water (wish it came in larger glasses). We studied the menu. My friend got the kale Caesar salad. I ordered the manicotti. 

Both meals came promptly. Her salad was tasty, but the real winner was my dish! The ""manicotti"" was comprised of raw zucchini lasagna zoodles stuffed with cashew cheese and touched with tomato sauce. I got a tossed arugula salad on the side. That cashew cheese was to die for!! No joke! So good! My only wish was that the manicotti could be served warm. I think it would push it over the top -- nonetheless, totally delicious! We ended our meal with 2 chocolate chip cookies and a class of almond milk. The cookies were great. They came warm with lots of nutty flavor. However, I'd pass on the almond milk next time -- too sweet. 

The actual space is beautiful and eclectic. It's pretty spacious too.

After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.

Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline.

The atmosphere is a mix of rustic and chic. The cash/front is a stack of beautiful wooden railway ties with a varnished top. I want it! There is a classic Toronto tin ceiling and lots of pot lights so you can be productive anywhere. There is free fast Wi-Fi but it's a bit spotty. There are mostly tables for two around the room with a few larger tables. This place is also crowded, and outlets are scarce. There is a nice community feel in here. The guys behind the cash seemed a bit aloof with me but their interactions with regulars made me realise they are actually very nice. There was a group of ladies who came in with new babies and they were very accommodating. Speaking of new babies, lots of yelling babies visited this café today. Why, moms, why? It's already quite loud when busy, especially with the latte machine. During most of the day the dull lull of background noise and the awesome indie soundtrack was perfect for getting my work done, but my concentration was broken once or twice with the peaks in volume in the early afternoon.

(Fare)
There is a handy chart on the blackboard illustrating the amount of milk added to shots, which means you don't need to ask the difference between for example a macchiato and a latte. There is no difference in the number of shots between S, M, L, but they pull doubles by default, so guaranteed caffeine. They have a small menu of paninis they can grill up for you (the Caprese is tasty, with tomato, mozzarella, and arugula on a sweet-ish milk bun). They also have a selection of teas, and a limited number of baked treats to pair with your beverage. Other reviewers have commented on the baked goods which makes me think they were just low on supplies today. Prices are pretty good, though. Oh, I almost forgot the latte art! Yay! 

I think a friendlier vibe from the staff, more outlets, and more baked goods would elicit a higher rating. Overall, it's a good local place to be productive, I'm glad it's in the neighbourhood!",2014-04-02 21:53:40

The food did not stop. It kept coming and coming : )   The calamari was very good,  It was served with a spicy mayo type of sauce, crispy and tender.  Steak lollipops served medium rare. Usually those are shoe leather at most places.  I could not tell what kind of beef but it was tender, so I'm guessing tenderloin.  Chicken lollipops very flavorful.  They were  that good that I am not calling them meat on a stick!

There was also cured meat and cheese platters that were wonderful.  There were roasted veggies that were flavorful, I suppose it was for the ahem vegan crowd.  There were also some fancy cheese dips,  salads and other stuff.  I can say this was an Atkins friendly wine tasting event.

The crowd was great.  I found out that I made a lot of friends at the costume party from the History Museum.  I was talking to a couple of women and I kept saying that I knew them.

The interior is beautiful, rustic looking with wood trimming and columns. There are some wooden benches for seats as well they have a large marble table in the center that seats about 8 people and an open concept bar/kitchen so you can see your drinks and food being made.

Since its family style, Tiff and I ordered a Caesar salad, pan roasted gai lan, yam tortilla, and the roasted cauliflower.  Waters were frequently filled as we chatted and our dishes came. First, the delicious looking casesar salad came - it was topped with a fried egg that was sprinkled with chopped cashews and pecorino cheese was scattered throughout the salad. The dressing was light, didn't overpower and everything mixed together was a great meal. The roasted cauliflower came as a half head, egg bagna cauda style which is typically made of garlic, anchovies, olive oil and butter but this dish didn't have anchovies instead, some green olive type mixture on top. The cauliflower was perfectly roasted with dark tips and garlic bread crumbs were sprinkled on top, I`m not normally a huge fan of olives but whatever it was on top, it mixed well with the breadcrumbs and cauliflower and it was tasty. Tiff and I were some big fans of the yam tortilla, which essentially was a piece of thinly sliced yams that is made with sumac and topped with nigella sour cream. Super simple yet so heavenly. Lastly, the pan roasted gai lan which is also known as Chinese kale was really tasty - there was this salty tahini, miso and ginger sauce wiped on the plate with the gai lan placed on top sprinkled with some fried shiitake mushrooms. I appreciated that the gai lan was blanched and left unseasoned because the sauce was salty enough to balance the dish.

I take it back, they DO have books by Sidney Sheldon! Oh and Dean Koontz too. Perhaps it would've been wiser to check the other side of the aisle the last time I went. Book lovers, be careful. Apparently, with savers, the line between horror and crime genres has been blurred. I saw psychological thrillers and murder mysteries (both my favourite) under both genre aisles! 

Light-hearted romantic comedies, on the other hand, are stacked up under fiction, so you'll really need to know your authors' very well (with their specific writing categories) as opposed to judging a book by where it's placed. Sophie Kinsella fans, here's an update. She goes under another name now: Madeleine Wickham, and yet her content is still full of unpredictable twists with such lovable protagonists, sure to give you a great laugh! 

Would've loved if they allowed their memorial day sales to flow to the book section, but $1.99 (no sale) is not bad either. Pages were intact, covers were clean & unscraped, no loose ends. Save up on some good books and take in stories by these great authors at a fraction of their original prices.",2013-05-29 18:13:35

Went there for dinner seemed like a nice place headed in got seated and ordered a salad which was pretty good then everything went downhill from there. So we placed our entree order and it took 30 min to get to us not only that but they got my order wrong the waiter was confused when I told him that's not what I ordered. I was pissed and hungry  I was not going to wait another 30 min. Told the waiter that we would share the dish that my wife ordered. The manager came by and offered a dessert but I declined. No one brought me a plate so I can share the dish so we were eating out of one plate which was kind of annoying. On top of that that food sucked. The head chef was just walking around the restaurant bullshitting with customers and not where he is supposed to be in the kitchen making sure everyone's order is correct. We left leaving pissed off. I definitely would not recommend and will not be back to this establishment.,2014-04-20 01:42:06

A Camelback East urban neighborhood hang, where you can get healthy eats or simple pleasures with a relaxed very sweet staff. And I don't necessarily need to bring up the sexy people that shop here but c'mon.

I have done coffee in the morning and sandwiches at lunch. The Barista outside does a fine cup of coffee. The lunches I have had, tuna salad, tuna steak and pizza salad. All of these meals are man size and especially pleasing. They even have a wide variety of beverages to wash down those tasty bites. Sturdy neighborhood staples by my standard. 

If I might recommend a product that would fit, look into water that comes in a paper carton to sell alongside the plastic bottles. There are indoor tables and as I'm eating, I see some of the merchandise in which LGO stocks. A small but excellent offering as far as I can tell. There are outdoor tables and benches that yield old-school homey aesthetics.

As usual, we ordered pork/coriander and lamb/coriander dumplings. The pork ones came first and were delicious. The lamb dumplings came 5-10 minutes later. We each ate one, and stared at each other.

- Is this lamb?
- I think its pork.

We flagged the waiter, and told him there might have been a mistake. He brought the dumplings back to the kitchen, where a few staff members sampled them. He came back and said it was definitely lamb, but would prepare us another portion (no extra fee). I apologized, but was puzzled - lamb has such a unique taste, how did I miss it? Anyhow, the second serving came, and we happily started eating. The first dumpling was distinctively lamb, and so was the second. But the third and fourth tasted just like pork. The fifth was lamb again. Was I losing my sense of taste? Did they make a mistake again? Who knows, but I wasn't very happy about it.

I still think their food is good, but I don't really feel like going back anymore.

Note: They brought in new tables. A nice improvement!",2016-10-01 16:22:11

Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but it's more like eating in my Grandma's kitchen - except my Grandma wasn't Moroccan or Iraqi, which is definitely the accent here.

My friend warned me that the platters were too big for one person (or at least two women trying to keep their, ahem, girlish figures) to eat, so we shared a Chicken Shawarma platter.

This is a Meal (capital M).  The larger plate had a good-sized portion of chicken pieces.  They were tasty, but I swear, I couldn't tell whether they were dark or white meat.  This was accompanied by a large helping of rice covered with pinto beans in sauce (we could have chosen green beans as a topping).  The smaller plate had Israeli salad - basically chopped and seasoned cucumber and tomato - along with baba ganouche, hummus, and a red cabbage salad that was scrumptious.  A third plate had four mini pitas (more upon request).  The idea was to pull off pieces of the the pita and make little mini sandwiches with all the ingredients.  Luckily, I was there with a native, to teach me the ropes and translate the waitress, Gila, who's also the cook and owner, with her husband.  Gila speaks English, but obviously preferred to converse with my friend in Hebrew.

My friend bought a box of pastries - Gila made - to take home, but we snacked on them for dessert.  They were farina-based, stuffed with dates, deep-fried, then baked, and finally, dipped in honey.  They were so out of this world delicious that I wanted to take home a box, too, but she got the last one!

As mentioned in the other review, there is no beer or wine, but there's not even coffee, due to an agreement with the Pannini Cafe next door.  That, together with the mystery chicken, is the reason for this not being a five-star review.  But it's damned close, and I highly recommend it!",2010-10-08 05:31:39

We opted for the 7-course (+ dessert), although we did get a surprise amuse about halfway through. The fish was absolutely amazing and very fresh, particularly the black cod (cooked) and the sashimi sampler at the end (each fish paired with a tiny bit of sauce or other flavor). However, the courses came out REALLY close together. Like, I had barely put my hashi down when the next course came. For me, eight courses should be something to enjoy, especially when you're dropping this kind of money. Finally, the fiance and I just started eating the individual courses more slowly, but we still ended up out of there in less than 90 minutes. Dessert was okay but I do wish there had been some choices (I realize the point of Omakase is chef's choice, but I wouldn't extend that to non-house-made desserts); it was a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and I am not a chocolate girl. Given what I've heard about Soba's dessert menu I was hoping to get to try something else!

We ordered a couple of cocktails as we sat down and they didn't come out until we were done with our first course--Mr. Shu actually checked on them for us upon realizing we only had water. They do serve their Moscow Mules in copper cups, if you care about that kind of thing.

I visited around 12:30pm and the server told us we were the first ones there today. We ordered the lobster mac & cheese, lobster grilled cheese, avocado grilled cheese, and lobster nachos. The lobster nachos was loaded with lots and lots of cheese with lobster bits scattered around. I would say it's a little heavy for an appetizer especially because everything else we ordered had cheese, but it wouldn't be such of a problem if everything else was less cheesy. Everything else was very delicious. We left around 2pm and there was still only 3 tables. 

Today we visited again around 12 and this place was packed (Father's Day). This time we ordered the soft shell crab fried rice, fish sliders, oyster sliders, beef poke bowl with zoodles, and the lobster supreme (the yelp). I personally preferred the fish sliders over the oyster. The lobster supreme was a little cold when it arrived, but I understand that it's a busy day and it might've sat a bit before being served. The beef from the poke bowl is very high quality and perfectly seasoned. The servers are always very friendly and helpful. Left at around 2pm and there was still people waiting for a table!

Came here for brunch with a group of friends.  Service was ok, drinks sat empty for a bit multiple times, and the time between apps and entrees was quite extensive.  Also waiting for the bill took quite a while for some reason...figured they wanted us outta there!

Prices were also somewhat high here, especially for brunch menu.  The chicken sandwich and burgers were $13, the fish apps we ordered were both around $15.  I ordered some mac and cheese off a secret kids menu, and it was $8....just mac and cheese.  I don't mind spending good money on food, and I could tell there was quality ingredients here, but when I sit back and think about it, it was not a solid ""bang for your buck"".

On to the food!

The comp bread and chips were good...came with a hummus like mix to dip.  The wheat bread rolls or whatever they were didn't do much for me, but I really liked the spice in the chips, and the hummus were a great combination!  The little guy loved these!

I ordered the Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.  It was a very good sandwich that was cooked well, had juicy insides, and a nice sweet sauce.  Why the weird vegetable salad though...wish I would have asked for fries.  Yummy pic :

I've been to a few others around town, but this place is spotless, the entire building is like a walk in freezer (meaning fresh meat out of the back and stays fresh while cutting and bagging) and it's a simple set up.  You have the cash counter up front where you grab a paper that has this 2 page list of all the cuts you can get, and then the old man behind the counter -- who is totally awesome and very sweet -- helps you with thickness and cooking tips.

I cannot believe how many varieties of meats they have available, and what made me even more intrigued was their smoked bacon slabs, done right in the smoke house on site.  Oh yeah, baby.  Sweet lovin' bacon slabs, cut to order.  I grabbed 1.5 lbs of their smoked bacon (without rind cause they suggested it that way), two 1"" ribeye steaks cut FRESH from the slab, and 4 pork chops cut thick enough for pan frying cut fresh off the slab.  It was fun to watch, fun to order, and a shocker at the register.

All that meat, ALL that meat was 25 bucks.  WOW.  I freaked out.  I know that the pork was at least 6 pounds and the ribeyes were 18oz each, and then the bacon...all for 25 bucks?  I was happy as can be walking out of there.

Screw the supermarkets.  I'm buying my meats from John Mull's from now on.  They have all I need when I need it.  If you're looking for a butcher up in the northwest area, head to this place.  It's worth the drive, and was a well kept secret of the neighborhood until now.

This place is beautiful. Apparently they've just had a remodel and I have to say that they got their money's worth. The lobby is immaculate and stunning to walk into. Me and my friend were both impressed when we walked in the front door. I asked about exchanging currencies but the offer they gave me didn't seem appealing (and later find out that it was 17% less than exchange rate they offered in a place a few minutes walking distance away which is pretty bad), so I decided against it.  

So I opted to stay here because of the pictures I saw online and I was very impressed with it. When I walked into the room, I was blown away. The pictures did it no justice.. the views were beautiful since I was on the 46th floor and once the sun set and the buildings lights came on, it was like a totally different experience. I find myself just sitting in front of the windows and just taking it all in for long periods of time. Everything seemed new, furniture, fixtures, everything. 

On the 17th floor there is a fitness center and on the 12th floor there is an elevator that connects to the historic elevator which takes you to the underground shopping district that connects all over the place. How convenient is that? I rented a car from the attendant so I could take a trip to Niagra Falls and they were super helpful. Great staff at this place.. I am very impressed. 

It's the little things that really go a long way. They have light fixtures and outlets that you can charge with regular cords or with USB fixtures. Very convenient.

I've read somewhere that bent was opening but wasn't really interested in going, not until I started seeing photos of these bent-o boxes on twitter (damn you twitter! *shakes fist).
They were just so colorful and pretty! and especially with the 'avail for limited time only' and $35 for 2 price tag as long as you went before 7PM, I had to check it out.

And yes this was only avail for limited time so the deal is now over but at least you kind of get to see what the restaurant is all about.

It was my friend's birthday on the last week the deal on so we decided to give it a try. We arrived at 5pm on a Saturday and were first few people in the table.

This was a menu they were testing out that day, it had tomatoes, artichokes, crispy rice puffs and beets. It was a very refreshing dish and the orange vinegrette def gave it that citrus kick.

Following were all part of $35 bent-o box for 2

Oyster Sake Shot

* Lemongrass, shallots, ponzu marinated salmon roe
* I was looking forward to this but found it to be way too fishy for my likings

Lime Coconut Curry Shrimp Soup

* Tomato, corn, squash and crispy puff rice
* This was a creamy rich soup that I really enjoyed

Lobster Tacos

* Charred onion tomato salsa, lobster meat and avocado
* Filled with lots of lobster meat, it was one of our favorites from the box

Tuna Watermelon Ceviche

* Shaved red onion, cilantro, crispy shallots, citrus juice, chili and chinese doughnut fritter
* It was hard to tell the difference between red tuna and watermelon
* Another light sashimi dish that was good with sake

Pressed Octopus

* Perilla, black garlic, olive oil, lentil and tomato
* This I did not enjoy as much as I thought I would

Spicy Tuna Avocado Tartare

* One of the most familiar tasting dish our of the box
* Spicy tuna on top of deep fried rice ball

Spicy Peruvian Style Ceviche

* White snapper, clams, mussels, calamari, chili and lime juice
* There was so much seafood in this dish and the chili really brought out the flavor

Asian style Atlantic Salmon Gravlax

* Japanese omelette, horseradish lemon & chive creme fraiche topped with marinated salmon roe
* I liked the creme fraiche but not so much the omelette on the bottom

Apart from the food we were served, the restaurant itself is a piece of art to look at! Especially where we were seated, the walls were covered in these tiny collectibles and I felt like I was at some garage sale (in a good way of course).

Conclusion: Trying bent before Lee Restaurant (which has been on my list forever), now def convinced me that I need to drop by Lee Restaurant one day. Usually I am not a fan of fusion Asian food, but if it's done properly I know I will enjoy my meal. 
Unfortunately Bent-o box is no longer avail but I will def be back to try their regular menu.",2013-06-25 01:51:04

Most dishes were OK and didn't come out that hot. Additionally, the rice that came with the curry was not fully cooked. The mango sticky rice was probably the best part of the meal.

From the outside it looks like a very expensive restaurant, but surprisingly enough it was very reasonable and the food and service were excellent.

I had the rigatoni with Italian sausage while others had everything from the chicken cobb salad the short rib sandwich to the burger. Everyone was raving about their food, as was I.

The atmosphere was very nice as well and they even have live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights which I would like to return and see.

As a couple, or in a larger group, we've never had a bad experience at Roosters. I'm truly amazed that I have read some negative reviews. Everything is ala carte with reasonable prices. I don't usually eat chicken, but have had theirs, both regular and BBQ, and have found it to be exceptionally good. My favorites are the short ribs (very tender and flavorful) and the onion soup (incredibly rich). When it's offered, which is only when they can get a special local tomato in season, the BLT is absolutely wonderful. Service is exceptional, team approach with some taking order, others delivering the food. The roosters on the wall are interesting and a unique decor. An excellent choice for groups (they have a second set of tables across the hall) and I don't think you can go wrong eating here. My one negative is that the corned beef hash on Sunday brunch is not your typical hash, not bad, but not at all what I expected (so there, I can find some fault, but really had to work at it).",2011-11-30 11:08:11

Menu has several specials, like a whole rotisserie chicken meal with pita for under $9. The best option though, is their Sultani Plate, $20 and enough to share, with a little bit of everything on the menu. 

I'm pretty picky about shawarma, and the chicken version here was good but not great- what kicks it up a level is their garlic sauce. It seems to be sour-cream based which is a little unusual, but it packs plenty of garlic flavor! They also offer garlic fries as a side, though I have yet to try them.

The restaurant is quite small so remember to make a reservation, as the wait can be 15-30 minutes.

*Drinks: 
-Sweet Ginger Tea with green tea, raw ginger and maple syrup - $5: I don't like ginger so I didn't taste this, but my friend enjoyed it and she had a sore throat coming, so this helped to calm her throat :). 
-gojiccino -$5: a cappuccino-style beverage made from pure goji berries. I LOVE this drink. Surprisingly it doesn't taste fruity. The taste is very unique: naturally sweet, taste like a mocha but with a herbal finish. 

*Food: 
-poutine -$8: The portion was huge! I enjoyed this dish but unfortunately I couldn't taste the cheese. For me the cheese curds are a big part of poutine, but again this is a pure vegetarian poutine, so I can look past that. The fries were thick and I believe they were baked, but I wished they were a bit more crispy though.The gravy is made from smoked mushrooms and it was not too heavy, quite light and very smooth.

-bbq burger - $12:  The onion rings were well cut, not like the skinny pitiful stringy type of onion rings. They were coated with puffed quinoa batter and fried (or baked?), really crispy and delicious! I didn't get to try the burger but my friend loved it.

-Buddha Fresh Bowl - baby size with soba noodle - $11.50: quite disappointed with this dish. Luckily I chose the baby size too, as the normal size would have costed me $17. The tofu steaks tasted like cooked meat. The marinade for this dish was on point and it was cooked to perfection. The peanut sauce overpowers the ingredients and made the dish really heavy. I suppose the fresh vegetables (tomato, cucumber, bean sprouts) were supposed to cut down the heaviness of the dish, but it did little to nothing. My friend tried it and she agreed that the dish was really heavy as well. Furthermore, the soba noodles were overcooked and turned soggy. In my opinion, the soba noodles should be cooked, rinsed and served cold for this dish to work. Because the noodles were hot and sat at the bottom of the bowl, the noodles continued cooking, while soaking the peanut sauce, which made the noodles soggy. I ended up eating the tofu steaks and picked pieces of vegetables to eat lol.

Overall, while my experience wasn't good, I would come back and try other dishes. If you don't know what to order, I recommend ordering the burgers and quinoa onion rings. Although these are vegetarian dishes, they really fill you up and most dishes are tasty, while being nutritious :).",2015-04-16 03:12:50

My burger came and it was gynormous, too pink in the middle and worst of all 'charred'. 'Charred' to the point it had me gagging. I took two bites and didn't touch it again. The waitress asked how everything was before I'd taken a bite (I ate some of my fries first, so my B), and didn't ask if it was okay when I still hadn't eaten it after everyone else was finished. She took it away and still didn't ask. I don't know about the rest of the world but if I'm ordering a $9 burger it's my goal to eat it entirely.

The check came, and wasn't separated (although we were a group of seven 20-somethings that obviously didn't go together check-wise), so it sucked to figure out. We had to write our names down next to our items on the receipt since our waitress couldn't separate it for us. I asked for my burger to be taken off, since it was burnt and I didn't eat it. She told me right away that I should have said something earlier so they could have made me another (I would have LOVED to have been asked why I wasn't eating my burger, if everything was okay) and said she'd ask the manager. The manager took my burger off of the check, and our waitress told me that next time I shouldn't order medium well and it won't be so charred. Funny thing though, everything our party ordered was 'charred'. Including the chicken on the nachos. So I call BS. Oh, and I order medium well burgers everywhere I go and am never assaulted in the mouth by a burnt burger. Red Robin makes awesome medium well burgers. Anyway. In addition to figuring the check out being a nightmare, some of us used cash and should have gotten change, and didn't. The waitress confused us and didn't do a good job with the check.

The chairs upstairs on the deck were wire and extremely uncomfortable to sit on, as a woman wearing shorts. I had the imprint on the back of my legs for half an hour... The bathroom upstairs was creepy. My stall didn't latch shut, and the paper towel dispenser was broken.

It has the kind of bar where you actually sit at the bar and maybe can even talk to the person sitting next to you. Some of the bartenders there are pretty cool too and are more than happy to explain anything on the menu to you and get into a conversation.

Came across this great spot on the Yelp app - on the hunt for something sweet. We skipped the coffee, but sure got our sweet tooth craving fulfilled with one of their delicious waffles.

They have various waffles to choose from with toppings such as nutella, banana, strawberries, chocolate and other sweets. Then they also have savory waffle sandwiches with bacon, turkey - and even egg and cheese!

We stuck with the Banana Tella which has banana, nutella drizzle, almonds and whipped cream. You can make any waffle a ""dessert"" by adding a scoop of ice cream. YES PLEASE! The waffle was incredible. I would of liked more of a ""home made"" whip cream - this one was possibly from the can - but it was still great.

We got the chance to chat up the owner and she was so nice! We asked her about the concept and apparently it started as a coffee shop - then they wanted to add some desserts and decided waffles would be a good fit - then decided to hit the lunch crowd so they added the savory waffles. Genius!

They were busy, like usual.

First thing i noticed was that the dogs all were asleep or sad looking. it didnt look as if they were getting out of the cages. There was poop all over the cages and most of them had not been cleaned, about 65% were filthy. It made me sad for them. I hate dirty cages and would hate to have to sit on my own poop. 

We asked to take out a dog. The lady employee couldnt even tell us what type of dog it was, she had to go look twice. Then she brought us the wrong dog and we had to correct her. Finally, she brought the correct dog..  it was very excited and then was super loving and calm. It was a weenie dog, priced at 1200. Not bad, had its first round of shots and pure breed papers. It had gorgeous coloring, grey and black.

As we continued to look there were two employees in their early twenties running around the store smacking each others butts with towels. Very unprofessional. It really upset me and its the main reason why we left

1) The products used were very oily in how they felt on my skin. Not good.
2) Post facial, my skin did not glow as usual and in fact looked worse, dull. 
3) The bed was heated when it is 110°F outside and so, despite air-conditioning, I felt like I was burning and very uncomfortable. 
4) As soon as the facial was done, as the eye cream was one of the last things to come on, I immediately ran to the shower and washed my hair of all the oil in it and rinsed my eyes out with cold water. Eye cream was applied over whole eye with more than light pressure...Not good! This has never happened to me before!
5) I was sweating during the facial yet the aesthetician didn't seem to notice that at all?! 
6) The scalp massage was not relaxing at all, which is so unlike me, because I find that so relaxing yet this was not. 7) I could not wait for the facial to be over which is never the case with me. 
Overall, the facial cost $285 for a customized facial for 90 minutes, and tip is not included.
I did end up complaining to the manager because I was asked how my services were. The manager was kind enough to give me 50% off of the treatment. What I think she should have done was not to tell me that the aesthetician I had was one of the top estheticians there and many people ask for her because that means they probably have pretty bad estheticians there. She was terrible and I have had many facials at top
rated spas worldwide and know what a great aesthetician is. 
The facility itself is nice, but it is nothing to write home about. I would not pay for treatment here again as too many other places that are way better and way cheaper in Las Vegas.
How this spa is top rated on sites for best spa in Las Vegas is beyond my understanding... because there is no way this is the best spa in Las Vegas. 
This is why I only gave the spa one star: the price is ridiculously exorbitant and doesn't even come close to justifying the price for what you get, both with the spa facilities and the treatment. I will not be coming back to the spa. I am okay with expensive when the level of service matches the price.

Been wanting to try this spot for a long while, but it's hidden downstairs in the Path and only really open during the work day hours, not my preferred time to get froyo. 

There are varying sizes and toppings, with a $6 small size serving up to four toppings, each additional topping is $1 more. The small size is a very decent portion, but I won't judge anyone for getting a larger size.

There are signs all over advertising super cheap specials, but those are only available late at night.

I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The chicken fried steak itself was really tough and the batter was soggy and greasy. I liked the crispy hashbrowns and the generous amount of gravy, though. Service was just okay, pretty much in line with what Raul T. said below.

The highlight of my meal had to be that a table near us had apparently dined and dashed. It was really weird because it was a pretty big group and it looked like a family.

When I arrived at around 6pm, I was the first person in the restaurant.  My first impression was -why is it so dark in here? My second impression was-why are they so expensive?  

With the exception of the Margherita, White Pizza, and two or three other pizzas, the majority of the pizzas were in the $15.00 to $17.75 range.  While I was going to get the Capriciossa pizza, it was the most expensive pizza on their menu and I was put off at the price. As others have noted, these pizzas can be shared but at 12 inches in diameter, they are primarily for one person. 

Contrary to what some other reviewer wrote, these pizzas do not come with complimentary bread.  The bread was listed under appetizers and if I recall correctly, it was listed at $7.00, which I think is absolutely ridiculous.  On their menu, they also had some salads and they only had 1 desert item-tiramisu-also at the very high price of $7.00.

As for the pizza itself, the Margherita pizza I had certainly was good.  The cheese was excellent, the sauce good and crust pretty good  as well although I think it could have been done just a bit more. Needless to say, while I liked the pizza, I did not find it incredibly fantastic.

At the end of the day, the pizza, while good, was just too pricey.  If you look at other notable pizza restaurants in Phoenix- Humble Pie, La Grande Orange, Cibo, and even Pizzeria Bianco, all of the prices for pizza at these restaurants are less money.  While $17.75 for a pizza might be considered acceptable in San Francisco or New York, I've been around and for Phoenix, this place is overpriced .",2010-07-08 04:23:31

On Monday and Tuesday, I got blueberry and regular oatmeal respectively. Ever since Starbucks switched over to fresh blueberries, I was quite disappointed because I actually liked the dried blueberries more. The oatmeal I got on Tuesday was made with way too much water, and as a result, it was soggy and difficult to consume. 

On Wednesday and Thursday, I got a plain bagel with butter. The first set of butter I had was completely melted and separated, so that was extremely difficult to spread on my bagel. The next day, the butter was more intact and I was able to spread it just fine but I did wait much longer in order to get my order. Initially I was also given cream cheese, but this was quickly resolved after I asked for butter, which was what I had ordered.

Lastly, on Friday, I decided to switch it up and get a warmed glazed old-fashion donut that I didn't even finish eating because it just wasn't that good. Maybe food isn't quite Starbuck's area of expertise. 

I did have a nice cool refresher early this week and that was pretty good (but be prepare to shell out the money for these type of drinks). 

In the past, I've actually had issues with this store accepting free refills as a part of the Starbucks loyalty program, I was also charged for drinks even when I stated that I wanted to redeem my free drink. As a result, I've avoided this location for quite some time. However given the location of this place centrally located around the square, and the convenience it is to mobile order (although this whole week I've only just ordered while at the store), I suppose I couldn't help it and ended up coming here way too often for my own good. 

I'm not sure if I'll continue ordering every single day, but I'll probably stop by once in while to grab something to eat and drink. 

Keep in mind, it will get busy in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon as well. So perhaps use mobile order to get what you ordered and get it from the pick up counter to the left side.  Good luck and may your experience be better than mine.",2017-06-17 22:00:12

Coming from all the amazing burger joints in LA, I would say Holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. It beats Umami Burger for sure, is on par with Bachi Burger, but Father's Office still wins. Nothing could beat Father's Office.

Anyway, Holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. The restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. Prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in Cosmopolitan so I think it's pretty fair for Vegas prices. Service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.

I've tried the Gold Standard and the Rising Sun burgers.  Whenever I have these, oh man I am in burger heaven. Gold Standard has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. The Rising Sun has a teriyaki glaze with Kobe beef and tempura avocado!! The avocado seriously is amazinggg. I definitely recommend these two burgers. 

Not only are the burgers the bomb but the alcoholic milkshakes are too!  You can also ask them to be non-alcoholic if you really want that. They have a variety of flavors that they rotate around. You really can't go wrong with any of them. I've had the Frozen Grasshopper, Banana Creme Pie, and Red Velvet before and they were all yummy.

Excitedly, I took my daughter for her first time and the sales guy, with a full face of makeup, asked what she was using. When she responded by listing a couple drugstore items, he gave her such a disgusted look while saying loudly, ""Uh, Oh No!!"" She is young and he embarrassed her. I felt so bad for my daughter. First, I got her the makeup to experiment with. Secondly, a reaction like this is not good for a young lady's self esteem who is just starting to come into her own. Instead of making her feel pretty, he did just the opposite. I have never been one to judge and it was VERY HARD for me to keep my composure, but when it comes to my child; I was ready to give him a bit of his own medicine and let him know that makeup is not looking like a drag queen either. I spoke with her afterward and explained what a parent should when encountered by such ignorance. 
Anyhow, I still return long enough to literally run in, pay, and leave. Their job is to help others choose makeup that will enhance an individual and ring up a sale. Management should be reminded, if we all decided to shop online, there would be little need for a MAC store at Biltmore.",2016-08-14 02:35:11

It was on my birthday and I enjoyed the company and celebration. I didn't let it bother me. When I was invited to go again, and for free, I figured, why not? 
Either I stepped up my steak game, or STK fell off even more because overall- NOTHING impressed me. Wait, I fib, the mushroom pot pie side dish was good enough to order again. So out of a dinner that would have cost $145, the best part was a side dish?!!?

My boyfriend and I ordered the gyoza, a field greens salad, the 20oz ribeye sliced, the mushroom pot pie, and a panna cotta dessert. 
First, sharing is the way to go. Other than the potstickers being extremely small, coming with only 4, and costing $19- I was happy with the portions and servings. They offered to split the salad and slice the steak, very appreciated for things like that. 
They staff was on game, they cleared our plates and gave us fresh silverware after every dish. The salad needed more of the cheese and croutons. That's what made it enjoyable. The steak was just ok. Not amazing, not bad. The bacon butter on top was super succulent. The side of mushrooms came in a classic looking pot pie crust, and when you cut into it there were about 4 types of mushrooms in a creamy sauce. It was the highlight of the night! The panna cotta, never again! Wrong consistency and just all around not enough flavor for me. 

Another downfall- one glass of wine is $17. I understand fancy steakhouses charging more for specialty cocktails, high end liquor, etc. But even then it ranges about $10-$15. $17 for a glass of mediocre wine, is pathetic. 

I get STK's concept. A sexy club feel with high end food. Except that wasn't the vibe I got. More like a cutting corners steakhouse that caters to the local adult industry, rich tourist, and old men who like the eye candy. 
Vegas needs that, don't get me wrong. I am not hating on the adult industry in the least. But when there are well known Vegas working girls that dine there on the regular, it attracts a certain crowd. You wouldn't see those same girls down the street at Herb & Rye, thank God. 

Overall, my favorite part was the DJ bumping 90's jams, and the mushrooms. I will gladly skip out on the drunk, red head tourist sitting next to me screaming, and spilling stinky wine, and the pervy old guys. 
However, Vegas has a place for everyone, this is just not mine.",2014-05-09 16:57:53

Chicken with pesto sauce was okay - thinly pressed chicken but the pesto was missing something. Pretty plain sauce for pesto. The small rigatoni pasta side (comes with lunch special ) has a good tomato and basil homestyle flavor.

(You know I couldn't stay away after the dinner last year.)

I once again gathered up a group of friends and ventured out in the midst of a heavy snowstorm to get in for the final weekend of the promotion, which had an entirely different menu and cost us about $40 per person after taxes.

They had a large number of choices. Appetizers we ordered included:

Beef Carpaccio (my choice): Extremely-thin slices of rich, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth beef under a bed of arugula and balsamic vinaigrette.  I had to augment it with a metric ton of bread (I was starving because I hadn't eaten anything all day), but the beef was delicious and the balsamic dressing hit the spot.

Pasta e Fagioli soup: Macaroni pasta and vegetables in a huge bowl of rich vegetable(?) broth. Two of my companions had this and both reported that it hit the spot, considering how cold it was outside. 

For mains, both myself and one other ordered the Osso Bucco (veal shanks), which included a big, fatty piece of fall-apart-on-the-fork veal, a piece of marrow (which you could eat the meat out of) over a bed of rich risotto. You want something that will hit the spot on a cold night? This is it, full of flavour and rich goodness, and left me wanting a second order.

My other companions also opted for the salmon on a bed of vegetables (they had cod, but ran out due to how popular it was) and big plates of garganelli with a rich cream sauce, sausage and zucchini. Everyone reported that the meals were delicious, and the service was A-one as always - constant refills of drinks, bread and the classic layout of cutlery.

Although I was originally going to opt in for a pie jar like the Canada 150 cheesecake last time, it quickly became clear that the only sane option was to go for the Sicilian bread pudding with Panettone, which was served with a big dollop of whipped cream and was the perfect capper to the evening. Because one of my friends was too full, he offered me his dessert and I got two for the price of one!

Solstice is one of a select few restaurants (including Ruth's Chris and Canyon Creek) that I'd follow around the city if it meant having a culinary experience that's this consistently good. I'm looking forward to the next visit, and the experience was a particular highlight so early in 2018.

Hits:

Lanzhou noodles - these are some of the best lanzhou noodles I've had! Delicious, delicious, delicious.

Misses:

Spicy beef in noodle soup - not spicy enough, the noodles were undercooked, and the beef was not tender at all.

Pan fried pancake stuffed with beef - very hard pancake and very chewy beef with tendons all around in it. Probably the worst dish of the night.

Jiaozi stuffed with pork and cabbage - the first time I got it, it was good. The second time it was gross.

Noodles in home style sauce - looked and tasted like something I would make... from a recipe that I've never tried before.

Beef with chinese broccoli - waaaay too salty and the veggies did not taste fresh either.

Presotea - it's like going to a Burger King and getting watered down coke.. except this is bubble tea. It tastes very diluted and watery and not like Presotea at all.

The fries are amazing, though I should admit they aren't most peoples style.  They are quite limp (but not soggy).  They have a good thickness which allows you to actually taste the potato.  They salt the hell out of them so make sure you order without salt though.

The ranch dressing here is also awesome.  It's thin without being watery.  Normally I like a thick ranch, but wingstop manages to make a thin sauce that's really perfect for dipping.

The wings (boneless and strips) themselves are about average.  They do have some good sauces though (If doing boneless, I recommend ordering the sauce on the side for dipping).  My personal favorite is the hawaiian.  Beware of the mild sauce as it's really watery/runny.",2012-06-01 19:23:05

This is not a typical/full menu Indian place. They have about 5 meat options (including Butter Chicken, Lamb + Chicken Curries and Chicken Vindaloo). These items are either served with Rice or Roti. Their specialty is the Roti. If you are looking for an Indian buffet, or for a larger variety of dishes, or Naan, then this is not your place to go.

That said: If you are a fan of Roti, and you are looking for a budget meal, this place is the place for you.

The curry chicken ordered very spicy was about a 6 on the spicy scale where Jalapeno is a 3, Habanero an 8.5 and Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce a 10. 

That means it started to make me sweat slightly, and I was totally OK with that. I prefer more spicy, but didn't fight too hard for it today.

The food was Excellent however. The Roti is sort of a Roti burrito filled with the meat of your choice...comes out piping hot, and super tasty. This place is pretty inexpensive too and you get a lot of food. if my date and I liked the same dishes we totally could have shared a single order of the Roti.

Well, I sat at the bar still hoping for the ability to order individual slices, but that idea was quickly quashed. Oh well.

I opted for a small ""Big Apple"" and my usual ice tea. The pizza was good, the crust was thin, not too crisp, and a bit chewy.

La Salle À Manger is a true gem.  I loved everything about it.  I loved the location.  I loved the logo.  I loved the interior.  I loved our waiter. I loved the food.

It has been a while since I felt this much love.

I'll break it down, because amazingness like this deserves to be broken down.

The service was impeccable.  Rumour has it that they are always setting the bar for fantastic service.  Attentive, responsive, and friendly without being overbarring.  

The restaurant itself is a delightful mix of raw and refined.  Hanging lights, worn and industrial finishes, and beautiful wood tables.  It's my favourite type of venue, chic but laid-back.  No in your face frills or gimmicky garnishes.  Noteworthy is the glass encased room at the back where meat hangs.  That's badass, especially because La Salle will serve you the whole animal (suckling pig for 12 people at $500).  The night I went they were offering a royal rabbit.  No, there were no bunnies hanging.

Now that you have sense of what it feels like to dine at La Salle, let me tell you what it will taste like.  It will taste like intimacy on a plate.  Simple presentation, but deep flavours.

Their menu changes so what I'm about to tell you may no longer matter.  But read between the dishes.

The salmon tartar (small $15) comes on a wood slab with homemade chips and a salad/slaw.  The tartar was fresh, light and creamy.  The chips were fried to perfection and their greens were bonkers.  It was a simple mix of vegetables but tasted so complex with its different textures and the flavourful vinaigrette.

The trio of brioche or foccacia (I no longer remember) was my favourite: gravlax, proscuitto, and lobster.  Each was distinctly different, but worked together.  I savoured every bite.

For the mains I opted for the veal pappardelle, while my sister had the pork belly with lobster.  

Everything on our plates was amazing.  La Salle does rich and relevant - only what needs to be there is there, and it all comes together in perfect harmony leaving you happily full.

What's more, my sources (and they are a vicious bunch who will tear a restaurant apart for one mistake) keep going back.  Repeat visits are the greatest compliment to any establishment, and the great ones know to thank us for it by being consistent. 

Skip the 'be seen be heard' restos like Au Pied and give your love to La Salle, he'll love you back.",2012-06-26 19:23:25

gOo7ZsSsGnYpHykNfbIjtg,Xxvz5g67eaCr3emnkY5M6w,ZLPAP1YKL56ODigLn4wd3w,2,9,1,2,"Damn, I had high hopes for this place.  Here is how it fell apart for me on Saturday August 17, 2013.  

1.  Major disconnect between how the food is described on the menu and what is actually served.  For example, we ordered the ""popcorn.""   On the menu it is described as ""curried popcorn/ peanuts / coconut / chili // "". Lo and behold what comes out of the kitchen is more of a chewy peanut brittle like Crunch n Munch.  When you advertise popcorn, I expect popcorn (see: Crop, they get it right).  This brittle was way, way too sweet to be served as an appetizer.  It paralyzed my palate.  Very Mild hints of curry.  Whoever wrote the description needs to rework that.  And either dial up the savory hints...or put it on the dessert menu.

2.  Food was not cooked properly.  I ordered the hanger steak which the server assured me I would not need a knife to cut.  I asked for it to be prepared medium.  No kidding, it came out completely raw (now I know why I wouldn't need a knife to cut it).  Back to the kitchen it went.  In the meantime, a server brought me a serving of sorbet to cleanse my palate (nice touch...but again, it was something sweet before my entree) and it didn't really taste like anything.  Hmph.  My hanger steak arrives and it is barely cooked more than it was last time.  

3.  The cucumber salad with the hanger steak was very salty and too cold.  Again, the concept of the dish was good but the execution failed, especially against raw meat.

4.  Desserts are a HUGE miss.  See #1 above.  The chocolate ""sugar"" cookie was neither chocolate nor sugar.  It tasted like a bitter, unsweetened cocoa cookie.  And raspberry ice cream?  Raspberry according to whose palate?  The blueberry sorbet was closer to its description but still not quite right.

5.  We never received bread.  Our server came back and asked us if we wanted more bread.  We said, ""Uh, we never received my bread to start with.""  Zoinks.  And it is allegedly served with ""melon"" butter.  Again, the taste delivery was off. Bread is very good...rustic and delicious.

6.  Service was slow.  Come on.  The place wasn't packed AND it is not that big of a restaurant.

7.  Saving grace of the night?  The cocktails!  The Shady Lane and the Smash made with Maker's Mark were both killer good drinks.  Bravo on that. 

I really, really wanted to dig this place.  I love that everything is house-made.  But there appears to be disconnects and missed executions on the food, not to mention confusion as to what the restaurant concept really is.  Blasting the Black Keys and Rolling Stones at high volume made it difficult to have conversation.  Sorry, Willeyville, but you have some kinks to work out.",2013-08-18 03:04:07

We were seated quite quickly, only 1/4 through a glass of wine at the bar, and the servers were very friendly and helpful with suggestions.

In the wake of my offensive lunch at the gravely overrated Winghart's 2 months ago, I felt I had a duty to warm a seat inside Market Square's other burger joint, the under-heralded Diamond Market Bar & Grill. 

Self-described as ""a casual place that's neither uppity nor a dive,"" Winghart's shatters against DMB&G upon impact. 

My meal's only downside was in the Classic Deviled Eggs, which gets you a trio of bisected hardboiled eggs served with a yellow ""four-pepper sauce."" The sauce, which kicked like an angry stallion, saved the eggs from complete mediocrity. The creamy, yolk-derived filling was scant and listless. The whites of the eggs themselves were akin to silicone rubber. 

DMB&G staff: Contact my mom; she makes better deviled eggs than I've had at any restaurant. Like many of her hallowed recipes, it is simple. Email me. I aim to help yinz. Seriously. Deviled eggs should be on more menus in Pittsburgh, and they absolutely rule when chilled, your deviled eggs' only other saving grace aside from the nice microsalad of pickled vegetables that accompanied them.

I mean, if you guys didn't make such an outstanding California Burger, and your cute, red-haired waitress by the name of Olga (trust me, she's a petite knockout) didn't do her job with such dexterity (they were insanely busy!) and succeed in charming the boots off of my feet, I wouldn't bother. 

That magnificently mushy beef cookie was on-the-target medium rare, oozing with meaty liquids that were absorbed adroitly by the bangin' Brioche bun. A spread of mashed avocado and chipotle-lime aioli furthered the decadence and pushed the burger towards the Mexican border while bean sprouts added a light, healthy, green-tinted 60's (Mr. Big reference), crispness to the body of the patty. Tomato, flawless shoestring french fries, a cold dill pickle, and a swell, creamy, crunchy cole slaw kept it in the realm of tradition. 

And speaking of tradition,as new as DMB&G is, it epitomizes ""classic"" to the point where one could fool a tourist into thinking that it has been fixture in this nook of Downtown for decades. 

A lively, gabby crowd that ranged from young professionals with loosened neckties to grizzled laborers with grime on their foreheads packed the dining room and bar so tightly that I almost went elsewhere assuming that I'd be unable get a table. Taking a chance, I entered the establishment. Fortuitously, a hostess happened upon a small table in a corner of the spirited room, one that appeared custom-made for dining alone and proved ideal for watching the jolly carnival of common folk that unfolded as I indulged in some fine grub. 

Even the bathrooms were tastefully retro and a joy to use. Pin-up girls illustrated by the late Alberto Vargas embellished the clean, white, tiled walls. I normally don't pay much mind to restrooms unless they're exceedingly rank, but DMB&G deserves a citation of excellence for their men's lavatory. The only omission was an attendant. 

With bags full of confections culled from stops at both Prantl's and Sinful Sweets beforehand, I had no reason to order dessert, even if the items on the menu sounded tempting. 

DMB&G doesn't try to be hip. Rather, it strives to impress with platters of good barfood and mugs full of class. Winghart's has been shot out of the sky with an aim as true as Pittsburgh itself. Pretension dies at Diamond Market's doormat.

Typically, I'm able to get good deals on items, but not always. Do your homework, people, if you have the time. Sometimes, the regular, old grocery store advertises a better buy (yay, Fry's!). The coupons are great, especially on items I was planning to purchase regardless. And unlike the coupon mailer states, you do NOT have to bring the mailer with you to the store to receive the savings -- the cashiers have customers covered (thanks, guys!).

Entrees- Panang Curry w chicken - super delicious; shrimp Pad Thai- for those of you who quest for the perfect pad thai this comes very close. The family was impressed. Thai beef salad- not too spicy!!!

Add ons- Brown rice, I think I found a new favorite. It seems like this was soaked or sprouted then steamed. Not a traditional brown rice that barely has the nutrient hulls scrubbed off. Cucumber salad- vegetable candy. ;) 

They added in a variety of dipping sauces at least five different kinds, plus chili flakes and chili dipping sauce.

They have a nice number of taps (12ish?), of course featuring exclusively Middleton, WI's Capital Brewery. This brewery is predictably drinkable, tho lacking a certain edge. I had their Winter Skal, which was on special for $3 a pint. Yum. 

Their fries are well seasoned and tasty (although calling them ""frites"" just doesn't quite fit the style of fry in my book). Their fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce are just as decadently salty as they sound. The Reuben was heavy but flavorful, the meat having been chopped and mixed with a creamy-mayo concoction...though if you're ordering a Reuben with fries, you're probably not on a diet anyway.

A couple of disappointments were the bland and dry chicken club, which barely had any of the guacamole listed as a topping on the menu, and (ok, let me explain) the ketchup. The ketchup was in a Heinz bottle, but definitely tasted, as my boyfriend succinctly put it, ""like watered-down tomato paste."" Details like this always make me question where else the restaurant is cutting corners...

Extra information:

*Authentic Italian cuisine
*2 floors
*Full course avail
*Patio on 2nd floor

Donatello is one of few restaurants located at Elm street and Yonge. I first found out about this place because my friend recommended it to me when we were trying to decide where to go for dinner. I've been to couple pasta places in downtown Toronto already such as Mercatto and Terroni but I am always up for some delicious pasta so I said yes.

We arrived around 7'ish and they asked us if we had reservation. We didn't and the only seats avail were outside on the patio of 2nd floor so we just decided to sit there. The balcony is small but really beautiful with all the rocks and greens creating this cave feel. However, note that there is no heater so it will get chilly.

Ordered: GRILLED CALAMARI 3/5
*2 medium sized calamari on greens for $
*Fresh grilled calamari on top of carrot pieces and salad
*It was a little burnt but there was that very distinct 'grilled' taste
*Sprinkled lemon and pepper on top for flavor
*It didn't come with any sauce nor were there any on the salad
*It was good on it's own but it felt kind of bland

Ordered: LINGUINI VONGOLE 4/5
*Pasta with Vongole(clams) is my favorite type of pasta, hands down
*I was super excited to find this choice here because I didn't see it at Mercatto or Terroni
*They offer fresh pepper and cheese on top
*The bowl doesn't look that big, but it's very deep
*Came with lots of small sized clams (around 15 or more)
*I chose the white wine sauce
*All the soup/white wine sauce sits on the bottom so make sure to mix it well
*I couldn't even finish this pasta so I had to take the leftover home(YAY for leftover pasta)
*This pasta was so good and so far my favorite in Toronto

Ordered: CRAB AND GOAT CHEESE RAVIOLI 4/5
*Off of Special menu of the day for $
*My friend ordered this so I just tried a bite of it
*It comes with 5-6 big ravioli pieces topped with creamy tomato sauce
*Inside is filled with crab pieces and goat cheese
*crab and goat cheese goes very well together, creating a creamy velvety filling perfect for the thin ravioli
*Creamy tomato sauce was bursting with flavor and it went really well with the pasta

Ordered: SHRIMPS ALLA DIAVOLA 3/5
*Shrimps in spicy garlic oil from Lunch Appetizer menu for $12.95
*Around 10 medium sized shrimp dunked in garlic butter sauce
*Sauce is perfect for dipping bread
*This appetizer tastes really good with the complimentary bread
*Shrimp could be a little bigger
*Kind of on the pricey side

Summary: Service was excellent both times I went. Everyone working there starting from host to busser is super friendly and genuine. I love the laid back italian home atmosphere and feel like I can enjoy my meal there without any pressure and enjoy my time there. Next time I go back, I would like to have the full course Italian meal with dessert and wine :)",2011-10-31 14:32:58

Found on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is the steakhouse to be scene at. The vibe definitely matches the hotel being swanky and trendy. The service was attentive and good for a steakhouse. The food - overall a good meal and price was reasonable for a steakhouse. Appetizers and salads - they are big on blue cheese here so if you are not a fan (like me) make sure that you ask that they do not include it on your dish. The bread and dip they give you is great (the bread has a blue cheese butter, but you can't taste it so I was ok with it - the dip is some herb based olive oil and it was phenomenal). The steaks - bone-in rib eye medium rare is excellent and pair it with the foie gras - definitely a luxurious meal with all that rich fattiness. This is definitely a steakhouse to come to celebrate a birthday or just hang out with some friends - I would not say its for a romantic date since the do play music (fairly loudly) and the crowd itself is extremely lively.",2012-04-02 01:45:22

I did receive a generous 19 shrimp per pound ordered, though. (Yes, I lined 'em up like trophies.) The sauce is spicy, but oddly buttery/oily, and I found myself not dipping the peeled shrimps back in the sauce. That is a sad state of affairs. Both HAJC and CC have me redipping in the sauce at all costs.

The Snow Crab (14.99/lb) here was of extremely good quality, and this reason alone is what is keeping my overall rating from being 3-stars. Some of the plumpest, sweetest and biggest Snow Crab I have ever had. I guess the owners figure that if people in Vegas are paying $25 elsewhere to eat all-u-can-eat snow crab, paying 14.99/lb better get you some top-tier crab. Interesting to note that my Snow Crab order was actually 0.9lb on my lunch receipt, so they only charged me 13.00 for the crab that I received. Pretty cool.

A ton of LCD tvs in the space, BUT NONE of them were on HD channels, so we ended up leaving at our game's halftime when we probably would have hung out longer if they had HD channels. The tvs are plentiful, but all kind of small (37"" or 40""?) And the restaurant space is big, so I found myself squinting to keep my eye on the football at times. If they had sprung for 46"" or 50""tvs it would have made a BIG difference. A classic case of quality vs. quantity.

Service was really good. The place seems well-managed. Unfortunately the buttery/oily sauce wasn't my style. I'm sure there are people out there that love it that way. Definitely give it a try, it may be for you. For me, I'll stick to CC and HAJC for my bag of cajun seafood fix!

Sauce note - if you get just the 'ragin' cajun' sauce it comes out like a uniform molé sauce with no garlic bits. No fun. If you add the 'garlic spread' to the sauce it improves, but then it comes out buttery/oily. Maybe doing the 'whole shebang' by adding the lemon pepper cuts it some, but I didn't try it.

First let me say it was so noisy we couldn't hear but that's to be expected since it was the last night of the hockey Stanley Cup.  Server was there promptly and brough wine and beer and took our order.

Considering the crowd the food came quickly but I think mine could have never come and I'd have been better off.  Lamb was chewy and had no flavor.  Not sure where they got it but they should change their source.  Hubs burger was good but not wonderful.  He said it was so so and he does love a burger so this was less than a ringing endorsement.

Not expensive which was good but when we go back next time it won't be on our list of places to re-visit.",2018-06-19 20:26:03

Meat was tender, well-seasoned and not dry at all! However, the batter is quite thick so it was really heavy especially upon the first few bites where there is little to no chicken to go with it. The best part is towards the middle (where all the meat is) but as you move closer to the end, you'll have to eat around the bones which is a little annoying. Its a good snack to eat in the cold as it comes out piping hot.

They don't cut the chicken into smaller pieces in order to retain the moisture so it's not really sharing-friendly. 

Considering the size, I don't think the pricing is outrageous nor is it really fair to compare it to what you'd pay in Taiwan. I didn't regret it but I'd think twice about going back since it failed to leave a lasting impression.

It can be pretty confusing because most people automatically start standing behind whoever is closest to the door without realizing that there are two separate lines (order and pick-up) and the longer one is most likely the pick-up line. So beware of that to prevent wasting your time.

I spent about 30 minutes in this place altogether - 10 or less in the order line and 20 in the pick-up when I came in on a late Saturday afternoon. It wasn't that bad as I've waited longer (ahem* Uncle Tetsu) but it's definitely not a place to go for a quick grab by any means.",2016-01-04 19:18:42

I can think of other places, when to have my lunch
Was everything a Yelper could want to do
I could always eat Vietnamese
I was never told about their ""Nam Nuong""

How can you mend a broken rice?
How can I try the pork and eggrolls now? (tell me)
How can you stop that fish sauce from flowing?
What makes my world go round?


Com Tam Thuan Kieu I would say is best known for their broken rice entree.  I usually go for that before I even think about browsing the menu.  

Secondly, I think their ""Nam Nuong"" is probably one of my favorites in town; charbroiled Vietnamese sausage strips, lettuces, fried noodles, and bean sprouts.  The texture of the cured salty meat and smokiness is accompanied by the crunchy texture of the fried noodles, bean sprouts and lettuce.  Along with this delectable dish is the sauce; which is orange in color with a peanut and what I can only describe as somewhat like a red pepper aioli and red chili mixture.  I could be wrong, but it's definitely the star of the night for me.  

For my entree I went with a broken rice dish of course, which came with the Vietnamese meat sausage, shredded pork skin, eggrolls, pork chops, bean curd skin with shrimp, and shrimp paste.  Yes, indeed it was a loaded dish.  I would say my favorites were the eggrolls and the pork chops.  Eggrolls here are tad bit different from what I'm used to.  The ingredients within is familiar, but the shell itself is what I describe as a crustacean like look with an extra crunchy stickiness to it since it has the tendency to stick to your teeth slightly as you bite into it.  

Overall, Com Tam Thuan Kieu has been around since the start of Mekong Plaza so they're definitely doing something right.  Service can be a hit or miss here, but nothing you can complain about. - Enjoy!",2015-12-21 17:46:50

They have a small counter for buying tickets so tuesdays can be crazy, but they do have a lot of self ticket counters, or you can easily buy your tickets in advance. 

Food is kinda expensive but they have good combos and lots of other options. I would recommend eating before going to your movie if you want to save money.

It's a three storey cinema and they have food counters on every floor but only the first floor is open so I don't really get that.

They often host special events for certain releases at midnight or first showings and those are so much fun! I went to the midnight opening of The Fault in our Stars and it was great except that they changed the room number at the last minute!

Firstly, the service. Our waitress was excellent and she did a great job in being very communicative about food being pumped out a little slower than usual. Only having a few lobster tacos left. And just right from the beginning knowing how to make service flow efficiently! 
Secondly, the food was amazing we all had a combo of the wings, corn, chips and quesadilla as apps and from my knowledge they were all amazing. Specifically corn and wings were bombbb. Tacos were amazing. My favourite had to be the lobster. As well, just to warn anyone not used to spicy. Personally, I found everything had a good kick but those who weren't used to spicy struggled a tad. 
I think the only thing I can comment on was the cake situation. So while we brought a cake my boyfriend called ahead of time and asked if that was fine and no one informed him of a 2 dollar charge per person on the cake slicing.

I'm giving our experience three stars because it's deserving of an ""A-OK"" description, but we aren't lining up our next trip any time soon. 

First and foremost, our seat was in the very back corner of the small, one-room restaurant. Normally I think a smaller restaurant can give off a very intimate feel, but this was a little TOO intimate. I had to stand on my tip-toes to squeeze through to my seat in the corner booth, muttering an apology to the couple next to us as my rear end hovered likely much-to-close to their appetizer (oops, so sorry, that's not very appetizing). 

We visited during Queen's Feast so had a more limited menu, and I really wasn't impressed or even intrigued by many of the first course options. We ended up choosing the lentils, which tasted as I had imagined my lentils would taste (and would typically not be a preference for an app), but they were nicely balanced with delicious ham and chicken croquettes (HIGHLY recommend these as a starter!). 

My husband ordered the lomo de cerdo asado (i.e. the pork loin) for his main course, later admitting that the pork was dry without a sauce and the vegetables on the side were cold. Pretty disappointing. 

I, on the other hand, had a fantastic main course. I chose the Zarzuela (i.e. the Spanish-style fish stew), and it was filled to the brim with delicious seafood. The side of fried yuka was pretty awful (tasted like freezer-burnt french fries), but again, the Zarzuela literally saved my entire dining experience. SO GOOD.

For dessert, my husband chose the flan, and I had the Tres Leches, which was mouth-wateringly tasty. 

One last recommendation if you choose Malabar for your dining experience - go for the red wine sangria. It was very flavorful, a decent-sized pour, and helps you look past some not-so-palatable moments.",2017-01-30 02:04:25

Maybe try blinds/curtains of some sort to keep out the sun?

Ho Su is a Korean/Japanese restaurant where you can get decent sushi and good bibimbap all in one meal. Their food is above average but doesn't particularly shine too brightly but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location to most people looking for a decent dinner out.

Although it's been a while since I've been back, they did have one standout dish that was not only amazing but one in which I have never found available at any other restaurants. It's called Kam Pong Gi. It is basically a Korean version of General Tso chicken but way better!

What I do remember:
The decor
The service

Let's start this off on a positive note, shall we? The decor was awesome. Bright and beautiful colors with a grand stairway. The art and little details all flowed together with the theme. Great for a Mexican restaurant. 

Yes, they were busy. However, the service was so slow that it will go down in my ""restaurant patron"" history as the slowest to date. Seriously? It was a two hour dining experience. If my friends and I didn't have tickets to a concert at the House of Blues, it wouldn't have been as big a deal as it was. Not only that but the food was forgettable. 

Chips and salsa? Forgettable. Margaritas? Don't remember what they tasted like. Tacos? I remember thinking they were OK but I don't recall anything else about the food. That, along with everything else, doesn't make for a good time.

Stir fry sweet rice w/ cured meat, the wok chi in this dish is incredible.  After 20 mins on the table, the bottom inside was still steaming.  Not oily at all, just right.

Duck w/ plum clay pot, a stand out if you enjoy duck and the duckiness/gamey taste.  It is not gamey at all, very refined w/ subtle flavor and the meat is moist and excellent texture.

How good a restaurant is can often be tested by ordering the simplest of dishes and yet, they shine like a star.......

After my last experience, Louis, the founder/owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review. He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me. He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time. We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it.

It was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service. We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non-profit groups like Komen. 

 He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right. Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong. 

By the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back. I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture. 

A week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation. Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor. I was moved by this donation.

Today, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card. So in full disclosure, I write this review.

I ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia. It was like heaven on a plate. 

The mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven. Think Stockton and Malone. Jordan and Pippen. Jay Z and Beyonce. Donny and Marie. Yeah. That freaking amazing.

The Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight. I want more.

On the side, I had the passion mango slaw. It was simply....great. 

This was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat. I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous.

I am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly. 

Last time, I complained about the long wait. Perhaps it's due to the high quality. I'm not sure what happened last time. Maybe it was an off-morning. Read all the other reviews. They are fairly consistent.

I am very happy with my return to Wildflower. I am very glad I gave it another shot.

Went for lunch with a coworker. Sat for nearly 10 minutes without a waiter/waitress coming to our table. We watched people who arrived after us get their drink orders taken and delivered during that same time period. 

The only time when we thought our waiter discovered us is when we got up to leave for a different restaurant. Someone was chasing after us as we walked to the elevator.

The hostess was equally clueless. She apparently didn't recognize us as the people she brought to a table only moments ago and asked if we enjoyed our lunch.

WrXBiv3ylx0xQWzAh9S9tQ,V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg,5,4,1,2,"Kai Restaurant is a Forbes Travel Guide five star and a five diamond AAA restaurant located in Chandler Arizona. 

Kai specializes in cuisine that is Native American tribal inspired sourcing as much regional ingredients as possible. The menu changes with the seasons and this season the menu features many different proteins such as elk, buffalo, pork, lamb and more. 

I found that the service was attentive and impeccable. Besides enjoying a shop stopping dinner this event also was slightly educational from the interpretations of menu paintings described by our server.

Dinner takes about three hours without the multi course tastings. Several amuse bouche are served and tribal flute music plays in the background.

I do note although they say they can accommodate anyone. I am not certain that they actually offer any vegetarian plates. Possibly only one of the salads might be vegetarian style but the other as I was surprised to find out after it was sitting in front of me that it  had squid in it. Ironically the salad was named, ""From The Garden"" I sure wasn't expecting squid and my server offered to make me a new one or get something else. I don't feel it's necessary to remove a star for this one fault since the salad was so absolutely stunning. 

I received the most sophisticated breath taking salad I've ever seen before that truly looked as if it was growing up from a garden with fancy vegetables I've never seen before like a small green with a fuzzy bright red top that I was told was some sort of spinach. The salad was delightful and looked magical. I was told it was a small plate and it was much larger than I expected it to be. 

For dinner I had the Chimayo Rubbed Dry Aged New York Stirp that came with horseradish potatoes gratin, creamed spinach, heirloom carrots with bordelaise sauce. The steak wasn't the most succulent steak I've ever had but it did have a really great crust on it that was very unique. The portion was very large for me and after eating enough I took home close to 7 ounces of steak. Heirlooms carrots were scented with vanilla or something that reminded me of vanilla. I thought the creamed spinach was very good but the potatoes gratin was slightly over salted. 

My husbands Elk Loin wrapped in Iberico seemed like a much more complex dinner and I went green with envy when they shaved fresh truffles over it.

Peanut butter in  mousse towers, peanut sponge cakes, crunchy peanut brittle dust and Jelly Dessert was many layers of peanut taste and very grown up jelly. Blackberry five spice sorbet, poached grapes and red wine hibiscus drops adorned the plate. This dessert really was amazing. It wasn't too sweet and was just right and had many different textures and was delicious.

Waiting for us in the car was a handwritten Thank You Card from the server, two bottles of water and a box of chocolates.

If you attended Devoured this year you might have picked up a card from Kai that would give each guest a complimentary glass of wine and a complimentary appetizer. For two people that adds up to a $70. savings. If you still have your card now is the time to try Kai if you were thinking of doing so.",2015-05-15 15:13:43

Since then, I've been 2 subsequent times and honestly, the girls working can be a LITTLE bit nicer.  It's irritating when I order coffee, get attitude like someone's doing me a favour, and hafta hear girls gossip while I'm waiting for my latté.

I really don't get the reason for an attitude.  You're working in a really busy bakery, perhaps you don't like it, but that's not my problem.  Get over yourselves!

The 2 times that I've been to order coffee, the girls who took my order were not pleasant whatsoever.  They just treat customers like they're invisible.

Since the cash at the coffee bar wasn't working, I was directed to go to the main registers.  I stood waiting in line, right in front of an older female cashier.  After she finishes serving someone in front of me, she just turns, leaves her register, and didn't even bother noticing that I was waiting to be served.

I'd say you roll the dice when you get served.  It's 50/50, half friendly workers/half people who are just burnt out and seem to take out their frustrations on the customers.

Tip:  I believe the baked goods/bread on the racks are fresher than what's in the glass showcases.  Had tiramisu today and it was sickeningly sweet.  Felt like all I was eating was layers of whip cream in between 1 layer of lady fingers.",2013-10-07 01:29:35

This sleek and modern restaurant seats around 30 people? The employees here are friendly and will explain everything if you have never been here or if you are a shabu shabu noob. Service was very attentive. You can tell they just opened and wanted to make sure they were explaining everything and being very helpful. There are cute Asian girls working here too. ;)

So this is how you order. First you pick one of four different serving sizes - 3 oz (kodomo), 5 oz (geisha), 8 oz (samurai), or 12 oz (sumo). I thought the descriptions for the servings sizes were cute. Next, you pick your choice of meat (Angus cut, prime ribeye, Kobe beef), chicken, pork, salmon, combo, or vegetarian. Then you pick your broth- shabu shabu, sukiyaki, or spicy miso. It comes with white or brown rice, veggies (cabbage, broccoli, shiitake, carrots), udon, glass noodles, and dipping sauces.

I opted for Yojie's cut with sukiyaki with egg dip which is $2 additional. I went with the geisha size. The eggs are pasteurized at 140 degrees if you're worried about salmonella. The Angus meat had good marbling compared to the other shabu shabu places that I have been to in Vegas. You can add additional sides or more meat for you sumos.

I will be back and will try the shabu shabu and go for sumo size because I'm a meat fatty and 5 oz wasn't enough. Lastly, I have to mention the hot plates were far or maybe I'm short so I made a mess (sorry!) so be wary of that for you short people.",2015-05-14 03:00:40

Thankfully I don't feel quite as old going to the Library on a Friday night during happy hour. Chris and I went once on a Saturday night when they were apparently charging a $10 cover charge which somehow I avoided (the keep walking trick was very effective). The music being played was good but there was no room to dance...heck there was barely enough room to just stand and take a sip of my beer without getting knocked into. The schoolgirl attire for the waitresses and their dancing on the bar is super gimmicky and makes it look like the Library is just trying way too hard. Because of this dancing on the bar, there are no cameras allowed. After that one outing, we decided not to return on a weekend night.

Starting this summer, we started going to the Library every few weeks on Fridays at 6 pm for trivia and happy hour. The happy hour crowd is very mixed, so we don't feel creepy being there. Draft beer is $3 as are rum and cokes during happy hour. I haven't tried a lot of food--I'm more into the drinking aspect of HH--but I am not a fan of their seasoned fries at all. Much too spicy for me. The garden salad I ate this past weekend was rather large for $4.95 and it was much better and freshier than I anticipated receiving at a place like the Library. My husband is a fan of the chicken quesadillas which during happy hour are $5.20. So not a super spectacular deal, but cheaper than they normally would be. The trivia aspect is a lot of fun and first thru third places get a prize. Our team came in third this past week, but the only slightly annoying thing was that you can't use the gift certificate that visit. So sneaky Library!",2008-08-25 19:14:11

-""The Hangover Cure"" pizza - Tomato, Olives, Soppressata, Double Smoked bacon, Fresh mozzarella, Grana Padano, Chillies, topped with fried eggs
The first one we got was the hangover cure pizza which I quite enjoyed, however it was extremely salty and there wasn't anything to cut down the salt level at all. Not sure if I would want something overly salted as my hangover food, but overall it was decent.

-Peking Duck Pizza - roasted duck breast, enoki & shitaki mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, hoisin drizzle w/green onions, crispy duck crackling: 
This was my favorite of the night. The moment it arrived, there was a strong aroma from the sweet and pungent hoisin sauce, and duck was moist and tender. It tasted just like a real Peking Duck but on a pizza instead of being wrapped in a thin pancake.

-Pork belly pizza - Slow roasted pork belly, roasted sweet balsamic onions, fresh mozzarella, balsamic tossed radicchio: 
The pizza was a bit too oily from the fatty and succulent pork bellies, however the balsamic onions and radicchio brought some tanginess and helped to cut some of that down.

-Prosciutto pizza - grilled artichoke pesto, fresh mozzarella, fired roasted sweet pepper & arugula: 
The prosciutto pizza had the potential to be good, however I was slightly let down by this. The prosciutto wasn't salty enough so the entire pizza tasted bland, maybe it would have been better if the prosciutto was slightly cooked to bring out more flavors. The sweet pepper was a bit ... too sweet and contrasted with the savory pesto sauce, not really a good combination.

-Smoked Chicken - tomato, mozzarella, caramelized onions, sweet peppers, chipotle BBQ sauce: 
I couldn't taste any ""smokiness"" from the chicken, however I thought it was pretty good and the chicken pieces were juicy. The sauce was a bit sweet but had a slight kick from the sweet peppers, I quite enjoyed it.

-Margherita pizza - tomato, basil, fresh mozzarella: 
The tomato sauce was tasteless and there were barely any cheese.... I thought nothing can go wrong with a classic and basic pizza right? Oh boy I was wrong.",2015-09-25 14:34:40

Because as my husband said, ""There's nothing but martinis and mojitos on this damn drink list!""  It's true, 95% of the menu is sugary and girly concoctions, but sometimes I like me a good lemon drop!

Opinions on the drinks:
The drinks are nicely made and tasty and they're all only $5.  My favorite is one of the special ones they have on Wednesdays that is like a lemon drop with basil.  The sangria rosa is better than the white peach sangria.  The strawberry mojito tastes like fresh strawberries.  The red wine is a good, dry one.

Opinions on the food:
This is the money maker right here.  During HH, they have a special food list where everything is $3.95.  My husband and I ordered a hamburger to share.  Wowza, when it came out, it was like the size of a Carl's Jr. burger and it came with homemade potato chips.  What, what, what?  This whole thing is only $4?  And it was a delicious hamburger with melted provolone cheese and a zingy little secret sauce.  The gentleman next to us ordered the spicy crispy shrimp and a sausage flatbread, both of which were also generously sized for the $4 pricetag.  When I went with my friend, we ordered the ravioli caprese.  Very tasty, but it only comes with 3 ravioli.  Come on...you give out a huge burger and chips, but only 3 ravioli?  I was a little disappointed in that.  We also ordered the shrimp and eggplant which has a really nice smoky sauce to it.

It does get crowded during the HH, and sometimes you have to wait a while to get the bartender's attention, but that is what you have to expect when it's a great HH.  My advice: get there around 3:30 so you can find a seat and put an order in before the rush!",2012-06-28 23:18:39

Inside, it was very cozy and warm. They only have 14 tables of 2. They have an open kitchen and you can see the chef's working and the waitresses were extremely attentive.

You can tell that there is a lot of attention to detail as they were constantly scanning. The head chef also walked around and you can tell he was looking at how his food was received by how they ate his food. 

There are 3 choices each of a starter, entree and dessert. (vegetarian, seafood and meat)

My partner and I had squid tempura as a starter, seared beef for an entree and she had a brownie with caramel, cream and almonds and I had ice cream with a berry sauce and cracker. 

The bread came presented in a nice cloth and I liked how 'clean' the presentation was. The bread was warm enough to melt the cheese gently, but not so hot that it would burn your hands. 

The squid tempura was battered lightly and the spicy mayo added a nice kick. Only issue I had here was that the tempura would fall off the squid pieces because I cut it. Then again, I think I would've preferred a tempura sauce and...chopsticks. I don't really like using forks for tempura because it's more messy and i'd like to keep the tempura on the squid intact.

For the beef dish and vegetables, it was quite good. I wish I could have more of a red wine sauce as it was enough for the beef, but not enough to rub/soak the vegetables in. I really thought it was a new type of potato, but it turned to be a sunchoke (never heard of it before). It was like a mashed potato in roasted form without the starchy aftertaste of a mashed potato. 

Dessert was very good. I liked my ice cream as it was the softest soft ice cream i've ever had. The berry sauce accompanying it was sweet, but not overly done. The cracker...let's not talk about the cracker. It was a great combination with cracker, ice cream and sauce.

It was nice egg surrounding some rice that consisted of just rice and bacon - very simple but hearty because bacon and bacon fat is delicious. 

The brunch ramen was great! I've heard complaints of it being too thin because the brunch broth base does not have any pork, but it was surprisingly savory and perfect for lunch. There was also bacon in it, but the standouts were the bamboo, egg, and pork belly. The pork belly was very very tender and the ramen consisted of all my favorite toppings.

It's a good amount of crowd, not too empty but not too crowded. We were able to enjoy a drink by the bar. Drinks, well, they aren't cheap in my book (min $5-7 for beer, min $6.50 for wine, $10 for signature cocktail, $7 for a well drink), but I suppose that's what everyone is charging nowadays. 
After a drink we were able to sit at a table toward the back. My friends ordered the mussels and ""bag of chips"" as starters. Mussels tasted good but were a little overcooked. Chips were fried perfectly. I had the fish & chips for dinner ($12) and it was big enough to share. Fish was fried golden crispy. It came with fries (or ""chips"") and a bow of English peas. My friend had the chicken dish ($19) and came with mac & cheese and fried asparagus. Only complaint on her dish was that it came out a little cold.

On first look, I thought this was going to be the best burger I've had in ages. It had plate appeal, juicy meat and some decent looking fries on the side. It was a good burger, but admittedly I'm not sure if it was the thousand island dressing (which I normally am down with), but something just seemed a bit off in its flavour. It was still enjoyable, but fell a bit short which is the sole reason I've got to stick with a 4 star review.

But the place is quaint and cute and the service is friendly. I've also heard the fried chicken is crazy good, so I'm already looking for a good reason to come back to this side of town.",2017-03-27 16:55:09

This is somewhere you can go for your staples AND for exotic things to spice up your ""grocery life"".

The whole wheat pasta, organic peanut butter, organic dairy products, and alcohol (just to name a few things) are priced well below what you will pay for equal quality items in a ""standard"" grocery store.

Add to this, you can pick up toasted seaweed snacks, soy and flax seed chips (my personal favorite), Goodies from the Zen bakery,exotic spreads, sauces, marinades, you name it!

Do you refuse to eat Banquet frozen meals??? I categorically REFUSE to eat that yuckola --I'll starve first.  TJ's has a giant selection of really, really incredibly diverse types of frozen meals.  Indian, Thai, Chinese, vegan, etcetera.  Like pizza?   The TJ's frozen veggie pizza has yummy chunks of asparagus on it.

I buy my olive oil there too.  They have the best tasting Kalamata olive oil I've ever bought.  I also pick up a masala curry simmer sauce that makes a few cut potatoes (is that potatos?  Dan Quayle has me permanently confused)  and carrots taste like a gourmet meal.

This isn't where you'd go to do your weekly groceries shop as selection and variety are definitely limited.  It is, however, a place to get some hard-to-find Japanese goods.

If you're in the area, stop by for a browse - but I wouldn't recommend coming all the way up here just to check it out.

As a starter both me and my husband chose the pork tacos. We were very surprised when the server brought the starter to our table as there were not one but two tacos on each plate! This is a very generous portion, especially for being just a starter! The tacos were filled with nicely charred, slow cooked pork and pickled cabbage with nice fresh salsa. It had a little bit of chili but not too much. It gave just enough kick. It tasted so delicious and is probably one of the better tacos I've had!!!
For the main I had the pork ribs and brisket while my husband had the seabass. The brisket was so well cooked: it was succulent, tender and nicely charred. The pork ribs fell off the bone as they were so extremely tender and just melted in your mouth! This came with a side of cole slaw and two types of bbq sauce. Personally I was happy that there were no potatoes or other heavy carbs, since as I mentioned, the starter was so big. I also tried my husbands seabass, which was nicely grilled and perfectly seasoned. So far perfect food experience!
For the dessert I went for the cheesecake and my husband chose the brownie. Both were delicious!! The brownie was served warm with cold whipped cream. Awesome combination! My cheesecake was served with blueberries and oh my was it good! 
If you're still trying to decide which restaurant to go for for winterlicious, I can definitely recommend the Carbon Bar! 5 stars out of 5 possible! To sum up the pros and cons

+ Delicious food
+ Winterlicious menu is well worth the money

I haven't had sushi for a while so I thought I would splurge from my usual frugal spending and got the Yoko Bento C combo. It is $14.95. I only gave $18 in the end since I didn't have a calculator on me, so my tip was a little short. However, it was hidden with my co-workers bills so they probably made up for it. Oops.
The miso soup was salty but is that like saying the turkey was dry? The salad tasted fresh. It took some time for our boxes to come.
The chefs seemed to be Japanese as they weren't speaking Cantonese or Mandarin. I don't know what it was and cannot pin it down but my physical reaction was I didn't want to eat the food in front of me and that it was unappealing but that might just be me having a bad day. What I know objectively for sure was the food was average at best. The sashimi was just okay though maybe subconsciously something about it put me off and my stomach felt a little funny after. The sushi and maki were the same quality, nothing special.
I like the bean sprout thing and that was a little above average and this white cole slaw thing in the corner was good.\
Nothing throughout the meal was really tasty.
Bottom line, my meal was slightly below average (60/100), though that could be me. At best, it was just average (65/100 which is lower than what I would call ""good"" which is 70/100 and what I give 80% of the places I visit). I do not know the going rate for my meal so it might be reasonably price I but I did not feel I got good value for this meal. I actually think it is money not well spent.

I wouldn't reccommend this place/location to my worst enemy, it was that bad of an experience. Came here last Sunday with my mom for lunch...we were some of the first people to arrive at 11am when they opened. There was one table of about 5 people sitting behind us, they ahd already ordered their food, but were complaining about not getting re-fills in a timely manner (again it was not busy at all). We sat down and ordered diet coke and water...server tells me you wont want the diet its not tasting good today fromt eh machine. I said okay and took a water also. 15 minutes later brings us over our drinks (i get no water, i got the diet coke she just told me was not good), keep in mind the table behind us hasnt even received their re-fills yet that they ordered 10 minutes before us. Finally get to the food order...i knew it wasnt going to be good when the server didnt write down our order, just tried to memorize it. Server asks me how i want my skirt steak cooked...i said extra-well...she thens says okay it will take about an extra 20 minutes or so to cook your steak...i said no problem as we were not in any hurry. Literally 10 minutes later out food comes...my moms is great, mine ohhhhh boy...my steak was ALIVE, i cut into it and it started bleeding and juicing all over my other food. I also got refried beans but asked for black beans. The whole thing was a mess and i knew when i saw our food come out that fast she didnt put the order in correct. Didnt even bother to offer to make another one, just took it from the table. I didnt eat any of my meal at all.

I, of course raved about it to everyone at the dinner party and it ended tasting like your regular cake - very much oversold.

The decor is very upscale. There are actually windows which allows natural light to come in, along with huge tv screens above the buffet tables which is super modern. In almost all casino buffets you feel like you are in a basement but you feel like you are in heaven. 

Unfortunately, I am not a big seafood fan. I like my protein from animals and birds. It seemed like every other food selection was made of seafood. I like to start with a big salad with alot of toppings but the salad selection here was joke. The prime rib looked extra rare with blood dripping from the meat, ah no thanks. My favorite was the jambalaya. It was thick and meaty. The sushi sucked. The mushroom ravioli was pretty good. The panang curry was alright. The star of the buffet was king crab legs as it seemed like everyone except us was loading up on the legs. I actually enjoyed their delightful desserts much more than their entrees. They have various creamy dessert concoctions in plastic shot glasses. They were the bomb! The petite chessecake was rich and delicous as well.

Our server was awesome. He took care of us and was attentive. Overall, the ambience and the dessert were the it factors for me. If I was a seafood lover, I would probably give this place 5 stars. The food overall I would give 3 stars as nothing really stood out.",2013-10-24 07:52:47

Ahhhhh. It all makes sense now. I can choose between a million different items that will all be prepared in the same amount of time because they just have to be defrosted!

GROSS. They're a huge chain restaurant with a huge following of people who are more comfortable eating somewhere familiar than trying something new that will likely use fresh food and taste substantially better.

Our server was very VERY nice and attentive (Emilie?) And we never had to track someone down for anything. We were sat by the kitchen and I watched the girls working very hard the whole time.
The reason for 3 stars only is the food. Hubby did not like his wings as he likes them and asked for them to be extra crispy. He said he should have ordered them naked. I had the shrimp which was oddly lacking in flavor, since it was supposed to be tossed in buffalo sauce. Fries were very fresh and I also did notice many additions to their menu since we have been here last.
Restaurant was clean but for some reason it smelled like rotten eggs when we first came in. Maybe some gas from the kitchen? It dissipated after a few minutes.
I'd come here to watch games or hang with friends but don't come looking for 5 star food lol. I appreciate the hard working servers and did not see any slacking off, as other reviewers mentioned.

Food I give 4.5 stars. You get complementary biscuits and gravy to start. I want to say the gravy was chicken based. It was yummy.

Green beans had great flavor with the bacon. Fried chicken was good. Crispy and moist. But! The flavoring was actually bland. Maybe  I'm just used to intense seasonings. 
Hubby had the slab of ribs. Ribs were a little dry but sauce was good and sweet.

After that we had the mushroom toast and baked oysters. Oysters with bacon, heaven in a shell. We finished off with the pulled pork over grits and the salmon.

Range 702 is located on Dean Martin just behind the In-n-Out Burger on Trop.  You can't miss from view from the freeway.  The facility has a private parking lot and is pretty big on the inside and in a prime centralized location.

Staff are friendly and aren't snobby like a lot of range masters, especially the receptionist, which I failed to get her name, damn it.  She was cool either way and very helpful when processing my information.

Q is a cool cat who was supervising our lanes and a real down to earth guy.  He was working on a buddy of mines Saiga automatic 12-gauge shotgun that appeared to have ammo loading issues from the drum.  Q provided some insightful tips to my homie and went back to demolsihing his targets while my other friend was killing it at a distance with his Vector and AR-15.  I on the other hand, was mowing down zombie targets in my own lane with my Gen 4 Glock 17.  

The lanes appear to be compartmentalized with sections of 4-5 lanes, great for parties or beginners that what to be secluded from other shooters.  The place is very well kept and safe and included a TV to watch the first half of the MNF game too.  Inside you will also find a pretty loaded snack bar to replenish your vitals after squeezing off sountless grueling rounds.  That's a nice addition that most ranges do not have.   

Range fee was just $5 and there is a huge variety of firearm, rifle and machine gun rentals.  There are other supplies and pretty much everything you need there.  Not sure if they provide gunsmith services, but, you can purchase weapons there as well.  10% off for Law Enforcement too, sweet!

The chef's tasting menu consisted of caviar parfait (extra charge), lobster pot pie, wagyu ribeye, and a selection of desserts.  The caviar parfait is a beautiful layered tower with a crispy potato cake on the bottom, then layers of creme fraiche and smoked salmon, topped off with osetra caviar.  A magnificent presentation and so so so good.  My friend had the ahi tuna tartare instead of the caviar parfait, and despite all the raves about the tartare, I did not find it special.  The wine pairing was Veuve Cliquot yellow label Champagne which is fairly ubiquitous and I think not special enough for the singular caviar course.

The lobster pot pie was exceptional.  Large chunks of tender lobster in a truffled cream sauce.  Holy mackerel, that was good.  The wine pairing with a French Chablis was so delicious as well.  Bravo.

The wagyu ribeye arrived as a few smallish pieces with a few fingerling potato halves and some sylvetta (wild Italian arugula).  The morbier cheese sauce gave it a nice pungency.  The dish was delicious but the portion size was quite small.  I also found the paired cabernet sauvignon a bit timid for this dish.

The selection of desserts was a bit underwhelming to me.  Root beer float was cute but a bit lightweight for a meal of this caliber.  The wine pairing was a 1999 vintage port which I was not impressed with.  The desserts and some of the wines brought my rating down to 4 stars.",2012-04-30 04:10:25

Ordinarily, tickets are $22/person, but I bought it for $14/person.  We took the tour of ""How Pittsburgh Became Pittsburgh"".  Lasted for about 1 hour.

What's Hot
- Good location.  You get an excellent view of the city.  This tour was more of an historical background tour, where they explained the history of Pitt.  I liked that.  Dudes, I like learning and geeking out.  But that's just me.  Hahaha...  Additionally, the dock is by Station Square, which is near the Incline and other restaurants and shops.  
- There's an outside deck and inside area.  It was good weather the day we were there, but the sun was high.  The good thing is that you can go on the 2nd deck, be inside, see everything (at least most of everything) and not be exposed to the sun as much, and still hear the tour commentary/guide.
- Souvenirs.  They take souvenir pictures for you, as you get on the boat.  You don't have to buy them.  It's optional.  You can purchase items (food, drinks, souvenirs, etc...) on the boat.  You can also purchase items back on the dock.  Good thing is it's optional.
- Price.  I purchased the tickets on Groupon for $14/person.  Ordinarily, the tickets are $22/person.  I don't recommend paying full price.  Although the tour is beautiful and informational, there are additional costs involved for this type of thing.  Save yourself the money and find deals, because Gateway Clipper does offer savings.

What's Not
- Pay for parking.  To be fair, this is the Burgh, so parking is not easy to come by, especially by the river.  Parking was $7 and we had to pay cash.  Another downside is that because it isn't charged by the amount of time you park, that means you pay regardless of the time you spend in the area.  I highly recommend you take the Incline and don't just waste money on parking for the river cruise tour alone.  Not worth it.

Recommendation
- Bring sunscreen!  To be fair, it depends on when you take the tour (time of day, time of year, etc...)  However, be aware that if the sun is high, even an hour outside in the sun can at least tan you.

Would recommend this, but don't pay full price.",2018-07-07 23:42:17

Our waiter was friendly and provided some recommendations. I ordered the shirmp Po Boy and a hazelnut latte. The Po Boy was actually quite small for the price but the latte was really good.

While buying a car is a big purchase, I knew what I was getting into since I knew exactly what I wanted.  Once I test drove the car, it was pretty much love.

The paperwork process was fairly easy and we did buy into the extended warranty.  I know, I know - but it's just nice to have a little extra peace of mind.

Overall, from arrival to leaving with the keys, it took 2-3 hours tops.

What did NOT make me happy, though, was when we brought the car home and went to take it out again later with a friend... it wouldn't start.  Seriously?  Seriously.  I immediately called Carmax and, after 15 minutes of being transferred around/hold music, I talked to the sales manager who sent a technician out in an hour to replace my car battery (that's what we'd figured out what it was after I was waiting on the phone).

Cool, the car turned on again... and now I had no radio.  Half of my dash lights were also not on and my USB port was not functioning.  Seems that replacing the battery had blown a fuse or something.

I called in the morning since the office was already closed and had a bit of transferring around yet AGAIN... Finally, I spoke to the sales manager AGAIN (same one) and told him what was going on.  He told me to bring the car over right after work and they would get me a loaner.  I wanted the car fixed THAT DAY but he said they weren't sure what it was so he couldn't guarantee that.

I've had my car two days and barely got to drive it at this point.  I dropped it off, took the loaner, and the next day my car was FINALLY fixed 100%.

Not sure if I just had a fluke experience or what but they did fix it as fast as they could with no hassle and did not try to charge me extra - they have a 30-day policy I believe.

I do wish they would have told me about picking up the green slip at the office, though - my fiance and I specifically do NOT remember being told that we would have to PLUS the paperwork says it is supposed to be enclosed.  (Note: if you have the green slip, you do not have to physically go to the DMV to register your new vehicle, you can do it online).

It was a decent enough experience with everything that happened.",2015-03-05 05:13:18

Love the order from the card menu when I'm hungry and don't want the push-cart experience. Plus they serve dim sum all day.  Dim sum for dinner is absolutely divine at times when the cravings hit (no I'm not pregnant, but do get food cravings from time to time).

Prices may seem a little higher than other places in Chinatown, but food quality is good as the food served is always hot and fresh and very flavourful.

Service is friendly, fast and efficient.  Plus being a regular customer, I always get acknowledged promptly, but I still would have to wait for a table like all customers, so they're quite fair on the first come first serve policy.  And when it's busy they would ask if customers mind sharing tables which makes for an interesting dining experience and I'm totally in favour of that.  I had some fascinating conversations while seated with complete strangers.

Only one occasion so far that I dined alone which was a first at Rol San for me and the server was quite surprised as he thought I was ordering take-out, but still treated me like usual in his friendly manner.  I think the fact I can speak Cantonese is always helpful and they're not judging at all, but treat everyone equally.

You know the place is good when there's always a line-up and on weekends if you're not there by 10:30am, expect a long wait for dim sum service.",2015-04-01 17:40:28

We had a fairly large table (8 or 9 people I believe) but the waiter was perfectly able to handle our orders and questions as if we were a table of 2.  The food came out quickly, and it tasted like they'd been preparing it for days.  Really an A+ on service and quality.

My one thing to point out is that one of my friends found a piece of tin foil in her dish.  Obviously this impressed no one, but when we showed the server, he was embarrassed (as opposed to annoyed) and offered to comp the meal for our friend.  It was very responsible of him, and the fact that none of the rest of our meals had anything wrong with them makes me thing that this sort of thing doesn't happen often.

They have a nice sized patio and a parking lot, the latter of which is a true rarity in this area.",2008-12-04 20:23:21

Random day indeed, but happy as ever. He treated us all to Javier's because he loves lobsters enchiladas like you wouldn't believe. He indeed had that and he said it was amazing. I cannot attest to that since I do not enjoy seafood much, but I will take his word for it. 

As for me, BEST rice I have ever had thus far in my lifetime. I am a big big fan of (Spanish) rice. Anytime I can get it, I will. Unless I already know it sucks at a certain place, then that is a no go. However, Javier's is delicious, moist, mouth-watering. Whatever positive adjective you can think of, that is what it is. I wish I would have gotten more to go, but I was so full it didn't occur to me until later on when I was craving it. 

The next best thing I had was the chicken enchilada and the crispy chicken taco combo. This is usually on most menus of the Mexican restaurants I go to, but of course I had to compare my favorite. The enchilada was good, but not exploding in my mouth good. The sauce was a bit on the spice side for my taste buds, but not too overpowering where I needed to drench my mouth with water. And the chicken taco was stuffed with crisp bites all the way. Usually tacos just have a little bit of chicken on the bottom and that's it, but this one had chicken with every bite. It was really good. And of course the beans were good, but not as good as the rice my friends! 

Next, I washed it all down with a very delicious, but kind of on the small side, pomegranate margarita. They actually topped the drink with fresh pomegranate. It was very good, but for the price, I was expecting an actual margarita glass and not a rocks glass. Still good though. 

Lastly, and my absolute favorite is the decor and atmosphere of Javier's. It is a dark glamour like feeling when you walk in. There was a lot of tree branch designs coming out of the walls, but my favorite was the one that held multiple bottles of what looked like tequila and other variations of liquor.  It was so pretty, I wish I could have it in my future house. The next best thing was the back wall mural of skulls and skeletons. It was just so mesmerizing to look at. I could stare at it for hours, just examining each piece (4). 

This place is very expensive in some areas of their menu, but not too bad in others. My dish was only 19, not sure how much the drink was. I would save up to come here again for sure. Perfect for a nice date night. They also have a bar in the front. Such a neat place.",2013-09-04 18:19:41

I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday a few days early. We arrived at around 7:30 and the place was packed. I should have made a reservation because we walked in and the line of people waiting at the hostess table was almost out the door. We waited to be greeted by the hostess for about 5 minutes before we could give her our names. At first, both of the hostesses were polite and told us that a table for two had about a 10-15 minute wait, so we stood in the waiting area because there were no more seats available. About 20-25 minutes go by and we still hadn't been called up. We went back to the hostess station and asked the girls what was going on. Somehow, they ended up not taking our name down, so we were never added on their wait list. When we asked them how much longer from that point, they told us 35-40 minutes, despite the fact that we had already been waiting. Their excuse was that the kitchen was working at capacity. Yeah. I understand. But if the kitchen is working at capacity, then why did she offer for us to sit at the full-service bar? Sounded like a poorly-constructed excuse devised to cover up a mistake. We sucked it up, gave them our name and made sure they had it this time, and went back to standing. Other groups and couples kept walking in and were being seated immediately. I was so frustrated that I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to leave and go somewhere else, but he said no so we just walked around the Kierland area. 

After about 20 minutes, we got a text saying our table was ready. We walked back, and were seated outside. Our waitress came to take our drink order, and having had so much linger-time before we were seated, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we ordered the Pig pizza as an appetizer along with two Diet Cokes to drink. She came back immediately with two water glasses, but no Diet Coke. In the meantime, we asked for some bread and infamous sun-dried tomato butter to snack on. Five minutes had gone by and she stopped by our table with nothing, and simply told us that the bartender was backed up-- this seemed to be the excuse of the evening all night. I mean, how hard is it to really fill up a couple of soda glasses. Five minutes later, she came back with our drinks, but no bread. It took her about another 2 minutes for bread. 

Right after the bread came, our pizza came. It was absolutely delicious. The meats were so flavorful, the crust was the perfect consistency and thickness, and the sauce was amazing. Even though this place isn't technically a ""pizzeria,"" I think their pizza was better than LGO's Gladiator (similar pizza with two types of sausage).  In the meantime, we ordered our main courses. I got the spaghetti, and he got the short rib gnocchi. 

About 10 minutes after finishing the pizza the main courses came out. My spaghetti was really really good. The pasta, almost similar to a bucatini, was not like most traditional spaghettis. The noodles themselves were thick (larger diameter), and cooked to al-dente perfection. The pasta wasn't swimming in sauce, and similar to the pizza sauce, was very nicely flavored. My boyfriends gnocchi on the other hand was a complete disaster. I seriously cannot explain how unappetizing it was. The short ribs were apparently really good, but the sauce that it came in was SO bitter. I pretty much just dipped my fork in the sauce and didn't want to eat any more of it. After about 3 bites, we ended up having to send it back. We waited a bit, talked to the manager (I'm assuming), and eventually the other dish came out. It was actually pretty good. I can't remember what it was called but it had chicken, spinach, pine nuts and pasta all together. By this time (9:30 ish) the restaurant was starting to clear out. The waitress was nice enough to comp us an apple crumble dessert (that was truly delicious) because we were celebrating his birthday. We ate it, paid about $55 for the whole meal, and left 2 1/2 hours later. All together, the food was really good, but the service was really, really lackluster. 

If the service was even just a little bit better, this place would have gotten four stars in my book. At this point, I'm not too sure if I'd be back or not. Maybe I'll venture out on a day that seems to be less crowded, where all the staff can keep up with demands.",2013-08-15 17:38:09

It's not uber pricey just a lot for food so I make a point to not go there often but once in a while to treat myself and my fiancee.

The garlic fish was good. Probably the best item on the buffet
The butter chicken was ok, not bad
As for the goat curry, the quality of the goat was bad. I would advise them to either not serve such meat or change the menu selection.
The veg selections were just ok. Nothing special. Even their vegetable chow Mein barely had any veggies in there. 
There was only one dessert item. Which was blaaahhhh. No dessert options.
The appetizer of papdi chaat--useless. I took one bite and left it.
Service was good though. Staff was courteous.
I think this buffet that they are serving should be priced no more than $8.99.

While the menu, friendly service, ambiance, etc. are still mostly the same; the pizza isn't really what I remembered it to be.  I used to love love love their wood fired pizza and thought it was some of the best around.  I just remember the crust being perfecto.  Anyway, I don't know what happened on my recent visit 2 nights ago.

For an appetizer we ordered the garlic/jalapeno/pumpkin seed oil dip.  I didn't like it and thought it was a weird combination and bitter tasting.  Their homemade, wood fired bread on the other hand is excellent.

I forgot the exact pizza we ordered and can't find the menu online so I'll try my best to describe it.  We ordered a pizza with 1/2 being something with the homemade sausage and the other 1/2 veggie something.  The homemade sausage is excellent and I could probably just eat a plate of that by itself.  Anyway, the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  My complaint is with the crust.  It was very soggy.  I'm guessing maybe it wasn't cooked long enough or the fresh veggies were watery and it seeped through to the crust.  I just don't know and it wasn't what I remembered or expected.  Next time I am going to try a plain cheese pizza and see how it goes.

Our waitress was very fast and friendly.  The owner come over and talked wine with my wife and I.  We always like it when a restaurant's owner takes the time to chat with us.

A gentleman greeted me at the door and said to sit wherever I wanted.  He brought a menu and said the server would be right there.  After a few minutes, she hadn't come out of the kitchen yet.  He asked me what I'd like to have and I asked him what the frittata of the day was.  He said, ""I can make you anything you want.""

""A"" Mountain (proper verbal spacing and timing required) is a staple for many in Tempe for running and staying active. I love coming here in my morning runs and using the steep paved slope as a tool for my training. Please keep in mind that we are talking about a super-steep climb. The place is great and proper for morning workouts, but can be a pain at times for a couple separate reasons. One of the primary reasons is that A Mountain now requires payment at its base, with parking meters being installed about 1 1/2-2 years ago. Now I have to park at the Tempe Beach Park parking lot and walk 10 minutes to the mountain if I want to work out without paying a dime. What a crock of __insert word here___! Also, the crowd you get can sometimes be unsatisfactory given space constraints at certain points.  You'll have grandmas you have to cut off and my personal favorite: ""Tad, the sports Jock from the OC who moved to Scottsdale to find himself"". You know, the  sporty jock type who will cut you off and return the favor.

Aside from these guys, its a short hike with OK views of the East Valley. I suggest this as a good hike for health-conscious locals, and that's about it. Otherwise, skip this one and go for South Mountain and others if you want some nice views. Pretty simple.

Some of the locals were raving about this place.   They told us the food was top notch and you will never find anything better.   Throwing caution to the wind, we decided to try this place.   Boy were we surprised.   

You have to understand, this is a hole in the wall joint.   I usually like those places because they try harder to keep their customers coming back and the food is not pre-made.   

I should have known things were going to be bad when we got into the restaurant and met the hostess.   She is a dwarf, or midget or what ever the difference is, I don't know.   Let's just use the PC term and say ""Little Person"".    Well, we were not greeted by a smile, but just a look that said ""What the hell are you staring at?""

This gal puts us in the enclosed patio which, while air conditioned, is where they seated two families with unruly kids between 3 and 8 years old.   (Watch for my upcoming review of Scottsdale later.)   

Ok, so this hostess brings silverware, chips and menus at different times.  Each time she stopped by, we made eye contact, smiled and said thanks.   Still, we got the glare of death from this woman.   Ok, whatever, we tried to be nice.   So after that, any time she brought something over we barely even acknowledged her.  That seemed to work out the best.   The waitress was a little better, although she had a hard time talking over the little monsters in the room with us.   I found out if you want to drink your beer out of a glass rather than a can or bottle, you have to ASK for a glass.   Ok. Fine, I can adapt to that as well. By this time, I am thinking the food better be freakin' awesome.   

Well, dear reader, you have seen the rating I gave it so you can figure it out for yourself.   My dining companion had a chicken mole dish and I had a beef chimichanga.    The mole sauce was way too smoky.   It didn't have any of the rich, smooth or savory flavors it's supposed to have.   It's almost like we were eating something that had been smoked over a hickory pit for a month.   Surprisingly, the chimmy wasn't bad at all.   The shredded beef was cooked and seasoned just right.   So, I have to give them high marks for that.   The standard rice and beans sides were very forgettable.   Hopefully you are not too hungry when you go there as the serving sizes are not that generous.   

Will I go back?   No.   I will try most everywhere else in Scottsdale before returning there.",2006-07-04 06:31:01

I wanted to like this spot, it is in my hood and I love the rooftop. It started off great, but somehow the kitchen stopped giving a darn about the quality of food they put out. Maybe they changed the head chef? We have probabaly been here a total of 8 to 10 times, but the last several visits have been a disaster. The brunch was cold and tasted like it had ben sitting out for several hours before it was served. Not to mention, every time we called lately we got a different answer on whether or not reservations were needed. We were turned away last time, because we did not make reservations, but I was told on the phone we did not need them? Get your act together people, and for our sanity please hire some decent waitstaff.

I got the traditional eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Irish eggs Benedict. It was good, a little lacking in flavor but okay. The potatoes, however, were extremely bland and lacking of any seasoning. I needed to add salt and pepper to my entire meal, which came from these dirty looking tin cans sitting on the table. I noticed the portion of potatoes they gave us was extremely small, I felt gypped! I almost said something but decided not to make a fuss over it.
The waitress brought us a glass jar filled with ketchup for the potatoes...I didn't like this at all. The jar had some dried ketchup on the underneath side of the glass lid and it just looked greasy on the outside with finger prints all over it. It just bothered me. I know they're trying to be cute and unique but really just leave it in the original ketchup bottle.

Also this isn't a large eatery, with only about 10 tables. The size doesn't exactly bother me but when you have a baby at the next table screaming, the entire room gets tense, you can actually feel it. But it's not the size of the room its how they use the space. The Farm House in Gilbert is also a very small space but it is extremely warm and inviting, Mark's Cafe lacks this. 
FYI, if you haven't tried The Farmhouse off of Gilbert just south of Guadalupe, please do, it's incredible, but get there before 8AM or you'll be waiting in a line that goes around the building! Wonderful place!

Just a side note if the owners ever read their Yelp reviews. We noticed they were playing religious music, which didn't bother us even though we're not religious, but for the sake of respecting EVERYONE who comes into your place of business it would be a good idea to be neutral so you don't lose customers.


All in all this place was mediocre at best. I definitely felt it was over priced for what you get. Service was fast and friendly so that was a plus. However, knowing that I can get better quality, better tasting food, with cheaper prices elsewhere has me thinking we may not be back. We often go to Crackers Cafe on Elliot and Priest which is excellent. We've been there over a dozen times and every time it's a win. Wonderful food, great environment, friendly staff, and prices that make you feel like you're getting a great deal. Mark's Cafe is over priced with a lack of comfort in their decor and food.",2013-02-23 20:04:58

For a group of six, we ordered the platter for four and extra cabbage rolls and potato pancakes. We we warned, it's a lot of food (in the nicest of ways), but not in a ""you can't eat all that"" kind of way. But in a ""well done, this will be enjoyable!"" Way.

Best part for me, the schnitzel dipped in the dumpling sauce. Only issue I had was I could barely tell the difference between the pork and chicken schnitzel.

The cabbage rolls, potato pancakes and sausage were all amazing. I'm not a fan of the dumplings though (not to be confused with the perogies). They are basically just dough in a great sauce.

Since was in the area and all my tri friends was telling me need too check this small little restaurant out literally walking distance from the finish line. Hell yay! Talk about busy sure having pumpkin race was obvious reason but probably just as much once walked in realize that the restaurant been on DDD. So even more excited too try the food out because comes too DDD or Man vs Food. I like too check out the restaurants if given the chance. 

The decor is pretty crazy. I love the old school breakfast counter look (the whole counter area was filled too the max) or throw back dinner look. On the walls its all over the place but enjoy the long board, and lot of the stuff with surfing or things use too growing up in the islands. Really everywhere you turn you head like different scene with the decor.

I ordered simple just reuben sandwich. Sometimes its the simplest dishes that can be the easiest ones too mess up with food. At The Coffee Cup they do amazing job! The bread was perfect nice crispy, nice portion size of corned beef on the inside nice and hot, the sauce believe was thousand islands but whatever the case brought the whole sandwich together, and less not forget the sauerkraut that was good too. The fries were fries nothing special. It was perfect reuben sandwich too end long day of races and really the whole menu looked great although can only talk about the reuben. It great laid back old school atmosphere that get together with friends over coffee, breakfast, or lunch just chill. If I loved closer too Boulder City would come by more often.

Food is ok - about what you expect.  I ordered the Happy Family asian lunch.  It was ok - smallish portion and flavor was ok - somewhat muddy.  The ""Spring Rolls"" are 5 bullet sized (and strength) morsels that are not what I expected.  Over cooked and really not much more than one or two bites.  For the 5 bucks - I'll pass.  The bigger problem was my dining companions meal.  The Thai salad ordered looked great - he ordered the chicken addition.  All well - presentation is great.  But that's the problem.  The bowl used is one of these fancy-pancy ones where the front is much lower than the back with a small 'foot print' on a small square plate.  The salad is loaded ""back heavy"".  You use your knife/fork to cut the chicken - and it all flips forward - filling your lap/shirt/table/seat/floor with dressed salad and chicken.  Brought the issue to the servers attention - no offer to replace/reduce($) the salad... and I wonder if management will hear/do anything with the information that the bowl selection for the salad is not good.  Thumbs up for keeping the soda filled ... and for the dealer busing on Black Jack!  But the meal today...  Fail.",2016-01-04 23:19:05

The locations is pretty, inviting and quiet; Pandora plays in the background - loud enough to enjoy, but not loud enough to drown out your conversation.

And conversation there is! It's a wonderful community where the regulars meet of all ages, talking about their families or getting together on Saturday/Sunday afternoon to catch up. Otherwise you can come in do get some work done, discuss your newest project with your coworkers or just fill out job applications and yelp reviews like I do. 

The Service is friendly and pleasant and the coffee is good. Personally, I have been opting for the Tea which is served in a larger pot if you are dining in. Not the highest of high quality, but after all, it's a coffee shop and not Tea [plus my mother spoiled us with Marktfrau back in the day]. When my roommate vouches for coffee, I listen, and Enrico's has been T' approved.

Only dined in once, but I usually order to go. Whenever I'm here, there's usually only 2-3 other groups eating here. They get a lot of pick up orders - while I was eating, there was probably 5 people that came in to pick up their food.

Anyways, we ordered Chicken Panang, Khao Soi with Chicken, and Seafood House Fried Rice. There are some reviews that say their food is average - I think it's great and very flavorful. If you're not a picky eater, you'll enjoy this place. They cook their food here on the spicy side, but I like it that way. Also, they charge $1 for extra ingredients in their foods, such as basil or bamboo shoots. One downside is that their food does take somewhat of a long time to come out, but the servers would always check back to our table and update us when they can. This isn't a super big restaurant where there's lots of people cooking in the back so I understand. I like this place, so I can be patient about waiting a little longer than usual for my delicious food.

Sidenote: Overheard a conversation with another customer where they got her chicken satay order wrong and a lady employee here, who I'm assuming is the manager, insisted that a make-up order be made totally free of charge for her.

My first trip: I bought lamb dumplings and aloe - they were reasonably price and they accept credit cards so I was happy because I don't know much asian grocery stores in Phoenix.

My second trip - I came here for lunch with a coworker who recommends this place for cheap, affordable and good Chinese food. I couldn't decide what I wanted because the food just looks okay, it didn't look appetizing in the hot food section. I decided not to order the food that was sitting there so I decided to order something else. I went around to the other side where I can order food ready to cook. I couldn't decide what I wanted. I always love chow fun (with the sauce or the 'wet' one) but I didn't see it on the menu. I decided to try to the singapore noodles. 

The service is slow but the guy at the counter is nice. He has decent English. I asked for hot sauce on the side and he was happily able to accommodate. 

Now time for the food - the singapore noodles came in a styrofoam container (I hate these containers but I think it's because living in SF made me realize I rather use non-styrofoam containers). The noodles were short, I expected them to be longer. The flavor was decent but it could definitely have more flavor to it. I didn't taste msg or anything in my food. There were a few pieces of shrimp, not too much. It had bbq pork in it too, just a little pieces. There was a lot of noodles and onions, it would have probably been better with a tab bit more vegetables and meat. Overall, it's decent. I probably would go again and try a different dish. It's not that expensive. One dish can last 2-3 meals and it's about $5-6, so not too shady!

My nails are natural super long and all I get is SNS. so if your like me DO NOT get your SNS here. I got them done on Sunday. Within 3 hours the SNS on my left thumb had completely cracked. That's not even the worst part. Every one knows you soak your nails and use a DRILL to remove the SNS why does the guy use a nail file! It was so tough. I'm not talking about the smoothing out process I'm talking about the removal of excess SNS product. He ended up breaking my nail completely off then tried to act like it was broken. I'm like I didn't have any broken nails when I came in what are you saying ?? They also charged me five additional dollars because of the length of my nails. But I still tipped and paid. But I will not be going there for SNS services any time soon.,2017-07-29 00:56:08

1. #12 Pho tai chin, 8.05 Large 
2. #60 Com ga roti, 8.05 
for $20

- Conveniently located right off the 215. 
- Legit Viet restaurant! Cramped seating. Waiter speaks Viet to take our order. Grandma serves us our meal. Pay at the cashier after you finish eating. The only thing missing is a sign that says cash only! haha! Love it! 
- Pho tai chin: noodle soup with rare eye round steak and well done lean meat
Steaming hot when served. Broth was good, but average. I liked how the well done meat didn't have a lot of fat on it. Need more bean sprouts and cilantro. 
- Com ga roti: roasted Cornish hen, served with French rice or steamed rice, 8.05
Delicious French rice. They made it crispy and dry enough where you can still taste the tomato paste and not soggy. The chicken was a bit burnt and quite small. They did give plenty of vegetable sides and broth side soup was a good compliment. Seems like the side soup is what they would use for their wanton soup. 
- Viets eat here so you know its good.
- It takes hours to make the broth of pho bc you have to cook the bone. Just because its fast, doesn't mean its old. It's marinated. 
- Prices are cheaper than others in Henderson. I think this place gets mixed reviews since it's Henderson and expect American style service.

I'm so glad she did! There is a distinct lack of really good sushi in Phoenix. Much of it is overrated and overpriced, or it's some chain restaurant. Harumi is neither.

We got the sushi sampler plate, that came with slightly smaller versions of three different rolls, the spicy tuna roll, and some yellowtail sashimi. For the sampler, we opted for the Crazy Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and the Vegas Roll. All three were excellent, but I think my favourite was the Crazy Roll. It had salmon, tuna, and avocado, was wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed, and was topped with masago. I'm almost mad that I had to share it. The Vegas Roll was good, but fairly typical, as was the Rainbow Roll. The Spicy Tuna had enough kick to actually make it interesting. The sashimi was fresh and flavourfull. 

My only issue was that the rolls weren't sticking very well. They kept falling apart. It didn't affect the taste, obviously, but dealing with rolls that won't stay together can be a pain. I love the use of the purple rice! It added a little something extra that you don't usually see at other sushi places. 

The place is small, so make sure you time your visit right. As it's smack in the middle of downtown, it gets slammed at lunch during the week, as I understand. Dinner time on a Saturday wasn't too bad at all. No long lines, no long wait time. Our rolls were delivered pretty quick after we ordered them. 

Note: if you are not a fan of the owners of restaurants talking to you during your meal, be forewarned... the owners are very chatty! But they didn't really disrupt our date, which was good. 

I'm going to say that Harumi is definitely a) on my list to go back, soon, and b) the best sushi I've had in Phoenix.",2016-07-25 20:27:40

The music and ensuant dancing yesterday evening was typically corny, and the people on board were there for birthdays, bachelorette parties, and in our case, the 50th wedding anniversary of Kay's grandparents.

It sounds like the synopsis for a bad disaster flick, doesn't it? 

We rode the river on a leviathan of good times and nostalgia called The Majestic, that with a capacity of 1,000 passengers, is by far the largest boat of the fleet. A beauty to behold, she has 3 decks, the top one being outside, giving one a unique perspective from which to see our controversial city (unfortunately, not everyone thinks we're as 'livable' as surveys suggest) as well as a way to get some fresh air. 

The largely middle-aged crowd was in fact shakin' to tunes bashed out by a tight live band fronted by a short, greying man in a gold sequins jacket who was possessed by the spirit of James Brown, defying his age by falling to his knees and rising back up like a teenager sans a single bum note. He should be a star and was the apex of the evening's festivities. 

What else can I say about The Majestic?

*The ride itself is so smooth, it's easy to forget that you're moving

*Our Captain's Dinner Dance Cruise lasted about 3 hours. Shades of Gilligan's Island? ""A 3 Hourrr Tourrrr...""

*The buffet meal, which consisted of salad, prime rib, stuffed chicken breasts, and a few appetizers (veggies with dip, popcorn chicken, and breaded ravioli) was middling. 

*There's a bar in the back. Drinks can be ordered and brought to your table by a server. Some of the specialty drinks come in a special, keepsake cup. My non-alcoholic Captain's Orange Fizz (orange juice and ginger ale, shaddap) came in a massive, blue 50 ounce glass I suspect my mother will use as a  vase. Refills on regular soft drinks are free. 

*The staff is polite, enthusiastic, jovial, and appears determined to make sure you enjoy yourself, even if it's not your thing, and to be candid, I can't say it was mine. 

Not that it's an ordeal, but to me this is one for the out-of-towners and older folk. I.E. Take your parents or grandparents. If my grandmothers were both still alive, I can guarantee that they'd have had a grand time.

P.S. I thought I used to harbor sufficient disdain for disco.

After having been coerced into ""getting down"" by my date, that disdain is now even more profound. 

Pillory that chintzy music, white boy. 

P.P.S. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know they have other kinds of bands gigging on the boats. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens performed on one with his Judas Priest tribute band British Steel for a Halloween show shortly before he became Rob Halford's interim replacement in the very band he was paying tribute to.

The person I went with ordered the sashimi/sushi plate for around 15.99 and they enjoyed their meal too. The presentation was really nice, the food was presented on a wooden board with decorations such as a miniature fence and cherry blossom tree to mimic a garden. A+ for style points!!

I went with the Rude Dude (""double cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato & Rudy sauce"") and it was glorious. The griddle-cooked patty contained an absolutely irresistible crust that I honestly couldn't get enough of. The meat itself was pretty juicy despite having been cooked past medium. The toppings were nothing short of perfect.

Sadly, the meal was not perfect. We also got an order of fries to share and they were, quite frankly, terrible. They were a little undercooked and completely underseasoned.

We also ordered the chicken wings that were tossed in thai chili, salt and lime, but they were not your traditionsl wings. They were 3 wings on a skewer, but they were boneless. One of my favorite dishes was the TeriChikenDon. It was a bowl of white rice with crispy chicken over it, and a fried egg on top. If you break the egg, the yolk gives the entire bowl awesome flavor.

On Decatur between Hacienda and Russell, it's a relatively industrial area. I went because I have been craving chicken fried steak, and this place popped up on yelp. I book marked it and visited when in the area.  

Close to the strip, so compared to the hotels, the prices here are really favorable.

I ordered the chicken fried steak ($10.50)-came with choice of 3 eggs (soft scrambled), potatoes (hash browns), and toast (biscuit). The gravy was creamy, thick and included not only ground sausage but bacon pieces (my waitress told me about the bacon-had she not, I'm not sure the taste was noticeable). The hash browns looked perfect (I was trying to assess whether fresh potatoes or from bag/processed-I couldn't figure it out for sure). The crust was perfectly fried and the flavor of the chicken fried steak was pretty good. The eggs did not have a lot of flavor and assumed it was carton/processed scrambled eggs. 

The Pros: 
- value (good/large portions for the price). 
- the owner and staff are very friendly and communicative.
- I ordered, literally, before I sat down in the chair at the table, food came out fresh and hot, 10 minutes later

The Cons:
- the parking lot is busy/full on weekdays - little strip mall with at least 6 other businesses 
- wait time can be unexpected. I went on a weekday at 11:45ish, and the wait was 15-20 minutes-the est. was right on
- the atmosphere is not great. I think overall, it felt a bit dirty.
- I sat by the kitchen door and later (after I ate half of my meal) noticed that the shelves had a lot of cans (tomatoes, beans?) and boxes (biscuit mix). I prefer when I go out to eat minimally processed/fresh/scratch made food. I can use pantry items and boxed bake mixes myself. I wondered more about how scratch made my meal was-this may seem kind of nit picky, but when you go to small mom/pop places, I think it is more likely/expected.

Overall, my visit was OK. Would I return, maybe, but only if close by. I also would have to consider the time/day as I gather (based on other reviews), the wait time can be long.",2014-12-18 09:09:16

I ordered the Crab-Scallop Cake Benedict while my dad ordered the California Fish Tacos.  Both sounded good on the menu.  BUT, the fish was over battered, with very little meat, and the batter itself was thick, heavy and the oil tasted old.  I was also disappointed to get a deep fried crab-scallop cake over a thin toast crisp that was slightly soggy.  The flavour of the cake was totally masked because it was again over battered and over fried in stale oil.

The decor was beautiful, the service was adequate.  But I will never submit my stomach and tastebuds to this kind of torture again.

I had to attend a conference at Mandalay Bay and instead of paying the outrageous prices for a hotel room we decided to stay at the Grandview Resort. Luckily it is only 6 miles from Mandalay Bay which is essentially the southern part of the strip. This means that if you want to venture into the heart of the strip it is a little further. I've heard that the resort provides a shuttle that you can purchase for the day but since we rented a car for the week on priceline for under $200 we never used it.

We stayed in the Daisy building which was extrememly nice. Modern decor, granite countertops, flatscreen televisions in both the bedroom and the living room, and a large bathroom with both a shower and jetted tub. It is a small walk to the pool but we didn't mind it, and I'll tell you why. Parking can be a nightmare here. They do have a parking garage but it is at the end of the resort..........and right next to the Daisy building! Being Vegas we would never come home before 11pm and there is not nearly enough parking spaces for the number of rooms they have, hence the need for a parking garage. So we figured it was the lesser of two evils to be closer to the parking garage than the pool. We would rather have a short walk when we come home after a late night than a short walk to the pool. But alas, only our opinion. 

The room itself was very clean and they provided you with many items I wish we knew so that we didn't pick them up at the store. We stopped at the grocery store before checking in. They give you several coffee filters, a package of coffee, dishwasher soap, and one load of laundry detergent. They don't give nearly enough shampoo and conditioner so I would pack more of that as well as body soap. For the ladies, they do have a hairdryer so you can leave yours at home. 

The full kitchen has all the silverware, pots and pans, and cooking utensils that you need including a microwave and full fridge, as well as a dishwasher. Not too much more I can mention about the kitchen.

The king bed in the bedroom is extremely comfortable, and I looked forward to falling asleep between the sheets every evening knowing that I will be getting a good night's rest. The pull-out bed in the living room couch does have a thin pad and so not as comfortable for those sleeping there. 

Checking in was fairly simple but beware if you don't want to take a tour. After hearing some of the other reviews here we decided not to take the tour and save ourselves from a possible headache. After you check in they direct you to the place to get your parking pass. This is also the place they try to get you free or discounted show tickets in exchange for a resort tour. If you don't want it then just politely refuse and ask for your parking pass. They will try to pressure you a little but if you stand firm then they will just give you your pass and walk away. This is also the place we got a coupon book for the Southpoint Casino next door and VIP passes for nightclubs. Make sure to pick up some of those because they're free!

We saw two shows there, Matsuri at the Imperial Palace and Blue Man Group at the Venetian. Matsuri is what I would call a stripped down Cirque du Soleil show. All the performers are Asian and seating is done by tables. Our family got a front row table and had an amazing view! It's basically a show of dancing, feats of strength, agility, and balance. Not as big a production as some of the other shows in Vegas but a good one none the less. My 7 year old nephew was even called up to help perform a trick. I'm sure it's just a gimmick to get you to buy a photo or two (which we did!) but he did have a good time and you can't put a price on that. All this for only $45 bucks a ticket, but we did find a discount online.

The second show we saw was the Blue Man Group. To tell you the truth, I wasn't as impressed by this show. I may have had higher expectations but it basically boils down to 3 bald men painted blue making some music with PVC pipes and their band as well as making a mess with paint. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable to watch but I did get bored more than a few times. I just don't think it was worth the $80 bucks we shelled out for each ticket, and this was discounted online! 

All in all it was a great place to stay and we really didn't mind being a little further from the strip. I'm sure there are some people who would love to stay in the strip, and we would too, but I just couldn't justify spending all that money for one of the strip resorts. I'd rather save that for a good meal, shows, or GAMBLING! They do have a free business center where you can look up stuff to do and print boarding passes but you only get 20 minutes so beware of your time. We almost got timed out buying our show tickets. If you want wireless you have to pay for it but if you have a smartphone look to see if you can tether it to your laptop. Luckily we could with our phone and could play",2013-10-04 18:52:00

A little about me:
1. I love music
2. I hate festivals

Why do I hate festivals?  Well, first off, I don't want to camp.  I want to sleep in a real bed and take a shower, and occasionally cool off from the heat.  Lollapalooza was a pretty good festival candidate, but it is just too big and the hotel prices are too expensive.

This past October, I stayed at a crappy motel on 13th & Fremont for $45/night.  During a weekend, during a festival, that's amazing.

Also, the weather was perfect.  Not hot at all, and not too cold either.  So happy to see a festival not in the dead middle of summer.

On top of that, it was run fairly well for a 2nd year.  Food options were plentiful and delicious, stages never seemed too crowded, even for the headliners.

I really don't have much negative to say about the entire experience and will 99% be at 2015's festival.",2015-03-05 09:13:58

My mom and I both had the Acapulco Cheesesteak. Its got roast beef, some kind of Mexican cheese, red peppers, onions, and chipotle sauce! The sandwich was so good. Rich. Flavorful. Stacked. Fillings falling out of the sandwich! It came with a ""salad"" on the side. It was some lettuce with dressing on it. The balsamic was really good though. 

My brother had the Sheridan. Which was also stacked with turkey, salami, cheese lettuce, tomato and some spicy mustard. My brother can put down some grub but he was only able to finish half of his sandwich and half his side of kettle chips. 

Alisa was our server and she was really sweet and helpful. She was super with my son. Its always cute to watch my 7 year old flirt with a waitress haha. Okay so the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because I didn't go here alone. Based on the opinions of the company I was with saying that our server should have come around more I have to drop one. I think if our table as a whole had been 100% satisfied with the service it would be 5 stars. 

I love that the soda pop comes out in bottles with an ice filled glass to kind of self serve. My son kept his bottle.

I have also had the Jive Turkey sandwich from here which has turkey breast, tomato and lettuce with this amazing jalapeno cream cheese. The Mindy's Mac & Cheese is amazing also! My son had the quesadilla from here which is pricey for what it is considering he orders it plain, but the cheese is yummy and the rest of the food makes it totally worth it! Plus it comes with a side of cream cheese, guacamole, and salsa. 

We four way split the Triple Chocolate Brownie for desert and seeing as how none of us could finish our plates it was just enough!

That out of the way, I had a very memorable date at Bent. The ambiance is modern and chic. The waiter informed us that dishes here were designed to be shared and recommended 3-4 for a party of two. We ordered the Yucatan(?) ceviche (an off-menu special for which I'm unsure of the actual name), beef carpaccio, homemade gnocchi, and the black cod. All dishes were unique and absolutely delectable. The ceviche came with what seemed to be some sort of root vegetable tortilla chips, and was tasty show of bright citrus flavours. The gnocchi with the mushrooms and chorizo was a nice rustic combination of vegetal and cured savouriness. The cod seemed ordinary at first glance but proved to be quite delicious, with the gentle flakiness of the cod and the puree being a nice match. My personal favourite by far was the carpaccio. The pear, the vinaigrette, the beef, and the shoestring potatoes were the dominant robust flavours/textures that contrasted and were melded together perfectly in my mouth. My date and I left extremely satisfied and wallet permitting, we hope to come back to experience Bent's other offerings (perhaps come Summerlicious).",2017-04-08 10:01:33

Someone else delivered our hotdogs... still no waitress to be seen. This brings me to another problem... we had no silverware. I had to eat my side salad with the toothpick that came in the hotdog.... not cool. Meanwhile, my hotdog (the bear) which I have had several times, was not as good as it typically is.... they slathered it in sauce but put barely any popcorn or bacon or cheese on... I don't know, it just wasn't very good. It also wasn't very hot. The salad tasted like it wasn't dressed. It was bland. When I was halfway done with the hotdog we finally were able to wave down the waitress to ask for a drink. Their drinks are well priced, with beer for 3$.

Scramble has gluten-free options as well but they're almost all meat options, which is all naturally gluten-free anyway. If you're going to boast about your gluten-free options, you should have something special that's GF not just stuff everyone else has. GF French Toast would have been awesome.

I used to live in Colombia where their arepas are slightly different. When I first walked in I realized that these Venezuelan arepas would be *stuffed*! I have been back like a dozen times since. 

To back up a little, an arepa is a corn cake, and then at this cafe they'll add things to it. Usually along the lines of cheese, avocado, beans and sweet plantains. (Actually that is the contents of precisely my favourite arepa - the vegetarian Pabellon.) 

They offer them up with various sauces (I die for the garlic mayo) and you can also order fresh juices which are the perfect companion to an arepa. 

For first timers, arepas are quite filling. Come with an appetite!

Also, this is a judgement free zone. Sometimes the arepas are so stuffed they are hard to eat. But totally worth the mess!

On another visit, we ordered the panzanella salad which the menu lists as having basil leaves, but couldn't find (or taste) any when we received it.

Located in Rampart Casino, this has become a go-to. The service is always incredible... Our server Jonathan takes customer service to a whole different level. We usually start with a bottle of the Riesling white wine, and their bread basket to start is delicious -- especially the white chocolate walnut bread! 

APPETIZERS: So filling. We usually get the half dozen oysters, always so fresh. The LOBSTER BISQUE is so flavorful, and somehow stays so hot... pairs great with the thin bread in the basket. The Carmel HOUSE SALAD is of good size too, with butter lettuce, crab, (gigantic!) shrimp, hearts of palm, tomato, avocado and a citrus cream dressing. 

FOR HER (ENTREE): I usually opt for the SEARED SCALLOPS, which are four humongous ones with couscous, fennel cream sauce and tomato coulis. It's not too heavy and leaves me room for dessert. I also love the Carmel MIXED GRILL (pictured) -- petit beef tenderloin, two large shrimp, two large scallops, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables! We've tried all the entrees and those two are my personal faves.

FOR HIM (ENTREE): As a steak lover, he always opts for the 24 oz BONE-IN RIBEYE every single time. So delicious, does not require any steak sauce. Comes with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables as well. The perfect sized steak... He is usually a heavy eater but never is able to finish it! We always have to pack it to take home! 

DESSERTS: I always feel you can't go wrong with creme brûlée there, but my favorite is their trio of SORBETs. Mango, coconut and raspberry -- paired with shortbread cookies. One thing we always order is the Carmel Room SOUFFLÉ (make sure to order immediately, as it takes at least 30 minutes for them to prepare).

The lemon scones are perfect for a spring brunch. They are soft and crumbly and probably the best scones I have ever had. They have a wide assortment of cupcakes. My favorites have been the brown velvet, smores, and Irish cream.They rotate out their baked goods selection depending on the season so check their online menu before heading over.

Their Pecan and Pumpkin have gotten a lot of compliments from our guests and they're homemade whipped topping is just perfect!

Where do I even begin? 

Take this standpoint from a local who has tolerated the frequent 30-minute delays for about 5 years now. All because I somehow convinced myself - for some reason - that my long background with commuter trains, buses, trams and minibuses back in Hong Kong would help me get by without a car. Reality is, you cannot get by without a car in Vegas. RTC did it for me today, I wave my white flag and am just waiting till exams are over so that my license will finally get into the picture. 

Today, I left the Sahara West Library 15 minutes before closing to give myself ample waiting time before SX-B would arrive. 2 hours later, not a single bus arrived. Don't take my words with a grain of salt. I'm not even exaggerating. As 8pm hit, I began to suspect that something was amiss. Were the employees on strike? Did the buses break down? RTC phone line only ran till 6pm so that was not an option. Friends/family who had cars were not available to pick me up. Before I knew it, a whole sunset had just taken place before my eyes and the sky was already dark. What on earth was this supposed to be, a layover of some sort? Even airport waiting times were never as long. Just tragic. 

Anyway, what I did next was brisk walk all the way from the Grand Canyon stop to Fort Apache, hoping to try my luck on the SX-A (which meets with the SX-B at Fort Apache).There were people - good sign of safety - and lights. Almost 3 hours into my wait, guess which bus arrived - SX-B - the one I had waited for all afternoon! And the driver did not even knew what went on. I was outraged. To think how much time it would've taken to get home - 5 neighborhood blocks away - which would've been 10 minutes by car! I had 2 books checked out from the library, both of which I finished reading by the time the bus arrived. 

RTC gravely needs to improve their payment system as well, by establishing a tap card-ish service (we called them octopus cards in HK, clipper at the Bay). Buses run late sometimes because people take long paying $2/$5 in pennies and many times, the swipe-in day passes don't work once they are crumpled up a bit. There have been numerous instances where fights broke out and the drivers didn't mind having it going. 

Recently, RTC has tried to up its services by installing wi-fi within the bus. Perhaps it would be more useful to have that installed at the stops instead considering the delays and waiting. I understand that public transportation is not a big thing in this city but why don't we stop to think that maybe the reason people are so resistant to give up driving is because they have heard discouraging stories - turning the situation into a vicious cycle. Ever since I started college, I sought refuge in RTC to get me to school on time. However, after that one winter morning when the bus never arrived for me to catch a chemistry quiz (thankfully a friend swooped me to school just in time), I leave the house 2 hours before my first class just to make sure I am punctual. 

For the sake of the people of Las Vegas, I hope RTC will be able to tackle the issues that have been surrounding the agency for awhile now and improve their efficiency. 

Sorry guys, 2 stars.",2014-05-10 06:30:30

The servers were very attentive, and more than once we had different servers coming up to ask us if we needed anything else.  The food was great- we shared spring rolls, veggie fried rice and veggie low mein and it was more than enough.  They also give you a generous portion of wonton chips with this amazing sweet orange sauce and a bowl of white rice.

Our total was around $23 for all of this, so prices are pretty reasonable.  There are more expensive dishes on the menu, but luckily for us, we don't eat meat.  If you do, you could end up paying anywhere from $12-20 for a meal.

Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! 

The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait.

We got a table almost immediately somehow and tried to order quickly because the waitress seemed so busy and there were some large parties we wanted to get in front of. I went there planning on getting the blackberry lemonade, but then a rum drink with banana and walnut caught my eye. I asked the waitress which was better/more popular and she warned that the banana walnut was pretty sweet. Well I like sweet, so I figured, if she's comparing those two drinks and thinks one is sweeter, I'll trust that. Well I hadn't noticed that it was an ""old fashioned"" so was basically two fingers of straight rum - not exactly what I would ever describe as sweet when you compare it to a lemonade cocktail. It was my own fault for reading the menu too quickly, but that description from the server was odd to me....

On to the food. we'd heard so much about the chicken, my bf got the crunchy chicken sandwich and he really liked it. Again, I asked my server for her recommendation (we ordered drinks and food at the same time, so I didn't know yet that I wasn't a fan of her recommendations haha) between the smoked chicken salad (to try the fab chicken here) or the shrimp and grits. She recommended the shrimp and grits and, lucky me, I loved it. The flavors in this dish went together so perfectly. I hadn't realized there was ham in the dish and I really think it made the dish (and I'm really not even a ham fan!).

The food was delicious although a bit pricey especially for a pub setting but that's the problem I don't think they know what they're trying to be. 

It's actually quite sad this could be a really great  place with just a few minor changes for example: the glass on the exterior should be thoroughly cleaned, Decor should be a little bit more warm and inviting and building some type of Cabinetry around the center kitchen area wouldn't be a bad idea either nobody wants to see a gross looking floor drain in the center of the kitchen while they're eating or dingy metal shelving.

(We'd been here years ago, but I think that it was seafood night.)

Since I had the baby, my system has gotten a little sensitive to certain dishes so I went the safe route and stuck to a few choice items: shrimp scampi- didn't really taste like it was supposed to but eatable (didn't get seconds), chicken gumbo (good considering the averageness of the buffet as a whole), peel 'n eat shrimp- who can mess this up, right?, mussels- a tad overdone but eatable, green beans- surpsingly a crispness to it, and not soggy, prime rib- good, once you cut out all the fatty parts (and there was a lot of it). There were salads, mexican, seafood, carving stations, asian including a mongolian feature, and pasta. 

I still find that some people get a little crazy when it comes to food, and that there will always be an impatient person right next to you or someone who wants to create their own line when there is already a clearly defined line started. The majority of the diners were good, except there were a couple kids playing and when there is a big crowd, that type of horseplay is not appropriate period.

An average Las Vegas casino buffet is the best way I can put this place, not the worst, not the best, just right smack-dab in the middle. To tell you the truth, the desserts ARE better than the food selections- there were No-Sugar selections as well, in addition to the pies- pumpkin and pecan, cakes- red velvet cake, slice of rolls- lemon or raspberry, cookies, macaroons, plus ice cream and gellato- about 9 flavors like cookies 'n cream, coffee (delish!!!), watermelon sorbet. Just steer clear of items like cake slices that were the obvious leftovers. I made the mistake of grabbing a red velvet slice, against my better judgement, and had to take off the entire side because it had hardened a bit- eww.

There was a lot of refilling of dishes going on by the workers, which meant there were a bunch of customers here. It was a good crowd for a saturday night. It wasn't too noisy, since our baby got to nap a bit. I also noticed a Hand Sanitizer station in between food stations, which you don't see a lot in a typical Vegas buffet. The drink server was good except she kept missing asking one person in our party.

That said, if you come here on a sunny day, order some drinks and a side of their corn bread (truly some of the best I've ever had) you will have a great time.  But with better alternatives so nearby, the Double Wide would not be my first choice for a meal.

yes, the place is crowded but that's always been okay with me because the sushi had been so good - one could get over the rest.

the service is speedy - in my experience. They are always rushed so you better know what to order which was never an issue as a regular.

Price - great prices for yorkville. And thats probably why they had my loyalty over the many many years

and the food: 
- the sashimi for the most part has been fresh. 
- Its the sushi that's been an issue - the rice has been cold and dry - at times its felt like perhaps it wasnt even sticky rice. It was like a massive blob of rice wrapped around - wait for it - you may have to really really look for it - i think, there is some sort of fish somewhere in there! geez, i could go for indian or Thai if i wanted a rice-heavy dish.

I loved the ambiance. Low lighting, not too loud/obnoxious (aside from what appeared to be a birthday party at a nearby table). It actually wasn't as terribly busy as I would've expected for a Friday night. Perfect for a late Valentine's dinner with the boy. 

The waitstaff was VERY friendly and attentive-almost too attentive. I know everyone has their preferences, but I'd prefer that the waiter not be at my table every 5 minutes. I know he was trying to be helpful in helping us decide what to order as we'd never been there before. Also, it seemed like every time I took a few sips of water, someone was coming by to top off my glass. I guess that's better than the waitstaff completely forgetting you and you feel as if you might die from dehydration. That might be a little dramatic but you know what I mean. 

For drinks, we ordered what I think was called the Urban Manhattan? It was certainly a Manhattan but I can't remember if that's the correct drink name. I don't typically order this drink-but it was quite delicious.

Onwards to the food! After going back and forth between the Amazing Pasta Trio and Eggplant Torta & Butternut Squash Ravioli, I went with the trio..because HEY! It says it's amazing. In the back of my head I was thinking, ""that could be an over hyped claim"". My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini Amatriciana. Our server complimented on us on our outstanding choices..they really do talk up their menu items as other's have noted.

Our food arrived rather quickly. Portion size was little to be desired. I wasn't starving but.... seriously. The amount of food did not justify the price. It was delicious, don't get me wrong! I've eaten at enough upscale prices that you're not going to get a lot because you're getting quality food. I just felt as though it would be best listed as a ""small plate"".  It was some of the best pasta I've ever eaten, so I have to give credit where it is due. Boyfriend's Bucatini Amatriciana appeared to have a lot more to it and he said it was quite delicious-although he did feel bad for me with what little amount of food I had received. Too bad it had bacon in it, or I would've had some of his for myself. 

Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. Great waitstaff and delicious food despite the few issues I had with the place. I would go back again! I'm a pasta junkie!",2013-02-22 21:33:38

Both the large cups of cappuccino were amazing. The foam was so thick at the top that the sugar I poured in didn't even sink so each sip I took was accompanied with a few sugar crystals. I'm drinking my cappuccino like this from now on. Cute art work gave it great visual appeal. The taste was amazing and surprisingly did not leave any after taste of coffee. Had a nice chat with the owner after finishing my drink and he explained that L'arte Del Caffe is a brand that was originally opened in Italy.

This place is small, but it packs a punch. You can get a pour over in 4 different ways, you can get what is called a One and One where they pull two shots, one into an espresso and one into a macchiato with some kind of dairy or soy so you can try it both ways. 

I am a little surprised that they were unwilling to accommodate Cron J's request for three shots of espresso over ice,  because they were sure extremely accommodating to me.

After that, some places will lay egg-fried-rice into a plate (this place just used plain rice) and then pour the stir-fry meat, veggies, and curry on top of the rice and finish it in the oven with coconut shavings to garnish.

Go figure I found Steamie Weenie TOTALLY at random, but what a find indeed and by no means does the 5 star even do this place justice! Overall this was just simply perfection from beginning to end! I mean c'mon now see my pictures of how they segregate the bathrooms even (a weenie for the males and buns for the ladies). How can you go wrong?!?

Location wise it is based out of a small, but blossoming strip mall in Henderson and actually was not really much of a drive from the strip as well so certainly something doable. We were coming from the Southern Highland area (near the M casino) and it took roughly about 15 minutes and the restaurant itself was not that difficult to spot, but with a name like Steamie Weenie even in Vegas that tends to stand out? Ha-ha.

From perusing the menu ahead of time it was one of those ""has something for every member of the family"" type of menus. It had the regular go-to's for the kids, and what certainly made this outing even possible a vegan based hot dog (as I had a member who passed until she heard about the vegan hot dog offering) so definitely even among how it looks on the outside it was quite healthy on the inside.

As for the food, I did find everything to be surprisingly light and I did not feel like I needed to be carted out on a gurney afterwards which is a testament to the attention to health here. I went for the loaded tots as a side and they were prepared to golden brown perfection with a light crisp to it, but absent was the oodles of grease I'm used to getting pretty much everywhere else. Not scrimped on here was the ""loaded"" portion of the tots. The sour cream was lightly drizzled on the top of mounds of melted cheese, scallions, and the crowd pleasing: bountiful chunks of BACON!  

Now for the main attraction set to knock your tooth out, the trailer park hot dog! There was a lot going on in this dog, but somehow it all comes together and works marvelously. It starts with the great tasting all beef foot long hot dog that had the much sought after snap with each bite (I appreciated that more than anything). From here it was engulfed in piles of crispy fried onion strings, to die for coleslaw that would make the south rise up again, and literal chunks of spam (I think I had the equivalent of maybe two thick slices of it actually). What sets it apart though was for one the beer cheese (and yes there's a difference) and the watermelon BBQ sauce. It had me wanting to shout OH YEEEEEAH like the kool-aid man during each bite!

All in all this place is amazing. We did strike up a conversation with the owners as we walked out and I'm very impressed at how humble they were, but also just the care that they put into what they do. We were treated like family and I really begged them to open up a restaurant in California so I didn't dream of this in between Vegas trips. So definitely when you want a well prepared hot dog don't waste time on the strip and channel your inner dog. Think steamie and even think weenie and trek on over here as you will NOT be disappointed!",2016-04-23 13:39:49

The atmosphere inside is a little odd.  It felt a little old and empty, and I kind of had the sensation I was at my late grandmother's house.

Service was amazing, but that was to be expected as there were very few others in the restaurant, so we had seemingly three servers to ourselves.  For starters we had spring rolls and won ton soup.  Both were very tasty - the sweet and sour sauce paired very well with the spring roll.  I wish you got more than two!

For my main course I got the orange chicken.  I have to say I was a little disappointed by the spice level.  It is called out on their menu with a 'warning' red pepper, but there was almost no spice in it at all.  While I would prefer to err on the side of less spice over more, they went way overboard in this instance, and it really just tasted like plain chicken.

Since the service was so great, I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  If you're in the mood for some Americanized Chinese cuisine give this place a look, you could do worse.",2018-03-06 07:28:59

The screen is big and the sound quality is very good.
Doesn't matter where you sit, you'll get a great view.

Washrooms are upstairs and the concessions are small, but inexpensive. Not sure if it was just our event but they also gave out free water :)

It's caddy-corner to the Mesa Arts Center, with a lively, inviting patio out front.  The inside is artistically decorated with some exposed brick and large paitings on one wall.  The other wall is a bar, serving a sizable wine list and bottles from several local breweries.  (No draft beers.)  There's also a small stage for live music.  It's a nice atmosphere for a date.

Unfortunately, the food was lacking.  A crusty baguette was served before our meals with a homemade butter concotion that had way too many onions.  I ordered the fish of the day, escolar, served over vegetable risotto ($29).  The fish was cooked moist and succulent, but it was very buttery and carried some unrecognizable smoky flavor.  The risotto had a nice cheesy taste, but I didn't see many vegetables in it, and it was also very heavy and oily.  In between these layers were some tasty, vinegary wilted greens, but I could barely distinguish them sandwiched between the super rich fish and risotto.

On the plus side, my wife's salmon salad was a nice offering and good value ($11).  With asparagus, roasted red peppers, and multi-colored grape tomatoes, it was pleasing to the eye.  The piece of salmon on top was surprisingly large, and cooked perfectly medium rare.

Our server, Paul, hands down made our experience.  If we had anyone else it wouldn't have been the same.  I work in F&B and would hire him in a heart beat!

We started off with a nice bottle of Chardonnay.  We were given the bread which had a nice bleu cheese spread on it, not too much, just right!  This came with some oil for dipping.  We also had the beef tartar & borracha salad.  The cheese on the salad was to die for.  The beef tartar was good but not the best I've ever had.  The server did inform me that the Carpaccio is a better choice but I don't like Carpaccio's as much.

We then had our entree's.  I tried the special which was a 7oz filet w/ crab & asparagus.  It was prepared to my liking, medium rare and the flavor was excellent.  I also got a side of béarnaise.  My company got the fish on the menu which she loved.  We shared the truffle mac and cheese which was top notch as well.

Paul was very attentive during the entire meal.  He asked for our names and addressed us by them during the meal.  He was an honest server and didn't just say that everything was great however when he knew of a similar but better dish he offered that which is a wonderful quality.

We finished with the donuts which was a recommendation from the server.

I 100% will dine again at STK and ask for Paul.  Even overhearing the server at the table next to us their experience was so different.  

The environment is ambient and perfect for any special occasion or just a business dinner.  The only thing I disliked was that there was a bathroom attendant.  Being a female I don't really care for you to stand there and open the door to the restroom for me.  I expect that in a nightclub but not in a restaurant.",2016-10-01 03:12:10

The udon noodles are good, they've got a nice texture to them. The soup base is delicious as well but the meat is just okay. The curry udon is just the same thing with a spoon from a curry stock added in, and one carrot and one potato. 

The place was certainly popular with the crowds coming in from OCAD though. Even at 530pm this place was full-up. If I'm ever back, I'll try out the natto, I promise! But for it's price, it's a no-brainer choice if you're looking for something to warm you up on a cold day.",2011-09-26 02:45:51

This place is one of the reasons why I enjoy living here in the valley.  It gives off a charming, old world European vibe, and is located in such a quaint neighborhood.  My friend owns a condo in Williamsburg Square, which is right across the street from LGO. 

I love how there's odds and ends things for sale (the grocery part of LGO) in conjunction with a nice selection of food, pastries and drinks.  My favorites are:  the Sonoma salad, house chai, breakfast crepes and pretty much anything in the dessert case.

The best thing I like about this place is the wholesome feeling I get when I visit or even drive by it.  It's like I'm in a little town in France.  I like the fact that I can meet a friend for coffee in a chill atmosphere.  I also like the fact that after I visit Arcadia Animal Clinic (just up the street), that I can swing by for some take home desserts or gelato.  I even pick up dog shampoo here.

we started our meal with a crab cake appetizer topped with creamy lemon aioli. (we debated between this and the gumbo... the crab cake was good,  but next time it will HAVE to be the gumbo.) after that came some awesome garlic bread- it was crispy and crunchy and light and yumyumyum. we polished off the basket almost embarrassingly quickly. that bread was seriously amazing.

my husband's jambalaya did not impress me- it was kind of mushy, but i've never been a huge fan of the stuff anyway. i loved my entrée, though- the shrimp were spicy and perfectly cooked, the gouda grits were rich and creamy and the andouille-mushroom sauce on top of everything was super deliciously savory. i sopped up every. last. bite.

despite making a complete pig of myself (in my defense, i went hiking this afternoon and worked up an appetite), i did save a little bit of room for dessert and tried the bread pudding! bread pudding is so easy to make that i usually don't bother to order it out but i had a craving and our apartment is still in a shambles from our move so there isn't much baking in my future. it was a success- sweet and smooth and served with whipped cream on top, yum! even my husband (who is generally more of a chocolate dessert fellow) liked it... i think he had a touch of food envy, hehe.",2011-10-29 10:17:50

Happy hour runs 4-7 pm, though it's a little vague, I had to ask about what it actually included. Was told beer and well drinks were half off. As they had no beer on tap, I went for a house margarita and the other person in my party, after some pondering, went with a Midori sour, served straight up. Midori isn't a well, so no happy hour pricing, but bar tender didn't correct us nor did he actually realize it, I overheard his co- worker correct him in a hushed voice later. 
 We also ordered calimari, which is priced on a menu at $8, incredibly reasonable for a nice steak house. The portion is so enormous, we couldn't finish it. Sadly, however, it totally lacked flavor and seasoning, just lots of heavily breaded, though thankfully well cooked and not over fried fare. 
 The bill arrived in two separate parts, one for food and one for drinks, sort of unusual. The calimari was actually cheaper than listed on the menu, so I'm guessing there's some sort of mysterious happy hour pricing involved with appetizers as well.

I also tried the daily rice balls and poutine.  My husband had a house dog and a chili cheese dog.  He loved both of them.

The patio was lovely at 11am on a Saturday. We managed to get there before the rush, so we had our pick of seats and it was quiet and very relaxing. 

Our server wasn't the best in the world. He was a tall slim guy (though all the servers seemed to be super tall and slim) with a huge band-aid on the side of his neck. I assume this was to cover some kind of tattoo, but it wasn't that appetizing, i'll be honest.

However, because he was so soft spoken and meek, I thought maybe he had some kind of life-saving throat or neck surgery and cut him some slack.  His service was super slow and he forgot about us a few times, but I refused to let it ruin the brunch and let Mr. Potential Cancerous Goiter and/or Criss Angel Tattoo off without griping.

The peach bellini is TO DIE for. So good and comes in a giant pint glass. I thought it was going to be a simple bellini in a champagne flute, but no, this was like a booze slurpee. For $7. I'll have two next time.

I had the eggs benedict, which was absolutely delicious. The grilled asparagus that came with it was gone in 30 seconds. I like my poached eggs on the medium-well side and mine came so runny they were almost cold inside (which I realize is how some folks like them). But the manager, who happened to be walking by, had them remake them, despite my protests. She was really attentive and personable. I should've gotten her name -- she's got long dark hair and blue eyes, kinda on the wee side.

I'd definitely go back to this location, especially  for brunch. There's some berry stuffed french toast I've got my eye on...",2012-05-01 20:46:55

On today's visit I had the Sunny.. a chicken hotdog with peaches, goat cheese and arugula on naan .. great flavor combination.. with a side of fried pickles... crunchy and fried just right. My daughter had the Monika .. two cheese stuffed hotdogs wrapped in corn tortillas and bacon with a side of dragon sauce and French fries.. the sauce was really good with the hotdog and fries.

For dessert we shared the bourbon donut.. a brioche donut with chocolate custard and bourbon cream .. covered in powdered sugar.. it's a smaller donut, light texture and the perfect level of sweetness.. this is for the 21 and over crowd.. 

The donut display case looked amazing! You should leave room for one or two of these yummy treats

Unfortunately it ends there. I specifically came in for relaxation which was marked on my sheet under ""type of massage"" as well as ""why did you come in"".

Throughout the massage no  massage strokes were used, I have never had a massage (if you can even call it that) like that in my life. 

She also kept knocking me in the head with her arms and saying sorry. The massage continued with poking, pinching and pulling. I just kept thinking I couldnt wait for it to be over. Definately NO relaxation here! While checking out the receptionist asked how my massage was. I told her that it was painful and not relaxing.

Was not very impressed with the atmosphere I did get back into the chair pretty quickly I came in for gel nails and a polish change on my toes. When I ask the girl when she was doing my nails to put a powder coat on with the gel it was like she didn't know what I was talking about. I've been to multiple salons throughout The Valley and every one of them does it the same way except for this 1 she referred me to her manager and he didn't even know what he was doing. After he put the powder on he started using a drill on my nails the whole purpose of gel is to have no drills on my nails because it ruins my nail bed. I tried to describe to him 4 times as what the other nail salons do and it was like he didn't believe me and each time I have this done the nail salons charge me a $5 extra upgrade which I'm fine with. And for it to take almost 2 hours for me to get a Polish change and gel nails was absolutely ridiculous I've had this done multiple times before and I've only been in the salon for an hour at most. Will never go back to the salon ever again. And they also charged me way more than any of the other much much nicer salons have charged.,2018-03-15 21:29:04

Came to check out the Van Gogh-Alive exhibit, and what a great way to spend $25!  The average exhibit-goer takes about 45 minutes to go through the exhibit, which includes 5 to 10 minutes of ""reflection"" in the second room, where you may look at pictures and descriptions regarding Van Gogh's life and specific artworks, so do make a note of this.  Had we had more time to spend, my cousin and I would've stayed for at least a couple of hours... The music, Van Gogh's letters, and the beauty of the digital presentations captivated us so!  

I did find the benches, placed in a haphazard fashion, to be very distracting.  They broke the flow of energy in the room and kept me from being able to move about freely as I wanted to, and the benches' marred my visual field as I looked across the room.  This observation was again confirmed when I found a great YouTube vid that showcased the Istanbul presentation of this exhibit, which did not contain benches in the room.  (Now, I do not mind having somewhere to sit.  Indeed, there were lovely fabric and leather couches in this exhibit, and thankfully, they were by the walls.)  I also noticed that the Turkish exhibition suggested the room to have a larger dimension that that of Az Sci Center's.  I found its exhibit's dimensions seemed more open and had a better flow.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ACUNyN_Ec&feature=related

I would definitely recommend people to check this presentation out!  I would love to re-visit this viewing, but perhaps in another city...

p.s.  The exhibit's $25 fee includes admission to the rest of the exhibits within AZ Science Center.  Please note that the Van Gogh exhibit can only be entered and exited once, and that it runs through June 17, 2012.",2012-04-29 07:08:59

I've come here for dinner and drinks a couple times and it's been fairly decent both times.

There are huge bags of mineral salts, a well supplied produce section, a large refrigerated section with rows of noodles, natto, a huge frozen area with meats & dumplings, etc. I haven't tried the food court yet, but I might next time because the photos look yummy! There are open mini-store areas near the front that are mostly unoccupied, but I'm hoping they'll fill in soon because it has a lot of potential. It's pretty far from my side of town, but it's worth making the trek to stock up on awesome foods that are hard to find. I haven't seen skate or fresh uni anywhere else, and the marinated bulgogi is delicious! If you spend over a certain amount, they offer you a bag of rice for $.99. I'll be going back after my next payday! :}",2010-05-19 19:59:28

I took take out since waiting for a table is that of when the president arrives and stops all lanes of traffic, no one is ready and no one knows how to make it flow. Place is jam packed because of the tasty ramen provided but my personal opinion they have fallen off the tracks a bit due to such overwhelming success.

I took the tonkatsu soyu but was given just the soya offering. Discovered when I arrived to my home. The broth was what I wanted but it was too late and I felt it's from monta so it should taste good either way; I was not impressed. There were a few things wrong with the meal the tea egg was over cooked and just the overall wait inside the shop to pick up your Togo wasn't very pleasing. 

This isn't a make or break for me with Monta just gave me a reason to find other ramen around town that do just ask great if not better",2017-04-08 18:15:09

The food was good. The service acceptably friendly and quick. 
I ordered spring rolls and a noodle dish with beef.  I got egg rolls (fried) and the correct noodle dish. I also ordered a Thai hot coffee, which was ordinary, tasted like instant.

The sadness began when I got my bill. It seemed a bit high, that is, higher than the menu prices warranted. I did the math in my head. It didn't work out. My meal cost about $14 - high for noodles, egg rolls and coffee, amirite? - and the total I received, on an un-itemized bill, was almost $18, a shocking amount for 1 person's egg rolls, noodles and coffee.

I asked for assistance.  Nobody came.  I went to the counter and asked to speak to the manager. A man with a pony tail came to me. I explained I believed I was overcharged, and wanted to check it out.  He replied, ""The bill is correct,"" and began to walk away.  

Now I realized I was in the midst of a situation.  I replied, ""I don't think so.  May I see a menu please?""  He didn't get me a menu despite 3 requests. He walked away from me twice, dawdling elsewhere, until I requested he come back. Suddenly everybody and everything else in the restaurant was more important than I was.

He wrote some numbers on my ticket. None of these numbers corresponded to the prices I saw on the menu; all were about $1 higher than menu prices. I mentioned this, and again I asked to see a menu. He did not provide a menu. Finally I grabbed one and opened it. He grimaced.

""See the menu?  This is $4.28, this is $2.68 and this is $7.48,"" I said.  ""You overcharged me"".(by about $3). He never once agreed with nor denied what I was saying. He also did not offer to repay the difference. I had to demand he refund the money he overcharged me. It is my opinion that such behavior is several steps over the line into dishonesty.  He claimed what I ordered was different than what I had, and that those things (all) cost more. I pointed out another obvious fact: ""None of the prices you wrote on my ticket (after the fact) are anywhere to be found in your menu."" He was making stuff up.

So I had to get loud and aggressive and say, ""What do I have to do to get you to refund the money you overcharged me? Call the police?"" He grabbed a dollar and some change from the till quickly and thrust them into my hands. This was still only about half the amount I was overcharged. 

Here are my tips for eating at Pho 68, if you must:
--Demand an itemized bill when you sit down.
--Check your tab against the menu if you must. 
--Contact staff for assistance before paying if there's a discrepancy.
--If there is a discrepancy, do not pay the bill until it has been addressed to your satisfaction, and a correct bill rendered.",2011-12-05 22:59:13

We both had the same thing  Evil Jungle Noodles. A tounge tickling adventure made from curried coconut milk with tofu and vegetables. Holy uncow people this food is effin good OK!
Usually we split our lunch just to save the calories, but this time I am uber glad we did not. I am already drooling thinking about the leftovers. I cannot wait to go back and I have not evenfinished what I got today!

They do appear to be crazy busy at lunch so come early and try to order online first. There's a special online order pick-up line. 

My steak sandwich with hot peppers was good, but not spectacular. First of all, they charge you fifty cents for every topping - even a tomato slice. That's ridiculous. Secondly, they cook they steak to well done. Well done steak is a waste of steak, in my opinion. Third, they don't trim the steak well so there's a lot of fat and gristle. This does make the sandwich a bit hard to eat because the hard gristle doesn't bite cleanly so you end up yanking large pieces of steak out of your sandwich when you try to take a bite.

Not sure I would come back here of my own initiative, but if my cohorts wanted to come here, I'd probably try the grilled chicken sandwich or something else.",2015-11-06 17:50:33

The first night I came with my boyfriend and daughter, and the restaurant was almost completely full, but there were 3 seats on the lower bar so we snagged them. Our server was Carl and he was AWESOME. Excellent customer service skills and the food was great!  I love the portion sizes and how they vary slightly. My daughter got the 3oz portion and it was just perfect for her. I usually hesitate to buy her a full meal at a shabu shabu restaurant because of the price, especially when she usually ends up wasting half of it...but she finished it all and ended with ""I'm full, mommy!""  Perfect!  My meal was also the perfect size and my boyfriend had no complaints. Overall, a 5 star experience. 

Tonight, on the other hand, was a little different. My daughter and boyfriend are both out of town, so I took myself to a solo dinner! I walked in around 7:45pm and the restaurant was almost empty so I had my pick of seats. My server (again, Carl) offered me the corner seat, nearest the window.  An OK choice, I guess...but I felt a little isolated in such an empty room. Not his fault...but maybe I'll ask to be seated closer to the kitchen next time.  The service started out great with Carl taking my order and bringing everything out quickly.  Shortly after receiving my main course, Carl stopped by to make sure everything was ok, but also to let me know that he was going to be going on a break. He promised me that the other 2 servers on shift would be checking on me and take good care of me.  The restaurant was far from busy, yet they came to check on me once.  I ran out of ponzu sauce at one point and waited nearly 10 minutes for any of the servers to come out far enough to where I was sitting so I could flag them down.  When I finished my meal I waited about 5 minutes for them to bring out the check. When it finally arrived I put my card out for payment and again was waiting.... Carl came back from his break shortly after that and saw that I was waiting to pay, so he cashed me out quickly. By the time I left it was about 8:45.  It was just an OK experience tonight. 

My only other suggestion (other than the minor service improvements) is that the tea service needs a little adjustment.  The pot of tea is large but it doesn't hold heat very well.  On both visits the second half of the tea pot was consumed at room temperature.  Maybe the tea service should be recommend for 2 people to share?  Or they should offer more hot water halfway through the meal?  But overall I like Yojié and will be back!",2015-06-21 08:05:30

I stopped in for a snack and a beer.  The beer and charcuterie was great, but the rest of the food kind of sucked.  I'm going to go back in hopes that this was just an off night since I do love this place a lot.

First, service was fine.  No complaints there at all.  The food was the issue.  I ordered the broccoli raab, wild mushroom bisque, pickled pork shoulder, and the charcuterie board.

The wild mushroom bisque was creamy and it had good mushroom flavor, but the soup had formed skin in the bowl.  It seemed odd for it to skin so fast even though it just came out of the pan.  I stirred up the soup and all was well, but I did find it to be slightly over-salted. Not bad enough to complain, but enough to take notice.

The broccoli raab was an absolute mess.  The dish contained about 3 ounces of overcooked broccoli raab soaking in two inches of oil and covered in sea salt.  It was inedible.  The sea salt was overpowering and crunched with each bite.  The veggies were incredibly limp and, of course, greasy.  Broccoli raab, being a bitter veggie, didn't help this concoction.  This was a huge failure by whoever cooked the dish.

The pickled pork shoulder looked great.  The chetnuts, lardo, and greens all made the dish look very inviting.  Everything packed flavor except for the pork.  It was flavorless.  To go from over-salted food to flavorless meat was quite surprising.  The texture over the entire dish felt like well-dressed lunch meat, but with even less flavor in the meat than I would get from the deli.  I'm not sure of the process for how the shoulder was cooked and pickled, but someone forgot a step along the way, I'm sure of it.  If not, this recipe needs some major work.

The charcuterie board was the standout.  I miss the some aspects of the old board that would have contained proscutto and other salumi items.  This board seemed a bit more french in nature.  But that's a nit pick complaint because the board was amazing.  But that's to be expected since it's essentially Lola's old board--it's made by the same guy.  

I think what bugged me the most was watching the kitchen do its thing.  In the past, when I had a good food experience, the kitchen always seemed to be operating with some discipline and skill.   In this visit, I saw the line eagerly working to close up shop even though the kitchen was to be open for four more hours.  Everyone was goofing off and playing on their cell phones.  My food shouldn't be drowning in oil and salt if there's time to play around.  It also struck me as odd to see a large bag of commercial peeled garlic.  That never used to be an option for Cento, and rightfully so since there's a huge difference between fresh garlic and something peeled in a factory.  Garlic is the most used ingredient int hat place as far as I know.  While easier to use, changing the garlic to something packing less power is troublesome.  That small change tells me things might not be moving in the right direction overall.  The cured meat department is certainly going good, and I'm sure the pizza is still awesome, but everything else may be in need of some revision.  I'll pop back in for a full dinner soon enough since the current menu looks great--it's the type of menu I want to see.  I hope I just hit an off night and everything on that menu strikes the right balance of flavor that I didn't get this time around.",2012-11-08 17:24:55

Environment /Service
--Restaurant looks amazing from the outside. However, inside decroation is kind of disappointing. It is very old country style like you are eating at your grandma's old house. The table cloth colour theme and the chair made the resturant looks very cheap and sketchy. You would not expect the menu is this expensive when you look inside the restaurant. I think that's why most people walk by and look at the menu and then just walk away.
-Service is nice. Waitress does know their food and menu and provide some valuable suggestion

Food:
--mussules (3/5) . 
The sauce of the day is coconut curry.It is a very unique sauce and i do think it's worthy of trying. However, the mussuls and sauce was not hot enough. The dish was warm, which made it less enjoyable. If it were hot enough, i believe you could smell and taste the sauce better. 

--Escargot (2/5).
 Escargot is very different than other french restaurant. It was not baked. It is more like fried escargot with mushroom. Again, the dish was warm and didnt look like freshly cooked at all. I was very upset about this dish since i LOVE escargot

--Grilled horse meat and venison (4/5)
The meat were cooked perfectly. When waitress informed me they cooked them rare, I were a little bit worried. However, it turned out to be perfect. You can feel that the meat is melting into your mouse. If you want to try something different, definitely order this dish. I have nothing to complain about it. 

--duck neck sausage (3.5/5)
The meat and testure were great. Howeve, I don't like the puree because  It was sweet. It was a light dish and suitable for summer. I just disliked the sweet flavour in the dish in general.

We didnt order any alcohol and the bills is around $120. 
The price is okay in terms of the french food. However, i dont think i would go back again if i get to choose the resturant.",2014-08-12 20:03:09

The first time they were still in their temporary space, and the second in their expanded showroom.  We found ourselves unexpectedly pregnant at the end of 2012.  I wanted to wait to buy furniture until I was comfortable enough in this pregnancy.  (Just a little background....I have had 6 miscarriages, then had 3 years of unexplained infertility, so I wasn't even sure how far along I would get in this pregnancy.)  Therefore, I was around 23 weeks when I finally felt comfortable enough to buy a nursery set.  So, here is the problem with Babystop.  They have nothing in stock.  Most of their furniture comes from out of the states, travels across the United States from the east coast, and finally arrives in Arizona.  They told me worst case scenario that the set we wanted was 16 weeks out!  What!?!  That is 4 months, almost  1/2 of a pregnancy!!!  That would put me at week 39!  Who wants to be setting up their nursery a week before they are due, that is if the baby doesn't come early?  

We decided their furniture was not an option for us, which was unfortunate because we really liked their top of the line Romina furniture.  (I read in another review that the customer's Romina furniture did end up being later than promised.) And, we would have purchased on the spot, if they had it in stock or even if it would have taken less than 4 months to arrive (they told us that was worst case scenario, 12-16 weeks was the normal, but our luck would be the 16 weeks).  

That wasn't the worst part, as we were leaving, the saleslady tried one last ditch effort to persuade us to purchase the Romina.  She ran over and started opening and shutting the Romina dresser drawers, almost as if she were mocking us.  Romina has a self closing drawer feature, which we loved and the fact that it seems to be very high quality furniture.   Well, this did nothing but make my husband angry, and that rarely happens.  I think I have seen my husband truly angry 3 times in our 10 years of marriage.  He is normally very even keel; I'm the one with the temper.  So, needless to say, we will not be going back to Babystop for anything at this point.  The saleslady made my husband so very angry that he doesn't ever want to go back.  Yes, we finally found a nursery set, and it's all set up waiting for our special delivery.  We didn't have to wait 16 weeks!  My advice to Babystop, if you are going to sell a product that takes 16 weeks to arrive, I would get some stock in my warehouse.  You would sell a lot more furniture that way!",2013-04-11 17:47:57

Good food for the money and fantastic service.  Manager Brandon really made sure it was a great experience.  I also appreciate and support that they employ people with visible tattoos.

I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit to Ribs and Burgers.  It's a casual place with an outdoor patio, but the menu was definitely full of potential.  My first choice was the salmon, but they were out (it was late evening).   I chose the kid menu ribs and my dining partner chose the chicken protein plate.    They also have military/veteran discount, which is always cool.

The kid menu ribs came with four hearty ribs and fries.  I don't generally eat fries, but I had a small nibble and they were delicious. The pork ribs were super tender, had just a bit of sauce, and were not gristly or fatty at all.   I would come back for the ribs for sure.

The chicken plate came with two seasoned chicken breasts and a cabbage/apple salad.  I am not a huge chicken fan, but that chicken was incredibly good.  Moist and seasoned perfectly.  The salad was fresh and crisp.  

They serve boozy milkshakes which sounded interesting.  I didn't get to try those on this trip.

Our first visit was with nurse Raquel and Dr. Hill. They both were super helpful and friendly! They gave us all the tips we needed to know on being new puppy parents and made us feel really secure. They really went above and beyond with making sure our baby was healthy and happy.

The food is typical cafe food but because of their target market restricted low salt diet be prepared to add your own seasoning. Other than it being bland it's what you expect from a cafe in a casino. The place is located where the original pancake house was, I miss that place :-( 49er flap jacks....sigh....okay it's gone move on......

Let's talk about the saving grace of this cafe, the service!! Oh My G-O-S-H those employees should be cloned and sent across the valley!! I was debating on giving this place 4 stars just because the service was that good. My server Gurgen was great! He was attentive not just to me but my little girl. He caught me using Lily name and started calling her directly by her name the whole meal...that's the kind of stuff I love!

Nice dark, chewy crust with melt-in-your-mouth softness inside. Tried the regular brat with sauerkraut topped with whole grain mustard and fries on the side. I am not a big brat eater or even a fan of sausage in general because I don't like running into the unchewable, gristly parts. There was no such thing in this brat! Unfortunately, I chowed down so much during happy hour, I had to go straight home and visit the couch.

This place is quite the mob scene on weekends and feels as if half of the singles in Gilbert and Chandler are up in here wearing their evening best -- whether it be from Wet Seal for the ladies or guys sporting black/white caps over their brows ensembles from TapOut. 

So you have a few choices:
* Try to engage in some mind-numbing small talk with the regulars.
* Be among the first (because no one else in the club is drunk enough) on the dancefloor to the local band doing mid-90s alt rock covers.
* Or hide in the corner with your friends, and avoid everyone while sharpen your Buck Hunter skills.

Went to dinner with a group of friends from nearby Landmark Education.  I had never been here before but I was looking forward to it.

The restaurant was clean and inviting...  First impressions were definitely a good start.  The server indicated we could sit where we wanted and quickly brought out sparkling clean glasses of water with fresh lime slices in them.  First time I have had lime in my water glass and it was a refreshing change.,

I ordered the Papaya salad.  ""A North Eastern Thai style salad, fresh green papaya tossed with grilled prawns, carrots, tomatoes, peanuts, green beans and spicy lime juice."" 

I have never had green papaya, and was intrigued,.. The order came out within 10 minutes.  Beautiful plump looking prawns sat atop a mound of shredded green papaya.  The salad was garnished with a lovely carrot rose.

The salad was absolutely delicious.  The spicy lime juice was not too spicy, indeed, I hardly noticed any spice at all.  Just a tinge of sweetness made it a perfect accompaniement to the prawns and the green papaya.  The salad was fresh, sweet, and beautifully prepared.  I really enjoyed it.

And a big kudos to them for fighting the big fight against Starbucks across the parking lot. That said, I drove past the Starbucks first (which was mostly empty) while Gold Bar was much more crowded. Good goin', Tempe!

I entered and my first reaction was I liked the feeling of the place  - tables made of wrought iron or of the wooden breakfast nook variety, random mishmash of art and stained glass on the walls and windows, a tall wooden shelving unit holding premium teas with ""Gold Bar Espresso"" carved into it, a pair of black leather lounge seats, etc. However, the layout of the place was a little awkward and it felt kind of cramped in there with every table and chair occupied. 

I ordered a medium soy latte from the friendly barista, but when she told me it was going to be $4.70 I asked her to repeat herself to make sure I heard that right. I'm sorry, but that price is ridiculous. I'm used to being penalized by coffeehouses for being lactose intolerant (which sucks), but when a shot of espresso with soy milk in a 16 ounce cup approaches five bucks, I am really going to get turned off, especially when 8 times out of 10 the soy drink isn't going to be all that great. I'm not ordering some gargantuan frapuccino with 3 syrups and whipped cream, just a simple latte. Anyway, that's my own personal pet peeve.

I'd say the patronage was a mix of younger students hanging out to grad students working to older folks chatting and playing cards. I sat down to a table and tried relaxing when I realized that there was no music playing overhead. That was kind of weird. And with nothing playing in the background, every conversation became that much more amplified. I think some background music at low volume to set at least some sort of ambiance is key to any coffeehouse - whereas this felt more like a library except there was no librarian giving people dirty glances when they were being loud. I didn't have my iPod with me but I was wishing I did.

However, around 1/2 an hour later a bunch of guys came in and set up instruments at the far end of the cafe, complete with chimes and xylophone and sax, and proceeded to play jazzy versions of Christmas tunes, like the one from the Charlie Brown Christmas special. That was kind of cool and it finally led to a more decent atmosphere, except that with the weird layout of Gold Bar, unless you were sitting at the two tables in that section where the band was, you could barely see them playing. They were more or less disconnected with the rest of the cafe.

So I'm bummed to say Gold Bar was kind of a let down for me. I really appreciate the little indie holding steady against the corporate giant, and it was a lot mellower than Xtreme Bean if you wanted to get work done, but I'd probably rank it in the middle of the coffeehouse trio, behind Steve's Espresso, which was a lot more my kind of coffeehouse.

A tomato sauce is poured over the top and topped with garlic butter. Dollops of yogurt sauce completes this dish.  It is out of this world!!!!  We have had this in Turkey on  a few trips and I prefer the Med Fresh version.   

The chicken kabobs are lemony and moist.  The plate comes with rice pilaf, yummy salad, hummus, pickle and pita bread.  I usually split it with my daughter because it is so big.  The chicken doner is a nice treat either on a bed of rice or as a pita wrap.  Salads are generous in size and we love the dressing.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy.  The restaurant is always clean and the owners are very nice and welcoming.  Prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food you get.

There is a pedestrian street between the building facing Steeles, which has a few stores/restos, and the building with supermarket I described.

I'm not a HUGE In-n-out fan but it's OK so I tried the Habit. Of course you get the burger free but pay to add fries and a drink as expected. We then apparently made a mistake and asked for ""cheese fries"". (Which, btw, every restaurant I've ever been to can, and does, make.) 

Cashier said ""Uhhhh...I don't know if we can do that. Let me ask the manager."" Manager comes out and asks what we want. 
I explain again...""cheese fries...you know...fries with cheese melted on top."" 
She says no...that they don't have that. 
ME: ""Ok...do you have fries?"" 
MANAGER: ""Yes."" 
ME: ""Do you have cheese?"" 
MANAGER: ""Yes."" 
ME: ""Soooo...can you just put the cheese ON the fries?"" 
MANAGER: ""No."" 
ME: ""Is it about the cost? We can pay for the cheese separately as an extra piece of cheese for a burger and you can just put it on the fries. Would that work?"" 
MANAGER: ""We can't put cheese on your fries."" 
ME: ""Ok...can you just sell us a piece of cheese?""
MANAGER: ""Yes.""

Food comes out, and sure enough in a separate cardboard fry container...a single slice of cheese which we promptly flipped over on top of the fries and VOILA! Cheese fries! 
We made the amazing transformation right at the counter and showed them. I still don't understand why they couldn't just put it on the fries and skip the step and extra trash incurred by putting it in its own container, but whatever. Lol.

So...aside from the cheese fry incident the Habit was...eh. The taste wasn't anything special...probably rather go to In-n-out. The fries (even with cheese on them) weren't very good. The burger patty was very small. I wished I had gotten a double and I don't normally get doubles. The meat to bread/lettuce ratio was terrible. The prices weren't a great deal. I would say I probably wouldn't go back unless I got another free burger coupon and even then, because of the inflexibility of the cheese fry issue I believe I can safely say I won't go back at all.

My first time at Short Leash Dogs was at their recent sit and stay for a UYE. The food truck was nestled in a alley off Central and Camelback. Seating was outdoors with some wooden tables and a fire pit in the center, great for the s'more packs and the kids really love melting the marshmallows. 
Short Leash Dogs offer a new twist on the everyday hotdog. For the sit and stay they have a different menu.  I was there with a group of friends and although I really wanted to try the Bear I decided to try the bacon wrapped bockwurst. Lucky for me my friends tried both the bear and the pippin style dog.  We all shared so I got to try half the menu. 
The bockwurst was a very typical German style brat with German potato salad and gravy.  It wasn't very flavorful but it was delicious.  The pippin style dog was great and flavorful even without the naan. Adding some seratcho gave it a great kick that totally brought all the flavors together. The bear ended up being my favorite. It's unique blend of peanut butter, bacon, BBQ, cracker jacks and Gouda. This odd sounding combination when at first glance sound like it wouldn't work but the BBQ and peanut butter mesh together with a flavor explosion.  Most of the dogs can be made with a variety of hot dog choices like regular dog, beer dog, and more.  My first experience was awesome and I recommend trying one of the crazy sounding concoctions made at Short Leash Dogs.",2013-02-26 02:34:57

Arrived for breakfast shortly after 9 AM and the restaurant was very busy. We submitted our name and waited about 5 minutes for a table. Once seated service was prompt. The kitchen was slammed but the wait time for the food was acceptable. With a full house it was a little on the loud side, border line conversation friendly.
 
We ordered the Huevos Motulenus. Two eggs over easy, with red and green New Mexico Chiles, black beans, peas and pico on corn tortilla. This was a very tasty dish. The eggs were cooked to my satisfaction. A little heat from the red chili and the addition of peas was a welcome addition. The dish is served with Chive Potatoes which were crisp on the outside and soft inside. Soaking up the potatoes in the sauce was enjoyable.

The menu offers Pancakes in three sizes, full, short stack and one pancake. On this day the one pancake and a side order of Chive Potatoes was the right amount for breakfast. The pancake was fluffy and moist.

I recommend getting the mung bean noodles with sesame sauce. However, I like to get the sauce on the side because you can adjust the flavour to your liking. The first time I ordered it with the sauce, I found it too salty. 

Steamed dumplings are another must get. They make it right when you order so it is delivered to your table freshly steamed. I like getting the shrimp and veggie dumpling or the beef and radish dumpling. 

The braised beef with potato was a bit salty. Although I have to say, the beef was braised very well. It was very tender. There were also a lot of potatoes. Good dish but would prefer it to be a bit lighter on the sauce.

As for the pan fried green onion cake, most of the tables ordered one. It had a lot of green onions inside and the outer layer was crispy while the inside was soft. 

The sweet and sour sliced fish was unexpectedly delicious. The outside was fried so it is crispy and covered in a sweet and sour sauce that was tangy which I enjoyed. The fish inside was soft and tender. You could also feel the flaky texture of the fish which was good.

The wine pairing was the only element of the dinner that I found underwhelming. Normally, I expect a wine for each course. Some of them were meant for two courses and I would have finished the pour with once course in anticipation of the next.
The other issue was  the 'pour'. Wine was pre-poured and presented at the table with the bottle. I feel like with a menu this nice and service of this level that the wine ought to be poured AT the table. After all, the presentation is part of regular wine service.

Next time I had the same thing and the same thing the third time. Brent tried other things, and got the red curry and sushi. The fourth time I ordered the double fried noodles and those were mind-blowing! Why had I not tried these before? I also tried the saki ramen with seafood and loved it as well.

Great service too. The first time I came here it was pouring and the manager walked a patron and her three kids to their car under her umbrella. She was also very helpful in letting me substitute glass noodles in my stir fried noodles. Good service AND good food. Kudos!",2016-04-13 14:53:39

It's so good to have Twitter foodie friends because they lead to all sorts of yummy places.  After having seen View the Vibe's photos of the Seafood Bent-o Box for 2 at BENT - the restaurant moved right to the top of my to-try list.   Oh, and to make it all that much more enticing - it's $35 for 2 (before 7pm, or $42 from 7pm onwards).  Top that Summerlicious!

BENT, is a family-owned business and the patriarch of said family is none other than celebrity chef Susur Lee.  The restaurant is named after Lee's wife, Brenda Bent and the kids are running the show.

I can only assume that the decor consists of Kai and Levi Bent-Lee's childhood toys (with an array of figurines neatly displayed on the back wall - the way an obsessive collector would display them).  Behind the bar you'll find some vintage Pachinko machines.

The atmosphere is reminiscent of a cafeteria (with conversation abuzz and wooden benches and orange/yellow chairs for seating).  You also get an infusion of old school diner thrown into the mix with bulb-lined mirrors and mosaic-tiled floors.

BENT is what I would dub a raw bar or fusion seafood restaurant with a heavy focus on sashimi, and a well-stocked selection of sake to go with.  For those who prefer their food cooked, look no further than the Hot Kitchen section of the menu.

The Seafood Bent-o was just the kind of light and refreshing meal I wanted on a humid day such as yesterday.

My favourites by far were the Oyster Sake Shot (top centre) and Spicy Tuna with Avocado Tartare (second row, left) served sushi-style on a delicious crispy rice cake.  The Tuna-Watermelon Ceviche (top right) was the most interesting in terms of complexity as you had spicy, fatty tuna that was balanced out with cool, refreshing watermelon.

The entire Bent-o box was plenty for 2, though we did opt for the Duck Salad Wraps ($18) because I absolutely love duck. While I applaud the creativity (e.g. Susur's signature Asian slaw and creamy foie gras pâté) as components of the filling, I found that the duck breast and confit itself was seriously lacking any real duck flavour.  If there was any, the tangy Asian slaw was a good cover-up though the foie gras saves the show and it is here that we taste the real duck flavour.

Dinner ends in true Chinese restaurant fashion with complementary desserts - but instead of the usual sweet red bean soup we get surprised with a Mango Pana Cotta topped with tapioca rice pudding and a Strawberry Rhubarb and Lemon Curd Parfait with hints of mint.  A refreshing and divine way to end the evening (especially with a cup of Americano).

I really enjoyed my meal at BENT.  The food was creative without trying too hard, and the flavours were amazing.  It is a fun place to dine, but I wouldn't order too many drinks (at $17 a cocktail I'd rather order another dish).  The service is friendly and attentive (at least until it comes time to pay your bill).  The total for 2 net of tip was $105, which includes 2 cocktails and 2 Americanos.

Due to its popularity, BENT has extended their Seafood Bent-o promotion until Saturday, June 8.  Better get on the phone fast, as reservations are booking up fast!

ENen4cSOs0_uA6gYgvvIUA,WZpMPeySrgYiUfBF3PzZJw,BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA,2,9,2,1,"Having spent many a happy hour and dinner time at this location when it was Joe's, we anxiously awaited the remodel and new opening. They did a great job of opening up the inside and the patio is a super nice environment for eating outside (despite the motorcycle noise on the street). The place was full with people giving it a try and time will tell if the crowds continue to flock. Having been in food i know the need to build ""activity and excitement"" in a place so it doesn't seem like a morgue with classical music however.... with so many hard surfaces in this place (walls, floors, ceiling, tables, etc.), the noise level almost made it impossible to hear someone 3 feet across the table. Think about some softer items somewhere. Even in Italy they hang tapestries. 

As my companion said, ""nothing to make me really want to come back.""  Let's face it, there are more Mexican and Italian places around than you could eat at in a year, so there's got to be something special to make you revisit other than location. I was disappointed enough to have the same feeling after such anticipation.

First, I hate when restaurants are so pretentious as to bring out your ""portion"" of wine in a small carafe and pour it into a large glass (that seems the size of a football next to the portion) hoping you'll be impressed with their effort to dirty another container on your behalf. Sorry, just pour a nice glass of wine and bring it out. And it really does makes the portion look small. I'd rather have the wine than the experience. OK, it's a personal thing.

Second, as a test of new places, especially Italian, I try the Caesar salad. Not sure why but it's always been an indication. Well... Disappointment Central. I hate sending things back but there was as much taste as one might find chewing on their gym socks - maybe less. If there was any garlic at all, it's only cause it was walked through a room with garlic on a counter. You can usually taste the tang of the lemon juice...not to be found. It was a real disaster and I'm sure the creator is spinning in his grave somewhere in San Diego. If you like Caesar salads... I'd pass on this one.

Next, I wanted to try something different so I jumped on the Short Rib Ravioli. I'm always up for something new but maybe good short rib meat shouldn't be chopped, mushed and pureed. For some reason, the taste and texture belonged in a old age facility for people with no teeth. OK, I like my meat with texture and chunks. I guess the other thing was that the very rich beef stock sauce combined with the filling was really overwhelming. It would have been great over a nice charred steak with mushrooms and onions but on delicate pasta? Not so much. I've had great sauces and unique items and fillings at some terrific places but sometimes it just doesn't fit. Move on.

And overall, the waiter must have been extremely new (like 5 minutes?) as his attention to guests and quick, relaxed knowledge of things wasn't there. We deliberately waited a bit before showing up here so as not to get caught in the grand opening fray and to let things settle in a bit. Staff training is PARAMOUNT in a place of this projected level.

My last thought is about pricing. Italian and Mexican food places can be among the most profitable. After all, their menus are mainly based on less expensive commodities of rice, beans and flour. I was hoping this was a nice normal affordable place to sit and eat and enjoy some quality yet casual Italian love from the kitchen in a nice friendly neighborhood eatery. We didn't want to pay over $75 or $100 to do it. OK, they have to recoup the money put into very nice wall coverings and lighting and it is a nice atmosphere but... don't do it all on my check.

I never want to be unkind and maybe I should cut the owners some slack but hey... this isn't their first place so experience should count for something. Anyhow, with all that said, it might be worth a return visit to try their pizza which comes out of a nice looking wood burning oven. i'll update later as the motivation strikes me to repeat. 

Just keeping it real!

And get rid of those little carafes.",2015-02-03 16:29:44

They started us off with parmesan crisp and some whipped butter and some water. They gave us room temp and we had to ask for ice a few times as they brought some out a cup at a time to share among us six. 

I picked turkey meatballs for my starter. This was pretty good meatballs and the sauce it was in was solid. I liked the ricotta and the onions with it. It needed some yummy bread with it which it doesnt come with though.

Entree I had the Biloxi Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich. A bit messy to eat, but I liked the mustard dressing that was on the chicken sandwich. It came with a bowl of a chopped salad with kale, greens, avocado, what seemed to be raw squash cubes and creamy dressing which was just okay. Not a bad option, but nothing special. 

Dessert I got banana bread pudding which was a substitution since they ran out of one of the options. I love bread pudding and this was really friggin good. The only thing is I think it needs ice cream for contrast than just whipped cream. That was probably the best part of the meal for me and was better than the strawberry shortcake that was the other option. It was also a huge portion and I couldn't finish it, definitely enough to share.

The won ton soup is good, especially with just a hint of the spicy chili powder condiment they can provide.  The presentation in a flaming donut cauldron (not sure what the correct name is, and too lazy to ask the Internet) is cool, and the soup stays nice and hot.  I like to get a side of rice for my soup too.  The crispy won ton appetizer is also good, but I've managed to avoid the temptation of ordering other delicious sounding items (like the $12 shrimp tempura special I almost fell for today), since I knew I'd have leftovers from my soup once it was bulked up with rice.

They've had a full remodel since the car crashed into their restaurant.  The flooring is kind of ugly (it's that industrial-looking gray tile that Costco sells), and the wall decor is meh, but I like the tables and booths.

Dinging them one star for the obnoxious 3% credit card processing fee they're passing on to their customers.  At least my card gave me back 2% of the bill as cash back.  The tiny parking lot can also get crowded.

He tried to catch it with his foot to avoid shattered glass, and sent it spinning instead, spraying several of our feet.  But, his quick-witted and self-deprecating reaction was perfect (shit happens), and our service was truly the best I've had in years, anywhere.

Added a small plate to the list of those I've tried and enjoyed here, the mushrooms, which are a tempura preparation, and had the braised veal shoulder which was out. of. sight.  I mean it was perfect.  A nice crust on the outside, and just melty slow-cooked goodness inside.  Outrageous flavor.  The brussels sprouts were even better than Lolita's because they tasted like brussels sprouts.  Didn't think this was possible.

The bread and butter continues to be better than bread and butter should be.

This is not the finest dining in Cleveland.  But for a $23 entree, the food and service quality far exceed expectations.

$9 for chicken drummies. ***THIS....was our favorite for the night. Basically it's 6 drumsticks packed with flavor and seasoning.***

$7 for shishito peppers.
$8 chicken skin. Not a fan....because it's like chicken skin in crispy chip form. NOT worth the money.
$6 for house pickles(cucumbers, lotus roots, carrots)

Well I was ready to walk back out after standing around waiting to get a table in the dead empty restaurant.

Sitting outside on the patio it took a solid 5 minutes for someone else to show up and offer us drinks, then another 5 to get menus. Now I wasn't in a hurry on this particular day, but most people are on a time limit for lunch and would not appreciate this kind of service. I'm kind of shocked by the prices here 20+ dollars for a pizza is a bit expensive. So I opted to try a sandwich for $12. I selected a tempeh sandwich which theoretically sounded good on the menu but after it arrived and a couple bites I took out all the tempeh which tasted quite sour and rancid and just dumped a bunch of parmesan and pepper on the remaining lettuce, and tomato and ate it like that.

The ambiance of the place was just enough. Not too much, not too little. A perfect balance of class and simplicity. Very zen.

The service was excellent as well. Attentive, discrete and proactive.

Now let's go to the good stuff: the fish. What can I say, it was just great. The cuts, the flavor, the balance was excellent. The rice consistency and the fish quality was spot on.

Of course this is not a cheap place and the portions are small but that's pretty much the standard on an expensive restaurant. 

The party I went with which consisted on a Japanese citizen and another sushi lover like me, were completely impressed.

We were VERY disappointed in the pizza, however. It was $50 for two 18"" pizzas, first of all. The crust tasted burnt, the sauce was almost non-existent, and the spinach tasted funky (like it was already old and slimy before it was put on the pizza). We peeled the spinach off and it still wasn't good. I hate Little Caesar's, and I'd have rather had that instead. From now on, only Rocco's or Grimaldi's for us.

All their baked rice casseroles are also consistently good over the years. The only downside is that their menu does not change very often (which I'm okay with!). Everyone I know always comes here for a meal after they've been out of town - whether for school or a trip. You'll definitely see familiar faces if you become a regular, just like everyone else eating there!

The sticker on the side said ""salted caramel mocha"" but when I took a sip that was definitely something peppermint!  I opened the lid to look and there was caramel and salt so I feel like someone was making a peppermint mocha or something and got mixed up and finished it as if it was a salted caramel mocha.  I was late for work so I didn't go in to say anything as I had already drove off.  I get it, mistakes happen, but the fact that it was like half of one drink and half of another is kind of scary for allergy reasons.

I was very excited to receive complimentary tickets to Shania's show. I had never been in the Colosseum for one, and well, it's Shania! If you love Country-Pop, you know what this means.

Drink prices were 'meh' but they were on par with other notoriously famous and successful venues.

We were seated and to my delight, we had 4th row orchestra seats! Shimmery flowy gold curtains adorned the stage. I didn't realize how BIG the stage was, until the curtains were pulled back.

Shania opens up with an upbeat number. Her costumes show off her still bangin' body (I hope I look that hot when I'm 47!).

While her voice admittedly, isn't what it used to be (she did suffer vocal cord trauma), she still delivers a solid performance of both singing, dancing, and a yahoo good time.

Scene changes are smooth, her musical performers (dancers and musicians) are ALL good looking. They seem like they're having a lot of fun on stage as well.

One thing about her show that stood out for me-I've never had a smell-o-vision experience like this. She wants to stimulate all of your senses, it seems. Depending on the scene, there are aromas to go along with it. Musky campfire, sexy perfume aroma, one time I swore I was standing in a lush forest.

iMANWAjR5bFEFfBlDl2Z3w,nHxQfB9CRettoPKJmkDx_A,XItYW5ul3OW_AqpT2nDbBQ,3,4,0,3,"Since its opening in Point Breeze, I've been a big fan of Point Brugge Restaurant.  When I heard that the owners and chef of that establishment were opening a new place in Highland Park, I was excited to try the food.  
We arrived at Park Bruge close to 6pm, and there was already a nice crowd.  Clearly, the word had spread that good food was being served in the Morningside/Highland Park area, and loyal patrons to Point Brugge (located in Point Breeze) , as well as newbies were already enjoying the fare.  Although Park Bruge had only been open for a month, it was already starting to attract a loyal following. 
Décor/Ambiance  
Park Bruge restaurant isn't overly-decorated.  There is a large window on the front of the building that let's passers-by know that there's something going on inside.  At present, there's no sign either; but this didn't seem to dissuade people from finding its location.  
Upon entering, you will see a small bar on the right hand side- during our visit it was crowded with hungry customers waiting for a table, as well as people enjoying good Belgian beers and imported wine.    The interior can best be described as modern, and understated; a perfect combination for a place that serves simply prepared clean food.  There is ample lighting, but things aren't too bright, which means you can read your menu without having to find your glasses, or a spare flashlight.  Tables and booths are carefully arranged in the dining room providing plenty of room for the wait staff and patrons to move about.
Food
We got a few beers, and looked over the menu.  Of course we ordered the mussels which arrived in a thing garlicky broth, and fresh bread.  The mussels were fresh, and tasted like the ocean.  My dinner companion asked, ""Where else can you get mussels this good?""  I didn't have an answer.  We devoured or seafood, and listened to our server tell us about the specials.  One of the items was a striped bass; not something you see on most menus in the Pittsburgh area.  Although it sounded tempting, I ordered a burger with cheddar and homemade coleslaw.  We also chose the seared pork chop with potatoes, tomatoes, and gingered apples.  Our dinners arrived within minutes, and we quickly dug in.  The burger was good (just like those at Point Brugge).  The coleslaw was fresh, and not gooped-up with extra mayonnaise.  The portion was a nice size, but not too big; perfect to satisfy my appetite.  The beef was seasoned, and cooked to my specifications.   The pork was succulent and not over-done.  If you've had moist-free pork chops in the past, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the tenderness of these chops.  The chived-mashed potatoes were creamy, and there was a nice hint of ginger that complimented the natural sweetness of the pork.
Service
The service at park Bruge was stellar.  Our every need was met with a smile, and the waitstaff was courteous and competent.
Cost
Prices at Park Bruge are reasonable.  Appetizers start around $8.00. Entrees begin at the $12.00 to $14.00 range, and can go up to $28.00 depending on the nightly specials.
Conclusion
The owners of Park Bruge clearly have another hit on their hands.  A combination of talent in the kitchen, an excellent selection of Belgian beers and imported wines, and a fun environment will surely have hungry patrons coming back for more.

They appeared to be short staff yet the waitress acknowledge us so it was all good. I originally order a draft beer and it was served warm in a cold glass. Of course I'm not hesitant to advise them of this matter and at first, the waitress appear to have a look of disgust, yet she took care of it right away. The manager look into the issue and confirm that someone had turned off the switch and advise it would take about 10 minutes to get a cold one to me.  Kudos to him for handling the matter immediately and with professionalism.  I order the Dang Butterscotch Root beer and it was amazingly good.  Cold, in a bottle and served right away.  The pretzel was good and beware of the honey mustard sauce. It's got a kick like the one you get from eating horse radish so be forewarned. The Jerk Chicken brat was tasty served over a hearty portion of sauerkraut. The beet salad could use a lot less dressing and I recommend skipping that plate unless you like a lot of oil on your greens or perhaps, order the dressing on the side.

This square-shaped sparkly thing gets an A+ on the presentation, and they make some great cocktails. The rest of the place... not so much. I agree with everyone else: Hanny's has a great concept for a place. They left the skeleton of an old department store intact -- complete with a completely unusable second story -- but the results aren't spectacular. The restaurant looks great inside, like it should be a real classy establishment. So why are they serving pizzas here? The pies are decent, yeah, but really? Shouldn't we be getting steak here? Prime rib? A nice grouper fillet perhaps? With such a nice space and a primo location right in the heart of downtown, I'd think Hanny's could step it up in the food department.

The restaurant's signage can be a little difficult to miss as the strip mall is large with many stores so it can be overlooked.  Once you're facing Office Max, just walk to the right pass Panda Express and a couple other stores and you shouldn't miss it then.  
Plenty of parking is available but remember parking spots are shared with other surrounding businesses so the parking area can get a little busy but don't fret, if you can't find a parking spot in front of the business, you can easily park in the surrounding vicinity and walk, and the walk isn't far at all...just a couple feet.  
The restaurant is clean, spacious and well lit however my only gripe with the atmosphere was there was no separate place to order to go.  If one wanted to place an order to go, either you would call ahead or, if you're on the premises, you have to walk through the restaurant, pass the dinning tables where other patrons are dining

Menu - The menu is available at the counter where you place your order to go.  You can even chose to sit at the counter which resembles a bar counter and wait for the order or eat it there.  There's a lunch menu which is a bit cheaper ($8).  I also believe you can place your order online as well.  

Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  The lady who took our orders answered any questions we had.  

Food - I order the sweet and sour chicken which, to my puzzlement, came separated in two containers unlike the rest of the orders that was placed.  I guess this was to ensure the rice didn't become saturated with the sweet and sour sauce.  
The rice was soft and hot (the way I prefer), the chicken was well cooked and seasoned with the correct proportion of chicken to vegetables in the sweet and sour sauce.  The latter - the sweet and sour sauce was perfectly made with the correct ratio of sweet versus sour, neither being too overpowering to the other.

I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings on the menu!",2015-01-22 18:52:25

In a stroke of miraculous luck, I won 3-day GA tickets to LIB 2015 courtesy of Yelp. Once again, Yelp has shown that it's neat to elite - Thanks Yelp! LIB is a great music festival that has all the elements festival goers are looking for: a vibrant and positive energy, good food reflecting local culinary talent, and most importantly an eclectic set of bands and musicians. The summer heat was excruciating and three days filled with revelry was exhausting, but LIB is something that must be experienced at least once!   

I attended LIB with a friend who purchased a parking pass for about $40. The pass is good for everyone in the car. Every time we arrived around 5pm, shuttles were lined up out front of the parking garage. The drive to the festival took less than 10 minutes and the shuttles were in tip top condition. I'd recommend carpooling and buying the shuttle pass to simplify the parking question.

Entry into the festival was a breeze. There was never a line. All you had to do was scan your bracelet at the gate and you're good to go. Purses are searched but security makes this process quick and pain free. Unopened water bottles are allowed. Festival goers have reentry freedoms, so take advantage of nearby casinos for access to clean restrooms and local bars for cheap[er] alcohol.   

The festival generally kicks off around 3pm each day and goes past midnight. Some musical standouts (for me at least) for the 2015 lineup included Lindsey Stirling, Twenty One Pilots, Hozier, Glass Animals, Carnage, and Snoop Dogg. I really liked the diversity at LIB, but I have to point out that there is zero rock, punk, or metal bands here. Guess it's not the right scene? The Downtown Stage had the best visibility due to two large TVs/screens installed and was the largest stage at the festival. I feel like improvements could be made to the other stages (like putting the TVs higher up so people in the back can see better and adding TVs to all stages). For the Snoop Dogg performance, I could not see anything. I'd say half of the thousands of people in the crowd couldn't see anything. But hey, maybe those improvements will come in the future. These snafus are to be expected at large music festivals.  

The food available at LIB is impressive. There are tons of food trucks to choose from representing Las Vegas's finest (Yay Garden Grill!). There was also a couple of artificially turfed areas filled to the brim with legit food options from local restaurants who set up shop just for LIB (like Vegenation)! Craving sushi? You can find it at LIB! There was plenty of alcohol options to choose from as well. Beer, wine, fancy cocktails, and shots were all ready for the taking. Pricing is reflective of the usual festival rates. Water stations and fountains are set up throughout the event, so take advantage!

All in all, LIB is one kick ass festival. I hope Vegas keeps up the love for LIB.

Well coming into the restaurant few days after they open and it does not look like it's ready for opening. Decor and restaurant still looks a little bare. No music or anything on so conversations are a little awkward to have when everyone can hear.. Restaurant not ready for opening. On top of that owners not here one of the main reasons smaller restaurants like this fail. Still decided to try the food.

So I go in and look at the menu restaurant style is teriyaki madness-ish. Prices are restaurant range. Beef shrimp combo 16$ for a pretty small portion. Twice the price for half the food at Panda Express or teriyaki madness. Two entrees and two drinks 40$. 

Still I don't like to write negative reviews and wasn't going to if it weren't for the lack of service and wait time. I then decided to politely return a meal I took a bite out of since it completely tasted like pepper (beef yakisoba) and had to wait 25 minutes to try and return it.


Wouldn't go back. I always try to find the good in places and be as optimistic as possible but this restaurant just didn't do it for me.

The kids working there and the girl taking our order were sweet and tried but we're just inexperienced not there fault the food was below par and overpriced.

The 'roti' was actually a tortilla; it was filled with some heated chick peas (I could tell by their texture that they had been dried) sauteed onions, and large chunks of potato.

For salad, I was told by the lady at the counter that I would have a choice of cous cous, greens or one other-- the woman serving me didn't ask me, just gave me greens. For dressing I chose the vinaigrette, which was gelatinous in texture and they put WAY WAY WAY too much on. Tomatoes on my salad were mushy. 

This meal came to $7.75. Not impressed.

They offer a good selection (~7) of their own microbrews, covering most beer categories. I opted for the Saison which was crisp, clean and nicely carbonated. They also have a few different wine selections.

New Gen has a nicer interior, and free soup, salad and ice cream with every meal. I am a sucker for green tea ice cream, so that is one point for New Gen.

Sushi on Bloor is a bit cheaper, which I liked, but New Gen's rolls are generally tastier. Also New Gen has a lot of vegetarian options that my vegetarian friends swear by.

Expect lineups around dinner, but they have a pretty fast turnover rate so you shouldn't be waiting long. They're also open really late which comes in handy if you get sushi cravings at midnight. Which I totally do.",2008-12-09 17:03:30

-Negi Hamachi: Classic, delicious.
-Super Spicy Roll: Spicy yellow tail, tuna, salmon, avocado, smelt roe

I shop at the grocery store next door all the time.  I called ahead after reading their menu online.  I normally don't order a to go order at a restaurant I have not previously visited, but I took a chance.  I ordered an onion and mushroom cheese steak with no peppers.  A large pizza half cheese half pepperoni and a pastrami and provolone sub.  The total was almost $40 dollars.  Which I think it is a pretty good deal. 

They told me it would be ready in about 25 minutes, since it was lunch time I completely understood.  I got there after 15 minutes and the hostesses at the front were friendly.  I looked around and they had a side with booths as well as with restaurant style tables.  They also have a nice patio outside.  Like I mentioned, 15 minutes after placing the order the food was ready when I arrived.  They brought it from the kitchen nice and hot.  It smelled great in there.  The pizza I got filled my car with that delicious scent.  LOL  I paid and was on my way.  

Over all, I'd like to say that everything I ordered was tasty.  Specially after ordering blindly.  The only tiny itty bitty issue I had was with my steak and cheese.  It was very dry, I expected my sub to have mayo, lettuce and tomato, sadly it was plain.  The steak had not been cut up or cooked properly to make it tender so it was very dry and flavorless.  Just large pieces topped with the mushrooms, onion and cheese.  

My husbands pastrami sub was really good per him.  Ans the pizza was tasty.  We have plans to go back and have a seat down meal soon.",2018-03-16 03:12:55

Space much improved for dark and dreary LaPaz caveman space.  From the moment we walked into the new bright, expansive restaurant, we were treated like we were the only patrons there, even though there was a large party of 10 - 12 rigth beside us, our service never waivered.   Our server, Adela, was great - even recommending we share a plate since the portions are quite large. 

 We opted for a chopped salad with a mild Italian dressing, variety of lettuce crisp with fresh garbonzo  beans and a wedge salad with their house dressing which is similar to ranch.  Both were brought out in chilled plates - huge plus in my book.  It is the little things that were done throughout the evening that made for such an enjoyable dinner.  We noted to Adela that we were not in any hurry and she paced the delivery of the entree accordingly.  We paired the Coco Lasagna (crazy lasagna) with a nice, slightly chilled Italian wine.  I love it when a restaurant serves the red wine at the appropriate temperature - not room temperature at 72 to 74 degrees but more 66 to 68.  It so improves the wine experience.  

Getting back to the lasagna - kitchen split the dish before serving to us and HELLO no splitting charge which I have yet to figure out why any establishment would do this.  Same quantity of food, only takes 2 seconds to split and plate on two plates instead of one and they charge for this?  Hubby (aka Bulldawg) loved his lasagna but loves his garlic too and thought maybe dish could have had a little more garlic.  Enter Alexander, stage right.  He asked Bully about his food and he didn't hold back on his need for speed - I mean garlic - next thing we knew Bully's dish disappeared and reappeared a few minutes later with an improved bolognese sauce with Bully's drug of choice - garlic.  We could not get enough of this sauce. I actually thought the second dish they brought to the table was another full portion which was great , totally unexpected and added with my leftovers, we will have another full meal.  

This place is a date night, girls nite out, hiding out from the in-laws and pretending you are in Italy kind of place.    Loved every minute we were there and oh yes, free valet parking.  This places does it right!",2013-05-10 13:28:52

More expensive, far more pretentious, so average yet aims so high.  My food was very, very average. Best thing was the grilled asparagus but balsamic and Parmesan is something I can do myself. Fish was blah. Really. While I certainly didn't ask anyone to taste my fish, I'm telling you, no one you or I know would have sampled my fish and exclaimed, ""God, this is good!"" because it wasn't. It was BLAND. No smoke flavor, no benefit from plank-cooking. Really, the problem was:
                      NO FLAVOR. 

And they're not giving anything away. Let me put it to you this way: as I was walking out I passed a 12-top, 12 folks chomping away at a variety of seafood, and all I could think of was the guy who signs that check for $900 is not going home happy. It's a friggin' Bennigans and now it's a $1000 bucks.

Oh, and one more thing: maybe could you let the staff at King's Fish House know: 
per State Law: you are not once allowed to touch face/hair/each other while serving food?  Good Lord!  How do you get a foodhandlers card in Maricopa County and not know this?  Hmmm.  Somehow King's Fish House employees missed these memos. Sheesh. Or worse. Its disgusting and I saw at least half a dozen crewmembers ignore this strict food policy. 

HAND CONTAMINATION 
IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF 
FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS. Fact. 

IF YOU TOUCH YOUR FACE OR HAIR YOU MUST WASH 
  
Slow Service.  There wasn't one thing, not one instance I encountered in my visit that could've been defined as ""prompt"". Doesn't the word ""tip"", stand for ""to insure promptness""? Kinda does. 

And one more thing, (again): fix your website. I hit ""contact us"" and got the recipe page. I hit the recipe page link and got recipes. The prices on the menu were not at all current.  IN OTHER WORDS, WHY ISN'T ANYONE AT BENNIGANS, errrrr, KING'S FISH HOUSE -- paying attention to your website?

And one more thing: do ya just take any image, of anyone, anything, put a frame around it, and hang it in the wall?  Is that interior decorating nowadays?  Because they've got stuff on the wall that is so random, so arbitrary, so busy, so nothing-to-do-with-fish, it's not so much ""odd""as it is just so ordinary. No one, not even King's Fish House, aspires to ordinary.

I did not check out the menu ahead of time so my expectations were slightly different than reality. Based on the name, I was expecting a late night restaurant (which it is) that serves upscale (which it does), bar food (which it does NOT). Well, let me clarify. There are bar food-y items on the menu (chicken wings, flatbread, fries, poutine, etc.), but it's not a bar food restaurant, if that makes sense.
If I'm going to eat at 1AM after a night out, I'm probably drunk and want nachos, rather than a pan seared trout.
Now this isn't necessarily a complaint (I mean, I'm giving it 5 stars still!).
Moving on, we walked in and were greeted and seated right away. Our server was great, very friendly and enthusiastic and already knowledgeable about the menu.
We started with a bottle of sauv blanc and the short ribs. The short ribs were not what we were expecting, but should have. The suggested wine pairing is a Korean Viognier and its parinaded in a soy marinade and comes with fresh kimchi on the side. Should we have expected Korean style short ribs? Probably. Did we? No. They were good, but per that cut, a bit tough and fatty. The kimchi was more like a coleslaw than kimchi. And for $14 for two thin slices of short rib, seemed very overpriced. My sandwich had beef cutlet, a fried egg and french fries with it for the same price.
I had the milanesa sandwich and my friend had the chopped salad with chicken. We both thoroughly enjoyed out entrees.

HK Star is a Chinese seafood restaurant with a caffeteria-like feel tucked inconspicuously behind the more well known China Mama's. Though the ambience and several of their dishes leave something to be desired, there are some redeeming items on the menu.

Two such gems include the aforementioned 'salt and pepper cod' ($6.95 lunch, $9.95 dinner) and 'salt and pepper shrimp' ($6.95 lunch, $11.95 dinner). Both are lightly battered and deep fried, then tossed with hot chilies and crispy garlic bits. The 'salt' description rings true as well, though they have successfully managed to not go overboard with it. I couldn't pick a favorite between the two options, as the cod is flaky and moist and the shrimp are plump and snappy. These are certainly the best two items on the menu, and you won't miss the 'chips' at all.

The sauteed vegetables ($5.95 lunch, $7.95 dinner) come with a nice variety of mushrooms, one of which is kind of chewy and sponge like. After a google search I think I can call it 'snow fungus,' though I can't be entirely sure. Pass on the Kung Pao cod ($9.95) as the only flavors emerging from the blonde sauce come from the peanuts and MSG.

The scene is a hurried and the staff are not entirely friendly, but for the prices of those fried morsels I'm willing to tolerate a less than stellar overall experience. Come in with low expectations (with the exception of the salt and pepper selections) and you will leave satisfied.",2010-08-25 23:10:10

This is where I was introduced to the concept of small bites to share among friends.  I really love this concept and was hoping I could find something like that in Phoenix.  Sure enough, we have something like that in Phoenix, and it even has a communal table.  Yay!

We met a couple friends here one night and were sat near the end of the communal table, but in a rather odd configuration because the party next to us was a group of three.  In any event we were handed menus and we got down to business in selecting our food.  This was a little while ago, so I don't remember too well what we got, but I will do my best.  We chose the Serrano Ham with Cheese, a Shrimp dish similar to scampi, a Filet Mignon dish, and something else that I just cannot remember.

I am a big fan of artisan meat and cheese plates, especially ones with manchego cheese.  There was enough food on the plate to give all of us a little something to try and whet our appetites a bit.  The shrimp dish was amazing.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and sat in a pool of delicious garlicky-buttery goodness.  I wished there was more, but we all got a couple shrimp.  Finally, of what I remember, was the Filet Mignon dish.  I believe it was actually the special that night.  It was soooo decadent.  The meat was grilled to a beautiful medium and it was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork.  There were two cuts of meat served in this dish, so there was plenty to go around.  Everything was absolutely delicious.

If you are familiar with the concept of tapas and don't go in here with the mindset of traditional American dining (that you will be filled to the brim, pushing you past the point of gluttony) then you will love this place.  The communal table is lots of fun, and I guarantee you will meet someone new, especially if the alcohol is flowing.

The shrimp and artichoke and the lobster/crab crepes. Oh yeah and the short rib baguette delicious, too! LOL

When my parents come and visit or friends from out of town, we always always take them to Cafe Monte for breakfast or a late lunch. And occasionally we'll walk by and order some macarons or a fruit tart to go.

The food has a great presentation. It started with this duck appetizer which I loved. The main course, however, was salty to me. I ordered the shrimp. I asked the people in my party how their food was, and they all said theirs was very salty as well, even the vegetarian entree.

There was a line out the door and we were approximately waiting for 15 minutes before ordering. Their selection of bubble teas has some unique flavours - Royal Number 9 Milk Tea is one of the more popular drinks, along with their brown sugar drinks, sodas and their Aurora series. Have yet to try their deerioca as it always runs out before the end of the night. We saw their drinks with multi layers of slush being made - that's next to try here. 

Not sure what it is but I find their milk teas pretty watery compared to other bubble tea shops in the plaza. I do enjoy the light blueberry taste of the Royal No. 9 and it's different from other tea shops in the plaza. Half sweet was sweet enough sugar for me. A large Royal Number 9 with tapioca came up to $6 and change. I couldn't tell if their tapioca is supposed to be super plain or if they forgot to soak it in syrup prior to serving it. 

Ask for a stamp card and make your visits worthwhile. I love that their aesthetic is dark, mysterious, and modern.

We started with some nacho chips and guacamole which was sub-standard to start. The guacamole was fresh but it lacked substance and pop; it tasted rather bland and lacked chunkiness, namely speaking the tomatoes, onions, and corriander. Our entire table got three taco platters which included 9 tacos. 3 each which were beef and chicken and then the remaining 3 either shrimp or fish. This was a shame because the beef and chicken tacos weren't all that great and everyone agreed that we should have gotten all shrimp or fish if that was possible. The fish and shrimp tacos were by far the best ones. There was sweet creamy sauce which complimented the shrimp taco well, whereas the fish tacos had a large piece of crispy fish. The beef and chicken tacos were bland and lacked seasoning. The salsa Verde which was on some of the chicken tacos did nothing to the tacos. The nachos and Pico de Gallo were a nice addition to the platter. Service was fine and we had no problems.

Had all the crazy food offerings of any fair, but all we had was an icee and funnel cake. Haha yeah, total fatties. Lot of fair games but sadly not many rides. Had a neat petting zoo though with wallabes, so cute! We had to pay 15 for parking and parked kind of far away because the fair was crazy packed! But there was some kind of special and we got in for 2 dollars per person, so that worked out. I think we spent a total of 3 hours here and had enough to do.

My husband and I have been out here many times, the most recent was this past Friday. Food Truck Friday is located beside Common Market in Historic Southend. Basically, there are about 10 or so food trucks and a lot of space to sit around (so make sure to bring a blanket or chairs!) We ended up eating at the amazing Chrome Toaster and got the pupusa special for the night (If you dont know what a pupusa is, google it and then go find the awesome Chef Aaron to get one....they are A-mazing!). $10 for a pupusa, side (fried mac and cheese...duh!) and drink. We got the Bahn Mi pupusa and Duck pupusa. Both were awesome. 

As for Food Truck Friday, here are some tips:

-BYOB- You can bring beer/wine out here. You can also buy this at Common Market and bring it out there. However, Common Market's lines are suuuuuuuuuper long so I would suggest just bringing your own.
-Get there early. I believe it starts at 5 and hitting around 7 it is so slammed that alot of food choices are sold out and the lines are just way crazy.
-Lines......expect them. I mean think about it, one truck with a small handful of people are cooking your food. It's actually pretty amazing that they are even able to pump out that much food so kuddos to the chefs/assistants! Grab a drink and expect a wait to order and a wait to receive. I have never once regretted my wait for food though!
-Parking is pretty darn aweful. Fortunately, my husband and I live walking distance so this isnt an issue. I would suggest parking at the 485 light rail stop and taking the light rail in. It saves you time, energy, and frustration.",2014-08-25 14:21:32

But going to this fairly casual establishment, I figured I'd be fine... But no... I was overwhelmed. I felt SO uncultured. I had to Google basically every single menu item. I'm not exaggerating. Everything on the menu was something (or was topped with something) I've never heard of. 

I was already feeling like I wasn't hip enough to be there, but now I truly felt like I didn't belong. 

We decided to try a few things. The roasted vegetables, the skirt steak, and the grilled pulpa. We received our vegetables pretty fast. We were advised that the plates would come out as the were finished. (vague... Weird...) Those veggies were BOMB! Perfect comfort food. We took our time savoring the yumminess, and then waited quite a while for a RARE skirt steak. I can't eat meat that pink. I had Googled the sauce described on the menu. Smelled good... Wish I would have had some say on how the meat was cooked. But never fear... Grilled Pulpo was on its way. This dish was the only thing I hadn't Googled. The menu description just said potatoes, so lame-o uncultured me pictured some kind of potato dish. Ummm... After waiting several minutes for my ""potato dish"" a server walks out with a plate of freakin' OCTOPUS... aka Pulpo! It LITERALLY means octopus! I'm a fool! 

I'm basically 8 years old and simply cannot deal. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his MASSIVE dinner while I sat reminiscing wistfully over the four pieces of roasted cauliflower and potatoes I devoured thirty + minutes ago while trying to avert my eyes from him eating TENTACLES! 

Never ever would I had thought that the menu of such a light-hearted establishment would be so intense. The members of TLC were pictured just below the Bone Marrow ""shared plate"". This is coming from a fairly absurd individual, but doesn't that strike you as a bit comical? The movie Airplane! was playing over my head as I was Googling the word ""chimichurri"". They brought the check out in a copy of a hardback Garbage Pail Kids book and have you rate their service on a 5 point scale of ""dopeness"".

Our server listed the beers by region, not by maker, which was strange.  But we had the Greek beer, which turned out to be Hilla.  Served in a cold glass.  It went well with the food.

We came here just before 9pm on Friday. The sign outside says they close at 9pm every night of the week, except Sunday which is 8pm.  But they seemed to stay open past 9pm, so I don't know.

Red sangria - Strong but well-balanced, not too sweet. 

Sauteed padron peppers - This is a big plate, better suited for four; between the two of us, we each had over a dozen peppers. Beware: the heat is cumulative, so you may be a few peppers in before your boca goes en fuego. 

Tuna cones - Least successful; Spago kills it with their tuna cones, though the tuna itself was good.

Octopus - As noted, the softest octopus out there, tastes great.

Black rice w/fresh calamari, lobster tail, sofrito, squid ink - Definitely the best dish, just orgasmically good and a must-order if you go. Also, since it's a rice dish, it has some nice, anchoring heft for your tapas meal.

Bunelos - We are not ashamed to say that we fully dipped each doughnut in the caramel sauce before consuming, and then we finished off what was left of the sauce on its own with our spoons. Gluttontastic!

Okay, so the service. Our reservation got us the worst table in an otherwise beautiful restaurant: right next to the service station, where servers zipped behind each of our chairs, even kicking the chairs a few times, with no apologies. Rather than attempt to guide us toward a complementary tapas offering, the servers (we had a couple) were more intent on getting the order and getting out. I really would have appreciated them noting, for instance, that the peppers were a pretty big order for two, or that there were three tuna cones for the two of us. There's nothing wrong with being efficient, and I can't knock them for being inattentive, but I felt set aside enough between the poor seating and curt service to pull the four-star meal into a three-star rating for the experience.

This place has gained quite the reputation as one of the better dessert places in Toronto (now boasting 2 locations) and it's easy to see why. Walking in I am immediately struck by the decor which screams traditional french. Rustic mirrors and assorted ornaments adorn the walls, accompanied by impressive display cakes. 

The dessert line-up is nothing short of amazing. The macarons are some of the best I have had in Toronto, the pistachio and salted caramel varieties are real winners blending creamy fillings with perfect meringue.

The almond croissant is out of this world, so flaky and buttery it's the perfect accompaniment for the assortment of sloan tea they have on offer. I particularly love the copious amounts of toasted almonds atop the croissant, giving it a toasty, nutty flavour. The marzipan inside the croissant is quite good too.

The carrot cake is a generous portion for the $4.75 price tag. It was lacking the rich cream cheese frosting I look for in a good carrot cake. However, the cake itself was spicy, and one of the most moist (moistest?) cakes I have ever had. Not the best carrot cake I have had, but pretty close.

This place is a diner/dive/trucker spot.  You're not coming here for the decor or ambiance, but the good steaks for an unbeatable price and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars, good food and great value. (I'm a fan of Diners Drive-In and Dives so ambiance is not my thing)

A $10 12 oz NY steak? When you hear that, I know you're thinking ""this has got to be some Taco Bell, Grade F beef""... well, that's what I thought when I drove past. But after a friend convinced me to come here, I can tell you, it's definitely not. You get a quality steak (they have a ton of choices, NY, Rib, Porterhouse, T-bone, etc.) or chicken, smoked ribs, pulled pork, or even soulvaki for a great price.

I had a 12 oz Rib steak + baby back ribs with fries and a draft beer for $22 all in. Seriously. 

The steak was cooked to my liking (rare) and they cooked it perfectly.  The steak doesn't have much seasoning on it, but you can add bbq sauce or pepper to it if you want.  I wouldn't say ""Keg quality"" like other posts, but the cook knows his stuff, and the meat is good.  The ribs were also pretty tasty and tender.  

You can also get a 12 oz draft beer for $2.10, I don't know how you can beat that. 

They have a pretty wide array of menu items (makes me wonder how they stock/prepare all these meats, and if they have enough turnover to get through their smoked meats) and I'll definitely be back to try some other items, such as a pulled pork sandwich with fries for $6.99, Beef ribs with a side for $11, Del Monico steak (on special) with a side for $12. 

If you're in the area and you have a carnivore craving and don't mind a diner type setting, I'd suggest it.

UPDATE:
I tried the Del Monaco steak + fries + onion rings. They won't let you sub fries for onion rings (you can only sub fries for salad), so I just got it as an additional side.  

I don't like the cut of the Del Monaco, they charge more for it, but it's a thinner cut so I'd stick with the rib eye. The fries are good here, but I'd pass on the onion rings as well. Cheap for $2.50, but they use a thick batter so it's very doughy. Stick with the fries!",2011-02-17 15:52:01

So many places call themselves a (British) gastropub and justify it by placing something slightly English on the menu - Shepherd's Pie. That's what I was expecting here. This place however took the ""high-end"" part of the gastropub definition to heart. 

First off I was happy to see the kitchen was open to 12am. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and was expecting the traditional ground beef and veg under a crusty layer of mashed potatoes. Instead! Instead I got what appeared to be liquid potatoes - the menu called it potato foam! Under and throughout that there were peas, carrots, and braised beef. It was delicious!! And slightly minty... I absolutely loved this dish and it's the most unique, most untraditional, Shepherd's Pie I have ever had ($20 and worth it). 

They also put a spin on the typical Moscow Mule. They serve that, but also serve a Naut-Mule ($10). It's based with the traditional Tito's Vodka and ginger beer, but includes fresh Jalapeño! The kick was refreshing, but not overpowering. 

The atmosphere is super cool as well. I loved the backlit bar with counter to ceiling shelves of bottles. They have a moving ladder like in an old fashioned library to slide along the rear bar to get bottles down.

We went for the Coastal tasting menu for $55/pp.  Overall pretty good - especially seafood and eggy items.  Kitchen service was a bit slow, but our waiter Rodney was excellent.  Highlights of our brunch:

First Courses:
* Appetizer of radishes with sea salt and honey butter - crispy and the flavor combo kinda works.

* Poke - wow pretty fresh yellowtail with shoyu, Maui onion, and mac nuts.  They offered some flat bread that reminded me of green onion pancakes that was quite good and perfect for scooping up the poke.

* Shrimp Ceviche - more on the tart side from the Clamato and salsa, but lots of shrimp!  They added some nice guac and used saltines for scooping up the ceviche.

Second Course:
* Crab Benny - Instead of something on an English muffin, this was two cakes of lumped crab meat with two perfectly cooked sous vide farm eggs. We liked this dish, especially that runny egg which is like having more sauce for the crab cakes.

* Bobby Sliders - Named after ex-poker legend Bobby Baldwin (and now Casino Exec at Aria), these were Kobe beef with some aged cheddar that added some sweetness to the sliders.  Pretty good as well!

Dessert:
* Fresh fruit platter had a nice variety - mango, watermelon, strawberry, pineapple, and a rambutan! The whipped yogurt sauce underneath was nice and sweet.

The bars have been condensed into one long piece, running about 2/3 of the way down the wall. A huge dance area, a few games, a photobooth, and scattered high tops fill the large space. There is also seating along some of the back walls with a wide bar height ledge, and a nice window between the porch and the bar so you don't have to go back inside to order your drink!

You either sit at a one-sided hightop bar with your own personal heating service or a low top bar with the same set up. It is a very communal atmosphere. This is a wonderful place to take a date or to grab something for yourself. This year Joy is in making your own food. Be sure to take your time. All the food comes out at one time raw and if you Mary Lee dump it all in at once it kind of ruins the fondue experience. I had seen set ups like this before on Anthony board Danes show and Andrew Zimmerman's bizarre foods and always wanted to find a place like this. I happened to stumble upon it while grabbing coffee at a shop close to next door. The staff is incredibly polite and very professional. One would be hard-pressed to try all the amalgamations of the food options including the broths, protein, types of rice and noodles, and vegetables etc. an absolutely stellar experience.

If you have a daughter or know anyone that likes princess-y things (and cupcakes!) - you need to buy them cupcakes from here.  The cupcakes look so pretty with all that glitter on top, any girl is going to love it!

I've been wanting to try Cupcakery for a while, and when I received that B1G1 coupon in the mail, I knew it was time.  $3.50 seems to be the average price for cupcakes in Las Vegas, but it's a little hard to wrap my head around paying that much for one cupcake...especially since I can't eat just one!  I could tear through a dozen cupcakes, but definitely think my body will hate me for it.  The cupcakes were moist and delicious, with adequate frosting - not too much, not too little.  I tried Red velvet and a chocolate cupcake.  

Room for improvement: 
+ to-go packaging of cupcakes: my 2 cupcakes were placed in a small plastic box and when I got home, the frosting was smashed/rubbed off on the container.  As a customer transporting the items, I would appreciate smaller individual packaging for each cupcake or a box with a designated cut out for the cupcake to sit in.  Not the end of the world, but this is something that can be improved upon.
+ lack of flavor variety: standard red velvet, chocolate, white cake... I want some unique/different flavors that I can only go to Cupcakery for (I am a Crumbs fan and am sad they are no more)

Yummy & beautiful cupcakes.  Would return if I have extra cash to spend on cupcakes.  Please send me more B1G1 coupons, thanks!",2015-04-16 20:31:20

I also really love that you can mix and match bottles of beer to make your own six pack. Great idea!

Pizza was not nearly as big or filling or good (veggie) as they claimed it would be, it seemed to be frozen veggies, thawed, and put on a pizza shell. Which led to a soggy, freezer burned mess. 

Drinks, beer menu sucks... Kinda, who knows really, because when I requested to try a sample the waitress refused (???) and then I didn't like the beer I ended up ordering. The bartender made my BF's drink wrong and wouldn't replace it (This is not usually something I would complain about, you make your drinks however you want, BUT she had to ask someone else how to make it and then admitted she did it wrong, but served it anyways)

There is Wi-Fi here, which works well if you manage to snag a seat and you have a lot of work to do.

I drank a ridiculous amount of coffee at work today so I opted to get a tea rather than my usual java. The jasmine tea was great. My pal ordered the hot chocolate and half a dozen of LNC`s infamous homemade donuts. She said that both her treat and drink were fantabulous.

finding our room was also a breeze - the casino and lobby park I couldn't smell one bit of smoke and it was so clean! it wasn't near as huge as mgm and other hotels but It still had all the common machines you see in other resorts. 

the room was fabulous - everything was very modern and updated including a button to press the curtains open and shut from your bed and another button by the bathroom super convenient! 

the shower had the bathtub within it which was very different but I didn't mind it one bit... I wish there were more electric circuits in more convenient spots for hairdryers, flat irons, etc... 

access to the strip here is so easy and its such a simple walk to Bellagio or vdara. 

one thing that was annoying during this stay was the amount of noise I could hear while laying in bed at night.. one night I only got 2 hours sleep because I could hear the people above us cheering on some sort of athletic game. 

the pool is amazing here there are multiple so be aware of which one you go to - some are for VIP rooms or else you have to pay $75 per lounge chair don't make the same embarrassing mistake that we did!

Firstly, the Kung Pao chicken was served smothered in sauce.  I like the sauce but there was no need to drowned everything

Second, the pineapple chicken was stone cold.  Even on the re-heat the chicken was warm but the pineapple was very cold. 

Thirdly and this often the case here a plate of someone else's food arrived. Now once I might forgive but twice.  And please note, some wait staff are insistent that yes you ordered the item.  Thankfully, the iPad breaks any tie and the item was removed.  The reason why I mention this is that if you waste any food or ask to take it with you.  The customer is charged extra.  

Fourth, the dinner menu adds some extra items. My favourite are Korean short ribs. However, last night's serving was more fat than beef.

Ended up getting the california crepe.  The crepe was thin and had a good proportion of egg to meats.  The avocado was the kicker.  I tend to order due to specific items within the dish and the avocado really made it taste great. (of course, the bacon helped as well).  Other dishes our group ordered included the loco moco, which was a bit salty and the banana nut french toast, which was very very (maybe too) moist.  One thing I did notice was that they had great servers and they had a little paddle on each table that lets you indirectly ask for the servers to come.

On my first visit, I ordered a viking slice. It looked pretty good, but I found the chocolate frosting too sugary. I was expecting a more denser chocolate-like flavor, similar to what you'd get from a chocolate croissant. However, it was more like a sheet of sugar that melts in your mouth. That ruined it for me, but I was willing to give Danish Pastry House another try.

On my next visit, I ordered an aebelfiske. It's a flaky pastry with a center with slices of apple and dusted with confectioner's sugar. I really enjoyed this one much more because it was sweet, but not too sugary.",2018-02-03 02:28:02

Then we all got burgers (Luxe and Salmon burgers) and they were all so good! 

Everything on the menu ranges from around $8-$30 but the food is excellent. My friend didn't care for the cocktail she ordered and the bartender took it off her check and made her a whole new drink. But our waiter also told us that if she wanted they could remix her original drink and make it sweet because they make their own sweeteners and brews. This made the place even more unique! And I ordered a Chardonnay; first glass arrived and a little fly had found its way in. As soon as I told the waiter he removed it and brought me a new glass. 

The restrooms were even nice, very spacious, and the ladies room has a chair and feminine toiletries. Our service was good too. We waited about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, but it was worth the wait and if you're not in a hurry (which you shouldn't be anyways if you're coming to this place) the outdoor patio is a great place to just sit and chat.

+Diff dance/lounge areas put on by different vendors

+H2O tanks!
+People watching
+overall pleasant happy crowd

Quick Tips:
  - They close daily from 3-5.
  - Be prepared to pay for parking.
  - The share their restaurant space with a pizza joint.
  - They regularly sell out of ramen near 9pm.

Not sure where to start with Umami.  We have been going there since the original location opened and it is truly our favorite ramen spot (with the exception of Monta in Las Vegas).  Its also an amazing rainy day spot.  You pretty much can't go wrong with any way you build your bowl.  If you like soy sauce get the Shoyu broth.  And make it spicy!

Our favorite add ins include the spam, the cracklins, and spicy garlic paste.  Don't go overboard though...the best bowls are simple bowls with few ingredients.

Nash-drum, Ben Hedquist-bass and Angelo Versace-piano (the house trio) were amazingly good, and they made sure that other artists had a chance to play on stage as well. There were some visiting singers in town So they performed as well.

Amazing! 
Jaw Dropping!

This is a MUST see if you are a Shania Fan! One of the best shows I've seen in Vegas since I've lived here!

Here's the notable mentions: 
1) Her figure, holy crap, how does a woman around the age of 45 look like this? She puts girls that work at Sapphires to shame, believe you me.  She's got some body and God bless her genes and jeans!
2) Her voice-she was clear as a whistle. Sang every song *live*. Sang songs a cappella [without music] and it was angelic
3) Lighting/stage/costumes- wow some of this was just to die for. perfect and a show to behold
4) She plays all the songs you remember and wears all the outfits that are from her sexy videos
5) She drinks her meals and is very amendment about that! Amen for that!

3 random things to note:

1) Her ""male"" dancers need to hit up Stoney's and see how country dancing is really done. They were a little off when dancing together AND they weren't manly enough for me.  She might've been better served getting some mediocre looking men from Stoney's that really know how to boot scoot and boogie.  They didn't do it for me or my all female group.  Perhaps they should train w/ the Chippendales?

2) The average age of the audience. Wow this was kind of a shocker for me. I'm in my early 30's I thought there would be some 30s, 40's and 50's age groups present... Boy was I wrong!  I would venture to say the average age of the audience was closer to 70. Yeah for real, like my parents age.  Walkers, hearing aids and all.  So keep that in mind, it could've been a lot more rowdier if there was a younger crowd, but it was very 'tame' in my opinion. 

3) Ticket pricing is steep. I paid about $150 a ticket for dead center Mezzanine, not cheap.  And while we saw everything that was going on on-stage, there were definitely higher priced tickets below us.",2012-12-07 17:05:46

We were all first timers and our waitress took the time to walk us through the menu and recommend their top items. The menu is very vast, with traditional appetizers, entrée salads, soup ramen, ramen stir fries, stir fries with various noodles or rice, etc. All with your choice of meat, tofu, or veggies. I ordered the ramen stir-fry and to make it vegan asked for steamed tofu and no fish sauce. Our waitress wasn't sure if they could accommodate, but she checked with the kitchen and came right back. Unfortunately their ramen noodles have egg in them, but she happily advised what my other options were and ultimately I ordered the Singapore Curry Noodles which were very thin rice noodles, yellow curry, bell peppers, red onion, scallions, with steamed tofu. So very delicious! So flavorful, loaded with veggies and tofu, served piping hot, not oily or greasy at all. Staff was super kind and food was great, I will definitely be back.",2018-07-27 17:16:38

""Wait. Hold on there, buddy. What the hell's a pupuseria?"" you say. 

Well, amigo, a pupuseria serves pupusas, which are small, handmade corn tortillas stuffed with, well, stuff (cheese, beans, and/or meat). Of course there are other Salvadoran specialties as well, but pupusas are what make Salvadoran food distinct from the cuisine of other nearby Central American countries and Mexico.

Moving to Phoenix, I spotted Eliana's pretty much within my first week here and thought to myself, ""Man, I have to check this place out."" Of course, I only did so 18 months later, venturing into the decent-sized eaterie on McDowell & 24th Street to satisify my cravings, bringing along a bunch of friends who've never had Salvadoran food before.

The inside of Eliana's is pretty casual, with the Salvadoran flag and other arty decorations hanging from the walls. There are probably 8 booths and then a bunch of tables spread out in the dining room. Our server, who may have been one of the owners, was nice and patiently explained anything on the menu we had questions on, including giving recommendations to the vegetarians in the group. For appetizers we got 2 combination platters, each consisting of a pupusa, a tamal (tamale), and a pastele (stuffed pastry shell). The pupusas can come in either veggie or non-veg varieties. We also got fried plantain which came with refried beans and sour cream. They were all pretty decent (I'm a big platano fan so the plantain was definitely my favorite) , as was the complimentary mini-bowl of chicken soup and the glass of ice-cold Tamarindo that I got to drink. The pupusas weren't as great as some of the ones I've had in San Francisco, but they still held their own and my friends enjoyed them and eveything else on the platter.

For entree, I got the carne asada (pounded skirt steak with rice, grilled onions, salsa and beans) while other choices at my table included the arroz valenciana (a rice dish with shrimp and vegetables) and the vegetarian chile relleno. My steak, I would say, was alright - a bit gristly, but all in all a good value for the price. For dessert we got the banana burrito, which is basically what it sounds like. Fried banana wrapped in a sugar and cinammon-coated tortilla and served with vanilla ice cream. And that was excellent. No, let me correct myself. EXCELLENT. And dare I say, pretty frickin' ingenious. A burrito for dessert, because why not? And all this food ended up being around $18/person which seems like a pretty good deal to me.    

I'd say overall, I'd give Eliana's a 3.75 and so I'll round it up to 4. It isn't the most amazing Salvadoran food I've had, but it's still pretty good and I'd recommend it to folks who're looking to try something a little different when it comes to Latin American grub.",2007-06-18 16:17:39

It makes me laugh because it's like McDonalds with a twist. The only thing vegetarian here is french fries. I was surprised and excited when I heard this was coming into town. I remember when it first came into town in LA. So this place is nestled in the Best Buy Shopping Center at Seafood City. It's next to Jason's Deli. 
There's a weird feeling when I came up to it this weekend. One....It was hotter than shit out. Two....I have never seen so many filipinos. It's like one of the islands crash landed nearby. Seriously they were like ants coming out of the ground. 
Jollibee is known for just a few menu items:
Yumburger, Double Yum, Champ Burger and the Amazing Aloha with grilled pineapple - The Burger itself is pretty thick - not your average burger. 1/3 meat. Cooked all the way through - kinda tastes hearty with beef broth or onion soup mixed into it. 
Noodles: Pacit Palabok - it's a noodle dish with thick rice noodles and sorta a thick sauce with ground pork rinds...scallions, hardboiled egg....Yea...I know Healthy right? Jollibee also carries spaghetti. But it's filipino spaghetti with sliced hot dogs and meat. It's slightly sweeter than american or italian. It's also topped off with cheese. Mmmm yea way healthy.
Finally there's Chicken Joy. YAY Joy. Fried chicken. Served with a side of gravy and rice. 
Couldn't decide so I ordered a noodle, burger, and chicken. I don't get that that often...so what? I do what I want. The lines are a lil slow, the food isn't really bad. It's not great, but you know it's a novelty. I took it back to work. Had a few bites of each and it was over. I'd definitely go back. I mean I gotta try the boba!

RWqJV-rMKceR9wNesr5MbA,ehJZ9rmtXQk-SI5XJkYSGA,HK2Ki-PvnNN-YMTlX1uSVA,4,5,8,8,"I rolled into Las Vegas on Tuesday.  I had three days and a hundred and eighty-five bookmarks.  It was time to get busy.

I was hungry AF, and I wanted to try somewhere new.  808 Mixed plate was at the top of my list. What a great discovery!

Stepping up to the counter, I told the counterperson it was my first visit.  Then it got a little weird.  Without saying a word to me, she turned around a told the kitchen ""Give me a garlic!""

Someone's To Go order had just come up and she grabbed it and started packing it up.  Meanwhile I'm standing there, a little confused.  Another counterperson was nearby and I tried to ask him a question.  He totally didn't hear me.  So I'm standing there for like a solid minute or two while everyone behind the counter is doing their behind the counter duties.

I've read about a million reviews that describe something similar.  Usually the customer just gives up  and leaves.  Then they go home and writes a scathing review of the customer service.   

But that would've been a douche move.  Super douchey.  I would've missed out on a really great meal.

Barely two minutes had passed when Joy, the counterperson, turned around and offered me a little sample cup.  ""This is our Garlic Chicken,"" she explained, ""this is what we're known for.""

Garlic Chicken?  Who the hell wants Garlic Chicken?  I didn't come for Garlic Chicken.  I'm all about Katsu Chicken.  I don't even want to try Garlic Chicken.

But Joy is super cute, and like most men, I'll do just about anything for a smile from a cute girl.  So, I politely try the Garlic Chicken.

Holy hell, that sh$t is good!  ""Wow!,"" I exclaimed.  Joy laughed at my reaction.  ""It's kind of like I punched you in the face, isn't it?,"" asked Joy,  ""No kidding,"" I replied.   I couldn't believe how good that garlic sauce was.  Joy explained about how it was made, something about garlic and mayo and something.  I can't remember exactly because talking to cute girls gives me amnesia.  And I had just recently been, like, punched in the face.

So, you know, I was on a mission to score some Katsu, and I needed to follow through.  But at the same time, I needed more of that creamy garlic sauce.  I asked about  getting a half katsu and half garlic chicken.  Joy said, no problem, you can get a half and half.

Now, if you are a dumb ass like me, you might think you're going to get a regular-sized order of food with half katsu and half garlic chicken.  But if you've been around the block, you know that a combo at a Hawaiian food place means two full orders of whatever it is you pick.  So when I pick up my food my eyes just about bug out of my head.  Dang, that's a huge pile of chicken!

You know how a dog's leg starts to shake when you pet it just right?  If there was a camera on me in that restaurant when I was there, I'm pretty sure the video will show some serious shaking.  

The Katsu and Garlic chicken are prepared a little differently than at other Hawaiian places I've visited.  The chicken isn't pounded flat.  The pieces more closely resemble actual pieces of chicken rather than flattened cutlets, or whatever.  The chicken isn't at all dry, like Katsu sometimes can be.  It's moist as a prom date and every bit as delicious.

The mac salad was atrocious.  I could only eat one bite.  The rice wasn't much better.  That's all I'm going to say about that.

They have a self serve Coca Cola machine, but no Mr. Pibb.  They have styrofoam cups, and I love me some styrofoam cups.  

I will definitely be back for more of that crazy good Garlic Chicken.  Thanks for turning me on to it, Joy!

I would never recommend using San Tan Ford's service department EVER!

I have had 2 terrible experiences here which goes to show you fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. 

My first experience was having my SUV alignment done here. I dropped it off for the day and came back to pick it up and paid and was told they made minor adjustments. I pulled out and onto the 202 freeway and the truck went crazy out of control and jerking the steering. 

I pulled over fast as this was pretty scary and looked under the truck and found they forgot to put the nuts back onto my tie rods and it's amazing I didn't crash. 

I went back and they at first asked if I did anything to he truck in the 10-15 minutes since I left. I said of course not.... they said they didn't know how it could have happened to be heir fault since a second mechanic checks work before it leaves. 

Irregardless they screwed the nuts on and I went home.

THE WORST TRIP was when my transmission wasn't going into overdrive with only 8,000 miles on it from another shop. San Tan Ford told me it was the transmission again after charging me around $450 to diagnose the problem. 

They quoted to replace it and I told them I would see the other shop that put it in since it had a warranty. I brought it to the other shop and they said the transmission was testing fine and that it was electrical. 

I called San Tan Ford and they said the transmission shop was scamming me and didn't want to do the warranty. I got really mad at the transmission shop and argued on the phone after the so called ""experts assured"" told me I went to a bad shop. 

I brought it to another diesel shop where they said it was an electrical problem stemming from inconsistent voltage produced by the alternator and that Ford had a service bulletin about this. They charged me $250 total to replace the alternator and the truck was perfect!

I told San Tan Ford afterwards and asked to see the general manager after all the trouble and they had me wait for 45 minutes in the sales area when the service Manager came out and gave me a $220 gift card to service to make up for it. 

$220 to make up for Harding me $450 to misdiagnose and blame someone for a simple problem wrongfully. This and nearly 2 weeks without my vehicle as this all transpired. They didn't even give back my total service fee from this fiasco!

---

I've been holding off writing a review because I don't enjoy sharing a negative experience. I finally am putting this out there because I continue to see daily deals for this place and I think people should know what they are getting into before they buy it thinking it's great value.

Rhythm Spa is a true example of 'You get what you pay for'. The deals they offer through any one of the numerable daily coupon sites are way below market value for professional spa services. And that's because they are not a professional spa. I imagine they've only managed to stay afloat through offering these deals that constantly bring in new, one-time customers.

Things started out well on my visit. The owner and her helper were friendly to us when we arrived. My friend bought a deal for us to use as a birthday gift to me for a mani/pedi and massage. He had never been to a spa or had a massage, so he didn't know what to expect or how to make a judgement call before choosing a spa.

I got a decent manicure and pedicure in an open area off the reception and so did he. They were very quick to take us after the last set of people at the pedicure station and it made me concerned about how well they had cleaned the equipment but I just went with it. We enjoyed talking to them but it felt drafty in this area because the front door was open at the bottom of the stairs and the fall wind was blowing in.

Somewhere during this time it was assumed that my friend and I were a couple and therefore would be okay with having a simultaneous massages. We were never consulted, so I just assumed we'd be going one at a time. After the mani/pedi they put us into a large room at the back of the house that was partitioned with a screen. They left us there before we saw the two massage tables behind the screen and realized what was going on.

The massage room had windowed french doors and no curtain over them, so anyone in the hallway could see in. It also allowed for a lot of noise to come through the doors. Not ideal or tranquil.

The biggest problem with the room was the temperature. It was very cold. The tables were near an old window that was likely not well insulated and it didn't feel like they had turned on their heat for the fall yet. There was no area for us to change for the massage without being in front of each other or exposed through the french doors so changing was slightly awkward.

Because it was so cold in this room the massage was easily the worst I have ever had. I had the owner, who said she is a RMT, do mine. I was freezing cold, nearly shivering for the entire massage and it was surprising she did not notice this while massaging me. Not only does being so cold do nothing to help the muscles relax but it's incredibly uncomfortable to be mostly naked in a cold room having someone rub even colder lotion onto you. I asked her to turn on the electric fireplace that was in the room half way through the massage and she told me it was already on!

I've never had a massage actually make me feel worse than I did beforehand but that's what happened here. When they put hot stones on us (which I had no idea was even coming because I don't recall being consulted) they were a little too hot on my sensitive skin. I didn't complain at this point because at least it provided some brief warmth.

In terms of technique, the skill level was not up to RMT level. I have a lot of experience going to RMTs and I would compare this massage to some of the massages I've had a massage schools, when I get a fairly new student.

When the massage ended I waited for my friend to get dressed and leave before getting up to put my clothes back on. That's when the assistant who had performed my friend's massage walked in on me changing! 

The place was partially under construction while we were there which, I take from the other reviews is still the case many months later. I wouldn't eat at a restaurant that was still under construction so why would anyone want to go to a spa in the same state? They should really close down and get a contractor to do the job all at once instead of trying to DYI it bit by bit themselves.

Bottom line, this place is just not up to snuff. Just look at the owner's incoherent responses to Yelp reviews (which is what dissuaded me from writing this review last fall) and the 23 filtered reviews (I encourage you to go down to the bottom, enter the security code and browse through them).

If you don't mind all the above, then best of luck to you. I'm sure some people have a good experience here but the inconsistency is very worrying. The owners seems to hire untrained staff who are not qualified to work at a spa. Based on what I've read and experienced, I don't think she has enough good business sense to operate one either.

I like their breadsticks, their cheese, their pizzas, and last night I had a sandwich that was pretty dang good too. Friday night, around 8pm, completely empty, and they were working on preparing a catering order. We were recognized immediately and taken care of - I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich (on the 11-grain bread) with Pasta Salad and The Lady ordered a salad. The sandwich, although relatively basic, was good, exactly what I wanted. 
The only negative thing I have to say, is that the pasta salad had ZERO flavor, and was almost frozen. It's what dropped this down from a 4 to a 3 star, because I've tried the same at their Rock Hill location and it was much better. Blech.

All of the meals that I have had here are fantastic. I recently had the 3pc chicken tenders meal and they were fantastic - cooked perfectly and seasoned exactly the way I wish mine would taste at home! They upcharge for mashed potatoes and gravy instead of fries, and I really didn't see the value because the side is so tiny. Potatoes and gravy are not an expensive food item, and their sides are tiny.

I think that they are priced on the high end for the size of meals that they provide which limits my quantity of visits. I would like them to be more 

Other than this the quality of the food and service is 5 stars. I would recommend Stevia as a sweetener option instead of splenda and sweet n low and maybe push Boylan's Soda to create a Diet Cola that doesn't have Splenda.",2016-11-10 16:29:23

When you walk in, it's like walking in a little tunnel. The front area is really small too and if you arrive with a lot of people, your personal space bubble becomes almost non-existent. We asked for a booth and yes, the tables are very close together. The staff are friendly and they especially warm-up if you speak Spanish. 

We ordered the ""Macho"" and veggie fajitas. Very good and large portions! We also ordered the fresh guacamole since many of the previous reviews raved about this. Even though it was delicious, I thought it was a tad pricey ($7 for one avocado) after thinking it was only $3 (I guess I mis-read the menu). The salsa was on the watery side and I'm accustomed to the chunkier, but it was still good. 

As we were leaving, a table was having a birthday and it was such a fun site to see! Most of the staff came out singing and sombreros in hand. At the end of the birthday song, one of the waiters got up on a chair and was pretending to do a little strip-tease with his apron. Hilarious.

Since I had tried A1 once before I decided to try them again. When I called the company they set me up with an appointment right away. On repair day once again they sent me the technicians bio prior to the technician arriving which is comforting giving me a background on the technician before they arrive to the house. I was surprised and happy to see that I had the same technician as last time Robin Enwiya. Mr. Enwiya gave me a call 20 minutes before he arrived as I requested. He easily switched out my garage door key pad, spent the time and showed me how to program it in case I needed to in the future. The key pad he installed is superior to my older one. Mr. Enwiya has the same extremely pleasant attitude as he did before and really at this point it was like seeing an old friend. Being able to have the same technician come developed consistency and trust both in the technician and the company. The service is a strong 5 star and I just wish more companies had technicians like Mr Enwiya and performed like A1. 
Oh and by the way, the price was very affordable. Once again if you are in need of garage door service I highly recommend this company and ask for Mr Enwiya. 

My garage door spring broke and I search on yelp for a reputable company. I called A1 and they made me an appointment the next day. The customer service per telephone were very nice and got me the soonest appointment available. On the repair day the technician name was Robin Enwiya which the company basically sent me his photo and full resume prior to his arrival. Mr Enwiya called me when he was 30 minutes out and got to the house on time. He explained my issue with the garage and gave me several options to fix it. Mr. Enwiya was very pleasant, knowledgeable and educated me on the different options I had to choose from, at no time did he try to sell me something I didn't need.

Location: 
Currently in the market place behind pacific mall but the owner or manager was telling another table that they'll be moving sometime soonish because they are tearing it down to build a new complex.

Parking situation:

Pacific mall so it's can be a bit nuts. Although, I went at 6 on a Saturday and there were spaces a plenty. When we left it was a bit fuller but cool.

Inside:

This is a place for groups. Full of round tables that fit up to 12 but has a couple of square tables that were pushed together with a larger group at it.

Food:

Good. They have set courses which was what we got and what it looks like everyone else got. There's a menu that we picked additional dishes from but looks like most came for the set courses
 
The food came fast, was fresh, tasted great and came with very generous portions! I can see why everyone comes!!


Cost:
Pretty good. We ordered so much that there was no room on the table for everything and it cost $30 per person. Tonnes left over!

Conclusion:

Will most definitely be back!!",2017-08-09 00:53:03

My friend and I originally came here for their restaurant week menu, but we were persuaded by their happy hour menu! On their HH menu, most of the appetizers are $6, with $5 off pizzas, and a ton of great deals on alcohol. We decided to order 3 appetizers and 1 restaurant week deal to share. For the appetizers, we obviously picked the three most expensive ones on the menu because they're all $6 each! We got the short ribs (yes, this was an appetizer!!), mushroom eggrolls, and some fried cheesy bites with sriracha sauce (sorry I'm butchering the names here). The short ribs dish was probably the most worthwhile of the three! It had three pieces of BBQ ribs with very thinly cut and crispy fries. It was large enough to be considered an entree, so I definitely recommend getting this if you're here for HH! The mushroom eggrolls were delicious too! I loved the crispy outer shell and the sweet sauce! I don't recommend the cheesy bites though--totally not worth $6! 

From the restaurant week menu, we ordered the brussel sprouts, rainbow trout, and blueberry cheesecake. Brussel sprouts were okay--the bacon bits could use more crispiness! Rainbow trout was not very impressive, unfortunately. It was well cooked, but it lacked flavor so I wouldn't order this again! The cheesecake was probably my favorite of these three. It's different from your usual cheesecake. Less cheesy and more creamy :)

The nostalgic feel to this show sets it apart from the other shows in town, especially the big production ones.  I love old Vegas, so this was right up my alley.  

The only let downs I had was that you couldn't take pictures and they did not offer a playbook or guide that had anything to remember the show.  They sold pictures that they took as you walked in, but that as all that I saw.  

The other issue was seating the people who came late after the show started.  If they are late.... Seat them in the back!  

There were a lot of things I loved.  The dancers were super sexy and amazing (Especially the red headed lead dancer)  the comedic acts (Hulu Hoop Guy, Juggler and Miniature Village People) were extremely funny and the best entertainer was the guy who played Dean Martin.

The waxer seemed to have trouble pulling the strip in 1 clean shot and had to try several times making the experience really uncomfortable.

Today went to lunch, and did have a reservation--my dining companion likes to eat outside.  Our reservation was for 1:00.  Our table was not ready and had to wait about fifteen minutes.  Another person showed up, and was seated right away at a table outside, they too must have had a reservation.  My guess is they were regulars, as the waiter seemed to know them, and spent a fair amount of time talking with them.
Our waiter was very slow and seemed to spend a lot of time socializing with the regulars who were seated before us.
We finally did give our drink order.  We have a running test, my girlfriend likes lime in her water, and we will always order, asking for lime--the test is if they actually listen and bring the lime or lemon--our waiter did not pass.
My girlfriend had the Quiche Lorraine, and I had the Beef Short Rib Baguette, which is supposed to be their more popular sandwich.  The sandwich -- short rib, caramelized onions, provolone cheese and arugula.  I could not detect any onions, and the sandwich was too greasy for me--I couldn't finish it.  The quiche was very good, and my girlfriend finished her whole plate, which doesn't happen often, so you know it was good.
Our waiter never did come around to ask how everything was, never asked if I wanted another drink, must have been too distracted talking with the regulars at the other table.

Each page of the menu displays details of each ramen bowl available, with different combos that include (and/or ricebowl/salad/dessert/drinks)

Soup: pork bone and fish dashi flavour was subtle and was primarily a slightly more salty, but creamy soup. The surface of the soup had black bubbles which I assume to be black garlic oil, was not overwhelming. Even though you cannot customize the flavour of the broth, it was a very consistent broth that wasn't overly salty to the point of dehydration! I was looking for the ""soup sand"" (ground up bones), but there was barely any.

Noodles: They were edible, but mostly hard and dense. Not my favourite.

Toppings: green onion, canola flower (tastes like chinese broccoli), kikurage mushroom were all finely chopped and freshly prepared. They gave one decent slice of pork shoulder, with only small portions of fat attached to the meat, which would've been better if it was torched. The texture of the meat was well put together, but I've tasted better with better seasoning.

The restaurant was spacious unlike a lot of other ramen shops around the area, but alike most yelpers' experience here, the language barrier was strong, despite their attentiveness.

Regardless, the small was sufficient as a full meal, as well as to fully savour the soup, considering that I hadn't eaten for the whole day",2015-07-30 04:59:41

Sarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.

Modern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  

In general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.

Creative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.

Nice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.

Forget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.

Well chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   

Good service but still showing the ""green"" uncertainty that will go away with time.

Definitely one of the better ""interpretive"" Japanese eateries in Vegas today.",2014-12-21 15:23:47

My thought was, on a Tuesday night, over 40 people loaded into your tables. How much revenue is that going to make you?  Wouldn't you be happy to see everybody?  It seemed like it was absolute  drudgery for him to see us, serve us, and when we were running out of room in the Jungle Room, we requested to be moved to a larger area and he seemed annoyed at the request, and did not want to move us into a larger area, even after the servers  serving us agree that would probably be the best choice. The service was actually ok but, the real reason that we go to restaurants is for good food right? Well the food is really not that tasty compared to other Mexican restaurants within the same area. The drinks were merely okay but at 10 bucks a pop I think I can probably find another place to get just OK margaritas.

It was not worth it in the end. The price of eating here went from the $20 vegas to $26. The service was not 15% tip worthy.  They are the only place that charges automatic gratuity for parties of 5 or less for service that is not worth it.

I'm trying to work it out with the billing manager so there maybe another update in store. She assures me that it's fixed and explained the problems. I understand part of the issues but I also agree with the other people leaving 1 stars.

You know it and I know it.  When I visit Paris, the first thing I do is run to the local bakery and buy a baguette (or two) because the first baguette doesn't make it to the hotel in one piece.... And with a piece of cheese, OMG.  I would be at Mimi's buying your baguettes for sandwiches and for anything else.  

Back to the dinner.

Three pieces of delicious fish, not overly breaded. Check.  Crispy french fries, check.  Coq au Vin was tasty enough but not crazy delicious. They served it with little sautéed potatoes instead of mashed.  Couldn't fit in dessert so we took Chocolate mousse to go.  Did I tell you that we had a really good server, Melissa.  Everything we needed she was there.  And.... she packed our dessert with everything that is usually served with it when you eat it in-house.  Meaning:  slices of strawberries and strawberry sauce.  Thanks Melissa.",2014-08-11 20:01:36

I ordered the prosciutto and tomato sandwich. Decent sandwich. The tomatoes are sundried. Bread was a bit soggy. My brother ordered the leige waffles. For the record, they don't compare to Waffalonia's. The ones here were really dry. At that time, they also had this strawberry, chocolate french toast that were also extremely dry.

Still, this probably is a good brunch place. You just need to order the right things. Next time, will definitely order the mussels, poutine, and mac & cheese. Seems like it's what they do best.",2013-10-25 11:58:07

So it is with great regret that I have to report I was fairly disappointed in my experience.  The space itself is really amazing, and they did something really cool with the way they kept the original aesthetic and fit a restaurant right in.  But it's in this weird space between ""club"" and ""restaurant"", and I think they just need to decide which one they'd rather be.

We had really, really bad service, too.  Nobody seemed to know what they were supposed to be doing, and we sat at our table for at least 5 minutes before anyone took our drink order, and that was with 2 waitresses just hanging out about 10 feet away.  But we both really enjoyed our pizza, and I thought the prices were very reasonable. 

I know Hanny's is still very new, and I love that we have a place to go get a bite at midnight (ok, so it's been years since I was still awake at midnight, but it's nice to know it's there).  So I'll definitely keep going back, and hope that it gels into something great.",2008-12-06 17:26:23

dAerYecLiDP3FasGK62Xdw,1WREwRWD4sHHObFXmCCgyw,aKFZamejw8kpglVk7e4WSA,5,0,0,0,"The Herberger Theater Center is one of Phoenix's cultural gems. It's located in the heart of the city, and offers a home to live performance productions of all sizes and types. While there are at least two other theaters in the greater Phoenix metro that I refuse to go to unless it's an absolute must-see, when I learn that a production I'm interested in is at the Herberger, I never hesitate!

I've been a patron of HTC for many years, and seen a lot of great performances. HTC doesn't produce many shows itself (with a notable exception being last year's dual productions of Julius Caesar and X, in collaboration with The Acting Company and ASU's Herberger school), so this review won't be about productions, but instead about the facility.

I'll get the negative out first - parking! You can try to find street parking, or park in one of the nearby garages, but there's no parking within the center itself. You can prepay for parking at the garage across the street via their website though. It's normally not a problem, but can be confusing for first time attendees who don't know where to park.

The building is very nice. It has a modern look without being brutal. The grand staircase in the lobby/atrium is a great photo spot. There is a gallery upstairs that's always worth a look, and some quiet spaces for waiting before the production.

The HTC has expanded its concessions over the years, and kept the prices reasonable. Bottles of water are $3, which isn't bad compared to most venues. There are plenty of beer and wine options, and they also offer a limited amount of warm meals, snacks and desserts. You can't bring food into the theaters, but you can bring drinks in. 

One of the other minor negatives about the facility is that some people are not aware of the fact that there are three separate theaters within the HTC. For instance, the tickets I had to a recent performance didn't say which theater the production was in (center stage vs. stage west). There were signs and plenty of ushers to help, but every time I'm there I see someone who appears confused/lost - especially if more than one production is happening at the same time.

I've been to productions in both stage west and center stage, but I haven't been to shows on the Kax stage. Stage west is smaller, but comfortable. Center stage's expanded space allows for broader productions but is still intimate. Both theaters are much more comfortable than most theaters in town, and have excellent acoustics and lighting. 

The HTC staff are helpful and efficient. They don't force the ushers to take you to your seats - I hate being escorted if I know where I'm going  - but they are plenty of people available to answer questions or point you in the right direction. The box office is efficient, and concessions are usually quick. Adding in more food options does seem to have slowed the line down a bit though. 

One important note: while the building may look ""stuffy"" from the outside, you'll find that there's no expectation of the audiences. You can attend in shorts and a t-shirt or dress up for the night -- all are welcome. While most patrons tend to be of a certain leisure age and class, I've seen more diversity and youth added to the mix lately. So don't be too intimidated to attend the theater in Phoenix!",2018-05-19 18:59:07

This has become new new go-to Pho, I usually call in on the way home from work and pick it up just because I like to eat at home after a long day and somedays you don't wan to cook or go out.  I call in and give them my numbers they make sure I know where it is and give me a time.  They are always right on time the soup is hot and ready everything is in the boxes and I head on home.  When we get to-go  we don't eat right away so I put the broth on low and let it warm buy the time I am ready to eat we ladle it out and add ingredients and it is as good as eating in!

Eating in the restaurant is always clean the owners are almost always there working and you are greated nicely and led to a table.  They know us so it is pretty easy for us.  They have a tv to watch while you wait.  

The soup is one of the better Pho places in town.  A lot of people complain about the oil in the soup but in all actuality the oil is part of the soup and means it has been made properly, if it is not there you will be lacking the essential flavor of the soup.  It is also a clear light brown broth.

This is not a fancy place and the price reflects that but the soup is good, hot and fast V/S other places down the road with a 20 minute wait and a bit over priced.  If you want good home cooked Pho come here if you are meeting friends for drinks fun and Pho you may not like it here.

Not that comestibles are forgotten, FAR from that! I'd stick a fork in anyone who tried to come between me and my Shishito Peppers and aioli, Crispy Pig Wing, Roasted Brussels Sprouts or Pig Candy! It's just that when an entire floor-to-SOARING-ceiling wall-o-whiskey is the first thing you see when you come through the door, well...the emphasis is evident.

While you're perusing the premises, it will be hard to find one spot for your eye to settle on because there's so much to see. I swear the restaurant is as much an art installation as it is a spot for fine dining. And drinking, of course. The surroundings have been curated and built by the chef himself. Rick DeShantz, of Meat & Potatoes fame, put together a restaurant for all the senses. And I'm not just talking about the food.

Every elevation, twist and turn holds new curiosities from a Jackalope riding squirrel to a grown-ass bear to tattooed red leather chairs to door knobs for purse hooks on the upstairs bar made of recycled vintage doors to the quirky Ladies' Room downstairs that allows you to make eye contact and conversation with your across-the-divider neighbor and still take care of private necessities. I can only imagine what special features the Mens' Room has! Explore every level, explore every nook and cranny. What Chef DeShantz didn't handle himself, he hired the best of the best to tackle. Like the amazing murals!  Bottom line...if you're a fan of art, antiquities and bizarrities, check this place out. You won't be disappointed. 

On to the cocktails. Please! Downstairs the wonderful wall-o-whiskey dominates the room. Here's where you'll settle in for flights and tastings and drinks made of the finest whiskeys around. At all price levels. You name the whiskey, I'd be shocked if B&R doesn't have it. Give it a try. 

Head up the stairs...and up yet another smaller set of stairs still...and you find yourself at my own favorite spot of all. Bar Manager Mike Mills put his head together with Rick's to come up with a bar setup all other bartenders must drool over. There's even an area behind the bar to cook up syrups and shrubs, bitters and brews and all sorts of cocktail creativity. Be sure you order a classic cocktail here. My fave? A cool, refreshingly tart and sweet Ramos Gin Fizz. Oh my! There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever why the The Butcher and the Rye is a semi-finalist for James Beard Outstanding Bar Program this year!

Classic/craft cocktails not your scene? Maybe one of the original cocktails from some of the best bartenders in the city. (When I talked about Rick being a curator, I was talking about the way he gathered not just the artwork, but some of the most talented cocktologists in the city under one roof. Well...he and business partner Tolga Sevdik conspired to make that happen!) 

One other thing...Monday nights from 6:00 PM on, there's a little (BIG) deal going on upstairs called PopUp Embury. Yep, The old renowned Embury makes a weekly appearance with the former Embury's own Spencer Warren behind the stick. Guest bartenders from all over the 'Burgh and elsewhere recreate the magic that was Embury for those of us who miss it or MISSED it before the magic ended. Don't miss it while it's there....last call for PopUp Embury is scheduled for March 31st. See you there!",2014-03-17 13:56:01

It's always a hit or miss.  We tend to spend about an hour to an hour and a half here, depending on how the service is and how busy they are. 

We came on last Wednesday night with the same couple we went on Valentine's Day.  I didn't tell them we were invited back.  We all weren't too hungry this time around and only ordered 3 glasses of wine and an entree each.  I did have a gnat in my glass of wine.  They replaced it right away.  Service was much better this time from the hostess to our server.  I added one of my friend to the dinner and asked the hostess to tell our server to hand me the check at the end, so I can pay for the bill and tip properly on what was being taken care of.  We didn't order so much food and drinks, maybe this is why they took care of our visit.

I really do appreciate the kind gesture from the management.  After being a loyal customer of Brio since 2010...  Either this location have to get better in customer service or we'll have to suffer through the service.  LOL",2018-04-15 20:59:17

We both thought our dishes, although good were nothing out of the ordinary.  Both tasted bland and well....just ordinary.  We were only given a lunch menu which was a bit limited.  The dishes that other yelpers reviewed about must have come from the evening meal servivce.  They sure weren't on the lunch menu.  Prices were good.  Service was good.  Lunches were from a steam table I'm sure.  Based on what we saw today, I don't think the place merits a trip back.  We live near Glendale and 35th ave.  The food is hardly worth the trip.

Our gift certificate had expired 2 weeks ago (I can't understand why a gift certifcate would expire).  The hostess at the desk didn't look like we were going to wiggle our way out of this one.  She called over the manager, Dillon, and he looked at the gift certifcate and said they would honor it and then thanked us for our donation to the JDRF.  Dillon seated us and took our drink order.  Hendrick Gin & Tonics - yes they had Hendricks AND they had cucumbers and didn't look at us strangely when we asked.  A+ already.  We started off with the Basil spring rolls.  They were very good and the dipping suace was very spicy, but you only got 2 of them for $6.95.  I thought that was a little pricey and I would have rather gone for the lettuce wraps. Dillon was very attentive and we had a great discussion about how the Uptown hotel market has been full for weeks and is booked until Thanksgiving.  He also made an excellent recommendation for a Pinot Noir and it wasn't the most expensive wine on the list.  For dinner, Jennifer our waitress was very helpful.  She said she liked the red curry dishes the best and suggested the Red Curry Duck  ($24.95).  We ordered the duck and the Pad Thai ($15.95).  The Red Curry Duck was awesome.  The Pad Thai had chicken and shrimp and it was very good.  One of the best Pad Thai I have had in awhile.  It did not stick together like a big wad of starchy noodles.  It was very good with enough of a helping of chicken and large size shrimp and a good amount of vegetables.  After dinner we went to the bar and finished our wine and had a rum mojito that was also very good.  The bar tender was personable and Dillon came over to check on us.

The ordering process seemed needlessly long considering the few people there, i would hate to see how backed up the line gets when it's super busy.

The italian beef sandwich is basically a french dip -- don't let any overly gung ho chicagoan try to tell you otherwise.  They recommend 'dipped' where they put the whole sandwhich in the sauce, and it's likely because the bread they use is pretty dry.  I ordered my sauce on the side for dipping, and the bread was falling apart a little bit as i tried to maneuver it into the cup of tasty but watery sauce.  

Whatever I had as a side was totally unmemorable, and the amount of time I waited for them to slap precooked meat on a presliced roll was not appropriate, considering the customer load at the time.

I agree with the others about the photos.  Why can't Cashman charge a lot less?  I might have purchased one or two, but at $20+ for the photos, that's robbery--but it's going on in the right exhibit place.  Reduce your price, email me the digital photo, and I'll buy!",2011-04-26 22:38:50

Located right off Charleston and the I/15 you will find this hidden gem of a restaurant. I get random invites all the time from clients on these business lunches and I sometimes run out of places to think of to go eat on the spur of the moment. Today was different though I have been craving some Cajun style southern cuisine dishes and thought hmm why not check off this Lola's in my ""bookmark"" section on Yelp!

For starters when you are traveling to this restaurant for the first time pay close attention because it's super easy to drive right past. Look for this small turn in of an entry to the Holsum Bread bakery and Lola's will be right next door. Upon arriving it was to my surprise that they weren't as busy as I had anticipated especially around lunch time! Seated right away?! Score! Our server was awesome and super attentive to us the entire time we were there. I can always appreciate great customer service at restaurants when they make recommendations knowing it's my first visit. 

Lunch was as followed:

Drinks: 2 ""Muddy Waters"" Pretty much Lemonade & Iced Tea

Appetizer: Crab Cake- Lump blue crab, hand-formed with special seasonings. Served on a bed of mixed greens drizzled with a lemon garlic aioli sauce.

Blackened Chicken- Served with two sides (country potato salad/Mardi Gras Coleslaw)

Bronzed Catfish & Grits- Seasoned and bronzed catfish served over Gouda grits with an Andouille sausage & mushroom ragout.

Food total is going to be a 4 out of 5. The crab cake appetizer was so-so I do believe there was too much bread or something in it that took away the crab taste. My client is from the south and knows much about crab cakes and agreed. Overall though, this place definitely didn't disappoint and will return very soon.

Service was good. Staffs were all really attentive and polite. Came a few times around to ask if we needed anything.

They were all absolutely delicious.

We had the steak enchiladas and the pastor flautas. Steak enchiladas were okay, I am very rarely happy with steak when I order it at restaurants, but we wanted to give it a shot. The pastor was incredible... crispy, flavourful, perfect.

The service was excellent. With regards to female pulchritude, one of our wait staff excelled in that regard and was dressed in appropriately revealing bar little black oufit.

This restaurant is located in a small plaza and it's also a small location that can sit only about 20-25 ppl.   There is usually at least an hour wait during dinner and lunch time.   They don't take reservations and won't sit you unless all parties are present.  I highly recommend coming during a weekday or early before rush hour.   But even if you had to wait, it's still worth trying for the 1st time.  The food comes out really fast and the servers are not a few feet away.   Monta is very efficient in getting you in and out.  The menu overall is very affordable and what's even better is that the ramen is delicious!   

The 2 dishes you have to try are Kuro Ramen Black Garlic oil $7.95 and Takana Fried Rice $6.95.  The ramen broth is very rich from a long period of simmering and the noodles comes out chewy just like the way i like it.  If you like roasted garlic, you have to try it.  I found the flavor was even better when you add chili oil.  Eat this ramen fast because the soup gets richer and saltier the longer the soup sits.   It was a bit too salty and thicker for my liking.  But it's still a good ramen that you can't get anywhere else in this world!!!!!  You can also add additional toppings for additional fee if you are feeling adventurous.   The Takana Fried rice is the best rice i have ever had and i want to note that i'm not much of a ricer eater.  But the way they made the fried rice is out of this world.  Its served with chasu pork, mustard vegetables, green onions, eggs and white onions.  I loved the texture with the white and green onions mixed together.  They also give you a side of radish ginger for more enhanced flavoring.

1.  They do accept credit card if the bill is over $10.

So much great good, so much great service, so much awesome all around.  I need to give a special thank you to the owner Tommy for being so accommodating to our large group during Restaurant Week.  He had his staff reorganize our table at the last minute after some changes in our group size and did so at lightning speed.  He personally worked with me to make sure it was right and I can't thank him enough.

I don't venture into the Scottsdale area to dine out very often (even during Restaurant Week) so a little background on how I picked this place.  I needed a Restaurant Week spot that I could reserve for a large group on OpenTable.  In addition it had to have vegetarian options, was charging the Restaurant Week minimum price of $33/person, and was rated at 4 stars or higher on Yelp.  Tommy V's was the only one that met every criteria and polled at 4.5 stars on Yelp.  So I took a gamble on bringing 12 of us here despite none of us having been here.  Its located just east of Scottsdale Road and Indian School in the Old Town district.

Parking here was surprisingly easy as Tommy V's has its own private lot for their customers only.  From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty unassuming.  When you walk in its a different story.  You're immediately greeted by a glass structure with tons of different wines on display for the whole restaurant to see.  On the west side of the building is the bar area (which is fully stocked), and the sit down dining is on the east side.  The interior is elegant, but cozy at the same time.  As a guy I would be perfectly home here in a collared shirt or a suit.  It can be as casual or fancy as you want it to be.

I had done my Restaurant Week research in advance so I knew what I was getting.  Of the three appetizer options, I chose the Orecchiette Pasta.  Tiny pasta shells mixed with crab, shrimp and really nice thick chunks of lobster.  A fantastically rich (but not overwhelmingly rich) pasta mixing in fresh hearty portions of the seafood that goes great with a wine (I had a Syrah).  For the main course, I went with their Short Ribs with Gnocchi and two types of cheese.  Ridiculously tender meat that cuts easily with a fork and a gnocchi and cheese blend that exudes a creamy savory compliment to meat and soaks up the meat juices perfectly.  For the big finish, I went with the Salted Caramel Gelato.  A nice, cold, dense gelato but admittedly I didn't taste as much of the caramel as I expected.  In fact I picked up the chocolate notes on this one moreso than salted caramel.  It was still great, just a little surprising.

Total price for the three course meal, glass of Syrah, tax, and tip totaled about $55.  Between the outstanding food and very attentive service by our server Tyler, it was worth every penny.  And even with a jazz band playing over at the bar area and a full house of customers, our party of 12 was still able to converse easily without yelling across the table at one another.  Even though Yelp gave it 4.5 stars going in, even I was surprised how great the experience was.  Mad props to Tommy V's entire operation for delivering a Restaurant Week experience to remember.

I ordered the club sandwich without bacon, however when the food arrived it still came with bacon. That doesn't bother me too much but it would have been nice if they followed through with any special requests. The sandwich was just okay I thought and the fries ushered a similar response from me. Unfortunately none of the food really stood out to me but that's not to say that it was terrible as the meal was still satisfactory.

Other than that there's nothing much to really say about this place. Not sure if I would come back though, but I might have to give it another chance and order something else.",2016-07-06 01:43:23

a) validated parking for 90 mins (or just swing over to Queen City Q for a drink and have them validate if you're going to be there for a long time)
b) incredible local food options including Local Loaf, Orrmans, Pure Pizza, Bonsai, etc.

Since it was restaurant week, we opted in for the $44 per person menu. We got to choose an appetizer, main course and dessert each. We started ourselves with wine and the complimentary bread. The bread was olive oil, rosemary tasting with a side of spicy dip or olive oil cheese. We were both a fan of the bread and the cheese dip! Yum! We then started with our appetizers: scallops crudo & burrata di bufala which were both good but nothing exceptional. The scallops were really thin pieces and the burrata di bufala was also small bites but the taste was more unique and impressional. For the mains, we had: Ora king salmon & short rib vaccinara. The short rib was god and so was the salmon, but not impressionable either. However, they were still decent and tasted good, so it was solid. For desserts, we ended with: lemon panna cotta & gianduja franjelico tiramisu - the tiramisu didn't taste like the usual moist ones I e had, but I liked it a lot! The toasted banana bits and chocolates weren't overpowering to each other nor was it too sweet, a fan of it and would recommend to order.

Today, lunch at Mika's Greek was suggested by one of the quieter ""culinary co-horts"". I had no idea this awesome little joint was hiding in my backyard at the south end of Papago Plaza! Mika's is clean, modern and comfortable. They even have a Coke Freestyle dispenser. More on that later.

True to form, I ordered something ""gyro"" related. My Gyro Platter (with one meat and one side) was a generous portion and very reasonable for less than eight dollars. Lunch was filling, healthy and so tasty! I'm glad I was a creature of habit today, because it made it easier to make a decision in the face of so many options.

Now about that soda machine... Right after one of my co-workers filled his drink, the touch screen indicated that nearly all the choices were unavailable. All I had at this point was a cup of ice. An employee tried to fix this by re-booting the machine. She also offered me a bottle of Coke as an option. I declined and waited patiently, returning two more times, only to find the screen slowly re-booting. When the dispenser was working again, it was still missing about 80% of the options. However, I managed to dispense a surprisingly good Cherry Mello Yello Zero. Random, huh?

Unfortunately, when I returned for a refill, the machine looked like it was working properly, but my Cherry Coke was flat... I can't deduct a star, even after that. The food at Mika's was too good! See you again soon!",2016-11-12 06:07:10

I called about my 20+ year old honda which is difficult to get parts for, there have been times I've ordered listed parts that weren't correct and I've had to return. I asked him if he could give me part numbers along with prices and he flat out refused, stating that he wouldn't do that because the part numbers are so readily available online. Seriously??? 
I called them because they're the experts(being a dealership and all) and I wanted to make sure that the parts I needed were the right ones as I said, especially since many parts listed online are old numbers that have been superceded by newer parts, which can quickly get confusing and complicated.
I have an Acura as well and call dealerships often for information and have never, ever, not even once been told that they wouldn't give me information that I was requesting. In fact, after calling Honda West I called my old Honda dealer in the Midwest and the guy not only took at least 15 minutes giving me every last part # I asked for and compared prices, but he even offered to put me in the touch with the internet manager in case I had any more questions about how to search and order parts on their website. That's how you handle customer service, not take shortcuts to make your own day easier. Isn't that your job if you work in a parts dept? Deal with part numbers? 
The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is that I had picked up a few odds and ends for my car a few months before and one of the service guys was moderately helpful with a few tips on the side. I also clearly recall at the time that whoever was working in parts that day was very stressed and short with customers, he kept running back and forth and kept me waiting for several minutes to get wiper blades. There were no other customers but me the whole time I sat there. 
I believe Trent is the parts manager at HW, so hopefully one of his superiors will read this and know that his not wanting to spend a few more minutes on the phone lost them my business for good. As I'm replacing my whole suspension, brakes and several other parts that was a costly mistake to make, as I usually source all my parts for repairs and don't always have to time to wait for online parts, even if it's a little cheaper. Any manager who doesn't understand the basics of customer service and resorts to laziness and shortcuts doesn't have what it takes to be manager. It comes across as self-serving and extremely unprofessional. I'll find another dealer in Vegas or Henderson who wants to help me more than themselves.",2018-06-10 04:11:02

Hailing from the Midwest it would be an understatement to say that Hawaiian food was locally underrepresented, and even to this day a search of restaurants close to Northwest Ohio indicates zero serving anything 'Hawaiian' save for the ""Flaming Hawaiian Volcano Roll"" at a particularly sad looking Sushi joint, thus when a patient from the Big Island suggested that the most authentic taste of home she'd found since living in Las Vegas was at 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate on West Craig Road the decision was made to stop in, though a drive of nearly thirty minutes from home made such a thing somewhat laborious.

In reality located in North Las Vegas, a completely different entity from Las Vegas proper to those unfamiliar, and operated by the same family for seven years in a shopping plaza next to Ella Em's Soul Food, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate is presented as a counter-service concept in which diners are invited to approach a menu hanging at the far end of a lengthy space over a wide window looking into the kitchen, the owner's wife serving as the sole front-of-house staff-member as she pulls triple duty as cashier, server and story-teller, an early arrival before the crowds allowing for plenty of the latter.

Truly a wealth of knowledge as relates to her homeland's history, the 'plantation era' briefly described when explaining Saimin Noodles to the uninitiated, it was with several questions asked and answered that decisions were made from a board that at first seems brief before one really digs into the various offerings for Meats and toppings, the decision to try one mixed plate plus Noodles, an Appetizer, two sweets and a side easily enough food for four, all at the total cost of just under thirty dollars.

Taking a seat in the minimally decorated space, The Food Network displayed  on televisions as diners are left to peruse a flip-card indicating daily specials plus a Brunch menu offered on Sundays, it was after perhaps five minutes that plates one and two were delivered from the kitchen, the aforementioned Egg Noodles pan fried in a slick sauce with Ham and a mix of Cabbage, Radishes and Green Onions, the flavor largely that of light Sesame plus a bit of Ginger while the half-dozen Chicken Wings were twice-fried crisp and medium-hot, the meat on the inside plump with a good seasoning of its own and tender but not greasy.

Offering Chicken in no less than ten styles, a sample of the Garlic version topped in yellow Aioli a bit too pungent while the ""Ono Chicken"" takes the Katsu-style Thigh meat and lightly tosses it in a pan of Garlic, Onions and Oil with outstanding results, the $11.50 ""Mixed Plate"" was completed with a small bowl of shredded Pork and Cabbage next to two big mounds of Rice and a rather flavorless Macaroni Salad, the deep-fried Musubi marrying Hawaii's love of Spam with Spicy Mayonnaise, Unagi Sauce and Furikake in an unexpectedly compelling manner that could change the opinion of many mainlanders as relates to canned Meat.

Told that 808's Pastry Chef, actually the owner's son, was vacationing back home currently, thus leaving only two types of Butter Mochi available for Dessert, it was with one of each that the meal came to an end, the version topped in Blueberries unfortunately quite disappointing with a gummy texture and not much sweetness while the block of sticky Purple Yam proved somewhat better, though certainly not on par with the pies and cakes featured in Social Media, nor the Macadamia Nut Pancakes or Bread Pudding French Toast offered at Brunch.

***1/2: Thriving as a family run eatery in North Las Vegas for almost eight years thanks to a dedicated following of Hawaiians searching for the real thing, 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate is a worthy destination for those seeking something a little different from the big-box Poke stops springing up across the Valley, the prices a genuine bargain for both the quality and the portion sizes even when accounting for the gallon or so of gas it will take most Las Vegans to get there.",2017-05-15 12:00:15

We started with The Pierogies, which were crispy style with feta, cabbage, onions, and olive sour cream.  They were amazing!  I've tried a lot of pierogies around the city and these were by far my favorite I've ever had.

My main dish was The Diamond Burger which was topped with melted mozzarella curd, smothered with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and herb mix. With a truffle Worcestershire aioli.  It was easily one of the top 5 best burgers I've ever had in my life!!  It was amazing.

So why after eating some awesome food would I give this place a mediocre rating?  Because we had a super crappy/lazy waitress.  We planned to order drinks with our meal but she took the drink menu away as soon as we ordered.  She never asked if we wanted dessert.  She never came to refill our glasses and we ended up waiting around 10 minutes for her to pick up our bill while she stood at the bar watching TV.  (I posted a picture.)

I purchased 50% off tickets via Phoenix Voice and told as many people as I could about this event. I mean, who doesn't love tacos? When we arrived, there was no real direction of where to go or where specific booths were. It would have been great to have a directory or map (as someone else stated) of where each vendor was along with some contact information or what menu items they would be serving for the day. I also don't recall seeing a schedule of events anywhere. 

We decided to start the day off with margaritas but were told we had to go get food and beverage tickets. No problem!  We walked out of the main drink tent and found the table where they check your I.D. It looks like the TSA is renting their goons out to local events because the guy at the table was all dressed in black, had sunglasses on and was obviously not happy to be there. When he held on to my driver's license and peered at me over his glasses, I thought I was going to get groped down. Apparently, I passed muster because he nodded to the wrist band person and I was able to move on and get my tickets. 

After getting our margaritas, we circled the event grounds. We had the bbq taco (ok), the carnitas taco on fry bread (delish), the much talked about carne asada taco from Milagro Grill (yawn), the chicken taco with salsa verde from Manuels (very good) and many more. For me, the best taco of the day was the carnitas taco from the Four Seasons food truck. It was a beautiful day outside and as some people mentioned, there were plenty of places to sit if you wanted to park it on the grass in the sun. It would have been nice to have a few more tables with shade. We also arrived at noon (on Sunday) and half of the vendors had not arrived yet. We watched the lucha libre Mexican wrestling and checked out some of the vendors. All in all, I would definitely recommend and I will definitely return next year.

We came on a Sunday morning at 10:00am for the doughnuts, cider, and to pick pumpkins.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've been a Vegas resident since 1992 and this was my first visit--shame on me!  I've been missing out all these years.  Kids of all ages will love this place!  Free admission, free rides on the tractor trailer that goes around the orchard, free use of their wheelbarrows--you should visit if you've been putting it off.  We had the doughnuts and cider first because the longer you wait, the longer the wait will be for those items and they may even sell out.  Our friends got there earlier and bought the doughnuts at $2.00 an order as well as bottles of the fresh pear cider for $2 a pint: an excellent breakfast!  There are also half gallon bottles of apple and pear cider available for $4.  Next, we headed towards the pumpkin patches.  Definitely wear closed-toe shoes when you visit because you're walking around in the dirt; my regular weekend wear of flip-flops were not a good idea - duh.  Also, if you don't have a wheelbarrow of your own, the orchard offers customers free use of theirs, but you may have to find one on your own if they're all in use.  Basically just find someone who's checking out at the cashier line and take one off their hands.  We walked over to the pumpkin patches and there were many pumpkins available.  Customers just need to walk around and find those to their liking and load up; the choosing can take a while if you're looking for the perfect pumpkin.  The line to check out moved quickly, but it was fairly long by the time we left.  On our next visit, we will definitely get there much earlier.  The price for pumpkins is 50 cents a pound (as of 10/12/14).  Don't put it off if you've been thinking of going--now is the right time to enjoy the orchard.  
**Open Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, 7:00am-2:00pm until the end of October.  Cash, credit, and debit are accepted.

The food is kind of just thrown on the plate and covered in tomatoes. My daughter even said she didn't like it and she loves Mexican food and tomatoes. The cashier was nice but the manager seems to need an attitude adjustment. For a salad and kids meal 14 bucks seems pretty steep considering its not that great. The only plus is shaded out door seating that my dog seems to enjoy. I wont be wasting my money here again and I suggest you don't either.,2011-06-01 06:10:30

For any of the uninitiated out there, Camelview is basically the one main place in the Phoenix metropolitan area that plays all of the limited release and lesser known movies out there. They play the movies that the main theaters SHOULD be playing. The theater itself is nothing special.. it's old and no frills; but in my eyes the only thing that really counts here is what's on the screen! Here is a quick run-down of some of the movies I've seen at Camelview that weren't playing anywhere else when they were first released in Arizona:

No Country for Old Men
There Will be Blood
The Wrestler
Napoleon Dynamite
Grizzly Man
A Serious Man
Crazy Heart

That's just to name a few... basically a large portion of the critical hits that probably aren't going to make oodles of money will find an audience here; and thank God they do... if Camelview were to go away we'd left with the usual globbidy gloop of poopy that plays at all the main theaters (The weekly rut of romantic comedies and cliche action movies... no thanks!). 

The other thing worth mentioning real quick is the type of people that go here. Generally I'd say a good 99% of people that go here are adults... you're not going to get crying kids or trouble making teenagers here. I've never had an issue with talking or texting during a movie and I think it's because most people that come here are 'movie people' and are genuinely interested in watching what's on the screen in a respectable fashion. God Bless Camelview!",2010-01-13 19:09:41

So I convinced him to pleaaasseee come and eat something else than the soup.

I got the shoyu-tonkatsu and my taste has changed. It was just too salty for me now.  I took the noodles and didn't drink the broth.  I had a massive headache immediately after and drank a ton of water. Owies. Since I've gone and cut out processed foods I think I've become sensitive to high sodium. 

The cold noodle salad was still pretty good to me though and I took a bite of pork belly bowl which is still one of the yummiest things on rice.

It was a dream meal for me, this crispy breaded pan fried veal with spaghetti in tomato sauce. It's like a kids' meal in an adult portion. 

It did took us awhile to get seated. When we got there, around 7.30pm on a Saturday evening, the place was in full swing and the manager was teaching his son tricks and tips to handle the pressure. We started with bread and it was served warm, which for me is a real plus plus. Then came the calamari, which was good on its own (though a tad oily), but was absolutely fantastic when dipped into the accompanying tomato sauce. It was a very unique taste, this tomato sauce, and it reminded me of the tomato sauce I had at a greek restaurant recently. And finally the superstar of the night for me, the veal, just made that evening better and better. For dessert, we had a canoli, which was also unbelievably good, even though by this time my stomach was already screaming, ""Enough is enough!""

I will go back 1000 times and recommend everybody who likes their genuine, family run Italian restaurants to give this place a try.",2016-02-13 14:46:14

We showed up on a Saturday morning and were quoted a 20min wait for our party of 3.  That wait only took about 10 mins since a party of 8 ahead of us disappeared.  We were seated in a lonely table in a giant empty orange room that would soon become the waiting room.  After five minutes or so, someone showed up to take our orders.  We put in our orders and waited again.  She eventually brought out our drinks.  Everything here is served in glasses that you would expect to see fresh-squeezed orange juice served in - 6-oz glasses.  Inevitably, these glasses would sit empty for most of our experience.

And what an experience it was! We sat there for 25 minutes waiting for our $8 waffles.  Yes, I said $8 for a waffle.  Mine was chocolate chip.  Giradelli's you ask? No...regular cheap semi-sweets.  How many waffles you ask? Just one.  Was it tire sized? Nope...about 8"" diameter.  Sounds overpriced?  You bet'cha.

So our food finally came.  The waffle was alone.  No toppings, no sides of bacon or hashedbrowns.  Nothing.  Just an $8 waffle sitting on a plate insulting me and my debit card.  It then proceeded to insult my calcium intake by challenging my teeth to Mortal Kombat.  This was the crispiest waffle I had ever seen and that was not a good thing.  No malted creaminess to enjoy.  No love whatsoever. 

Ages went by before we saw a server again.  We were surrounded by waiting patrons who I just wanted to tell - Go Across The Street To The Good Egg!

I LOVE VARIETY!

Despite being the only show in town, Golden Corral puts out each and every day.  The food quality is solid and they have a varying menu depending on the day of the week.  They offer fresh steamed vegetables, fish, steak, shrimp and other seafood depending on the day.  They also have a decent dessert buffet.  

The taste of the food here is really good.  I usually stuff myself with steak, potatoes, corn, apple pie and ice cream.  It doesn't get anymore American than that.  This place reminds me of Thanksgiving every day of the week.  I would eat here every day if I could because of the terrific variety and flavor.  

You will find some of Cleveland's largest eaters doing their favorite thing here.  For the price, you can't beat it.  

The layout of the restaurant is not great and it's a mad-dash for food while you dodge people and kids, but again, the food is descent.

My sometimes-snooty wife doesn't like the ""atmosphere"" at Golden Corral, yet she proclaimed she ate ""the best"" deep fried shrimp that she'd ever eaten here.  Sometimes the best food isn't where you would expect to find it...and I've proven this on multiple occasions.  For example, see my reviews of La Casita Blanca and Hounddog's Three Degree Pizza.

When it comes to my taste buds, I will not discriminate.

We stopped in for an early morning breakfast after a late night in Vegas. We must have walked in at just the right time because we were immediately seated in this very eclectic, gaudy diner. The waitress attire varied between what looked like a 80s throwback soda girl outfit and a 90s style prom dress. Hilarious and awesome. 

Families were sat around us, no drunks, no rowdy people--as others have mentioned. And the menu was a classic, American diner reprieve from fancy or over-the-top touristy stops. Me likey. The prices were a little high for breakfast-fare, but again, this is Vegas. 

Their eggs Benedict was the absolutely delicious and featured a split, well-toasted English muffin, topped with THREE poached eggs and some super-solid hollandaise sauce. And by ""super-solid"" I mean just classically delicious. No overly-powerful lemon punch, just well-balanced, rich goodness. Those hashbrowns were also off-the-charts good with fluffy and crunchy spots. I topped mine with Tabasco and loved that some of the yolks and hollandaise dressed the sides of the 'browns. 

An honorable mention goes out to the coffee! Smooth, awesome diner coffee. 

Also, this place doesn't look like it's changed much over the years, and really, that's part of its charm.",2015-03-06 19:51:55

The location inside of The Four Seasons made this very easy for a weeknight meal. The Four Seasons is easy to access since it isn't in the middle of the Strip and all of the traffic. We were immediately greeted by a valet and told that the $24 valet fee would be waived since we were dining at the hotel. The restaurant is a very short walk from the front door. I liked that I didn't have to walk through a casino to access this restaurant.

The host at the front warmly greeted us as soon as he seated the party in front of us. He provided us Restaurant Week menus as well as the regular menu. The regular menu looked great for a future visit, but we were set on RW for this visit.

The service was excellent from start to finish. Our waiter was professional and timely. We were checked on regularly, drinks refilled constantly, and all courses were presented with an explanation of what we were being served. The service definitely met if not exceeded the level of service one expects at a steakhouse.

The bread basket that is brought out before the courses was great. There was a nice olive bread, cornbread, and a regular crusty bread. All of the breads were delicious. The Bibb Lettuce Salad was simple with some bacon and ranch, but was good. The RW menu also included bottomless wine. We were served white with the salad and red with the main course. The red was on the dry side and was my favorite of the two.

The Surf & Turf was very, very good. The steak was prepared perfectly with a well seasoned char on the outside and tender meat inside. The stuffed lobster had nice pieces of lobster and crab with a tasty stuffing. The jalapeno creamed corn was very tasty and the jalapeno didn't overwhelm the other flavors. The smashed potatoes were good, but not the most exciting side this restaurant offers. The finale to the meal came in the form of a Lemon Tart.

We found the place easy enough and it has ample parking. The inside definitely felt more like a lunch place and was surprisingly empty (probably due to holidays more than deliciousness).

We ordered the Hamachi (Yellow Tail), Crispy California Roll and Dragon Roll...and holy shit, was it DELISH. The Yellow Tail worked as a nice palatte cleanser with all the warm outer goodness, but all I can say is, PERFECT. The miso soup at a buck fiddy was also perfect.

The beer was reasonably priced, ample NONPINK ginger, light Kikomo, and the chefs were super nice. The waitstaff left a lot to be desired considering we were one of three tables and it really pissed me off after more than ten minutes of waiting and had to stand up and ask someone to take our order-that just ain't right.

It is a little more $$ than Brodard's in California but which is cheaper:  Flying/driving down west to LA or slapping down an extra buck for nearly the same rolls?  A member of the family that owns Brodard's runs the operation and with at least two visits there, I noted:

1) Nem Nuong rolls ($4.95)* are similar to Brodard's but with more crunch and thinner slices of Nem Nuong.  The sauce is about the same to me, regardless of what others say.  They make these rolls when you order them so the rice paper wrapper is still freshly soft and not hard and dried out.  Overall, their best item is their signature item.  The other roll contains shrimp paste (chao tom) and also okay but not as good.

2) Combo rice plate with Thit Nuong (grilled pork) - not recommended.   That day the meat came out way salty and I notified them right away.  They did offer to take care of it so that is always a welcome customer service gesture.  For some reason, I didn't take a photo of that rice dish that day.  hmmmm

3) Banh Canh Tom Cua - a Vietnamese udon noodle soup with crab and shrimp.  I recommend this soup.  The broth is rich and delicious.  Noodles come soft and the toppings are sufficient for a wholesome bowl of hot goodness.

4) Banh Khot - I forgot that I hated Brodard's Banh Khot when I ordered this one.  The walls of each mini ""pancake"" were still too thick causing the batter not to be crispy as it potentially could be.  The lack of other toppings with the shrimp detracts also.  Not recommended.

Conclusion:  Despite the mishaps with the rice plate and banh khot, if you stick with the Banh Canh Tom Cua and the Nem Nuong rolls and you should be golden.

Basically what I'm getting at is that Tony Gemignani is the Howard Johnson of pizza. He does a few styles of pizza really well. And a few others ... well, he tries.

The best of the bunch, by a long shot, is the sausage and stout pizza, topped with fontina cheese and infused with Guinness in the crust. It's made in limited quantities each day and is worth getting there early for. The Detroit Red Top is like a Chicago deep dish on steroids - order one of these and you'll be eating it for a week.

Somewhat less successful is the New Yorker pie - an interpretation of a classic that just feels... off. Maybe he's trying to elevate it. But the whole point of New York pizza ... if you're elevating it, you're doing it wrong.",2016-04-12 06:59:24

Our waitress was very courteous and attentive throughout our meal, but you could tell she was new to her job.  The food arrived slowly.

Go figure.  Anyway, I wasn't missing much based upon my experience there.  

It was about noon when I stopped in and the lunch crowd was starting to fill the place up.  I was offered any open table which was nice (there were only a couple available).  The place was full groups of folks that appeared to be mostly from the nearby business park.  I sat myself on down and waited for about 5 minutes before I got my water, and then took a look over the menu.  No lunch specials to be found here which I found extremely odd given that this is obviously a spot that does a lot of business during lunch.  Okay, whatevs.  

I ordered up a couple of sushi rolls, which I verbally ordered and then was advised to mark on the paper sushi menu.  That was a bit absurd to me, we're going to waste a whole sheet of paper for me to make 2 marks?!  Fair enough, I followed the sushi ordering rules.   I went with one specialty roll and then a standard spicy tuna.  

The place was pretty full, yes, but I watched several other tables that showed up after me get their stuff before I did.  I know sushi can take longer but they had sushi too.  Plus, I was flying solo.  Anyway, the sushi arrived and it was about like everything else to this point, meh.  Lots of white rice on the outside, not a ton of stuff on the inside, and not a lot of taste.  It was pretty inexpensive and, as they say, you get what you pay for.  The whole lunch took about 45 minutes which is pretty long considering that I was by myself. 

Maybe the sushi isn't their specialty, I don't know.  There are also some other Japanese-ish dishes, hibachi and such. Based upon my overall experience, I was pretty underwhelmed.",2015-01-06 16:30:50

I get to the warehouse, and they're not sure about my order because it has not been properly called in. They then have to verify and then send someone out The back somewhere to look for this part that was supposed to be waiting for me at the first location!

The broth has been perfect the last few times I've been and it just hits the spot! I love going on Sundays for their Vietnamese buffet (the only one in Charlotte)! It's a good way to try out a plethora of Vietnamese dishes including traditional soups, dishes and dessert. I recommend:

1. Quail - Must get!
2. Vietnamese Pancakes/Crepes - make sure to get the fish sauce to eat with this dish!
3. Summer Rolls - use the brown (hoisin) sauce to dip these in. I like to add peanuts and sriracha on top
4. Bun Bo Hue - build your own with veggies on the bottom, then noodles and then pour the soup over!

I have heard of Bamiyan, not only through Yelp, but from my friends who absolutely love this place. So, when my bf and I were in the area, we decided to venture in. We went on a Saturday night and to be expected, the place was packed. I was already scanning some tables where people were just about to leave. There was on empty table and I quickly bee-lined towards it.

My bf decided to get the Chicken Breast Kabob with rice, salad, and naan and the Chaplee Kabob which turned out to be my fave...the spices were so delicious and the meat tender. While the chicken breast was tender, it was nothing special. Add to that rice and salad, I could have been anywhere, and not necessarily in a restaurant serving Afghan cuisine. The one good thing about this place are the portions and price. For $10, you get a HUGE plate of rice (it takes half of the big plate) and comes with meat and salad AND naan. It really does fill you up.

My bf said that this location was smaller than the other one he visited, so while I don't mind doing a ""fast-food"" establishment once in a while, I won't be coming back here anytime soon. The place is crowded with families, babies, kids running around, long lines and just chaos. Saturday night or no Saturday night, I really just wanted to eat and leave. It's the type of place where you put your fork down and people think you are leaving and take over the table by placing the baby carriage in front of you.

The food on the other hand...I don't know, was plain at best. I have never tasted or been introduced to Afghan cuisine other than Bamiyan, so would those from the area consider the food authentic? Real? Delicious? (For me, it would be a similar idea to a Holy Chow masked as Chinese cuisine, but for those in the know, it is far from it). If I wanted to get rice, salad, and naan, I could go to any place that served those types of foods.

Had I had the same mediocre, over-cooked dimsum at a dingy Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, the food would probably be worse in my head and definitely the restaurant would be 2-star. However, due to the prime location it is in, and the fact that I was there on a sunny day, sitting near the window, the view made up for the somewhat crummy food.

______________________________
Location:
2nd floor in the Harbourfront building, with a corner location and a beautiful view to the lake. Restaurant is bright and clean. Very nice.

Food:
My friend and I, we ordered a LOT. Most of which were ridiculously overcooked, and obviously really hot. I think they have a huge stack of steamers in the back and they just leave the food in there all day.
- leaf wrapped rice: the leaves were dried up and stuck on to the rice. The flavour was okay, not authentic enough, and a little bland
- spinach dumplings: the clear skin literally breaks apart at the touch of chopstick. None of the al dente feel that skin should have. I might have liked the flavour better if it wasn't so steamy hot.
- chicken feet: the flavour was all there (in fact it was really tasty) and of course the bones fell apart as soon as you picked it up, somewhat in a good way, but you can tell the outerskin has been sucked of its moisture due to the overcookedness
- deep-fried squid tentacles: BEST dish of the meal. The only dish that didn't feel overcooked, amazingly tasty, and wasn't cold (unlike many of the dimsum restaurants with push carts).
- fried leek and shrimp dumplings: a bit cold,but really good
- scallop rice noodle wrap (chun fun) - OK
- black bean pork ribs: they used the good ribs, and a bit salty but pretty good.
- bbq pork bun: not a huge fan, a little too sweet
- garlic baby bokchoy veggie: the garlic was roasted and not stir-fried with the vegetable, weird. It was okay...
- jelly fish: weird dish for dimsum, but okay. 

Price:
EXPENSIVE! $5.50 for a medium, $6 for large (scallop rice noodle), $7.50 for special (jelly fish, baby bok choy)
Our bill worked out to be $75 after tax and tip...for what i mentioned above. Ridiculous.

Service:
Ironically, it's your typical chinese service. Other than the fact that they spoke English, everyone pretty much ignores you and forgets to give you things when you ask for them. They do have push cart service, but they come around randomly and it's the same carts that go around and around, with nothing you actually want in them. You're better off ordering from the menu than wait for the push cart. 
______________________

Funnies:  
- they have to take the push carts up and down the stairs, and every time the push cart lady has to ask some male server to help her. 
- also THE PUSH CART LADIES CALL OUT THE FOODS IN ENGLISH, which, to be honest, makes the food somewhat incomprehensible. 

Would I go back? Only if I want to bring someone special to go see the view while having dimsum...so very not likely.",2011-08-01 18:33:22

I know, it's not the most thrilling use of a kid-free Saturday afternoon, but at least we ordered a coffee - caffeine after 2pm is a little edgy?

Ok, so maybe not, but at least we ventured some place new rather than Starbucks.  And apparently ordering caffeine after 2pm is normal behavior for young folk these days because nearly every table and chair were taken.  There is not a ton of seating because the place is very compact, but you can also perceive it to be cute, charming, quaint and comfortable.  There is a small living setup with an old bookcase, books and board games hidden around the corner. This is where we able to find a table. There are also tables outside for the overflow.

The menu was good - coffee and flavorings with an impressive bakery display that I pretended did not exist because I am not Day 6 of a sugar-reduced diet.

There was a friendly girl working the counter, a clean bathroom, and free wifi.  Everything was looking like a five star review until the coffee was a little more than half way gone...the caffeine put me in ""work"" mode, my head was down, I was working ferociously....and then the wifi dropped.

I immediately blamed my stupid computer but then I looked up to see that everyone's computer displayed the same ""cannot load webpage"" message.  The internet stayed down so I left, and my table was immediately overtaken by young hipsters.

I'll start with the service. Whether you're calling in an order, or going to there to order, EXPECT EXCELLENT SERVICE, cause that's all they have.  :) Nuff said. I mostly call in my orders and wait impatiently for my food cause it's soo good.

Walk in to the place, and it's not huge.  A few booths along the wall and 1 round table.  They also have a few games to play, or books to read as time passes for your food. Such a warm and cozy family vibe when you walk in.  You can tell there is love flowing through that place.  When I go to pick up my food, there are always people in the booths and they have nothing but smiles.  Families bring their kids, because it is kiddo friendly.  

I can honestly say this place has the best pizza.  I eat a lot of pizza, and have had it from different places since birth, and this is one of the best.  The crust is perfect.  Usually I'll leave the crust for someone else to eat, but not here.  If you don't want your crust, slide it over to the left hand side.  I will gladly dip it in some ranch and finish it for you.

Their colonial Spanish architecture with a Mediterranean flair is both elegant and romantic.  The Resort and Restaurant are both decorated with hardwoods and cherry woods everywhere with and hand-painted Italian frescoes and beautiful floral arrangements throughout.  The unfortunate thing about my visit, I was there for a business dinner... lol

The service from start to finish was outstanding.  The bar was fairly busy mixed with Resort guest and people like us just their to dine.  The servers were very attentive and we got our food fairly fast considering the type of restaurant.  The Sommelier was knowledgeable and eager to help us find the right wines to go with our meals. Excellent service all around.

I started my dinning experience with a glass of Chardonnay and Pear and organic mixed green salad.  It was good but I was expecting the pear to be grilled.  For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!  My steak was cooked extremely well and delicious.  I did not have room for desert, but made room for a cup of coffee, which was very good as well. 

My next visit to T. Cooks I plan to bring my lovely bride and have the pan roasted halibut with herb potatoes and local veggies cooked in a red wine butter sauce, YUM!!  It looked really good from across the table : )

The place was pretty empty on a Thursday evening, and the lady behind the counter was very friendly and smiled the entire time while I asked and she answered my questions regarding the menu. For example, what is in the mixed veggie roti. ( BTW is cauliflower, potato, and green peas). 

I originally wanted a dosa, but I was told that their fridge had stopped working earlier that day, and so they had to throw out everything they need to make the dosa. Oh well. I settled for a mix veggie roti, and the bf got a chicken roti, both were takeout. We sat down and perused through some magazines that they have for those who are waiting for their take - out, and in less than 10 mins, out came another lady with our orders packed up and ready to go. 

We got home and opened our containers, and WHOA!! These things are huge! We dug in, and this was the verdict: 
-Mix Veggie Roti was ok. I wasn't totally won over by it, I got mine medium hot, and it was spicy but there was also a sweetness to the sauce that I wasn't crazy about. 
- Chicken Roti was yummy! I really liked it, it was delicious, and saucy and my only complaint would be that my bf got his mild ( the big baby) and I wanted more kick to it! Otherwise totally delicious. 

Like I said, these things are huge, so I got halfway through mine before I almost had to undo a button on my pants. If you're a guy however, this is probably just the right amount of food, as my bf ate all his and then finished mine up.

We also had a two hour limit for dinning, which wasn't long enough. We took time to enjoy the cider flights, order a bunch of apps and pretty much ordered most items on the menu.

Yes, new restaurants are opening up left and right every week but I feel like they all serve the same thing but different ways. Anyways, but guess what! Home of the Brave did spark enough interest in me that I decided to take out my camera *wipes off dust* and go out for dinner with a friend.

So for those of you who didn't know, Home of the Brave is opened by team behind the famous La Carnita. La Carnita is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto that serves Mexican street style food so I knew I was in good hands going into Home of the Brave. 

It was on a Wednesday night I decided to walk in for a dinner at 6pm and the restaurant was already full. I put my name down for a table but decided to take a seat at the bar since it became avail first.

Ordered: Zombie Slush - 3 types of rum, grapefruit, pineapple and cinnamon syrup for $7. My friend had this drink and I tried a sip and boy was it strong! They def don't skimp out on alcohol!

Ordered: Bones in a Bucket - Kansas City rubbed beef and pork ribs served with ranch dressing, celery and carrot for $19. This dish was outstanding, first of all I loved the fact that we got to try both pork and beef ribs. I personally love beef ribs and found it to be very tender and the meat was falling off the bone. Pickled celery and carrot sticks were a nice touch on the side. I would def get this again if I went back.

Ordered: Kentucky Handshake Sandwich - Fried chicken, mayo, iceberg lettuce and louisiana hot sauce for $13. This is something I had to order because of its presentation. I thought only Asians eat chicken feet? I would've laughed if I saw somebody freak out over the chicken feet that comes attached to the sandwich. The sandwich def need the hot sauce that is served on the side, chicken was super juicy but didn't think it was anything special.

Ordered: Buffalo Cauliflower - Beer battered cauliflower, louisiana hot sauce, ranch dressing, celery and carrot for $8. I wasn't sure if I will like this but it was one of the best dishes we ordered that night. I didn't know deep fried cauliflower would taste this good, it was crunchy and hearty- perfect with louisiana hot sauce.

Ordered: Tater Tots - Crispy potatoes, cheese, gravy and herbs for $7. Served in mini cast iron pan, tater tots are just like deep fried mashed potatoes. Thin crispy outside with soft creamy inside.. says it is served with gravy but that didn't stand out to me much.

Ordered: Red Velvet Funnel Cake - My friend and I were so full but we had to try their dessert. Served with bourbon vanilla icecream on top, this was probably one of the best funnel cakes I've ever had. Tangy berries and rich cream cheese sauce on top, the funnel cake was just perfect in every way possible.

Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my meal at Home of the Brave. They serve unique dishes that you don't find at many restaurants and I love that they stick to what they do best, instead of following every food trend that is happening at the moment.

Yes, M Resort is that one hotel off the 15 surrounded by absolutely nothing where you can see the lights and hotels of the strip in the distance.

Totally worth it.

Along with the buffet comes unlimited drinks. And by unlimited drinks I mean beer, wine, and cider. For free. Although, you should be nice and tip them lol

So at Studio B they have the weekday lunch buffet, which does NOT have the crab legs and other seafood. It's a little more boring, but also because the price is MUCH cheaper. Then they have weeknight buffets and then the weekend seafood buffet. I love the weekend seafood buffet because they have snow crab legs (hot and cold), raw oysters (which are just eh-- but they're raw oysters and you're in Vegas, you can expect them to be fresh LOL), shrimp, paella, etc. There's a bunch of dishes that you can't find during the rest of the week.

There's an incredible selection of food. I usually start at the end with the pizzas and salads. By the time I'm halfway through the line my plate is full and overflowing. I always get prime rib, but that's partly because I want to get my money's worth in food. Whenever I come for the seafood buffet, my boyfriend and I get at least one full plate of crab legs, piled high like a mountain. 

I never eat the sushi there or the Asian food, but that's also because I feel like it's a waste of precious stomach real estate when you eat orange chicken and eggrolls at a buffet like this.

There's a huge dessert selection as well. I don't like the desserts as much as I like Wicked Spoon's desserts. Their gelato's just ok, but I always get some because I can't say no to ice cream lol. They have a lot of dessert shooter type things in mini cups that are just okay as well. Their creme brulee's not bad though.

Tout d'abord, le restaurant à l'air de miser sur la quantité de nourriture afin de donner une impression de bien-manger à ces clients.

Celui-ci était très copieux voir trop et a empêcher une partie des convives à apprécier à sa juste valeur le plat principal, ce qui était bien malheureux.
Deuxième point négatif, et non des moindres, les allergies alimentaires qui ont été signalées lors de la réservation n'ont pas été prises en compte le soir même. Heureusement, pas de drame, mais cela laisse un peu un goût amer sur l'organisation.
Pour finir, le dessert n'a pas du tout été à la hauteur du reste du repas. De la glace presque liquide a été servi sur un plateau à partager en bois (c'est de le concept du restaurant), soit aurait-il fallu la servir vraiment glacée soit dans des bols individuels pour nous éviter un service personnel laborieux du à la liquidité de la glace.

ALso ordered the spicy tuna roll and I also enjoyed that but as Eric mentioned back in February of 2014, they had run out of ginger. Makes me think that they just plain do not serve ginger. We also really enjoy fried tofu but they serve theirs in a bowl of juice. I forget what they call it but it is appetizer #5. Maybe that's the way it gets served back home, but I prefer to be able to dip it while eating instead of having it get all soggy. I will probably never go back to eat but all in all, it's not that bad. For 2 small smoothies, soggy tofu and a roll without ginger I could of spent my $20.+ better somewhere else.",2014-07-14 03:14:24

It doesn't look like a lot when you first open the container but it's bigger than you think.

Their pizza is also very good but head's up - it's not premade so it takes about 15 minutes. Make sure you have enough time to wait. Their bakery items are also really yummy.

The set-up seems a little confusing for people but the staff is friendly. This place definitely makes airport food not only bearable but actually enjoyable.",2013-10-24 22:54:03

The menu is very interesting. Some items seem high priced but others don't. I had the heirloom spinach salad and it was good. My concern is that I think it was over complicated but it was different. I had the appetizer mussels as a main course. I couldn't have eaten more so it is just as well. The others also tried combinations of soup, salads and/or appetizer and seemed happy. None of us tried an entree which we can try another time. Nobody had room for dessert. The wine list was decent though the three of us who were drinking all ended up with a decent, fairly priced petite sirah. Eventually we were talked into buying a bottle though there is no price advantage. The staff was all very nice and the waitress helpful except when things got busy and we didn't hear from her at a time we needed her. No doubt we will be back.

I had not been here in a Because it was so cold out, I ordered the oden, okonomyaki, and oyakodon.  ""Okonomyaki will take 20 minutes""  Really?  Are they that busy with the other two tables that the okonomyaki will take that long?  My brothers odered sushi and the spicey pork ramen, while my sister ordered some udon.  

My brother who ordered the sushi and sashimi was the smart one.  The restaurant might have been out of tea this night, but they sure as heck were not low on salt!  I didn't think drinking a salt lick was possible, yet here it was.  The oden was incredibly salty.  Good thing I guess, that I had hot water instead of tea since I had to pour my entire cup of hot water into the oden to dilute the saltiness.  I thought the oden might have been a fluke, but sadly no....my sister's udon, my youngest brother's pork ramen, even the oyakodon and accompanying miso soup were just grossly over salted.  Sure enough, the okonomyaki did take a while to come.  When it did, boy, it was obvious why it took so long: they had to bake it!  It was a two layer cake, it was so thick.  A think layer of green onion and cabbage sandwiched in between two thick layers of cake.  At least it wasn't too salty, I know that is not saying much.

Our bridesmaid dresses were supposed to be in no later than March 2017.  We ordered them a week before Thanksgiving in 2016. The bride could never get a straight answer from them as to when they would be in. They arrived the last week in April. They wouldn't give her a tracking info. The employees don't know what's going on. They have terrible communication amongst one another. They offered to give us a discount on the alterations. There is no way we would trust them to do the alterations. We probably would not get the dress back in time for the wedding. My advice to anyone who orders a dress from them is to tell them that their wedding is a month before it actually is. The dresses are also very cheaply made. They look like they are about to fall apart. We paid a lot of money for these.,2017-05-01 00:11:44

The next time came, so I took the fiancée there on a Thursday night for Rebel Bingo.  While we had reasonable expectations about the Act based on Yelp reviews and the wild and wonderful photos we'd seen online, however, we had very little idea about what Rebel Bingo was going to be about.  As nightclub venues go, the Act is much smaller than your average Vegas megaclub, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It's a distinctive looking space with an overall vibe that is possibly best described as Grand Guignol.  

The Act was a lot like other dance clubs with go go dancers and overpriced, uninspired drinks at the bar.  Rebel Bingo was a special event and it was your not so typical, drunken Brit-conceived, fun and an enjoyable time.  I know the fiancée had a good time...which would've been so much better had we won the slushie machine.

Hubby had a brilliant last minute idea of a date night this past Wed morning. We had been wanting to go to Charcut for awhile and he was able to get a table by booking on line for the same day which was surprising! 

We met downtown and inside we went! I love when there is a hostess actually standing AT the hostess stand and the amazing service started here! The hostess took my hubby's jacket and we were seated at table 63 where I was metres from the open style kitchen. My husband, knowing I am a huge foodie, Food Network fan AND Top Chef fan said, ""Yep, there she is!"" I looked up and there was Connie with a smile on her face waving to us! I managed to keep my composure, yes, I was a little star struck and sat myself down properly in our little booth and did not hit the floor as my heart did stop for a mili-second! We had about 5 waiters come to our table throughout the night and I just loved feeling like we were appreciated customers!

The night started off with a choice of natural or sparkling water - nice touch, and I did not see the sparkling water added at all to our bill. This is not a place we found that nickels and dimes the customer. The restaurant works together in all areas to make sure you have a wicked overall experience! 

Connie HERSELF brought us a stunning plate of thinly sliced cured meats and fish crocettes to start. HOW NICE! She must have talked to us for 15 min, wondering what our story was and telling us how she was doing as I had 40 questions! None of the Top Chef fame has gone to her head whatsoever. She is personable, down to earth and really added to our dining experience! That gift plate from the kitchen was very special. Next up, we ordered the heirloom beet plate. I am so glad they had this for me to try as the menu changes DAILY and you just never know what they will add/take off the menu. The beets and greens were to die for and everything was seasoned beautifully and the greens were not overdressed. YUM! 

Moving on, we had the infamous duck fat poutine as we just HAD TO and I am so glad we did. The portion size was large! Just perfect for 2 people, a poutine unlike I have ever had before. Perfection from the still-crispy fries, to the LARGE pieces of curds to that gravy that made the dish. 

Then we ordered the steak which was served on a cool cutting board complete with the large steak knife sticking out of it. On the board also was my pasta dish that was covered in sumptuous baby clams and BACON! We were somehow able to eat almost everything with the promise to myself that the next day I would not eat ANYTHING to make up for it, haha! The steak was seasoned perfectly. I can see how some may say that the meats are salty here but I love, love, love how they prepped everything. I know if I come back here, the food will be consistent and just as great. 

The restaurant is a roasthouse whose mission statement is just evolving simple ingredients. I love this point of view. The restaurant also focuses on family style eating so being a whole bunch of people with you, you will be well taken care of and you will leave full! 

Our water glasses were always kept full and I was impressed with the wine list. I had 2 glasses of an incredible Malbec that made my meal sing even more! Speaking of lists, I appreciated the fact that the menu was not a 100 page book. One simple sheet, front and back is all that is needed. You know then that the ingredients will be fresh and the chefs get very good at the dishes that they do prep.

Not dessert people normally but we had to round the meal out with something sweet, right? We had a choice of 3 things - we opted for the blueberry cheesecake which came in a little mason jar. So original and so deelish! Connie brought this out to us herself and also on the dessert plate laid 2 still-warm chocolate chip cookies like grandma would make! :) Congratulations was written in chocolate on our white plate as she had heard that we were recently married. :) Sweet! Connie works very hard, only taking Sunday off. She is even present for lunches and there is a very cool place for people to sit and watch the chefs in action at the kitchen bar. I will be going to lunch here as I am dying to try some other menu items and the soup that they serve mid-day.

The restaurant is hip, urban but not at all pretentious. Everyone makes you feel at home, including Connie's husband Jean-Francois who seems like such a nice guy! I was lucky enough to be able to chat with him too!

Everything here just seems to run so smoothly and the staff nails the little things for the meal which I feel is so important.

I could go on and on but I won't - other than to say that we found the prices so reasonable for what we got that we will be back here on a monthly basis.

We went on a weekday evening around 745-800pm, only had to wait about 10 mins for 2 people. They had a notice asking you to ""check-in"" with the receptionist. You should stay put and wait inside rather than outside the store as if your name was called a few times and no answer, they would pass on to the next person. There's a coat hanger at the front to keep your jacket out of the smoke. We were seated at the back of the restaurant, the A/C was quite chilly. 

It required a bit of a wait once you ordered from a selection of meats. It was not a lot of choices but the qualities were definitely better than other table BBQ and they were also a bit thicker cuts too. The only issue was the beef tongue, they were paper thin!! I would like to taste the beef flavour, thank you very much. Also, the store has their special marinate beef with miso. The marinate was tasty and sweet, but I would much rather cook that on a Korean table BBQ as the sauce would not catch fire as it dripped and burn the meat. My boyfriend almost burnt his hand.

Upon arrival, a busser tried to seat us, and had a problem understanding that we were a party of 9 apparently due to a language barrier, but it was quickly straightened out and we were seated in short order.

Warm bread with real salt butter was quickly brought to the table for our enjoyment. None of us wanted an appetizer, though they have a very nice list of them, and 8 of us opted for the salad bar, while one opted for soup. The salad bar was small but nicely laid out. I must say that I had the best beets of my life there, and another of our party said she had the most wonderful green beans she had ever eaten. Kudos for the nice start to our meal!

Our waitress came back to the table to tell us about the evening's specials. 3 of us ordered the Pork Osso Bucco from the special menu. Others ordered Jagerschnitzel, Weinerschnitzel, and one ordered a plate of scallops. A few of the items on the menu were not in keeping with German/Bavarian food, but it was all quite tasty.

All portions were big; big enough to satisfy the biggest appetite! The Osso Bucco was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone tender, and with a terrific, silky smooth sauce from the cooking with mushrooms in it.

All the schnitzels were properly pounded out thin, and just about completely covered the plates. The only word for them is huge. Companions all pronounced them to be excellent. The companion that ordered the scallops pronounced them to be perfect. 

Most of our party took home a doggy bag, though I seriously doubt any of the dogs would get a bite of this hearty food. Dessert was unanimously Apple Strudel. It was different than any apple strudel I have ever eaten, and was not the highlight of the meal, though the sauce it was swimming it was heavenly. I probably could have ordered and drank an entire cup of the sauce!

Other reviewers have mentioned slow service in their reviews, but we found the pace of service to be just right. A constant stream of guests were seated while we were there and it did not seem to have an effect on the service.
The place was clean, and the only dings were that the ladies room needs to be spiffed up a bit, and the A/C needs to be turned down a degree or two.

But I came for one of their opening lunches where we got to try a lot of dishes and was blown away and pleasantly surprised! I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.

The Crispy Shrimp Napoli appetizer totally blew me away. Never in a million years would I believe that I would crave a fried shrimp app and drive halfway across the city to eat it, but this absolutely did. It's somehow light and crispy but paired with this rich unidentifiable but totally delicious red pepper/tomato cheesy creamy sauce and arugula. My party called it Crack Shrimp. The beef carpaccio also was absolutely delicious and admittedly even better than my favorite non-chain Italian place. Antipasto is also nice.

For mains, my pick is the Shrimp Fra Diavolo for the top menu item. It's not ultra spicy like some Fra Diavolo, so don't let it scare you off. It's also a bit creamier like a Vodka sauce, but not too creamy. It was absolutely tender and delicious. I also really enjoyed the marsala mushroom sauce over  the marsala chicken and mashed potatoes. 
We got to sample the chicken off the gluten free menu and didn't care for it - it didn't have enough sauce to it and was too bland and also didn't care for the sweet potatoes. But I appreciated that they had GF options and might opt for something else from the GF or light menu. I can't speak to the desserts because I haven't tried them. I look forward to trying their weekend brunch menu because there are such limited options around town for brunch, and I love a fritatta!

My favorite part (Attention parents!!) is that I saw a family with kids get some raw pizza dough to ""make their own pizza"" and they fire it up in the brick oven which is a super cute way to keep kids occupied before food comes. I thought it was a nice touch, and smart in such a family-oriented neighborhood like South Charlotte.

The service has been super friendly. Bottom line- It's a good value and love the outdoor area, especially where you can people watch and listen to weekend entertainment! 

Sidenote: For people who commented that Bravo doesn't have authentic Italian, I would challenge you to find a restaurant here that does. No, not Villa Antonio, not Vivace, certainly not godawful Maggiano's or Carabbas. I just returned from Italy and was struck by the simplicity of the best dishes we ate there like Cacio y Pepe which is really simple pasta, olive oil, salt pepper and a little cheese which is ridiculously good, but you just won't find something that simple here. So let's just consider them all Italian-American, OK? So the bottom line is for a chain, Italian-American, Bravo's my fave.",2014-07-28 13:21:08

First of all I misunderstood, I thought this was a real sit down hibachi, so maybe that's where my disappointment began but at the same time I was excited to have my food to go to go eat in front of a TV lol. 

I ordered 2 chicken teriyaki meals. He wouldn't allow me to have them served with fried rice, why? I don't know. So I ordered the side of fried rice, an additional $10. The chicken, was horrible, poor quality meat. The seasoning itself was fine, but the cuts of the chicken were very chewy, and stringy, if that makes sense. 
The fried rice was horrendous, I'm sorry. There was pork bits that ruined the entire taste of the rice. I am not totally against pork but the way they cooked this with the rice was just down right gross. 
I will say the side salad that comes with the teriyaki meals was great. The vegetables were again just gross. No wear near what I typically find at a hibachi place. (Ohjah) 

I ordered a teriyaki salmon meal as well, and I wish I could give you a review on it, as they forgot to cook this and send it out with the rest of my order. 

I ordered a crunchy roll and a Vegas roll, the crunchy roll was worth the price and pretty good. The Vegas simply had so much on top it was over bearing, but I won't say it was bad as I am not a sushi expert. 

So for 3 teriyaki meals, and 2 orders of sushi my total came to $74 and some change. $74??????? I was so caught off guard when he told me this but of course I paid in hopes I would really enjoy this meal. Sadly I got home and discovered I didn't receive my salmon, which I will say to their credit they told me I could come back and grab or whenever I wanted. But I think if a customer is paying 80 bucks (more or less) for a few things, maybe we should check and make sure they receive their meals.

Service was great, or at least our waitress had an amazing nice shaped arse which made up for some of the otherwise poor dining experience. 

On to the food - wifey ordered a steak and it was so tough she couldn't chew it. We were going to send it back but it took them too long to notice -- on the plus side, they took it off our bill and apologized. Thanks +1 star for that.

There are TVs on, not loud. There is music, also not so loud, it's just overall loud as hell  and I don't mean because of the constant barge of yeehaws or call/response for birthdays.  I don't know if it's bad acoustics or what, but if I were a sound engineer I'd map that place out, then do something to dampen the noise.

I ordered a ribeye, medium rare. On the plus side, it was cooked perfectly. However, although these are hand picked and carved, I guess they cut corners better than meat, or maybe the chef missed this was about half fat which I had to trim off, along with stringy parts I wasn't able to cut.

Evidence of a bad slice left for the waitress to see, she got a good look but stayed silent as she removed my plate at the end. Not a question ""Did you enjoy your steak? Was it cooked well? Did it taste ok? Was it a bit too fat?"" None of that. -1 star there.

Drink menu has a few fruity cocktails and margaritas, beer selection awful unless you like commercial lager/pilsner in a frozen glass, then go ahead. They were out of the seasonal Sam Addams brew so Boston Lager was the thing and it tasted stale, also served in a chilled mug. I happen to like the taste of beer, don't mask it with ice cold containers please.

For a steakhouse, some darker brews compliment the meat. (Point here: Texas Roadhouse doesn't have them). Try a Guinness or a porter, really. Room temperature glass. You'll thank me. You're welcome. Every other bar in the area has at least a few locally produced ales and usually given in a proper glass. It's a science like wine, different shapes for different tastes. Keep the cans of cheap beer for hot summer days where you don't care how many or how often you drain them. Nuff said.

Parking is decent though at times odd because of the way these places are right angled along 75th, you may have to circle around or use adjacent parking for Desert Sky Mall. 

Tip: They have lunch/early dinner specials so come earlier to get in on that or for when it's less crowded.

Note to management or brand owners: I really really want to like Texas Roadhouse, and not just for the cute staff. Please fix the problems with the food and the beer selection, so we can enjoy the full experience like a Texas Roadhouse is supposed to be.",2016-06-13 17:19:17

Mexican food is our favorite so we gave this place a try. It sits above a seafood restaurant in Market Square. We were given a table at the windows which was nice. We could watch the shoppers walking by 
We were waited on immediately. We ordered drinks along with chips and salsa. The chips were tasty and a nice carrier for the salsa. The salsa had a great flavor. 
I ordered the Burrito Cancun. It had steak and shrimp. There was poco, lettuce and sour cream on the side. The hubby ordered chicken enchiladas. He had green sauce on half and red sauce on half so we could try both. His enchiladas came with refreshed beans and rice. 
I took one bite of my burrito and I was in heaven. I'm not sure how they treated or cooked the steak but it packed a big punch of flavor. It was also very tender. It was excellent. 
I tried my husband's enchiladas. I thought I would like the green sauce better but was surprised that I preferred the red. The chicken, like the steak in my burrito, was flavorful and tender. The enchiladas were spicy but you began to have a slow after burn in your mouth. It was the perfect heat.

Food came and distracted me a little from awful chairs.

Our service was a little slow, but friendly and efficient. I mean, it was Saturday night. Lots of people sitting around drinking and not ordering food.  :-(

We started with the Reuben Egg Rolls. Life changing. These were so amazing. Filled with corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut and fried to golden perfection. Served with 1000 Island-- I honestly could have made a great meal out of the Appetizers.
the Mister ordered the Bacony Goodness Burger and it earned it's name. Lots of thick bacon, thick cheesy sauce and an expertly grilled burger patty. His only complaint was that it was finished too quickly.

A lot of the people that used to come here all the time no longer do so. One of my best friends is permanently banned. I am sure that Edison's is making pretty good profit now however. It just saddens me. I guess like Black Sabbath said, ""I am going through changes"". I will always look back on the many days and nights that I spent at Edison's with the fondest of memories.

Since it was happy hour, let's start with the drink, if any one knows me they know Moscow Mules are my go to drink but Thirsty Lion kicked up a notch with their Spicy Mule, Smirnoff Vodka, ginger beer, lime juice, simple syrup, lime wedge and freshly sliced jalapenos, oh man this drink was amazing! Loved it! If you don't like spicy things, stay away from the Spicy Mule, because those jalapenos, they get all infused in the drink, so dang good!

Now for the food:  Pulled Pork Sliders, Traditional Scotch Egg, Sautéed Brussels Sprouts,  Bacon Wrapped BBQ Prawns, Bacon Wrapped Dates, who doesn't love BACON!!!!   

Pulled Pork Sliders were great and since it was up for the offering I tried a Scotch egg, a hardboiled egg wrapped in pork sausage lightly breaded & fried, can't say I would order them again, but not saying I didn't like them, it was a little bland for me, and honestly I'm not a fan of sausage (but love me some bacon!!). The bacon wrapped bbq prawns, oh my gosh! Yum!! oh and the sautéed Brussels sprouts, oh my! They were sautéed with pepper bacon, red onions, olive oil & Reggiano Cheese, these are the way Brussels Sprouts should always be! I was tickled pinked to see the bacon wrapped dates because I had been craving them!!  They were medjool dates stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese & almonds wrapped in maple pepper bacon, these guys are just heavenly!! I could make a dinner out of them.

I hadn't been to this location previously, although I had visited the Canyon Creek up by Roy Thomson Hall several times before. Finding the Front Street location was a bit of a trick, as it seems to be down a small stairway off the street and can be easily missed if you're not paying attention.

Things got off to a shaky start when we had to wait quite a long time for service. Though we were well aware that it was going to be busy (this was just after a Jays game, which we had just come from as well), there was a good half-hour lull between the time the waitress brought out drinks and the time she came to take our orders. Not to mention that one of my friends got a sticky glass for their beer (we're assuming they handled it after making a mixed drink), and we were a bit surprised that other groups were coming and going before us.

But boy, did they sure come through big once our orders were taken. I had a Garden Burger with a Caesar salad. That just might be the best veggie burger I've ever had. You almost couldn't tell that it wasn't real meat. Packed full of toppings and dripping like no tomorrow, it had me stuffed and satisfied by the end of it.

Half our group also had the prix-fixe menu, and what I tried from them (the garden salad, the pan-seared salmon and the creme brulee, the last of which was given to me because one of our members had to leave early) was all on point and flavorful.

We also had a... special discount, which came in very handy at the end of the meal and knocked off a substantial portion of the bill. I realize it shouldn't factor into my experience, but I'm pointing it out all the same.

They also have a weird habit of putting way too much ice in their soft drinks. It was hardly more than a small cup's worth of actual soda, and a good two-thirds ice. I had to tell the waitress that I wanted no ice in my drink, which she argued a little about but eventually acquiesced to. Tone your ice game down, please.

This location is a worthy successor to the King Street CC I visited in the past, and besides a couple little points (mainly, handling crowd flow on busy days), I'll definitely be coming back in the near future. One of my new favorite restaurants at the south end of the city.

It had a very cozy ambience with friendly service.  Oh and how cute!  Lola actually picked up the phone to take my reservation!  

Here's the spotlight on the food =)
1.  Charbroiled Oysters - ""Fresh Oysters charbroiled the Cresent City way, with lots of garlic, lemon and a blend of cheeses.""  Usually I shy away from any cooked type of half shell oysters suspicious that it is the stuff that they're trying to hide the unfreshness of with cooking it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with my favorite robust flavors of garlic and cheese and the lovely toasted slices of french bread
2.  Crab Cakes - ""Lump Crab in Lola's special blend of spices, pan fried and served w/Lemon-garlic Aioli.""  This is not the usual crab cake you'd expect.  It seems to be 99% crab meat.  Not crispy but very crab meaty.
3. Fried Oyster Po Boy on New Orlean's French Bread fully dressed, meaning that it comes with all the slaw glory.  I love po boys!  I enjoyed the deep fried goodness of the oyster with the slaw a bam of hot sauce.  bam bam!
4.  Jambalaya with chicken, sausage and shrimp - fluffy flavorful rice 
5.  Etouffee - a cross between a roast and a gumbo.  Gravylicious

Dessert!
1.  Louisiana chocolate sheath cake - the cake was very light but every bite was a chocolate dream.  We made it a la mode with praline icecream and it was perfect!
2.  Bananas Foster - loved the flavor, but hated the mushiness.  I've had others where it was not so mushy.

I was contacted by the wash and asked to give them another chance; I did today. Nothing changed, I waited 35 minutes while 3 or 4 others behind me got completed. I had to walk up to one of the guys in the red shirt to find out why it was still sitting there.

They proceeded to put someone on it and instead of dry it, he put tire dressing all over my tires, bumpers and flares. Something I always ask them to never do since its a jeep for God sake. I purchased the works, so they clearly had no idea what was included.

I waited another 20 minutes while they finished and when it was done, the back window had not been cleaned and the front bumper and grill was full of dirt. No apologies for the wait and no attention to detail.

The spiked milkshakes will call out to you, what could be better than liquor in a milkshake, right? To me that just equals to a long night in Vegas, so I moved on.

We went with their Steakhouse burger and to try something I wouldn't expect on their menu we shared a Kalbi Beef quesadilla. The burger was good, not great, with a nice layer of black pepper on the beef, steak sauce, and choice of cheese.

He was nice but was lacking in skills. You know the part where the Teppan chef demonstrates his knife skills? This guy basically banged the stove and made a lot of noises but really didn't do anything. The owner was also not Japanese. He was Korean. The stove itself was smaller than your normal Teppan place. It only seated about 6 people as oppose to other places where you can seat about 10 people. We were there on a Sunday Night about 6:00 PM and our table was the only one being used. The place is also about 5 miles from the Strip so be prepare to drive a while through the non-Vegas part of town. 

Here is good part. The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and it was unbelievably tasty. The portions were ample. We both could not finish our dinners and I can eat a lot. They used a ""pink sauce"" which is basically butter, garlic and food coloring. It sounds gross but it made the fried rice very tasty. The service was pretty good. The other waiters kept coming around to make sure we had our drinks. The price was very good despite being in Vegas. You can have a steak Teppan dinner for about $24.00. 

Overall, this is a decent place if you are in Vegas and you're sick of buffets and fancy restaurants that are ridiculously expensive. If you are new to Teppan, it would be impressive. If you are used to Benihana-types of restaurants, this place may not measure up.",2017-06-19 17:50:37

Casino-I got lost in this casino because it's so large and the decor is amazing. You walk in and it screams luxury and high class. I felt very booshie in this place. Table minimums were kinda high. Lots of slots to choose from. Definitely a good casino to gamble in. I lost a lot of $$$ here. fML

Hotel/ accommodations-check in was quick, resort fee includes wifi around the property, pool was amazing and not packed and loud like other casinos. Hotel decor is very updated and eye popping, my eyes couldn't help but look at how everything is beautifully decorated.

Rooms-my fav in Vegas. Room is big, about 400 sq feet. Comfortable bed and pillows, electric curtains and shades, a tablet that is wireless in the room controls everything (tv, lighting, mood lighting, phone, room service, hotel requests, etc) bathroom was the best. Private toilet area to take a dump and explode, double sinks with TV, shower and hot tub joined. I could get a little crazy in the bathroom.

Staff- so friendly, we passed 3 employees walking to the room and all said hello and if we needed anything extra. M life front desk even called us in the room and asked if everything is up to expectations.  Luxurious!

Our steaks were good.  The meat was tender; it was seasoned; the meat texture was good.  It felt good chewing the meat!  It was, however, not cooked properly.  I ordered rare doneness, and the steak turned out to be blue to rare.  My BF ordered medium doneness, and the steak was medium rare to medium well.  I suspect that the heat of grill is not even.  Overall, the grill did not make the steaks perfect, but it didn't totally ruin them.  Just in case they would overcook your steak, I would suggest ordering on the rarer side of your preference.

The pricing was unbelievably low.  A 12 oz Delmonico steak with mashed potato was $13.99, a 12 oz prime rib with roasted potatoes was $16.99, a side lettuce salad was $1.99 and domestic beer costed $4.  The side salad was fresh, but it didn't worth the price.  I would suggest to skip it when the cashier takes your order.  They have other steak specials for T-bone steaks, rib steaks, lamb chops, etc..  

The ambiance was shockingly bad.  My BF literally halted his steps at the door until I pushed my way through.  Sure they could have used better light bulbs, right?  A coat of paint would be really nice, but I got the feeling that it was wishful thinking.

Since I like my steak, and the value blows me away, Master Steaks earns a 4-star rating on my book.  If you care about the ambiance, it is a 1-star restaurant, though.  This is a place where you dine with people who won't judge you for eating there, such as your family and your long-term friends.

Nothing special about the menu but everything is good. The Chicago burger, with its blue cheese, is a personal favorite. The bar features the usual selection of domestics and imports as well as specialty liquor.

This is not really a kid-friendly environment but there is nothing to suggest they shouldn't attend. Because the bar is more intertwined with the restaurant and the waitresses are usually minimally dressed, Cooper's Town might make a better impression on the younger ones. The food is better there too.",2008-12-16 06:05:17

I was wandering around Mill Ave with my friends and we were looking for a place around midnight that was still open for food. Overall I'm happy to report that the Greek/Mediterranean food here was better than expected especially with the restaurant being open until the early hours of the morning daily.

The lady (owner?) was extremely nice and patient with us as we were trying to figure out what to order. I ended up getting the Chicken Shawarma Pita which was great and what made it especially good was that the meat was cooked to perfection. It was extremely tasty and adding the Tzatziki sauce was a nice touch.

I would definitely come back here again for late night food on Mill Ave and will recommend my friends to check it out as well if they're in the area. If I do end up trying some of their other offerings I will update this review accordingly.",2015-11-21 03:43:53

Our server was very attentive. It was almost like dining at a fine dining restaurant. The one thing that I found was that their menu is very limited. However, the menu was really unique, and the portion was actually very generous and tasty. The experience was above most of the restaurants in the local restaurants and maybe even than the ones in the strip. 

We ordered the emperial rolls and pork belly.
The rolls were very unique and the sauce drizzled was very well-balanced with the crispy rolls. All the garnished veggies on the side went well with the dish as well. I would say it is a great appetizer to go with white wines. Also, their pork belly is a must try. The meat was really tender and the rice was very flavorful as well. I loved every single part of the dish. 

Everything is well- balanced in the dish and the menu; the only reason why I would deduct one star is because their menu selection. I hope they would elaborate it a little more. I will come back again to try out their hh oysters!",2017-06-18 19:13:07

NoDa is like the OG Gangster of Charlotte Breweries; they've been there, done that and make some hardcore flagship beers. I've been drinking their beers for years but never had the opportunity to step into their beer making domain! If you like beer and haven't heard of CAVU, Jam Session, Hop Drop and Roll, or Coco Loco you have in fact been living in a cave. Although, I've not had a chance to taste any of their white whales, I have enjoyed a growler or two of Ramble on Red and Woody and Wilcox. Last fall I went to a NoDa beer pairing dinner at Wolfgang Puck's that was amazing; not only was it paired, but the food was also made with the beers. The gelato and spice cake were made with their incredible Gordgeous Pumpkin Ale; unreal deliciousness. Their beer is an easy 5 and their dark taproom (aka the batcave) is a 4.

That is my only problem with this pool, I have never been able to lounge on the fake beach because every square inch is covered with kids and crying babies.

The piri-piri sauce was pretty good, although a little bit on the tame side. Even the super hot was what I would only call medium. I will say that to be fair, I'm more used to South American piri-piri sauce, so that might just be a cultural difference.

She comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate (a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes)  If the egg was for me, I would have sent it back.  But it's for a baby and I would have cooled it down before I fed him.  

The food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order.  If we wanted water or extra napkins, I got up and got it myself.  

This isn't my first rodeo.  My wife had her baby shower here on a Sunday and we got the same crappy service.  I need to remind myself to stop coming here on Sundays.",2010-08-29 20:43:20

I've had my eye on the place since it opened (I used to love Coco Osteria), but I never managed to make it there til Saturday night. The fella and I decided to go for dinner and made reservations for 6:30. As others have noted, it's a pretty small place, so reservations are highly recommended.

I usually don't like such cramped quarters because I feel like everyone around me is listening to my conversation, but at Malabar, the music and people are so lively that I didn't mind at all. Our service was impeccable.

So, why only 3 stars? The food. Sigh. We made it a night of tapas and tried the croquetas (ham, potato), albondigas (beet meatballs in tomato sauce), vaca frita (crispy beef with pickled onion on top), and romesco (eggplant bruschetta). While it was all fine, it was all just fine. Nothing stood out, nothing had much spice... it was all just, well, fine. I had hoped that out of four tapas, surely one of them would be delicious! But no. I also got the sangria after reading other reviews of how good it was; it was good, but can you really mess up sangria OR make it super great? It was fine, too.

We did try the tres leches cake for dessert (after asking out waitress to pick between that and the churros), and it was good - small but the perfect size for not gorging, moist, and creamy.

Thankfully, the atmosphere and service made up for the food, but I don't think we'll make it a point to stop by Malabar again.",2014-03-16 23:33:07

I came here for a friend's birthday with about 30 other people. I think the first impression I got while they were seating us was Wow, this place looks a lot bigger on the inside than the outside (TARDIS effect perhaps? Hahaha) 

When I go to any English pub, I always look for the pot pies or yorkshire pudding (yorkies). They are a staple of any pub, and you rarely go wrong with meat pies. I got a yorkie myself, and I was quite disappointed. The crust was overcooked and they used sliced beef instead of cubes of steak. The overcooked crust threw me off, even though the flavours were alright. It definitely didn't measure up to other yorkies I've had before. The pot pies however, were much better and definitely would have been a better choice. 

The cost of food here is around $10-15 for a dish, typical for pub food.

They have a good variety of beers on tap, so you'll be able to find something to drink.  

It definitely has the feel of a more classic pub while trying, with wooden wall mouldings. The pub itself like I mentioned earlier is really big. It's great for large parties and has a nice ambience.

The service here is friendly and courteous.

This place is a good pub and it has its merits, most of the food was good, but next time I'm not ordering a yorkie. Still a nice place to catch a game or have a pint.",2017-03-28 15:17:25

Inside is upscale Asian with running water on the back wall over a fountain.  Inside the restaurant are tables along a wall.  Where pillows lined the booth portions of the table along walls.  It's pretty nice.

I ordered the Shrimp curry noodle soup.  I was told the chef prepared a complimentary shrimp bisque for me to try first.  Usually when I visit a restaurant with something complimentary I get a sample.  This was an actual bowl of soup.  The broth was a bit thin for bisque, but the flavor packed a punch.  Rich cream, butter, shrimp.  Smalls bits of shrimp were in the soup throughout.  I'm not going to complain since it's free.  It was very good.

The Shrimp curry noodle soup was served with a soup spoon and chopsticks.  This soup was loaded!  There were at least 6 large (21/25 count) shrimp, red bell pepper, onion, sprouts, mushrooms, noodles, and a lemon wedge with cilantro on top.  The bowl was huge.  I couldn't eat it all.  The broth was piping hot and rich.  The curry melded with rich seasonings.  Ginger, coconut.  Simply delicious.  This broth was a bit thin as well.  I can easily overlook that for the flavors exploding out of the bowl.

This is your standard Keg restaurant only it is located in a HUGE mansion, making for an amazing ambiance and a gorgeous setting. I went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, we were a group of 15 and since they don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays we were certainly in for a long wait (we were told about an hour). After our wait had exceeded an hour and we asked for an update we were told we would be seated shortly and the manager would do something for us. Figuring our group was on the verge of starvation (which we were) the manager came to us with a plate of canopies topped with a goat cheese bruschetta, absolutely delicious! A few minutes later she comes with a giant plate of fully loaded nachos, and these may have been some of the best nachos I have ever had! Loaded with lots of cheese (and high quality cheese at that) made them warm and very gooey, lots of jalapenos added a nice kick, I would definitely order these when I go back! 
 
When we were finally seated everybody seemed to enjoy their food. It's the standard Keg menu so you are guaranteed a good steak. I had the French Onion soup to start and this was mind-blowing! So much cheese on top that was perfectly melted without being greasy, the broth was very rich and had a good beef flavour while the onion added a nice sweetness. I have never had a bad steak at the keg, and this occasion was no different. New York strip was cooked to perfection and was so tender it practically melted in my mouth, this time I tried it cooked ""Chicago style"" (meaning it is charred on the outside and cooked to order inside). This added a nice charred crust to the steak and actually did a better job of sealing in the juices; this cooking style is definitely worth a try. For sides I always go for the twice baked potato; bacon, cheese, and baked potato how could you go wrong? 
 
This place gets bonus marks for letting our huge group split the bills and not adding an automatic gratuity (which most restaurants do for large groups). Definitely a great place to go with a large group, on a special occasion, or simply for a nice dinner. Overall great food, beautiful restaurant and good service!

The pasta was super fresh tasting and the accompaniments were perfect- it included broccolini, asparagus, tomatoes, baby carrots, a lemony sauce and feta cream.

The food was awesome -- everyone had good things to say about their chosen dishes, including my vegetarian friends who ordered a bunch of the veggie side dishes and really loved them. I personally ordered the wedge with chicken added and it was great. from other plates I tried the pulled pork mac and cheese, burger, cauliflower side, potatoes and probably some other stuff.

I've seen the place while driving by but never thought anything much because this specific location has been taken over by so many different businesses over the years I didn't want to get my heart set on the spot and then see it go. To hear that Sammy's has been here for three years brings comfort knowing they will be here to stay (fingers crossed). I decided to give it a try after reviewing all the great yelp reviews instead of just going to another fast food joint. I am so glad that I did. I had a hamburger with french fries and a drink. May I mention our order was pick up and still tasted great when we ate at home. The amount of French fries served was extremely generous. We had so much left over that we threw them in the oven the next day for dinner. The hamburger patty itself tasted grilled fresh and not a run of the mill kind which sets them apart. Definitely, on my list now for a good burger but, that's not all that's served here. They have a breakfast menu and Fish Friday's.

First off, the. Restaurant itself is great...it's so clean inside, the employees are really friendly, and they have indoor and outdoor seating. I would say the inside decor is somewhat hippish but it's not so overboard that you feel awkward if that's not your thing. It's very inviting inside and they have some near artwork up. 

Secondly, the food!!!! Amazing! I got the a avocado and basil sandwich but instead of bread got it wrapped in collard greens. Omg I could not get enough. It had so many different tastes, the most prominent one being freshness! The hummus added a richness to it and even though it's now a lot of food, that definitely helps to feel more full after. Everything from the onions to the sprouts to the tomatoes made this sandwich. And how could you forget the a acacia, yum! I could eat them plain and be satisfied so this only made it that much better! You get a side with every sandwich so I got the kale salad, again deelicious, especially the dressing. 

And then dessert...oh man. Got the berry lemon cheesecake, so good!!!! And again tasted so fresh! I really liked the pecan crust, completely different than ""normal"" cheesecake but it almost felt healthier....almost.

I booked the Drago Sisters after my initial cake tasting. After tasting they moist cake I had, I just could even make my other appointments and cancelled them immediately. I ended up getting 3 different cakes. I got a small 3 tier and a sheet cake. I ended up with Cookie Batter cake/Raspberry Preserves, Carmel Cake/Carmel Sauce, and Marble Cake/Boston Crème Filling. The cake was not only moist but beautiful. Everyone loved the cake so much. I wished that more people got to try the Carmel Cake but the hotel service messed up and didn't serve that tier. Which meant all the immediate family ate the cake two days later while we were still partying on the strip. So not a huge deal as 15 people still got to try it but it would been a big hit during the reception. 
Doreen was very easy to work with, d9irect and to the point. No extra fluff but enjoys being a baker and creating tasty pieces. While my cake spot was reserve, it was the last thing that I actually finalized. Needless to say, by then I was tired of making decisions.

I found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997.

-Pot pie ($8.99)
-Steak and eggs ($8.99)
- Chocolate brownie ($4.99)

The stuffed potato skins were really crispy, they were stuffed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and to my husbands dismay, chives. I have no problem with them but he picked them off. They were served with a side of ranch and sour cream. I had the steak and eggs for my entree and my husband had the chicken pot pie. His pot pie was amazing, it was really rich and creamy. My steak was really tender and juicy, what really stood out were the potatoes, they were well seasoned. I still had a little room for dessert so we went with the brownie, it was loaded with whipped cream, drizzled in chocolate sauce, and topped with ice cream.

This place is very small - they have an outside patio that seats about 11 total.. and 5 more on couches with these almost hideous looking coffee-tables.

We arrived on a Friday (First Friday, which we totally hadn't planned that) and since we didn't know we'd need (nor had we made) reservations, we were seated on a two-person red couch with the ugly coffee-table to eat from.  We were both not big fans of this, but hey, at least we got seated with no reservations (there were a lot of ppl that came after us with no reservations and were turned away.. sucks).

Ordered two beers - they came out quickly.  Ordered 2 entrees: the Market special (which was veal) and the Portuguese Stew.  I had the stew and he had the veal.  His came out quite a bit before mine (didn't care for that) and then when I finally got mine, it was not at all what I expected.  It was *spicy* as all hell (I must've missed that on the menu) and had a lot of seafood and a big tilapia on top... I guess I was expecting a soup.. that's my bad for not knowing that stews and soups are different.

He loved his dish (finished it before me) and I did not care for mine with all the spiciness (I had a runny nose the whole time from the spice).. luckily the server lady asked how I was liking it and I told her the truth but told her I was really hungry so I was just going to eat it. She said sorry, left and came back and said the chef wanted to add extra sauce to tame down the spiciness.. she brought it back quickly and it was heaping with mixed in manchego cheese (though the tilapia I hadn't finished yet was missing now).. the flavor was fabulous.. but it left me wondering about my tilapia.  Maybe he switched the tilapia out for more mussels.. whatever, that's fine.  I was just glad that I could finally eat my meal.. though I ate it alone because, again, his meal had come first and was now gone (I told him not to wait because I knew a freshly hot veal chop would get cold in the patio where we were and would not be as enjoyable).

SO.. alas.. conclusions:
there were several minuses mixed in with some pluses.. I wouldn't say I'd never go back, but it was a good experience and I'd give it another try to see how it would go on another visit.",2012-03-04 21:53:00

I'll walk a dog and anything else a long way to have one of these creative tasty delicious hot dogs.

It all dates back to my childhood when I thought a hot dog, boiled in a pot of water, on an unassuming bun with a squirt of mustard and a dash of ketchup was the best a dog could get.  Then I went to Chicago/New York during my undergrad years only to  discover that more than ketchup and mustard can go on a hot dog and make it taste REAL good.  So, as my hot dog paradigm is making another shift... I want to recognize and give the appropriate YELP-out to Short Leash Dogs!

This place is quite simply Ah-mazing.  They put ""stuff"" together on a hot dog that I never would have imagined putting together across meals in the same day!  But these interesting toppings together  taste sooo good on a hot dog from SLD!  I've had exactly 3 hot dogs from this place and each time I'm amazed that, not only did I like the dog, I LOVED IT!  The most interesting thus far has to be the Bear hot dog.   I had it prepared Naked (that's no bun, 2x the hot dog) with the spicy hot dog.  The bear has Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce on it.  Yes, you read it correctly!  Cracker Jacks and Peanut butter... If this is your first time around the block, I'm sure we had the same first thought - Are they serious?  Oh, but yes... serious as a dog about his bone!   The flavors in the bear meld together in your mouth and the taste bursts with the peanut butter and the cracker jack, just enough salty with the sweet; nutty with the mild flavor of the cheese.  I would recommend this dog to anyone!

When you go, look for the special of the week.  I think upon my next visits, I will always have the special of the week OR I will try my own hand at creating my own dog.  Be sure to try the very delicious fried pickles.  

To boot, the folks working in this food truck are top-notch folks.  I find that most if not all food truck owners/employees are extremely pleasant.

My uncle and I decided to seat ourselves, and still waited. The open sign was on and the time was 11:23 a.m.  I got up to make eye contact again with the guy in the kitchen area. I asked if they were open (Awkward), anyways he went to another part of the restaurant and then an older lady came out and brought us tea and menus. We ordered two beef bulgogi bento boxes, and to start they give you some Korean Banchan. (Small dishes like kimchee, pickled daikon etc.
The Bento box comes with a small cabbage salad, rice, bulgogi, two small springrolls.
The food came out really quickly, which led me to believe that nothing was made fresh.  The bulgogi and rice plus salad were all made ahead of time that's for certain. The only thing that was made fresh was the two mini springrolls.

The space itself is located up a few flights of stairs, and no elevator access. If you have mobility issues, I'd skip this place all together.
To be honest there are a lot of better options for Korean food. Macleod Trail and 17th ave. both have better fresher food.
They do give you a ticket to fill out for a draw for Chinese New Years at the moment. 1st prize is a 65"" Samsung Television. 2nd is  a $100. gift certificate for the restaurant itself.  3rd prize $50 certificate.

I probably won't be back here for Korean. Nothing really wowed me here at all.

But alas, let me start at the beginning.  Our wait was short, just enough time to grab a drink at the bar.  I couldn't resist getting a beer off of the extensive list, but my dinner mates each got cocktails (Beer Sangria!!) that were creative and tasty.  The bartender and hostess were very friendly.

We ordered the following (for real, it was just us 3, don't judge):  Tarte Flambee - classic version, the Cheese Board with chorizo, Asian Chicken Skewers, and Moules Frites - Spicy Creole.  For dessert we ordered these three cream puffs with hazelnut deliciousness inside.  

My absolute favorite dish was the Moules Frites.  You CAN get great mussels in Pittsburgh!  The Creole version had Maytag bleu cheese that melted in your mouth.  The Frites were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  What a treat.  When I come again I'm getting this allllll for me!

My second favorite was the Cheese Board.  I'm a complete sucker for a good Cheese Board and this one had a great mix of cheeses, including one of my favorites, St. Andre's.  

The Skewers and Tarte Flambee were good, although I found the Asian Skewers a bit out of place.  I actually liked the cucumber salad that came with it more than the skewers.  Still wonderfully tender, delicious chicken, though.  The Tarte Flambee was good but it didn't stand out after gorging myself on everything else.  

Service was good, waitresses were attentive and friendly.  

Best of all, our bill was surprisingly lower than what we were expecting.

I started with the lobster and truffle chawana-mushi.  A small portion in a tea cup size contianer, it had rich custard, the custard sides, lobster, and truffle flavors melded well.  The broth was so tasty.

This was a winner too!  The beef was very tender the foie gras was  Everything worked well together and I really enjoyed this dish.

For a second main, I ordered the Wafu carbonara.  The dish is noodles with Slow-bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg. I broke the egg and stirred the noodles and bacon to coat the noodles with the yolk.  A very tasty dish!!  Phillip T, you need to listen to your wife more often.  :)

The fresh pasta is amazing, a personal favorite, and all of the meat dishes are amazing!  The service is amazing as well.  We love that we have a place to actually DINE.  We love the relaxing atmosphere and every staff member treats you like family.  Chef Marc routinely comes out of the kitchen and touches tables.  When you talk to him, his passion for food and his craft is obvious.  From the moment you enter the restaurant and Lucio (the Matre'd) greets you, you feel at home.

It's definitely a gorgeous space. I love the lines, the materials used in the building and the decor.  

As far as food, just did a couple rolls - the hamachi serrano chili roll & the soft shell crab roll. Both were quite good and quite affordable.

With regard to drinks, started with a shochu sampler. It came with honey-comb shochu, grape shochu (I think) and pinenapple shochu. They were all quite good. I definitely enjoyed them all but a couple of folks at the table thought the honey and pineapple versions were a bit sweet. Tasted a friend's tanuki peach. That is a dangerous drink. I'm sure it has shochu in it as advertised but neither of us could detect any alcohol. Could definitely get you in trouble. After that had a glass maze (shochu, lychee juice and ylang-ylang). Not sure what ylang-ylang is but it was quite good. I'm a big fan of lychee. I also tried a friends poochie-poochi (sparkling nigori sake). That was killer as well.

Service in the Shochu Lounge was also quite excellent.

Service: 4.5/5 We were greeted immediately upon entering and asked if we had any questions as we stepped up.  Little overwhelming for a first time visit as they have so many options, but the young asian girl who was our cashier helped us out with descriptions and made us feel comfortable knowing we were rookies.  She signed us up their loyalty program and gave us the immediate 10% discount which we really appreciated.

Drinky Drinks and Waffle Sticks: 4/5  I dig Earl Grey Tea so right off the bat I'm hitting up the Earl Grey Milk Tea and we went 16 oz.  Nephew went with the Hokkaido Milk Tea at 12 oz.  which he loved.  For me, it was a little too sweet but I'm way older so that's probably why. lol  My Early Grey Milk tea was tasty and the Boba worked well with it. 
We tried the waffle sticks with the strawberry and nutella dips which were great compliments to the stick.

Value: 4.5/5 $5.50 for the 16 oz and $4.75 for the 12 oz Milk teas served to us in a cool bottle that you get to keep with a cork top, super cool. 3 waffle sticks at $4.50 plus .50 for each dip.  Taking the bottle home adds to the value of the visit.

Ambiance: 4/5 Small place but seems bigger than it really is with how the furniture and decorations is setup.  A couple tables for group seating, along with some couches, lounge chairs and a counter with chairs.  Cool pieces of art, shelving and background music keeps it hip and chill.  Lots of ""snapping"" and IG uploads were taking place when we were there.  Ok, we were in on the action too. hehe

Summary: So glad there's a boba place less than 2 miles from my house.  I don't have to restrict getting Boba to only when I'm down in the city.  With that, I'll be back trying all the different milk teas and building the bottle collection as long as the drinks stay tasty.  Enjoy...",2017-05-28 02:34:30

First off, they promote green life (grass fed beef, recycling, turning fryer oil into bio fuel, etc.), which is nice, and they have a beautiful joint.  Their customer service is pretty good, but needs more fine tuning, which will more than likely occur in the next few months as they settle in.  Their food, however, is what Yelpers want to hear about, so let's have at it.

Their patties are juicy, well seasoned and tender.  I love the fact that their burgers take maybe 2 minutes to cook fresh with all the trimmings, and that they let you try any toppings you want to add on.  Their buns are nice and aren't too sweet, which is always good.  Overall, the burger itself is yummy.

They have shakes and you can't go wrong with a nice, thick shake.  I had to use a spoon with mine, but that's the fun in it.  They are yummy, huge, and satisfying.

The fries left me wanting.  They're okay, but they aren't the best in the world.  I believe that they can do better, and hope that they do.  Oh, and it doesn't hurt to salt them just a tad.  Everyone likes seasoned fries.

Overall, great fun, good food, and I'd go back some day.  I think I'll give them six months till the next visit to see how much they improve, but it is worth a curious stop in for those who like the hot new businesses on the block.",2012-03-04 01:55:26

The fountain does erupt like Old Faithful at timed intervals (every hour?) and is pretty cool and makes our town unique. Please take extra precaution on windy days, as fountain spray WILL blow on pedestrians on the sidewalk. Also note that a lot of ducks reside in the water... ;)

The park is well-maintained with tons of grass (which is rare in AZ) as well as a few businesses at the south end. It is canine-friendly which makes my heart happy and I'm sure puppies feel that going here is a huge social affair in their doggy world. The park also has a mini amphitheater on NW corner for outdoor concerts/speakers, etc which is rad and was pretty well-planned.

They also have a kids water play park thing-y in SE corner for them to frolick and splash around. And, they even have a memorial area (not sure for what - sorry!) on the east side too. 

So, this park is pretty much ""the tits"" and I'm rather proud of it being in our town. I've gone here to walk solo when I needed some fresh air/exercise, vent with girlfriends about men and flap our gums about other girlie stuff, have been on dates here (both were crappy), attended Norooz (Persian New Year) and had picnic w/my Persian bestie and her family, and just... people watched sitting on a bench!",2016-03-07 20:56:21

Until today!

I needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.

2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.
3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.

Zanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.

Arrived a bit earlier than reservation, we started with our drink at the bar. I like the way they decorated the bar. Nice display of so many different kind of shotsyu, great wine selection, comfy chairs, and they even had a DJ last night.

We started our dinner with deluxe sashimi plate. First seafood I put in my mouth was uni (sea urchin). As soon as I put it in my mouth, it melted in my mouth, so good. I was really happy with the quality of uni they served. I like their fresh wasabi where they grind real fresh wasabi roots. I also like their rock salt. Some fish goes good with salt better than soy sauce with wasabi. I ate some sashimi with just fresh wasabi without soy sauce. Their wasabi is so good, it has great flavor without too much of spice.  Toro (fatty tuna) was also good as well. Good toro melts in my mouth so good, I like the texture and flavor of toro.  Oysters had a bit too much citrus flavoring for my taste. I prefer real oysters taste without any added flavor.

Nigiri and rolls we had were also good as well. I like the way they flavored scallops. Hamachi sushi I had, I was pleased with the quality of hamachi.

We finished dinner with kabocha pumpkin cheesecake. This cheesecake was't too sweet, just right amount of sweetness mixed with ice cream and cranberry sauce. Nuts on the cheesecake was just a little overwhelming, it didn't compliment the kabocha .

Service was excellent. Besides our waitress, they had enough staff always walking around to clear empty plates and refill our drink.

Bathroom stool's door came all the way down, completely enclosed the toilet. The shape of toilet was not standard US. They were similar to what I've seen in Singapore. Bathroom was clean but I thought they could use something more, perhaps some nice aroma oils.

What I liked:

$5 martinis and a robust wine list made for a nice pre-game watering hole for non-beer drinkers like myself.  The glasses are smaller than those at AZ88, but just as filled to the brim and at less than half the price.

The food was OK.  I ordered the chopped salad, but was surprised to discover that it wasn't really ""chopped."" Large chunks of red-leaf lettuce accompanied by cherry tomatoes, chopped onions, and a few other ingredients.  It could have been larger and more complex.

The prices are fantastic. Brad ordered the roast beef sandwich for around $9, which came on fresh focaccia bread and was stacked with bacon and a fried egg.  He said that it was OK, but could have benefited by some more flavor -- perhaps a nice sauce.  My chopped salad was around $8, so also a healthy bargain.

What I did not like:

The service.  Our server admitted to forgetting to place our appetizer order (the bruschetta), so our entrees arrived first.  When she realized her mistake, she apologized and said that the bruschetta will ""be right out."" However, she still charged us for it.  Not good.

The atmosphere.  Sterile and cold, with a monochromatic color scheme and too many clean lines.  It reminded me of a hotel bar in Manhattan, with minimalist intentions taken to the extreme.  There was nothing warm or inviting about Hanny's, and it's not the type of place I would have stopped in had I been simply walking through the neighborhood.  

All in all a nice option for a pre-game drink or snack, but not the type of place I'd make my destination on a Saturday night.  A decent addition to the downtown neighborhood, but lacking the vibrance of a place where someone would be happy to call his or herself a regular.",2010-01-12 17:56:14

i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...

Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
I said the truth is here the truth is here

I want more
Give me more
We want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

[Verse 1:]
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

[Chorus: x2]
I want more
We need more
I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is

[Verse 2:]
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold

People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground

Truth is here the truth is here

It still deserves a 3/5 though because there isn't a lot of choices in the area when it comes to chain restaurants. It had been either moxies, milestones, jack astors or baton rouge so we were pretty excited when this place opened up.

Overall: 3/5 Great place to hangout and socialize with friends in the area if downtown is too far for you folks.

Service: 3/5 nothing spectacular but also nothing bad to say. 

Drinks: 2.5/5 one rotating tap of craft beer.. which is better than nothing. Cocktail was just okay, tasted like juice to me (I bartend, I am allowed to be critical: )

Food: 3/5 I had the short rib poutine that everyone raved about. Good but not good enough for me to order again. My fiancé had the steak, very juicy and delicious. We also subbed the regular fries with dragon roll (not authentic, but I didn't mind it). 

Conclusions: I would come back to have drinks with friends. They have a pretty extensive app menu. However, food is not up to this foodie's standard, I wouldn't come back here for food.

Okay, they have a back patio. Whoo hoo. Summer time tapas. Great date place. That said, if you can bring three friends, it's an ideal situation to try more dishes. That said (even more so), the last time I was here was in 2008 --the ceviche was way better (and different) and inside had more of a reggae type feel like you were on vacation. Now, the inside just feels drab. The servers don't seem to be very excited - they weren't bad; they just weren't great. 

WE ATE
Ceviche. Because everyone hypes this up as THE ceviche place (which it kind of was but not so much anymore. Questions: what are the other options in TO other than Torito?). As with the atmosphere, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great which confuses me about most of the other reviews (which are about over a year old ....well, those from my friends on here). 

The arctic char was good and I loved the texture with the apple and ginger. Presentation was a bunch of sliced apple on top. If the arctic char was a character, it would be screaming out, ""Pay attention to ME! LOOK AT ME!"" It also looked and tasted like salmon, but that's just me. 

Scallop ""ceviche"" were a bunch of scallops presented on a plate (much better in presentation than the arctic char). It wasn't memorable. 

Other notes: menu readability is overwhelming, as it's about 30 items on one long list. Break it up, Foxley! 
The value wasn't worth it. Two ceviches that were appetizer size at $16 each. With no drinks and tax and tip, we paid $40. 

To actually get fed, we went over to Electric Mud BBQ, had a feast and paid $46 (with two drinks!). 

I wanted to re-love Foxley like I did the first time. I really did but this time, I was disappointed. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
To ceviche or not to ceviche. That is the question.

1) super friendly and accommodating staff
2) hotel is a little dated
3) great location on the strip

I stayed at the Paris hotel for a week for business. I booked a king standard room but when I arrived they were out of that room style so they gave me a room with two double beds and an Eiffel Tower view. I also had to leave about 15 items at the bell desk for co-workers and the staff was really accommodating. The view was great! The room wasn't anything super special and a little dated but nice overall with a pretty big bathroom. 

There are a few good restaurants and bars in the hotel including Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. There is also a piano bar, Napoleans, that had some really talented pianists in the week I was there. There is also a club, Chateau here. The club is probably not a top club in Vegas but the view from the ""rooftop"" deck is great and the DJs were great the few times I went.

The location of the hotel is great, it is in the middle of the strip so you can walk almost anywhere. The hotel is connected to Ballys so you can get to monorail station without having to walk outside.

From the food perspective, this place knows what it's doing. Dinner artichoke appetizer turns artichoke haters into lovers. Salad options are fresh, simple and not over dressed. Dinner entree's highlight new takes on traditional dishes, with a special shout out to the lamb shank and steak frites. When a restaurant makes its own homemade icecreams and desserts, you know the chef is in it from start to end. 
Everything we had was extremely good and for the pricing, you really can't go wrong.

The atmosphere is perfectly Toronto. In a city where half the restaurants are  focusing more and more on modern spaces with year half livs on ambience, The Ace does the opposite and supports the casual relaxed this-is-a-what-a-neighbourhood-restaurant-should-feel-like. I personally find myself drawn to places like this. The servers are attentive, informative and just down right cool. The place almost feels like an American dinner in a French city.

It seemed like a great night for hot noodles since it was cold outside, there was a bit of a line at the restaurant and I was hungry - a great combination for enjoying a hot bowl of ramen.  I entered Ramen Isshin with moderately high expectations, and left the restaurant bitterly disappointed. 

I'm looking for something positive to say about this place, but very little good stuff mind and a lot of bad stuff comes to mind as I write this piece.

The good: Presentation of Ramen was nice. The takoyaki side dish was good.

The bad: Seating was tight and cramped. Food was bad. Prices were expensive.  Portions were average, on the small-ish side. Service was bad. 

I ordered a shouyu ramen, the others in our group ordered one miso ramen and two sesame ramen.  We also added one side order of takoyaki.  The takoyaki was delicious and the presentation of the ramen was well done.  However, all of us agreed that the ramen was way too salty!  It was like they took the noodle broth and dumped a bucket of salt into it.  Eww.

On this occasion, we had a special request: one of my friends' phone was running out of battery and we noticed that they had a charger.  When we asked if we could charge the phone for a few minutes, they declined to help us out.  No going above and beyond here.

To add to the lousy service they forgot to ask us if we want to split our bill and added gratuity (15%) to our bill.  Since we were in a group and our bill came together, we split the bill ourselves and there were some coins at the end adding up to the total.  When the server came to collect our bill, she rudely counted every penny right in front of us. 

Bad food. Terrible service.  I do not recommend this place and don't plan to come back.

This is my third visit to Monta but first time to review.  

1.  The lines - The place is typical for a Ramen shop, with limited space to eat and to wait, but it is worth it.  My suggestion is to go when it opens and it will be all good.

a.  Miso Ramen - Bean Paste Ramen, very tasty. noodles perfect.
b.  Shoyu Ramen - Soy Sauce flavored broth and a nice stand by.
c.  Tonkatsu Ramen - Pork Bone broth - my favorite.

All noodles are just right, al dente and the broth is not piping hot as I would expect, but tasty overall.  Perhaps they believe the western palate does not prefer the hot broth, but to me, it has to be piping hot to be perfect.  The soups have a perfect blend of roasted pork slices that are tender and tasty.

I met Shannan M. for breakfast at the Foodbar a few weeks ago.  We were both excited to try a new place.  Although we walked in separately (from different entrances), we both shared a similar experience upon entering.  The staff was not so friendly and being that we were new customers, we wanted to feel welcome.  When we made our way up to the cafeteria style bar to order food, Shannan even asked the lady working for some suggestions and she didn't really make anything sound too great.  We both ended up with a muffin and coffee (I know, pretty boring).  

So, I feel that I need to pay the Foodbar another visit in hopes that they will be more welcoming and perhaps even sell me on something more delicious than a plain ol' muffin.  I did hear that since my visit, my BF had a more pleasant experience, so I am optimistic that they are working on customer service.  Time will tell...",2007-12-17 22:46:27

I loved my experience here because the food was exceptional, waiters were nice & friendly, and presentation was stellar. I also pulled my picky self together and asked them to move us to a bigger table and they did this immediately which was very satisfying.

ordered:
1.) Thai-Style 'Kobe' Beef Carpaccio
Glass Noodles, Cilantro, Chile, Toasted Peanuts - This was lovely. It was VERY good! A++
2.) Butter Poached Maine Lobster
Sweet Potato Crpe, Thai Coconut Cream - This was so delicious, I felt like I got a million different flavors from it. I was a bit sad it was small because I just wanted to eat more of this dish..A
3.) Chocolate
Gianduja Semifreddo, Praline Crunch, Caramel Mousse, Warm Chocolate Cake, Mocha Anglaise -Really good combination of desserts..loved it!

The reason as to why I'd knock off .5 stars is because perhaps I had slightly higher expectations because of the name of this place.. nonetheless the food was great, oh and our waiter gave us some extra dessert for free which was really sweet of her :)

Pros:
+ nice setting
+ they change all your utensils and plates several times which was nice
+ waiters are at every corner  waiting to re-fill your drinks
+bathroom was really pretty, too :)

Cons:
- just a tad bit pricy..but then again, it's Michael Mina's...what do you expect.",2007-05-30 01:10:32

I also stopped at the Rocky River metroparks dock location recently.  I had the honey pecan and mint chocolate chip flavors, which both tasted excellent.  I'd love to try the orange blossom flavor next.  I realize people are very regional-centric and love to defend their turf, and even overrate their favorite foods.  Honey Hut falls into this category.  Yes, their ice cream is real good, but is it really the best in all of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio?  To me, it's on the same level as Mitchell's (which I like too), but not nearly as good as some of the more 'high-end' gourmet ice cream shops in Tremont.  And certainly not as good as some of the incredible specialty ice cream stores i've been to along the Jersey Shore or in Miami.

I've had the beef shawerma, the chicken shawerma, and some of the gyros. Everything I've had so far has been really good, seemed fresh and taste delicious. Nothing seemed greasy or over/lacked seasoning, well I'd probably throw hot sauce on it but I love hot sauce. Someone on the table had ordered these fries, I don't know what they were called but it wasn't your usually fries it looked so good, the entire plate was wiped out before I even could try them. I will need to find out what they were and have them next time.

I remember once it was so busy that they gave us a complementary pieces of baklava. Yum that baklava was so good. Layers of flakey yet moist goodness with nuts and honey. If you have a sweet tooth make a stop here just for the baklava.

The interior is kind of mom and pops like or old however you want to call it but there are a lot of seats available, except when it's very busy and there a wait. There's a larger TV hanging on the wall.

It is an upscale casual bistro that happens to be run by Chinese.  And with this arrangement, Maxim offers exceptional value when compared to other casual fine dining establishments.  

Upon entry, I noticed the dim lighting, the white clothed tables, the pleasant and tasteful decoration and, you can't miss it, a wide selection of cakes in a refrigerated display case.

We ordered from the set dinner menu a Pickled Pork Hock with Sauerkraut and Potato ($19) and a Maxim's Mixed Grills ($22). Both came with roll and butter, starter soup, a piece of cake of your choice and a hot beverage. The Pork Hock was well portioned.  It was the size of a baseball (see pic). The flavour was bold, though not as complicated as the authentic pork hock at The Muskets. The meat was very juicy. The flavour was unfortunately one dimensional, but the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat made up for it. The Mixed Grills had a mix of steak, pork, sausage, and lamp chops (see pic). My BF said they chops were all tender and flavourful, though maybe salty for some. The cut of the meat was good.

I eagerly awaited the dessert because the cakes looked so pretty in the refrigerated display case.  There were maybe 10 types to choose from.  Patrons were expected to choose by viewing the case and ordered it through a wait staff back at table.  My BF chose a slice of Cappuccino Meringue and I chose a slice of Blueberry Almond Meringue.  I must say the Cappuccino Meringue was the better of the two.  

Is Maxim good? Yes, food tastes decent.  Is Maxim a good deal?  Oh 200% yes, if you order from the set menu.  The regular menu is rather pricey.  Is Maxim French?  I am not sure.  It tastes more continental to me.  The service was efficient and sufficient, yet definitely not refine by the standard of a casual fine dining restaurant.

Maxim is a solid choice if I feel like enjoying a Western meal in class but don't want to hurt my wallet too much.",2014-07-15 05:50:59

We sat right away, they took or orders in a timely manner and brought our food out quickly. When I came here with a large group of 8 people, while the staff was still friendly, they seemed unorganized. We asked to be seated 2 times (there were plenty of open tables) before finally being sat and they forgot to put one of our orders in, so my friend had to wait longer to get her food.

1. 2 and a half hour dining experience for one entree and a drink with a total table of 7.  (not an enjoyable wait)

overall pretty bad experience ... food tasted okay nothing special.  i would prefer donburi for more choices by commerce gate.

Some people may not prefer the hint of sour taste but that is just a matter of personal preference, no reason to give Duffs a 1 star, like the completely unfair review from Joanne Z.  Maybe she should have gone for the Honey or Hot Honey

Unfortunately their food was a tad underwhelming and simply wasn't worth it for the price.

I'm by no means a beer drinker but enjoyed their traditional et cetera tasting board. There was the blonde, amber, white, and brown and it was really interesting trying all of them. Our favourite was definitely the white as it was light, refreshing, and citrusy. The darker beers were more rich and provided a nice contrast.

For the food we got the half rack of ribs and the chicken and waffles. I was probably expecting too much but the food was just simply overwhelmingly average. The overall quality was underwhelming and the food lacked preparation and finesse. The waffles still had the crusts of coagulated sugar and there was simply no sauce to bring and bind the chicken waffle sandwich together. The coleslaw was a bit dry and didn't have sufficient mayo coating the cabbage. That being said the ribs were pretty decent and was definitely fall off the bone. The bbq sauce was a good amount of tang and sweetness but could have used just a tad more on them.

Hahaha I don't think anyone would ever put 25 cents because one it was dirty and their was nothing in it. They seriously need to take that out just embarrassing. The bathroom was dirty too so I didn't understand how these guys get an A when food inspection comes because the place was dirty everywhere I looked. If you want just a good burrito yeah sure come grab one but it's not a place I'll be coming back to just doesn't have what I like in a place.,2015-08-19 22:21:31

They really seem to have their act together for getting people in managing the people so that it isn't a whole shit show of people en mass. The way the inside is leveled into several different tiers is helpful as well. That way, it seems like, no matter where you stand you will at least have a decent view of the band/DJ. The restrooms are fairly easy to get to but kinda off to the left of main stage so if you are on the other side of the place it can be a bit of a hassle but there again with the way they manage the crowds they usually keep the main walkway clear of gawkers. Another nice layout feature is the back patio. It offers a very nice place to go either cool off of have a smoke or just get away from the havoc if you feel the need. The only thing I would say is a downer is the drink prices. Holly price gouging batman. I think a red bull and vodka in a 8 ounce cup (stuffed with ice first mind you) is around 9 dollars. Be sure and save up for a ticket for whatever event you are going to see and then if you are planning on drinking at the venue save up a months salary for the bar tab. Or pregame somewhere else which is never a bad idea and probably a decent way to beat their system. OK, enough of that little rant. Anyways, bottom line is its a great venue, run very well and laid out great. I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars but the drink prices were a big turn off.",2012-07-16 19:55:51

a. The view is amazing
b. The purchase of an entree at 360 allows you to bypass the long lines downstairs
c. All of the above

The food, then, in an afterthought. Sure, it's nicely plated and served in the style of fine dining, but the food is strictly wedding-banquet fare. My prix fixe lunch ($48) entree of stuffed chicken breast was slightly bland and rather dry, served with the obligatory mashed potatoes and overcooked broccolini. My heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad starter was pretty, but served with underripe tomato. My dessert, the maple walnut roulade, was nice (if a little too sweet for my taste). Portions are large, so even if the food isn't the greatest, you will leave pretty stuffed.

But everything outside of the food was good -- the server was very attentive and friendly, and of course the view can't be beat.

This restaurant has four stars...what could go wrong?!  For starters it was very loud.  I could barely here my waiter, who mostly stood as far away from our table as possible and whispered.  He didn't ask if we had been before, didn't bother explaining any specials or the menu.  The menu is a little confusing if you have not been before, but we proceeded to order a few items to share.  

The pork belly comes with a sauce on the side.  It was so dry and flavorless that I almost choked.  The sauce was ok, but not what I thought.  The potato salad has ham-(not mentioned in description) and was very watery.  It was inedible.  The sausage was sweet, but bland and dry.  I mentioned all this to the waiter who shrugged his shoulders and whispered ""I don't know what to do"".  Ok.

Things I did like: wings-both flavors were awesome.  The buns, although they come plain?????-weird..were tasty, and the potato swirl was decent.  The sauce it came with was gross and flavorless.

It was quite a bit smaller than I expected, even with my expectation of it being a hole-in-the-wall kind of burger joint. No worries though, as we were the only ones in there late that Saturday afternoon. 

The waitress was friendly and service was quick. She recommended the Shipwreck Burger and the Market Square Burger. We took her advice and added a basket of fries. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more choices for a place that is predominantly a burger place. There were 6 options, none of which were exactly what I was craving at the time. I would have appreciated an option to customize my own (like Burgatory). That's right, I said it. 

Fries were served first and I thought they were excellent. They had a sweet, yet salty flavor to them and are definitely in my top 5 list of fries around the city. 

The burgers were good - though I wouldn't say they're the best. Again, top 5 from what I've sampled. We ordered them both well-done, and they came out almost too well done. The toppings were good - very unique. I enjoyed the Shipwreck, however my wife wasn't thrilled with the sauce on the Market Square burger.

With a name containing the word ""chocolate"", one would expect to be walking into a room full of ""eye candy"". That's not the case here.

We explained that we had a limited amount of time and if he thought we could be served promptly. The gentleman assured us we would be able to be served and eat with the time we had left. 

We decided to get a latte and lunch. My lunch buddy and I ordered one of the latte that had mocha and marshmallow (forgot the name) it was ok, a bit too sweet for me.  For lunch we were going to each order an item and split; I ordered the Cornish pasty and she ordered the Cottswold Pie. Both came with a side salad. The pie and the pasty were insipid. The peas in the pasty were they only flavor. The Cottswold pie only had slight flavor of Cottswold cheese. We both ate our lunch pies, but as we sat there we quickly realized that we were going to be feeling our lunch for a while. It sat like a brick. 

The gentleman was so sweet and concerned if we were going to be back on time. He also gave us a chocolate before we left.

The story of Jade Morris, the ten year old girl who allegedly murdered by the Bellagio knife attacker; was that little girl

I'm not going any further on that story, but I'll ended it like this...I hope Brenda Stoke burns in hell for what she did    

One good thing came from this,  I found a place in Vegas that make Cincinnati Chili, and does it very well!      

After a pretty good workout at Golds on Eastern,  my friend an I decided to checkout this place among the 100's of other eateries in this part of Vegas, and since it was a stone throw away from the Gym it was a no brainier to walk down this strip center to Top notch.    

Service was great, and we were greeted very quickly by our host.     The menu is kind of small, but it was straight forward, and I was craving chili.    If you look at our picture of this place, you'll see what we ate.    It was very good, and the chili wasn't overly sweet, and had a mild spiciness to it.    I really enjoyed the hot link, and it had a nice snap to when I bit into it.    My friend doesn't eat too well after the gym, and I had some of her fries...wow.   It was very good!, and had that double fry action.    I almost ate most of it, but backed off.....hey, I have my news years resolution to keep

Top Notch shares space with a bar, but that establishment has it's own entrance, so it safe to say this place is children friendly.

It was very good although it was quite overly sweet for me due to the amount of the espresso sauce added on top. The coffee ice cream is also so good that I don't really like coffee flavor things but I still enjoyed it, probably because the coffee flavor was not that strong in the bingsoo. Because it was so sweet that a small size was enough for me and my friend. Another thing is that chewing mochi is a part of the toppings but there was exactly 2 pieces of mochi in my bingsoo unfortunately, a little disappointment here. Perhaps I will order the injeonmi one next time in order to get more of that chewing mochi.  

Service is efficient as I got my order within 5 minutes waiting. The cashier was very friendly and smiling all the time. It was kinda self-serve thing as you pay and pick up your order whenever the bell they gave you rings.

The Whining Pig has become one of my favorite places in all the valley to grab a few drinks and run into fellow Phoenicians/Yelpers (Hi Sunny!). Greg and his father did a bang-up job establishing this little beaut into a place that looks like it's been a part of the neighborhood for decades. The bar is tiny, filled with friendly faces and laughter, has great drinks and prices, and it just plain ol' feels good to be wetting your whistle in there. 

That said, keep in mind that this is a wine/beer bar, so don't come for cocktails. And, if you get hungry, know that you'll be able to get order some light bites and baked goods to munch on while you get ready for your next drink.

It's that simple. The Whining Pig is a neighborhood bar that feels like a neighborhood bar. Say hi if you see me in there during happy hour because it's highly likely.",2013-12-30 17:50:38

It's been a long time since I've been to England, but this is how I remember the British pubs to be: not fancy, kinda dim lighting, dark wood tables and chairs, with plain walls with chalkboard menus, and a traditional wood bar in the back. 

My Toronto friends live nearby so they've dined here often in the past, but this was my kid's and my first time here. We were, in total, a party of five when we recently had dinner here. Most in our party had burgers but my kid and I shared the grilled rainbow trout and the grilled chicken Cobb salad. Both were terrific: fresh and flavorful. Surprising for a pub, I thought. 

Here's the kicker: they serve hot sticky toffee pudding. And this dessert IS.TO.DIE.FOR. It's now weeks after we've dined there and my kid is still talking about this dessert. She tells me daily that this was the best dessert she ever had in her life and that this is now her favorite dessert of all time. (This is pretty amazing for a chocoholic like my kid!). If you never had this before, you MUST try it, and try it here where it truly is excellent.

Service was wonderful. 

One observation of note: the bathrooms are downstairs, at the end of a longish hallway. I'm not sure what the men's bathroom is like, but the women's had a strong, pervasive musky smell. Dank and musky. And when I visited the washroom (twice. Don't judge!), at one point the TO subway must've been passing by nearby, underground, close, and the room vibrated and the sound of the subway hummed. Very interesting bathroom visits!

Initially it was very loud inside, the games were blasting from the TVS and the last table in the place that we scored had a speaker right above it. Yes, I lost my voice over the course of the night but we had so many laughs it was worth it. It quieted down a bit a little later on.
The service was amazing for an hour or so until our waitress was off duty - so we paid our tab and were ignored after that until we flagged someone else down.
No complaints about the wings really - they were half price and had about 10 flavors to choose from. I highly recommend the Ancho Chipotle and also the Maple Whiskey BBQ wings. Very good. 
Ooh, and so was the salt and pepper wing that I tried. 
And the hot wing...  yummy! 
The wings were smaller but still meaty, fresh and not overcooked as you find at other places that are just cranking them out. 
The drinks were half off too on some beers and all wines except for the most expensive red and white on the menu. I was very happy with my 5oz glasses of sweet German white to go with the wings. 
Our table killed 6 baskets (1 pound of wings = 10 wings or so) and then we ordered a basket of fries after that. They were so good! We were told that the kitchen changed to red skin potatoes which just make for a darker, tastier fry, skins on! The tables next to me got nachos and the platters were huge and looked sooo good! Next time...
For as many people as there were in this place, it was very clean and the bar-like decor was modern and pleasant to the eye. My friend also said the washrooms were surprisingly clean!

Once I have drink in hand, I can go to their quaint patio (dog-friendly patio, but not dog-friendly inside) to sip the goods or I can stroll around Hingetown or head to Ohio City to check out the rest of the city. The coffee packs a punch so I don't have to worry about a lack of energy.

Seriously, you haven't tasted anything like it before, guaranteed. I was through the roof excited to hear of Dom DeMarco's, so I dropped everything to dine here with some friends and family immediately. 

It is an upscale looking restaurant with a bar area and a dining room that opens up to patio seating. It can get quite loud inside and the chairs are seriously giant, but overall has a really great feel to it. I loved the giant pictures of Vespa's on the wall and that they leave you a bottle of water on the table, very Italian touches. Our server was good, not great and definitely not overly available. 

We started with calamari, eggplant pizzettes, and the SOHO salad. The calamari smelled great, but I don't eat calamari. I tried a bite of the eggplant, but again I am not an eggplant fan so was not impressed. Everyone at the table really enjoyed them though. I thought the salad was good, a mixture of lettuce, asparagus, green beans, fennel, fontina, and a light truffle vinaigrette. I would have liked a little more flavor from the vinaigrette, but it was a fun mixture of ingredients overall.

We decided to go with the legendary Di Fara Special pizza. Now, the pizza they serve in Brooklyn is of course thin crust, so please tell me why this pizza has a thick crust! It was good, although the pepperoni was seriously lacking in flavor and the cheese pulled off the pizza with every bite, but it wasn't necessarily a bad pizza. I enjoyed the flavor of the olive oil and the crust (and I am not generally a crust person). But, if you are going to have a Di Fara special pizza it would have to be a thin crust simple pizza, just like you would get in Brooklyn! 

I do wish I had gotten the opportunity to sample the NY style thin crust pizza, maybe next time. I found this place a bit pricey and a little lackluster. We definitely have better options in Vegas.",2012-03-31 07:06:03

Unfortunately the second visit failed to wow, there were so many blunders that unfortunately left us disappointed from most recent visit. 

Being that it was winter, we opted for indoor seating because it was pretty chilly out, the inside of the restaurant wasn't much better. The lights were dimmed probably a little too far, our in-laws had to use their phones to read the menu. It wasn't until 10 minutes later when we had already figured out what we wanted to order, that our server came by and asked if he could adjust the lighting (by then it was too late). 

My husband and I were going to order tea, but we like gourmet tea and for $6 a cup that would be my expectation at this sort of restaurant. Unfortunately, when we asked about tea, we were presented with a box with the most generic teas that run about 10 cents a bag. Unfortunately hot water doesn't really justify the remaining $5.90 price tag so we stuck with cold water in the cold restaurant. 

I wasn't feeling like anything too heavy, so I opted with the vegetable sandwich, my husband went with the chicken one. My husband also ordered a cup of soup, and for a small bean soup it came to $8. It was good, but again I can't really justify a $8 price tag. 

Our sandwiches were pretty bland and the vegetable one tried to compensate for that with excessive balsamic vinegar.. it was OK but I would not recommend it or order it again. The side of yuca fries was the best part of the entire visit, but not nearly impressive enough to warrant a return visit.

Our server appeared to be very new and nervous, excessively so and it was rather frustrating. The manager (the owner's son) and the owner stopped by chatting for about 10 minutes at a time, which was nice having them stop by, but again a little excessive. I almost feel they stopped by to distract from the fact the food was so slow..

It took about 30 minutes after ordering to receive the first amount of food (besides the complimentary plantain.. which were good but not as good as the previous visit because they were cold and didn't taste fresh). There honestly was no reason for the service to be so slow as there were at least 6 employees and only 3 tables of customers! 

No one ever came for our drink order or to follow up on the tea.. we were going to do dessert, but decided to skip it after how long it took to get our entrees and everything. 

My husband had asked for his sandwich to be wrapped up to go about 10 minutes before we asked for the bill.. The bill came and it wasn't until we were nearly home we realized our server never came back with the leftovers.. I've honestly never experienced that before.

All and all, this was a hugely disappointing visit. I would say consistency is their problem and quite frankly we will be looking for a new spot after this visit.",2017-12-29 17:45:42

Fast forward 10 years, and what a difference a decade makes.  

We were warmly greeted at the entrance and immediately shown to a table.  The first thing that struck me was how bright the restaurant is:  every pendant, recessed, and accent light at full blast, making it seem like the good old days at Senior's restaurant in Brooklyn, aptly named for its clientele.  Where was the mood lighting of my memory?  Gone, gone, gone.

Service was excellent throughout our dinner.  I was happy to see a good German Riesling on the menu, rather than the ubiquitous Chateau Ste. Michelle that's on every other restaurant's list.  Two kinds of decent bread were in the basket, promptly delivered along with olive oil/balsamic.  

Hubby started with gazpacho.  It had a good taste, though it was missing the usual garnish of chopped veggies.  It did, though, have a bit of avocado.  But in my book, gazpacho needs to be served very cold, even on ice, and this one wasn't quite cold enough.  

I ordered from the list of specials, a pork tenderloin w/ prosciutto, served with sauteed spinach and garlic mashed.  The pork was sliced paper-thin, but wasn't dried out.  It was covered with a tasty brown sauce chock full of fresh dark mushroom quarters.  Normally I'm not a fan of sauces, but I liked this one.  The fresh spinach was full of garlic slices (yum!), but the mashed potatoes were shockingly bad:  thin, watery, flavorless, and tasting as if they'd come out of a box (a dollar store box at that).  I asked for a replacement, and cheerfully was served a large portion of the roasted potatoes, and those were very good.  There was plenty of pork, and those potatoes, so I have enough for another meal.

My husband had the meatballs and spaghetti.  He thought they were okay, but wasn't smacking his lips.  I tasted the meatballs and didn't like them, but I detest meatballs made with pork, which this seemed to have.  And it's rare for me to like a meatball that doesn't taste like the ones my mom used to make, even though her cooking in general left much to be desired. (Well-done liver, anyone?).  I didn't try his spaghetti, so I can't speak to it's ""toothsome-ness,"" but it wasn't a very large portion.

The prices, while not low, aren't as relatively high as they were 10 years ago.  My entree, at $20, was a much better value than Herb's, which was $19.  In a contrarian move, this restaurant seems to buck the tide of all the others:  many of the specials are the same price or lower than the ones on the regular menu.  That's almost unheard of these days.

I've been seesawing between 3 and 4 stars, but downgraded it to 3 because of the lighting, the awful mashed potatoes, and the stingy portion of balls and pasta.  I enjoyed my dinner, and three stars means A-OK so I'll stick with that for now.",2015-05-13 08:56:46

Or am I? Lately I would say that I may be just that. I was all about some of the other competition here in town and I am not saying that we are done with them but Inaka was impressive, not only the service, but the speed, the cleanliness, and the quality. 

It was a dark cold night here in Vegas and the wife and I had a sitter for the kiddos and we decided to go out to dinner and hit up Carrabas, after pulling up and realizing that we could very easily go to carrabas with the kids so why not try and hit one of our favorite sushi restaurants. A flipped a U-turn in the parking lot and got ready to leave the parking lot as we noticed the buzzing neon of the Inaka sign that is literally on the driveway out of the shopping center. We pulled up and I pulled out the handy dandy Yelp app and notice the great reviews. 

This is when we pose the question... Do we A Keep driving and go to the regular joint or do we throw the car in park and try Inaka ( if you happen to be a Metro officer, The car was in park and I was on a hands free device...) needless to say we turned the car off and headed inside. 

The greeting was quick and we were at a table in no time with our larger than average glasses of water, which I love by the way, the one thing I hate is running out of water. The all you can eat menu is large and includes lots of fresh fish options. some of the creative rolls are very impressive also. Here is where they truly shine. I think we ordered like 5 rolls combined, the gentlemen at the counter grabbed our order and no joke within about 5 minutes we had all the rolls and appetizers we ordered on our table. WOW. Other places that we like to go to take that long to bring us drinks let alone bring the food. 

I am a fan of this place now, The sushi was fresh, the service was fast and friendly and the plum ice cream was a great way to end the meal. If you are off of Eastern running around or taking care of something and the hunger pains start calling, Do not hesitate to hit up Inaka you will not be let down.",2013-02-25 07:33:18

I would have given them five stars if it weren't for the ridiculous policy. It was my second time at this venue. The first time was the Foster the People Concert, and the second was Morrissey, the frontman of the 80s band The Smiths. I usually collect my ticket stubs, but unfortunately, I had a paper ticket that was given to me by my friends since they bought the ticket online. I usually cut it out, and then put it in my collection of ticket stub book! After he scanned my stub, the employee took my only souvenir copy! I understand they have to collect them for accounting purposes, but other venues do not do that! Once they've scanned the ticket, they usually give it back whether they are cardstock ticket stub or the ones you print online. I mean they don't collect the ones you have scanned on your phone or the ones that get mailed to your home! Why collect the ones you get printed? Maybe someday, they will change their archaic guidelines because it's stupid. They're going to throw them all away anyway!

UPDATE: 11/27/2017

Meh..... Management has responded to my review. Perhaps maybe the venue should upgrade the system. The business claimed there is no way they can tell if tickets were printed multiple times. Well isn't that why they have to scan them, and if there were numerous tickets printed they could avoid fraud? 
I could say the same thing about hard perforated stub tickets. Anyone could make a copy of that, but as long as it's been scanned. The stub can be returned to the ticket holder. It should be the same for paper copies! They claim this standard policy is the same as any other venue. Sorry, but I have attended many concerts in different arenas and venues. They do not have the same policy! I went to a concert in another country with a paper ticket, and they gave me the copy.  Maybe this venue should update their scanning equipment because it's old and outdated.",2017-11-18 20:52:41

I get the small frozen with 1 topping, but you can get 3 more for only an extra $1. 

My top 3 favourite toppings are (in order of how healthy I want to be from least to most):

1. Crackle bits (the end when the froyo is melted and covered by cracked bits is heavenly)
2. Candied walnuts
3. Persimmons

The topping selection is fantastic and there's always variety of rotating fruits. At times I see some interesting exotic choices (ie. dragon fruit, persimmons, goji berries)If you see something unfamiliar and wish to try, they're happy to give you a sample.

I personally love the flavour of kefir but It's not for everyone. Some coworkers I've introduced to didn't appreciate the flavour at all. It's a love or hate relationship.

zVAzv4x832g7Rd8EETc7_g,BN5GEmbeZ92fOTiHXGG_dw,OA1o0ixPWw-maEq2CF1Qag,4,1,0,0,"There's a relatively uncharted niche of Thai cuisine that's landed in Toronto by way of Kiin--Royal Thai. Royal Thai is just what it sounds like. It's opulent. It's elevated. And most importantly, it's delicious.

Kiin, meaning ""eat"" in Thai, is a partnership between Jeff Regular and Nuit Regular, the husband and wife team behind Toronto's rapidly expanding Thai empire (Pai, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai), and Janet Zuccarini (Gusto 101, Trattoria Nervosa, Pai).

Nuit Regular was raised in Thailand and always dreamed of opening a restaurant where she could share her love of this opulent and less common form of Thai cuisine with others. Through Kiin's menu, she has elevated the Thai staples we have come to know (think: satays, Pad Thai, curries) in an intimate lower-level space that is more mature and refined that its sister restaurants. Kiin incorporates familiar flavours of traditional Thai cuisine (lemongrass, kaffir lime, coconut, coriander) and even imports nearly all of its ingredients from Thailand to perfect the flavour profile of each dish.

Unlike some of the Regular's other restaurants, Thai street food is absent from this menu. Kiin has a sharable, interactive menu that showcases food fit for a king (or a queen in my case...). It's a curation of Royal Thai favourites as well as dishes from Nuit's childhood.

I had the pleasure of meeting the Regulars while I was dining there one evening. For owning a mini empire of restaurants, the couple is humble, gracious and hospitable. Nuit shared a story about how the yum tua plu (wing bean salad) was once a secret recipe that was exclusive to the Thai royal family's staff. She spent several years in culinary school to learn more about her native cuisine and honed the recipes that are now being enjoyed at Kiin.

My guest and I put all of our decisions in the hands of our lovely server, who seemed to have another gig as an actress. Her storytelling was on point and she described each dish with detail as it was presented to us. There were far more standouts than mishaps.",2017-08-09 01:10:54

The ice cream is creamy, it's light, it's fluffy, it's addicting and it's really just everything you think about in an ice cream. The other reviews explain the ice cream to the core, so I won't go too into detail about the flavors, but I will say that my two favorites for now are the chocolate brownie and of course, the salted Carmel. Put them together and it's definitely 'ice cream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for-Sweet Republic-ice cream-sweetness.'

Here's another special treat to Sweet Republic. Their heavenly toffee! It could be the best toffee I've ever had. In fact, I think I'm going to deem it the best toffee I've had to-date. The almond toffee is buttery, crunchy and soft all together. I put it on top of my salted Carmel ice cream, forgot about every calorie I was consuming and enjoyed sweet moments of Sweet Republic bliss. The bacon brittle intrigued me and I must say, I wasn't too eager to try it. But, after reading about it so often, I had to give it a whirl and was happily surprised! The bacon taste definitely overtakes the taste of the toffee making it taste like you are eating bacon with an infused taste of left-over syrup from your pancakes. Actually, I bet it would taste pretty good on top of waffles or pancakes! 

So with that, I will end the 241st review of Sweet Republic.

It's ironic that the name of the restaurant is ""Pure Sushi"" because in my opinion, this place is good if you are into fusion rolls...they are very creative. Ambiance is nice,  decor is trendy, but prices are a little high. 

We started with the Yellowfin Ahi and Avocado Poke which had white truffle in it and was served on individual taro chips (6 I think?). While it was tasty, refreshing and had a nice presentation, the truffle flavor was a little strong for me. You cannot appreciate the yellowfin at all. We also ordered the salmon and albacore sahsimi and the ikura. Fish tasted fresh and was a pretty good cut. 

We also ordered the Fire Dragon Roll and Peppered Beef Roll. I know, I know, why order beef at a sushi place? Well, it is a fusion restaurant after all. And surprisingly the beef roll was my favorite of what we tried. The mushroom, asparagus, and sesame sauce all worked really well with the peppered beef. Mmm.

Don't get me wrong pita jungle is great but this place has better prices and authentic delicious food. It's family owned so the service is always great and friendly. We frequently walk in and order take out because it's healthy and fast. The chicken salad is delicious and the gyro meet is awesome too. The hummus and pita is also very good and they give warm pitas if you take out or eat in. They have a good assortment of alcohol too! Highly recommend this place.,2017-05-27 20:52:24

Our server, Zach, was very good,  We had a few small problems with one of the wines and he immediately fixed the issues with no fuss. Nice to see a restaurant that empowers its staff.

As we often do, we shared a appetizer. This time fried cauliflower pieces. They were excellent and not too heavily fried, if that makes sense. We then shared a 14oz prime rib, medium rare with a twice baked potato, asparagus, roasted pepper and fried onions. It was perfect and very tasty.

All in all it was a great meal. The restaurant was busy, which upped the noise level. Completely bearable though.",2018-08-25 01:00:51

We were greeted warmly by the hostess who had us promptly seated. While we were browsing thru the menu, comes the amazing bread with butter!! 

We started with their chopped salad served perfectly chilled, with cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, feta cheese and finely chopped eggs. Sooo good! 

My kids shared filet mignon which was great. Hubby loved the miso sea bass.

For sides I highly recommend creamed corn which has the most tender sweet corn and their Parmesan and truffle matchstick fries. They are not shy adding truffle to those fries!! Loved it!

I am happy that we were not charged extra for splitting our salad and filet. 

Wine selection was great and their somm is one of the friendliest in town. 

For dessert we had Morton's legendary hot chocolate cake, probably the best lava cake in Vegas! You need to order this 20 mins ahead of time. Our waitress was wonderful about letting us know that.",2018-04-29 16:28:45

Easy to get to location right off Ohio Route 8. Note to out of towners, this place is easy to get to, so consider it if you're staying in the Akron Cuyahoga Falls area, or if you're traveling Route 8 for any reason.

Pluses include the beer, wine, and cocktail selections, as well as the price point. The menu is diverse and we had a tough time deciding what to order. There are several appetizers that sounded great, a very respectable small plate offering, as well as salads and mains that sounded great.

We decided to go Tapas style and share a few things; stuffed peppers, arancini, fish tacos, roasted pear salad with a pear vinaigrette, fried green beans, and finished off with a bourbon caramel bread pudding.

Stuffed Peppers - 5 stars. The marina they make is lights out good, and the sausage was a perfect match to the heat and flavor of the peppers.

Aranaci - 5 stars. A very fun dish with a lot of flavor and texture. Bonus is that it also comes adorned with the delicious marinara.

Fish Tacos - 3 maybe 4 stars. Nothing bad, just okay.

Roasted Pear Salad - 5 stars, but you have to like walnuts and blue cheese.

Fried Green Beans - 3 stars. The preparation is the best I've ever seen for this dish with a very light tempura coating, so light you don't really notice it, but just enough to be glad it's there. The downfall was the balsamic that they use. It was just way too sweet for us. If they used a savory balsamic, this would be a five star rating. It's one of their best selling items, so give it a shot if you like sweet things.

 Bread Pudding - 4 stars. Very good but it could use a little more punch of bourbon and more caramel. 

Service - 4 stars. The bar tender did his best, and is a very friendly person, but he was running the whole show and a couple of things slipped. 

I was going to give them 4 stars, but after writing this, I'm going 5 stars. The price point is acceptable, ingredients are solid, and it's a bistro bar. 

Environment - 4 stars. Clean hipster joint meets sports bar. Small with around 12 tables, which doubles in the warm weather months.

Try them out, and hope you enjoy it.",2018-02-25 03:24:44

The menu was a little overwhelming at first.  As it is a tapas bar, the dishes aren't separated into sections - it's just one long list.

We shared a plate of dumplings and I ordered the frog's legs!  Both were well-prepared with lots of interesting flavours and the portions were perfect for me.

They have an espresso bar, but for some reason don't have milk-steaming capabilities so your only options are espresso shots or americanos (no lattes or cappuccinos).

I made the mistake of ordering the green tea crême brûlée for dessert.  (I love green tea and I like crême brûlée).  It was a weird combination and prepared in such a thin layer that the majority of the dish was the caramelized sugar.  A little too sweet for my tooth.

I thought the prices were very reasonable and the portions were a good size.  The waitress was surprised that we were full after only three dishes between two people so I would budget two dishes per person. 

I would love to go back to try some of the other dishes that caught my eye.",2009-10-21 03:26:17

Upon our arrival, there was a private room setup with four large tables arranged in a fashion to comfortably seat our large group. The setting was in order for the memorable meal that followed. 

A three course prix fixe menu was offered as a value to those who didn't wish to order from the full menu. Our server, admittedly new to Lago, was plenty attentive and patient with our group. 

To start, my accomplice and I shared a bowl of steamed mussels and clams in a white wine garlic broth. The clams, I am unhappy to report, tasted gritty from sand left unrinsed. The broth, nothing I couldn't have constructed at home. 

Next, I had the grilled lamb chops with pumpkin gratin, brussels sprouts and pomegranate vinaigrette. Now, I've ordered lamp chops at other fine dining establishments and have only received a small chop or two of this delicate meat as an entire entrée (I'm talking to you Johnny's Downtown). At Lago, I was served an entire rack of lamb with about 8 ribs each! Cooked to my choice of medium rare, they knocked this dish out of the park and certainly made up for the first course. Damn this was good! 

Throughout the meal, my other gracious friends let me sample their lobster gnocchi and separately, the veal tortelloni. The flavors of each were intense and left me wanting to come back in the very near future to sample the rest of the menu. 

For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu which is standard for me. My partner, the goat cheese crème brûlée which was absolutely phenomenal. My only complaint was that I would've ordered an entire portion of that instead of my tiramisu which by the way was also very good. 

Overall, the entire dining experience seemed to go off without a hitch. It was nice in getting to experience good food with the company we were joined by. See you soon Lago. I'll definitely be back soon.",2011-03-22 17:58:16

Their rolls aren't pretty like most other sushi rolls, but - they are GOOD and they have a HUGE variety.  They have some of the normal ""specialty"" rolls that other places have as well - but be adventurous, try new things!

I have eaten there in the past for hibachi and it was always great.  But now...all I go for is sushi.  On tuesday nights.  Because 1/2 off.  My friend and I greedily split 6 rolls last night.  (we later determined we should get 5 - but have no regrets!  haha)  for $50.

First issue was the entry fee.  At $9 a head I would seek out a special discount or coupon to make this expense more manageable.  We searched online and found one for two $$'s of each adult.  A plus was the no charge for the Kiddos. They do get you however at the carnival area where they charge anywhere from $3-5 per ride.  Ouch! The best deal would be to get the wrist band for $30 and this will allow you to ride as much as the little kids desire (big kids too). 

Now to the food....they have just about every type of food imaginable which is odd seeing that is an Italian festival with feast in it's name.  They had Thai, Middle Eastern, Mexican, American and many more.  The food was rather high  priced for what you get I feel.  Example being a Philly Cheese  Steak with no side  for $9 or the $11 Falafel or the $5 Slushy.  This most likely not the vendors fault but the organizers and there high cost of space or booth rental for the 4 day event.  

Some of the Vendors were a little odd as well, many of which were not in any way related to Italian American Culture or Heritage.  I was surprised to see vendors promoting magic pain lotions, shoe polish, cell phone accessories, and portable fans and misters.  The cover count for an event like this I am sure is up to at least 10,000 visitors a day.  If you want to beat the crowd arrive early in the afternoon to avoid long food lines.  Quality is sacrificed because cooks are not making as much fresh food.  If you like a big party come when the sun starts to set and I am sure you will enjoy the event with adult beverages.  

Entertainment wise at San Gennaro, the kids on stage were pretty cute singing there top forty songs and doing there little dances.  I enjoyed the eating contests the most.  We witnessed ""El Torro"" become the 3 time meatball eating Champ.  The Cannoli one was quite gross because it looked like vomit both coming and going. 

Overall some disappointments with the Feast. We will most likely be back, it might be a year or two.",2015-05-14 20:25:22

For what they're charging and the food they're serving, it seems like - generically - they might be better served by a slightly larger location.

Plates are small, entree portions are good, portions of sides are about half of what I'd normally expect; I really like sides more than entrees, so I was put off by the tiny plates of sides.  Would probably spend more and order an additional side on my next trip in.  I like *eating* food, not just looking at it.

I also love the seating around the bar.

There is a closed-off area of the lodge that is for non-smoking. It actually even has a different entrance than the bar. I think this is great, since people don't want to smell smoke when they are eating.

That would disrespect restaurants that actually try. Went in for a hot dog and fries which at most on a super busy day should take 10 mins. I waited 15 mins even after when purchasing the girl at the front told it me since it was a hot dog it would only take 5 minutes. It was hot in there I mean easily 100 degrees. Why no air conditioning? There was about 10 employees yet nothing ever got done. So many people standing around and doing nothing. Manager not directing anyone on what to do. I saw someone else cancel their order so I did too but not because the wait but because I only saw one person in the whole place wearing gloves while preparing food. Its so disgusting to think of them sweating and wiping and touching the food. This place needs some new direction. Something. The open fridges they use to store ingredients I can almost guarantee are not at the right temperature at that heat on the inside.

Salad - Pancetta & Arugula: The crispiness of the pancetta reminds me of Bacos, but you know, better. There's tons of arugula, so if you like the green stuff then eat up! As for me, it was too bitter and I don't have an acquired taste for it. I would've enjoyed the salad more if it was mixed with other greens. But don't get me wrong, it was solid. Their Gorgonzola and Apple salad is a little sweeter, and I prefer it over this one. 

Pizza - Picante: Having a penchant for spicy foods, the Picante's a pie that made me perspire a bit from its serrano, banana, and calabrese peppers --- If you order this, make the server's job a little easier by requesting that he or she leave a pitcher of water on the table. Oh, before I forget, the crust is perfect. It's not too thin, not too thick, and it has a delightful crunch.

Other eats - For appetizers, try the Calamari Fritti and the Moretti Battered Fried Artichokes. As for pizzas, The Cal Italia remains one of my favorites, but their Romana pizza is divided into three sections and offers different topping combinations.

Other - I haven't seen this place packed beyond maximum occupancy, but it does get busy. Go ahead and make a reservation anyway.

I showed up around 11:45am on a Wednesday and the place was PACKED. I had to park across the street.  The grocery area is where you order lunch. It was shoulder to shoulder with other patrons, most professionally dressed. I don't really see the appeal of coming here on your lunch hour squeezed in with everyone else. 

I chose a Caesar salad from the case as I was in line. I asked the girl at the counter if I could add chicken to the salad and was told she had turkey breast. But it was sliced, lunch meat style turkey. ""No thanks"" I told her. I would have thought they would carry grilled meat to add to the salads. 

Now to find a table..ugh. I snagged one as a group was leaving, I felt like a lurker. So we are there to chat with our client and eventually talk business. The techno music was so loud, I could barely hear myself or my client. Gosh, I feel like a Grandma here, but it was just not a conducive place to have a business lunch. 

Props do need to go to the dessert case.  That thing was packed with amazing treats, some from Tammie Coe.  I had a mini cupcake, a white cake with a cream cheese frosting with shredded coconut on top.  It was AMAZING!

I would give LGO another chance, possibly for the pizza everyone says is so fabulous. The manager contacted me the day I went to LGO. I had sent a fellow Yelper a comment about his experience at LGO (similar to mine). She must have seen my comment and was trying to intervene before I wrote my review. I find this in poor taste.

First the good: my favorite on the menu was probably the French Onion Soup.  I'm a huge fan of French Onion so it was a must as soon as I saw it.  Soup itself is nice with the gruyère cheese.  Nothing that makes me go ""wow"" but it's solid.  

The foie gras with the vanilla bread pudding and the foie fras mousse was a really rich and savory dish.  Much better for sharing, even though it's not much.  The bone marrow with the oxtail jam is also good, and again, the portion is small.  For $18, it was a small half section.  Oxtail jam is super tender oxtail with some caramelized onions.

We hated the oysters.  They had a variety of oysters so we asked them to bring us 2 dozens for the group so we can try so it was just... not fresh at all.  For a restaurant like Comme Ca, definitely had higher expectations, especially when it is over $3 for the oysters.  

The Pork Shank sounded tasty, but it was dry.  In fact... I actually think the pork shank at some of the HK cafes might be better haha.  Gnocchi, I'd pass.  Steak Frites was probably the best entree item that I've tried, but c'mon, can't mess up steak & fries at least.

I've been to FTF a couple times and a few things you should know.  First off, if the weather is good, you better get there early.  Seating is limited to picnic wooden tables or you can find a blanket space maybe in the adjoining grassy areas.  Secondly parking is tough.  I always try to park in the Common Market area but that's a gamble honestly.  Again, get there early if you can.

The restaurant was fairly busy Thursday evening about 7 o'clock. Our waiter was very attentive. Too attentive actually. The breads to get you started are fresh and warm.
 
For starters we had Roasted bone marrow and tarte flambe; smoked bacon, caramelized onion. The tarte flambe was tasty; baked crisp and full of tang from the cheese, smoke from the bacon and sweetness from the onion.
 
I've never had bone marrow, nor oxtail jam. I was excited to try it especially after all the raves I've seen about this particular dish. It's $18 on the regular menu and I didn't see a single complaint about the price so I figured it must be good.
 
I have nothing to compare it to, but I didn't appreciate it. The oxtail jam taste like pot roast and the bone marrow had no distictive flavor. I couldn't say if I liked it or not, I couldn't taste it. All I could think was that it looked like the big bones we'd get in a doggy bag when I'd dine out with my parents as a kid. Our pups loved to chew on bones. So, yes, I'm saying this dish seemed like dog treat.
 
Entrees were steamed mussels; spicy tomato, andouille sausage and simple risotto with wild mushrooms. The risotto was good, but not great. It was a bit grainy and we've been spoiled by truffles. The steamed mussels were very good, tender and in a nice broth. I really liked the meaty spicy andouille that accompanied the mussels.
 
Dessert was decadent and wonderful the salted caramel mousse; dark chocolate ice cream, cocoa nib crumble did not disappoint.

I was terribly disappointed with desserts at Comme Ca on a previous visit. Judging by this restaurant week dessert, they have really stepped up their game and that first visit has been long forgotten.",2012-09-12 17:37:02

The dark, sultry decor is very inviting and makes a striking initial impression. Seating is a little tighter than I'd prefer, but it was not a major issue (except when the couple next to us overheard some of our conversation and were a bit appalled!)  They've got an interesting mix of music playing (lots of hip hop) At first, I couldn't tell if it was from the casino, but I am pretty sure it was actually from the restaurant. I didn't mind at all, but it was a bit unexpected in a Mexican restaurant. 

The service was fantastic. Our waiter was quite knowledgable about almost everything on the menu, and able to give complete recommendations. He really gushed over how good everything was- and was quite believable! Our water and drinks were replenished frequently, the table side pour of my friend's beer was done with a flourish, and we were checked on periodically without feeling stifled or rushed.

The food was also quite good. I didn't consider the prices exceedingly high, especially for a relatively upscale restaurant on the Strip. Most entrees appeared to range from between $20-$45, although there were some more expensive items as well. 

The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious, as was the guacamole. My strawberry margarita was  also very tasty. It wasn't overly sweet or syrupy, but yet remained flavorful and easy to drink.  

I ordered the quesadilla marisco ($28), and my dining companion ordered the Cabo Azul ($30). They both were great meals, with generous portions. The quesadilla was everything it should be- cheesy and full of seafood. It was served with sour cream and guacamole on the side. The Cabo Azul was indeed a big meal, and well worth the price. It included a shrimp taco, lobster enchilada, beans and rice, and stuffed peppers. I was able to sample the shrimp taco and the enchilada, and thought they were both delicious. 

I'd definitely consider Javier's again for upscale Mexican in a sexy atmosphere. Muy bien!",2014-10-29 19:21:29

Should I get the triple scoop? No wait, I can't afford it. Damn.""

Here's how to remedy falling into the unsatisfied trap: Completely overdo it. By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich, or an entrée-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream, toffee, cookie pieces, brownie bites, torched marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and the kitchen sink, you'll not only leave satisfied (and slightly ill, in a good way) but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory.

So...I'm back home for a couple of weeks, and needless to say in the 3 months I've been gone, a lot of new restaurants opened. I decided to give this place a try after my parents tried this place and told me good things about it.

Mabu Generation is located in First Markham Place, at the particular unit that seems to have a high turnover. Hopefully this place is here to stay, cause it was quite busy on a Friday night at 10pm.

The menu is very extensive, ranging from Taiwanese snacks to Japanese delicacies to dessert to drinks...you name it. It would obviously take several visits for me to get a sense of what's good and what's not in here...regardless I tried some items for my first visit.

I had the deep fried tofu with garlic sauce, black pepper teriyaki sauce rice on hot plate, lamb with pickled cabbage hot pot, hokkaido molden cream cheese tart, and an oreo milk green tea. Good variety of choices for my first round to give an analysis of this place.

The deep fried tofu with garlic sauce was average; it was the garlic sauce that made the difference in my opinion, as the deep fried tofu wasn't anything memorable at all. The rice on hot plate was very good; definitely at least on par with Aka Teppan nearby. The hot pot was also good, and it's not your typical hot pot as the sauce and ingredients were put inside before it arrives. The cream cheese tart, however, was a letdown as the tart itself was burnt and it was too hard to chew. Finally, the oreo milk tea was decent but nothing spectacular.

Service was good, however do give the employees a bit of time, especially if the place is busy. It's quite a big restaurant and they seem to be understaffed quite a lot.

If I end up coming back before I go back to Winnipeg in the new year, I'll update this review with more items.",2016-12-21 04:40:26

A friend and I met for lunch and since we weren't too hungry, we both ordered salads.  She had the Caesar salad and I ordered the Big-Eye Tuna salad.  Both were quite good, but nothing special.  The service however, was very attentive and friendly.  Our water glasses were never half full.  It was quite crowded when we came for lunch on a weekday, letting me know that it is quite the popular lunch spot. 

There is outdoor seating, but we opted to sit inside where we were able to enjoy a nice long conversation with some lattes to conclude our meal.  I love that it is a family owned restaurant and that the menu is farm to table inspired.  It looks like I need to try the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken and their huge selection of desserts in order to truly appreciate this little Summerlin gem.  I will definitely be back.

The place wasn't crowded at that time, so I'm not sure what happened. We only ordered apps. The shrimp app was delicious with a nice piece of grilled bread(that we asked for more of) for dipping. It was in a sauce of sherry, garlic, and herbs. Really good. We also ordered the stuffed avocado. We expected an actual ""avocado"" stuffed with a shrimp ceviche, but what we got was an avocado TOWER.

Walking in, it seemed to me that Café Différance is the type of place where opposites somehow come together, if not attract - both corporate executives and hipsters in the same building, that is. It had a sleek ambience that wasn't too overbearing for a coffee shop, bringing two of my favorite things together seamlessly.

The cappuccino that I ordered, brewed 49th Parallel, wasn't my favorite, but it definitely wasn't on the acidic side either. The taste sort of teeter-tottered on the border between smooth and bitter, but since I do somewhat prefer a stronger coffee I won't complain. The real star of Café Différance, however, lies in the baked goods, or at the very least their muffins. I got the blueberry and (apple?) muffin, and it tasted as good, if not better, than it looked. The bursting flavors of the fruit, the sweetness of the muffin, and the extra sugar flakes on top (which was totally not unnecessary in my opinion) created an amazing balance that harmonized perfectly with the slight bitterness of the cappuccino. As a self-proclaimed ""muffin nut,"" I would definitely give it a 10/10.

The bottom line is that I can say with utmost certainty that I will come back for the pastries so I can have the excuse to ""sample"" (aka pig out on) them all. And who knows? Maybe I'll find another drink that will be even more up my alley than this time's.",2016-07-26 04:03:46

There are personal TVs on each seat back and while the programming depends on when your flight is, you're sitll likely to find something to keep you entertained. 

Cabin crew is very friendly especially compared to American regional flights and they have a good list of destination spots and can act as a great alternative to Air Canada and Porter Airlines (thanks to their ability to cover more cities). And their Captains/Pilots have casual messages over the system keeping the flight experience on a high.

The tasting menu included - ahi tuna tar tar, lobster pot pie, kobi beef, and array for desserts. What I liked about the service was the server would bring us the food and announce the food and what were in it (I guess that the 5 star eating experience). 

Ahi tuna tar tar - this was delicious. It had a quail egg, pine nuts, tuna, and other items on it which I can't remember and the server would present it and mix all the ingredients together in front of you before I put anything in my mouth, 

lobster pot pie - YUMMY! This was the an incredible dish. I am usually not the biggest lobster fan, but the way it was prepared, I am a fan now. You get a big lobster tail piece in the pie with vegetables and in cream broth. I was full after this meal. 

Kobi beef - it was a good, but I think I was just full by time this came..=P It was medium rare, but may have been too rare for me. 

Dessert - If you love dessert, this was the BOMB! It was a tasting menu of dessert - blood orange bon bon, old fashion root beer float with 2 chocolate chip cookie, brownie with ice cream, and I think 2 other ones that I can't remember. 

I was overly stuff by the end of the meal! It was so good!

I had the The Blu which has this wonderful chicken and cheese combination inside. It was delicious and went great with the sweet soft taste of the bun. It really complements each other well. I also had the Piz-a-pizza which is filled with pepperoni slices and a nice marinara sauce. My personal favorite is the truffle mac and cheese. Its just full of that cheesy goodness that keeps you wanting more and more! Also, good thing to know is that they do take card.

I think this place is in dire need of a makeover. The carpets are whacked out with ugly designs and the place is just boring and bland. There's just nothing here that makes you say, ""Wow"" besides the fact that it is huge. 

Here are some tips about the convention center though, whether you're attending a conference or working there:

Cabs will always take longer than you suspect, so always leave a little early. This goes the same for the monorail.

The layout of the convention center makes for long hikes to and fro. Expect to be walking - a lot. So ladies, just leave the heels at home.

The food choices are blah - Nathan's Hot Dogs and the over-priced Banners place will have you spending about $10+ for a meal with a drink included. Oh, there's also a bunch of Starbucks set up offering half of what a typical Starbucks offers with a pricier price tag - of course!

It can go from freezing to stifling hot, so bring differing types of clothing.

Parking is ridiculous. Especially if you're working here, you don't want to spend $10 to park! No siree! On smaller conventions try the Hilton Sports Book off of Joe W. Brown (runs behind the convention center), but not for bigger conventions - they will be charging for parking. Also try parking lots by the Riviera - sometimes you'll be able to get free parking. OR for big conventions try the street parking to the West of the Convention Center up Paradise Road. There are a few streets where on-street parking is available. Believe me, walking a little bit is worth not getting hit with a parking ticket!

Lastly, I always say be safe when leaving the Convention Center. I don't think it is in the best part of town. Do pairs, go in groups, just don't walk by yourself. 

That's it, I can't think of anything else to say. :)",2011-06-29 23:42:09

That being said, there is always a restaurant.com or groupon posted so make sure you take advantage of one of these as it seems to get them back in line with appropriate pricing.

I will say that I've had some real hits and misses off of their menu.  The real hidden gems are their specials.  I've had some real amazing stuff off of that menu.  Make sure you either ask your waiter/waitress or check the chalkboard at the back of the restaurant.

So, my reason for 3 stars instead of 4 is primarily due to their slow service.  EVERY time I come to this place, my food takes a small eternity.   Not overly full, seems appropriately staffed...why is my food taking this long!?!

Since my restaurant experience is limited to Diner Dash.  I'd say upgrade your stove.

Has your standard Thai dishes. My favourites are the islamic noodles (not on the menu), and green curry. I always ask for 3 chilis as even the 2 chili which they say is ""hot"" is not even mild imo. 

One downfall and the reason for 4 stars and not 5 - the food doesn't always come out piping hot. On more than one occasion it was served luke warm and although the taste was still great, it needs to be hot and steamy for it to be perfect.

Ok, that isn't all I can say, but wow, this place was extremely good, especially for a brand new restaurant. They already have it together. The decor of this restaurant is cute, they have a wall covered in 8 tracks and everything has a 70's vibe. I said the bathroom was like the Jetsons because it is decorated with 70's flair, but has all modern technology (I don't think I had to touch a handle or button in the place...). 

More importantly, the food was very good and made with local ingredients. I had the breakfast sandwich (at the waitress's recommendation, go waitress!) and it was pretty fabulous. Melt in your mouth short rib that is bursting with flavor served with an over easy egg (that's the way it comes! I know!), tomato jam for a savory and slightly sweet touch, all served on a soft sweet bun. Absolutely wonderful! It came with a small portion of nicely cooked potatoes with peppers and onions (which were especially good when put on the sandwich). The husband had the pancakes, which tasted homemade.... and not 'homemade' from a box. The portion was huge, 3 giant pancakes... he couldn't finish them. 

Service was good, though the waitress couldn't tell me what kind of coffee they use (it was pretty good, though) and asked if we wanted cream, 1/2 and 1/2 or milk.... we said cream and got milk (ha!), but little things like that will get ironed out I'm sure. The prices here were fairly steep, breakfast was over 30$ with tax and tip, but the quality warranted (to some degree) the price (plus they bring out the check inside of an old book.... that definitely softens the blow of the price, ha!).

I'm torn writing this because I have mixed reviews on different components of the restaurant.

Ambiance:  4 Stars
This place is full of energy, yet remains classy and trendy.  It's filled with attractive people which helps cover for the poor food.  The DJ plays great music, but be prepared to yell to talk with you dinner guests.

Service:  3 Stars
Service wasn't memorable.  Average for a fine dining restaurant.

Food:  2 Stars
Portions are small and the food is decent.  I had higher expectations given the STK brand.  I've had better food at steakhouses at a 1/4 of the prices at STK.

Value:  3 Stars
Expect to pay over $50 a person on average.  This ranking is based on the average of the three scores above.

This is a great place to start your evening as a pre-party for a long Saturday night. Alternatively, great place to end your evening with some energy on a weekday.  Avoid STK if you are looking for a quiet intimate evening or to walk away with a full belly.  I highly recommend STK for the atmosphere, not the food.",2012-08-16 07:39:56

Papaxpisx4Q77HN7XnpMYg,957fCi00p079PQJWKyw4Eg,e6UDJBEIoXBbnXtdwkqIGA,2,9,1,1,"Came across a blogTO post couple days ago introducing this very new restaurant from Taiwan - Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken.  They claimed to be one of the street food that you must get at the Taipei's Shilin Night Market.  I was very curious on the taste and size of their chicken, and here I am on the third day of their soft opening.

Arrived at 10:50am, there was already a short lineup. I was the sixth person in line, so it wasn't that bad.  After taking a couple pictures outside and reading their poster menu, it was already 11am, and I couldn't wait to get in.  Little did I know, they were not ready for customers, we had to wait outside until 11:15am to get in.

After getting into the restaurant, the staff made us wait for another 10 minutes to start taking orders.  They did not inform the customers why or what we are waiting for, but all I see are the floor staff standing around behind the cashier counter.

Anyhow, as I was waiting I learned a little bit more about this restaurant and their chicken.  Each piece of chicken is freshly fried upon order for 7 minutes, so that they are remain fresh and crispy.  In addition, they do not cut the chicken into little bite size pieces for you, as they want to maintain the juiciness and moisture of the chicken.  

Here's a closer look at their menu.  As you can see only the Original Large Fried Chicken is available.  I was told by the cashier that they are limiting to only one order per customer.  I was surprised that there were no signs or notices in the restaurant stating that.  I also wanted to try out their Fried King Oyster Mushroom, but it was unavailable. 

Their pick up area is nice and clean with a huge logo.  I didn't have to wait for the full 7 mins for my chicken to be ready, it was more like 2-3 minutes.  They also have a promotion right now, all fried chicken comes with a free soft drink.  But I still think it's over priced - $9.99 + HST for a piece of fried chicken and a soft drink (this is equivalent to buying 3 pieces of chicken in Taiwan).

Not going to lie, their Original Large Fried Chicken is very delicious.  It's crispy on the outside, while the inside still remains tender and moist.  Definitely one of the best street food I have ever had.

In general, I did not have a great experience at my time visiting this restaurant.  I felt like everything was out of place.  The staff were not well trained.  During my 50 minutes at the restaurant, I spent over 40 minutes waiting because they were not ready to open.  The rating that I gave to them was solely on the taste of their chicken.

TIPS:
-if you would like to try out everything on their menu, I would highly suggest you to visit them at a later time (maybe in a month or so, when they are more settled)
-be prepared to wait in line 
-they have limited quantities of chicken, once they are sold out, they'll call it a night
-availability of their menu is subject to change without notice",2015-11-07 21:42:06

(Can you tell I love bubble tea? Seriously, it's like a drink and a snack all in one.) I first tried bubble tea at Bubble Island in University Square/East Campus Mall, and since that went south, I've been searching for bubble tea. And then Steepery came, and I found it. 

Of course, there are other things to love about Steepery too - mainly the multitude of flavors they offer as add-ins. Where else in the central downtown area can you get a lavender chai latte? Also, Steepery's refreshingly tech-savvy for a local shop - they've got an iPad cash register, Belly rewards app, WiFi, all that fun stuff.

Only thing I don't like (and this may have changed since the last time I was there)? No gift cards. Instead, they do it by pots of tea - you can buy 10 pots, 20, etc. I'd prefer a traditional dollar-amount gift card option, if they haven't started doing it already.

Well, I was correct. 

As soon as we walked in, the aromas of the masalas were amazing. 
It's hard to screw up Indian food - but it's been done, especially in the hip/trendy areas of the city; but I knew that these guys had it nailed as soon as we walked in. 

The service was excellent - our server was on point all evening - and it was packed in there. 

I'm not going to go through all of the dishes, because I think everything is good on the menu.

Our group gave them a 3.25, which I'm rounding down to a 3. 

We were seated quickly and ordered a round of the grand canyon margaritas. We were brought chips and salsa, which unfortunately was the best tasting thing we ate at the restaurant. I had the carnitas taco, which was sadly underwhelming. The pork wasn't too flavorful. Jon had the corn crusted calamari. I don't have a calamari palate so I can't rank it against anything, but he said it was just average. The drinks however were BOMB (margarita with cranberry, lime, and prickly pear juice), both frozen and iced. Our server was super sweet and chatted it up with us which was nice. I don't know if I'd make the trip back for dinner, but if I was in the area I'd definitely come back for a margarita and some appetizers.",2011-12-04 01:55:36

Since we've never been here, thought we gave it a try, man was it a disappointment.  I am definitely surprised the rating is so high. I mean, there's nothing great I can find to say that's exceptional.  I really try to look for something positive.

Price: 0/5
Generally, I don't care about price if the food and service is good. About $17 for 10 pieces of horrible buffalo wings and about $26 for a horrible mixed chicken & beef fajitas is def expensive.

Service: 1/5
Our server was actually friendly, we don't deal with her much right after she took our order. Except when she bring us our bill. But what makes their service so bad? No Chips, in addition, they nickel & dime you to death. Even charge you for salsa. WTF? I have never came to a Mexican restaurant with no courtesy chips and salsa. Also, took forever to get our salsa and when we finally got it, it tasted horrible.

Quality: 0/5
NO Bueno! The buffalo wings were salty as hell and had a peanut taste to it. Kinda weird, tasted like a Thai Chicken Sate. Just doesn't taste right on buffalo wings. The fajitas was also gross, way too much paprika powder. Tasted like I was sniffing someone's bad armpit the entire time.

Quantity: 3/5
They do give you a lot of food, I am assuming it appears there was a lot because it tasted so crappy, I left a lot behind.

Cleanliness: 3/5
Not immaculate or nothing spectacular, but definitely not dirty, just a Meets standard rating.

If you still want to try this place out, at least get a Groupon special. Personally, even with the discount, I still don't think it's worth it.",2017-11-19 23:15:26

I had a steak burger, cooked medium (blech) salad and beans. 

Salad, sad little boring salad with packaged Blue cheese, even though they serve blue cheese crumbles as a topping for the burger. 

Burger was fried, I would say well done but still juicy, no seasoning.

Beans were wonderful.

It was a hot mid-August Saturday afternoon. When we came in, there were a few other customers indulging in what looked like promising delicious ice cream. We ordered a medium ($6.29) cool mint ice cream with chocolate fudge sauce and kit kat and skor mix-ins scooped into a white chocolate-dipped waffle cone. 

It was disappointing - the mix-ins felt sparse - I think we were given only two kit kat sticks cut in half; the cool mint ice cream itself wasn't flavourful enough - bland; the white chocolate-dipped cone (which is an extra $1.50) tasted fake and I couldn't really taste the white chocolate.

We had to pick at the cone, passing it back and forth, just to finish it... no one really wanted it but we didn't want to waste it. - something good ice cream never goes through

I honestly don't know if I'd come back... the only reason that Im giving this place two stars instead of one is because I'm basing this review on one order - maybe their other flavours are good. Maybe that just means I'll have to dish out another  $6-$9 for a ""better"" experience... although I don't think that ice cream should be this expensive in the first place.

Everyone looks and acts like they really like working there and want you to have a great experience. And then the food. You know how it is when you get your food and when they place it in front of you your eyes widen and you get this big smile. And then you take your first bite, and you close your eyes and you take a moment to enjoy the party going on in your mouth and you can't wait to have the person your with try it. Well none of that happened last night at The Upton. When we walked in the feeling was sad, depressed. The greeter who initially looked at us for what felt like a long time before coming over. I had told them when I made the reservation that we were coming to celebrate our 39th anniversary. The greeter says happy anniversary in a flat affect and tone. I have to tell you we went there because their web page stated they had fixed up their patio, and it was specifically designed to provide a welcoming and heat resistant patio due to improvements they had made. They were also having a special menu trying out new items, and there were items on their regular menu I was interested in. Well the patio looked nothing like the picture on the webpage. It was a narrow space along the side of the building. And the special feature to provide a heat resistant patio was an old portable evaporative unit that made metal clanking noises. The walls were full of spider webs and looked like it hadn't been cleaned or painted in a while. The person who waited on us was ok. She didn't do anything wrong, but there was no energy, friendliness, interest. And of course the food. It wasn't bad, it was OK. We had duck confit wings. That was good, but what isn't when it's fried. Everything else was Ok. But nothing that made me say to my wife, ""you have to try this""!!!

Dinner was quite good.  We ordered three a la carte dishes...Szechwan string beans with shrimp and tofu, eggplant with sliced pork, and garlic chicken.  We also had some free egg rolls as part of a Yelp check-in offer.  All of the dishes were flavorful, well portioned, and came out piping hot.

On our second visit, we came during lunch time but debated on whether we should just stick to the a la carte items or try their lunch specials.  Since the lunch prices are quite cheap, we decided to try the lunch specials.  Mistake.  I had the curry tofu with vegetables lunch special which also came with fried rice, an egg roll, a crab puff, and hot and sour soup.  The meal was very bland.  The fried rice is basically just steamed rice and soy sauce.  The food was disappointing considering how good our previous dinner had been.

With that being said, I would like to talk in depth about the management and how much they care. Had a personal conversation with the manager about how this place started off rocky and they'd like to fix it. This store is all about community out reach and families. I fully enjoyed about how they do specials for students, teachers, parties, and the school district. As someone who works with children they give free tours and free pizza coupons to the kids to show them behind the scenes in pizza making. They showed me such coupons they can make, for example student of the month, perfect attendance, happy birthday, Etc. 

While there I tried the AYCE salad bar, which was very fresh. I loved the spinach, romaine, carrots, bacon crumbles, broccoli, tomatoes and mushrooms. The potato salad and fresh fruit is a nice touch. Can't beat that for 7.95.

During the week they have a lunch special of pizza salad and drink for 7.95. 

My daughter was impressed with their pizza. She's huge on pepperoni and they didn't skimp out on the toppings. I personally thought there was too much pepperoni but she called me crazy. 
I loved the dough. It was very cool to see them tossing in the air the fresh dough for the next pizzas. 

They deliver which is quick and easy. You can even order online. They have specials if you buy in bulk which is perfect for parties or my staff meetings.

This being Vegas and all, summer without AC=miserable. They opened up the doors eventually to let in some air.

I ordered an iced caramel machiato and a green tea crepe cake. The coffee was nothing special but I really enjoyed my cake! One good thing about Asian bakeries, in my opinion, is that the desserts are never overly sweet. I was able to taste the green tea without it being hidden behind sugar. The presentation is super cute too. My friend custom ordered honey toast with berries, pocky and a bunch of other toppings and a custom coffee as well. The worker was kind enough to make her a second drink in case she didn't like the first. We both thought the honey toast was good but we had to eat the ice cream part pretty fast due to the heat.

We ordered the ebi shooter which everyone raved about, the rock shrimp tuna roll, lobster and shrimp dumplings and the albacore truffle roll. Ebi shooter did not live up to expectations. I don't understand how it's $14 when they simply put together a piece of shrimp, avocado, mango and tempura bits wrapped in soy paper. Nothing special. 

The dumplings were a joke. Essentially 2 har gows for $8 dollars but worst part is that har gows are even tastier at a Shanghai 360 at the mall food court or a mediocre Chinese restaurant. Biggest rip off. 

Now onto the rolls which was the ultimate failure and disappointment. This was probably one of the worst rolls I've ever eaten and I am a huge fan of maki rolls. The rice was COMPLETE mush. You can't even see the separate grains of rice. The rock shrimp roll was slightly better only because the rock shrimp was bigger than the roll itself and its taste overpowered the pathetic tuna wrapped in my half rice porridge. But the albacore truffle was just a disaster. I swear the quality is worse than all you can eat maki rolls. Even Loblaws sushi is probably better. At least they can make some decent rice.

I'd like to stress that I am more than willing to spend money on food. Even if it is small portions, it is not of concern as long as the quality is up to par and can justify the price. In this case, it did not. Even the presentation was very amateur. The complimentary yam chips or whatever was probably the yummiest thing we had there.

Aside from that, service wasn't an issue. They were very accommodating and apologetic when we made a complaint about the rolls. They remade it but the rice was still just as terrible. Just by looking at it, I didn't even want to try it. Took one bite and got my confirmation. We asked them to take it back, manager came out and they were kind enough to take it off our bill which we did appreciate.

Bottom line is that this place needs to get a new chef, change the menu or reposition itself somehow. Looking trendy and posh isn't going to cut it anymore when the sushi scene has become so big and competitive in Toronto. With players like Ki, Yuzu no Hana, JaBistro and Kasa Moto just to name a few, I can't see Blowfish surviving for very long. One thing for sure is that I won't be back. Ever.",2015-07-18 08:49:26

The rest of the staff is hit or miss. Today I stood waiting for soup for a really long time while those making salads stood there chatting, I counted 6 folks not doing anything while I stood there waiting. Finally the cashier came over, apologized and scooped me some soup. 
This happens often, no one is very attentive. The food is always consistent but service isn't.

I often get the Greek salad with no olives. So I tell the first guy no olives, then he hands the box with lettuce to the second person and says greek with no olives, she repeats ""greek with no olives"" then puts olives in the box. I then have to tell them I don't want olives and they always seem surprised despite the fact they repeated my order. This happens ALL THE TIME.

If you are looking for alternatives to the abundance of sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto, or on a budget and looking for a quick meal, I suggest you give this place a try.

-Takowasa - $3.99: If you don't know what Takowasa is, it's a bowl of chopped raw octopus smothered in a ""pickled"" wasabi sauce. The octopus was chewy, but hard, slimy (in a good way) and full of wasabi heat. I doubt the restaurant used fresh wasabi for this dish, as the octopus was extremely spicy and left this ""burning"" aftertaste in my mouth. So really, I wish they would have served this with seaweed, as the salty seaweed would help to cut down the spiciness. 

-Chawan Mushi - $3.99: Chawan mushi is an egg-custard dish, and when made properly the egg should have a silky and barely set, or quivering texture. This Chawan Mushi was quite different, in terms of texture, from a chawan mushi that I had previously. This was really watery and too bland for my taste, I don't recommend it at all.

-Hotate rice (Rice bowl topped with scallop and egg) - $8.99: the hotate rice tasted just like an okonoyami on top of rice. Also, there weren't many pieces of scallop, anyhow it was $9, I don't think you can expect much

-Salami Curry - $6.49: Manpuku's signature curry sauce on a bed of rice, with toppings such as pan-fried salami, ketchup, mayo -  sounds like a weird combination but somehow it works! The curry had a thicker texture than other curries I have had before, and the ketchup sweetened up the curry. The salami provided some saltiness and spicy to the dish, which in turn added a great depth of flavor that's unique to the curry",2015-05-13 16:30:27

The staff at the concession stand was awesome!  They were really funny and you could tell that they loved their job.
The theater itself was nice.  Not stadium seats, which all the big theaters have.  We got seats close to the front, because it was *that* crowded and there were 3 of us.  Try finding 3 seats together on a Sunday afternoon!

I love salsa.  Pedro's lets me pretend like I am actually making my own salsa (this is a good thing) by bringing three different salsas with varying flavors and spiciness.  They will give you countless amounts, which is a plus.  The added bonus is, of course, that everyone at the table can be happy with whether the salsa is mild, medium or hot by having their own bowl to mix it all in.

I have only had the San Marcos Enchilada dinner on my three visits and enjoyed it thoroughly each and every time.  It has this yummy jalapeno sauce that I love.  My companions usually get something basic- a burrito, enchiladas or a salad and are happy with it.  I haven't heard any real complaints.

As other reviews state, the store is clean, well lit, well laid and out with plenty of aisle space. To my count, there were at least seven ethnicities of groceries substantively represented: Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian and Hispanic.

But the downside of having so much variety in other than a megasize box store, is that you cannot carry every popular item from every ethnicity.  (As a famous comedian once quipped, ""you can't have everything. Where would you put it?"")

So it was with my Korean rice cakes.  Still, I got a few other fun things and there is plenty of cooking eye candy to give you loads of culinary ideas and inspiration - - all at very reasonable prices.

They have a nice big sign out front with plenty of parking and accommodations for our mobility challenged friends. 

Pro tip: credit card purchases must exceed $10.

Worth a stop if you are in the area. If you were closer to the near west side, I also suggest you visit the A-Mart  on the northwest corner of Odana Rd. at the Whitney Way intersection in that little strip mall. (They had my goods today).

We had to to the training first since I have never climbed before and we were slightly annoyed since the session was full of people and it took a really long time for the other people to get the concept of belaying and getting the ropes tied properly. I would recommend trying to find out when they are the least busy so you can get a quicker training done.

Rock climbing is a great work out but I would recommend everyone try it at least once. I can see how easily people can get addicted to this activity. It's a lot of fun but very hard.

After a bad experience a couple years back I decided to give it another try.  What I experienced on a Saturday night was deplorable.  Just as before, the service was anything but the friendly, welcoming atmosphere that goes with real Irish pubs.  Bartenders don't have to have a big phony smile but neither do they have to act like taking a simple drink order for one person is a huge, painful ordeal.  Then, as I was watching a closely contested sporting contest on one of their TVs, the place without warning turned into a cheesy dance club complete with unnecessarily risque and provocative images across the TV screens and songs with distasteful lyrics.   This type of objectification of women has no place in an establishment that advertises itself as an Irish pub.  Not surprisingly, it seemed to attract some low level rift raft with poor manners and objectionable attitudes.

After a previous bad review, management did respond and asked for some feedback.  I'm ready to offer that now.  My feedback is this.  Close this place down!  Right now!  Okay that's a bit extreme.  How about then changing the name at least away from an Irish Pub?  As a gesture of goodwill, I'm come up with a number of suggestions for a new name.

Their chips and salsa are pretty standard. My favorite dish, however, was a sampler platter that had miniature versions of practically everything (mini chimi, tamales etc). Much to my dismay, they removed it from the menu several months ago. Thankfully, the servers assured me that it could still be made quite easily on request. During our most recent visit, however, things seemed to take a turn for the worse.

I inquired about the combo platter, but was told by the server that they don't have that anymore and would have to order something else. I went with the significantly less exciting Tour de Macayo, while my girlfriend ordered her usual chicken enchiladas. By mistake, she received a cheese enchilada instead. When we politely said something, the server was not apologetic and seemed to ""turn off"" the hospitality button from that point on. I hate it when this happens, because you feel you're just supposed to shut up and take what you get.  

On the other hand, my ""tour"" had a pretty decent cheese enchilada and small chimichanga. However, the rice and beans tasted way off. Well, actually, the beans didn't taste like anything at all, while the rice possessed that ""old grease"" aftertaste that just ruins the dish completely. But after what happened with the cheese enchilada, I decided that it was best just to keep quiet.

Side Note: Macayo's actually makes a very good fried ice cream for dessert, but since our server rushed us off with the bill and didn't bother inquiring about dessert, we went to get ice cream elsewhere.

I'll be honest. When Macayo's is ""on,"" they're usually fairly decent with their service and food. But if they're not on top of things, the inconsistencies reveal themselves and you wind up leaving rather disappointed.",2016-07-05 16:18:03

I must say, common market is an amazing local staple. Half of the fun is educating yourself on the astute choices of brews to choose from. You just seem to feel like branching out and trying a micro/craft brew that you've never heard of before. Or, for the hipster at heart, grab a PBR and join the crowd. Their selection varies, so be sure to check back for seasonals and different locales to be featured/available.

I love the giant drums of beer and glass bottled coke throughout the shop as well. Makes it feel less like grocery-esque for a quick grab n' go. 

The deli is a phenomenon. Friendly for the typical sandwich aficionado and the vegan/veggie types. The flavors and combinations are endless and the deft hands of the deli staff move the lines faster than other places. 

Gotta love the niche humor and accessories/toys for sale. Always good for a gag gift or oddly celebrated white elephant party in July. 

Something for everyone here. Grab a six pack to go, a draught with friends or snackage for the road. 

Never a dull moment for this plaza midwood hearth. Always a pleasure to visit.

Only difference between this location and plaza midwood is the outdoor seating. Gotta love those nights out in southend sitting outside. Another perk? There's an apple tree in the courtyard.

It is open early to feed my caffeine needs when I proctor an early morning exam on a Saturday, and open later than anything else (besides GVR and restaurants) when I need to meet someone.  

Sunday I met a friend for a group project at 8.  Yesterday I was walking around to see the Halloween craziness and ran into Eric R. (yes, my own husband, but he had gone running and had stopped in CBTL because he saw one of our friends in line).  Once I got in, I saw 2 of Eric's coworkers in line too!  It was madness (and i was a fairy...people kept hitting my wings!! ahh)

Anyway, this location is cooler than other CBTL locations because it has way more iced teas already brewed every day.  Most locations have 3 (black, green and flavored) but this one has at least 6.  I have lately preferred going grassy green with Genmaicha Green, but I have a soft spot for Japanese Cherry and when I feel like having them fresh brew me something, it is always the Vanilla Ceylon (drinking a cookie, but sugar and calorie free!)

The manager Stacy is super nice as is the rest of the staff.  I shouldn't let out my secret but their granola tastes like it is laced with amaretto or some liquor.  It is really good (you can get it in a parfait or just by itself!)",2011-11-01 15:55:31

The menu was interesting with seasonal fare, but made sharing a bit difficult. The waitress was kind enough to inform us there was only two pieces of halibut left and if we want them, she'll reserve it. I took her up on that option. We order drinks and appetizers and we're set. The soup I got was an asparagus cold soup, perfect for the hot summer weather. It's creamy and good, a little heavy but doable. The entrees arrive and the halibut was cooked well, with a slight crispy crunch. As for the side of grits, I'm appalled to say it was grits. I grew up in the south and that was not creamy. It was a very strange interpretation.

We enjoyed our medium-well  burgers but next time we'll probably go with medium being that the patty could've been juicer.  But still, not bad. We split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. The Fun-ghi burger was absolutely delicious! You can taste the truffle in every bite. Truffle and Gruyere cheese in the same burger? Perfection! The Gold Standard is their most popular burger and I can see why. They took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. First, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. Second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! Lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave the burger a lot of flavor. Bacon, bacon, bacon! And for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. Ah-maze-ing! This changed the whole dynamic of the burger! Honestly, I don't even remember what the buns were like because I was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. The only downside to our meal was that I was so excited to have the ""unndon"" cake for dessert that I skipped on the raved about shakes. I came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. Seriously?! Until they bring that back I am not returning. Take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? If you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. Sorry. We ended up getting the Dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 I love anything DDL and #2 it said it had Frosted Flakes cereal in/on. Normally, I wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the Godiva or S'mores ones from The Cheesecake Factory but the description made this one hard to skip. It had the perfect consistency, too! The densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed gingerbread man and snicker doodle cookies. Salivating much? For the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, FF cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it.

Well, Edison's is that kind of bar. Don't come in here in your Sunday's Best people. This is a chill, down-to-earth bar that doesn't give a hoot about your expensive shoes or outfit. Just come up to the bartender and know a little about good beer. Otherwise, you'll probably get an eye-roll real quick. 

This dark, wooden neighborhood pub may have a no-frills policy when it comes to looks, but when it comes to beers they have the best of the best. Talk about coolers lit up and lined with mircos, imports and barley-pop yumminess. If you normally have to compromise with your brew choices at bars, you won't have to here. 

Can we take a moment to talk about the patio? Good, because this thing is huge. It's like sitting in someone's back yard. Have your pup with you? Bring 'em on in! Edison's is pretty dog friendly too, as long as you're outside on the patio. 

Another plus? If you tend to get hungrier as you drink, Edison's pops up some popcorn and has some tasty pizza next door to nosh on. Talk about making this girl happy. Laid back bar with good beer, good pizza and popcorn? I'll be there. 

If you enjoy loud live music, Ed's usually has a band crammed into the front part of the bar for your listening pleasure. It depends on what kind of mood I'm in, but you can always move towards the back of the bar if that's not your thing. Plus, I'm pretty sure they have pool tables as well.

I was in the hood so I wanted to check out Sugar Marmalade through my YEA.

Would highly recommend that you share the shaved ice dessert as I think the portion size is quite generous for one person.

The mango black pearl dessert was good and as it promised, it was heavy with the mango pulp/juice as the base with chunks of ripe mango floating within

The cafe looks very clean and modern with lots dessert-related phrases on the walls that lend it a cozy and jovial atmosphere that is all about desserts.  Their menu is expansive and covers all manner of Asian-style desserts.

I enjoy the banchans and while the service can sometimes be slow, they are generally nice enough. My banchans never get refilled but the portions (and my order choices, in general) provide me with plenty of food so it's not a problem.

The food is on the pricey side for Korean food but given the location, I can understand. I think their tempura is great value - though I wish they'd give you more dipping sauce and in a larger container. I've never been disappointed with their bibimbaps. I love that they serve them in the hot stone bowls that actually can make your rice crispy at the end if you smush it into the bowl as you eat. The gochujang sauce is tasty without being too spicy (for me - and I'm a lightweight when it comes to spice). Would love to try their bossam one day if I can round up enough people to come with me. 

I've come here a few times when I wanted to go to Japango for their cold soba with tempura but either the restaurant had a ridiculous wait or I didn't want to shell out that kind of money (because Japango is even pricier than here). Never been disappointed!

Tip: The regular bibimbap actually does come with meat - the menu makes it look like there's no beef, but there is. I think it's adequate and tasty, which is why I don't think the bulgogi bibimbap is really worth the premium price. (Also, I feel there's too much meat in it.) It's nice that you can add cheese to the bibimbaps too, if you're feeling extra decadent!

The smell was very alluring as soon as we parked our car in the parking lot. You could smell the broth cooking up because we all know for pho lovers- it is all about the broth.
We had the spring rolls, the nem nuong rolls and the #12 flank steak. Spring rolls were so so kinda over cooked. They are known for the nem nuong rolls which were good but a little too sweet for my liking. Everyone else loved it. As for the most important part, the pho. Kinda a little bit of meat about 8 pieces. The broth was also a little sweet as well. But I do love pho and I ate it all, esp with extra green onions.
Def recommended. Pretty cheap. Most items were from 3-11$ 
Probably will come here again.",2015-08-08 03:54:52

My guest and I were seated right after a supremely difficult woman, the type that just makes a fuss about everything. This made for some interesting dinner conversation, to say the least, and the staff seemed to handle her well. Their effort was certainly better than I could have ever attempted! I came to the conclusion throughout dinner that our waiter was not supposed to be taking care of our section but was just picking up the slack for another waiter or trying to get some extra tables. Even despite this, I am certain I will be back.

First off, the bread is sourdough! Any restaurant that has a default option of sourdough bread, sign me up because sourdough bread is so yummy! I had the lobster & shrimp fettucini while my guest had a chopped salad. The other reviews don't lie when they praise the chopped salad here! The shrimp and lobster pasta was as good as any I have ever head but still when I come back I think I will order a chopped salad. On the menu it is $5 and comes as a side, so maybe order two and ask them to combine it into a bowl. I am honestly surprised there is no entree option for this salad but I guess most people don't come to an Italian restaurant to have their cheapest salad option.

It has everything I love in a coffee shop, excellent coffee, yummy food, good music, and interesting people to watch. I ordered a sugar free caramel vanilla latte and a   croissant sandwich. I was super jazzed that they have several sugar free options. My coffee came out with a beautiful design in the foam. It was so pretty and tasted just as good as it looked. Next my sandwich came out. The croissant was flakey and buttery. It was filled with egg, avocado, tomato, lettuce and Veggie mayo. They even spelled out smile with a design of a kitty on my plate in veggie mayo. I enjoyed the sandwich and would totally try all the other items on the menu. 

If you find worn chairs and tables endearing like I do you won't be put off by the comfy chairs. They have places for you to plug in your lap top or just to charge your phone.

The food definitely lived up to the hype!

What finally made me cave and try it? I saw an article on some local news site about their grilled cheese. They use Barely Buzzed cheddar which is cheddar cheese rubbed with espresso and lavender and a gooey truffle spread. I saw this sandwich and knew immediately that I had to eat it for lunch, so I made reservations for this afternoon and IT WAS AWESOME.

My husband and I also shared the tuna tartare, which was super fresh and tasty and delicious. I am a sucker for any mixture of raw fish and avocado. The crisp flatbread they serve to start was very nice, too.

The not-so-great: service was a liiiitle slow and my jalapeno bloody mary was TINY for a $10 drink (though tasty).

Deliciousness - 5/5.

Oh my gosh you guys. Ohmygosh! I can't help but add to the insane amount of hype for this place. Kai earns it all, and more.

First, I'm not an elitist snobby guy. Like some of you, I rolled my eyes when reading the reviews calling it an ""experience."" Well - shame on me. It absolutely lives up to the billing.

The service is top notch. Artistic menus, gorgeous scenery outside of giant picture windows, staff all along the walls, finding a way to meet dietary needs, and then fresh (and free) biscuits and bottled water in my car when we were done (we didn't even have to call the valet, they do it for you). But what makes it an experience, beyond the out-of-this-world service, is that they try to engage all your senses. Calming Native American music. They brought out a basket of herbs that they poured hot tea on that filled (and cleansed) your nose and that activated dry ice to entice your eyes. How's that for an experience?!

I've focused so much on the service, but the food lives up to the rating and the price. The foie gras really is to die for. My wife is pretty ""meh"" about foie gras, and ended up eating more than I did (to my chagrin). They gave us a free dessert and palate cleansers, which was so generous. I had the bison, which was probably the best cuts of bison I've ever had.

Found them on Groupon, and went there. We went in pretty late for Dinner, they were cheerful at 9 pm on a Saturday night. They are open only for the past two months the owner said. Friendly bunch of folks, wife and I were pleasantly surprised.

South Indian food is different, has a distinct flavor very unlike the north Indian curry.  People who are used to the rich curry will be in for a surprise, so if this is your first time, find a South Indian dude (or dudette) and get some background, suspect that might be the reason for the bad reviews here...

First things first- there are a lot of Hot Dogs to choose from. A Hot Dog carnoisseur would know that they're not all create equal, so if you're looking for your standared 8 pack from the grocery store, keep it pushing.

FOOD: 
As I was saying, the Dogs are too notch! Some firmness to the meat helps keep everything (toppings) together. There's just a bit of resistance when you bite into the them, bit the give with a little juicy ""pop"" almost immediately. I go for the Chili Cheese Dog w/ Onions 99% of the time but on days when I want a ""standard"" dog, the original is still completely satisfying. Poppet seed buns, mustard, sweet peppers, relish, rotmstoe and onion are what Hot Dogs are suppose to be. Couple them with fresh cut fries and drink you got yourself a perfect meal for under $10

The Filet Mignon sandwiches from the appetizer menu (regularly 4/$16) have good quality meat but very little of the mustard-mayo and thus little moisture. Ask for Dijon on the side. The Crabcake BLT sliders ($17?) were a hit though, would get them again if we came back. 

The Caesar Salad ($13) is huge, but oddly doesn't come with anchovies unless you specifically ask for them, which we found bizarre. The $15 Baked Five Onion soup was packed with onions, but the broth lacked depth and frankly the portion was worth half the price. Literally every other French onion soup I've had in Vegas (including on the Strip) has been cheaper and better than this one, and usually larger.

I've had the trout, which was good, but still not on par with M n' P. I've also dived into their breads, which are very good. But I feel like I'm still looking for something to set them apart. I know it will happen... or hope at least!

But the drinks... Oh the drinks! They are spectacular! I mean, I want to drink there every night. Which would probably mean I have a problem... but it's just so good. I'm so into the Boulavardier. I can't help but get that every time I'm there. I know I need to branch out though, I realize I'm tying myself down. But sometimes I can't help myself!

The attention to detail in decor is incredible. It makes me feel like I'm in a secluded writer's cabin, if you ignore all the people eating and drinking inside. I love the squirrels on the wall and the little corner with the desk and typewriter. Every time I'm there I find some other little bobble or decoration to admire.

The one negative is the bathroom. As everyone else has noted, it is... interesting. I get it. It's supposed to be like stalls in a barn. I know, you can lock the door so that no one can get in, even though there's two stalls. But you don't learn that you can lock the door until you've been in there a handful of times. If you're the lucky one who doesn't know, you're sure to get a peak at something you might not want to see or someone will get a looksie at your goodies. Just bein' honest folks.

The restaurant is located just at the end of the building and entrance is from the outside so if you are parking underground, you'll need step back outside to get to the restaurant.

It's very bright and spacious place so you'll feel very comfortable as soon as you walk in.

In the years since their opening, my excitement has been replaced with increasing disappointment. I didn't buy my car here so my review only reflects my experience with their service/parts department.

Though I hate to say it because their location is so convenient, Findlay's service is not up to par with other Acura dealerships. I have been 4 different Acura dealerships since having my TSX (2 in Socal, the 2 here in town) and Findlay ranks a distant 4th... =(.

Taking my car to their service department feels like going to the doctor for a headache and coming out with brain cancer. Each time I have brought my car in, the service writers have come up with a laundry list of problems and push to have you spend big $$$ on minor repairs. Taking the TSX in for a standard oil change resulted recommendations for a $850 tires (I got them for under $600 at Discount Tire Co.), and $630 maintenance package which included 2 fluid flushes (transmission, and power steering), a tire rotation, and the ""inspection"" of many various belts/parts. I can understand dealerships charging a little extra as they are the ""official spot"" but $600+ for 2 fluid flushes is insane.

Each time I have been, I left with the impression that my car was about to break down agree to the expensive service/repairs. Subsequent trips to Hondatronics and Las Vegas Acura alleviate the fear. The writers here like other places make commission of their service orders, but Findlay really writes you up for every single little thing.

The availability of loaners is rare. Unless you are leaving your car in over night, it is unlikely they will hand over a loaner for a few hours service appointment which means you are going to be stuck in waiting area. The area itself is pretty small and is nothing like what you would expect from a luxury car manufacturer. Find another spot for service, you will save money and be treated better.",2013-03-20 10:01:55

There's nothing worse than paying top-shelf prices for poorly executed food, and I'm happy to report that this place was great.  After a comical adventure exploring what seemed like the entire reservation, we had a meal to remember.

Wife was a bit worried by the steak-heavy menu, but those worries proved totally unfounded.  We split the crab dip, a house salad, a scallop dish, and the gnocchi.

Each dish was well-portioned, well-prepared, and expertly seasoned.  The scallops were seared just-so; the top crispy, the rest of the scallop slightly chewy and smooth.  The bed of greens they sat upon were a perfect contrast, and the accompanying potatoes mirrored the scallops: slightly crispy on the outside, smooth and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside.  Every few bites had a bit of cheese (gorgonzola?) that spiked the flavor-o-meter into head-explosion territory.

The gnocchi were also top-notch.  I can't lie - I dipped my finger in the bowl and licked some sauce long after the gnocchi were depleted.  Ditto for the crab dip, which wasn't heavy or gross or cheese-melty.

The house salad was also super good, though not very memorable in the face of everything else.

The complimentary black bean hummus: fantastic, as others noted.  Tasted fresh, not like it had been sitting in a vat.

The restaurant was probably only about 1/3 full and is fairly quiet compared to Brodard's. Service was decent for the most part and we kept getting water refills. When it came time to ask for our check it took a little while though because we couldn't locate anybody or get their attention. Guess it dies down here when it gets later?

Location - It's on the North end of Downtown Summerlin. There's easy parking and entertainment if you want to walk or shop off the calories after lunch or dinner. The restaurant has plenty of seats and lots of natural lights. I love sitting by the window and watching dogs walk by. 

Food - Best fried chicken in Vegas! We ordered the chicken tenders and wings during our first visit. The seasoning gives a little kick to the typical fried chicken dish. The French fries are just the right amount of crispy and there's so, so many different sauces to choose from. We also ordered the Mac n' cheese. It wasn't the most memorable dish compared to the rest but chicken and macaroni and cheese just feels right together. During our second visit we ordered the Firebird sandwich and the Rancher sandwich. The Firebird sandwich was so spicy (just the way I like it, hehe) and my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his lunch as well. The sandwich is a pretty hefty size and I could only eat about half of it. On top of that, there's special sodas and iced teas. 

Service - The cashier was really nice. He offered his recommendations and made conversation - something that a lot of people falter to do. It progressively got busier as we ate and everyone was still getting helped.

Having looked at the brunch menu, and finding it a little more enticing, I swung by looking to reevaluate my precious stance as Bluphies being a disappointment.

The verdict is I would say an upgrade from a 2 to a 3.51... so a 4 star rating it is

In short the food I ordered was much much better than the first time around. Specifically I really enjoyed the fondue with marinated pears. They were a wonderful treat, one I hope to enjoy again and again. Get the fondue appetizer next time your at bluphies!!!!

The other things ordered and were served with good presentation and flavor was the crab Benedict, stuffed french toast with blueberry compote.

So good job Bluphies, much better second time round!

The not so great was still the dessert. We ordered the chocolate cake :( I love chocolate but that was unappealing to me. Although it looks great it's way too sweet (and I don't mean rich) and thick.

My sister raves about this truck so when I came down to visit, she told me we HAD to go.  There was no need to twist my arm about it, so we tracked them down at Triple C brewery one night.  One glance at the menu and I knew what I was getting.  Their special grilled cheese for the night was a bacon, fig, and manchego grilled cheese.  The chef inside told me they put baby arugula on it as well (I'm not sure if he was just excited about the special or warning me so I knew what to expect, but either way I knew I was going to enjoy it).  

We sat down inside the brewery and they brought our sandwiches in to us.  Each box is stamped with the papi queso mustache (which is probably the cutest logo ever) and a stamp to show what sandwich you have.  I got to try a bite of everyone's sandwich at the table.  The leek and mushroom was probably my least favorite, only because I'm not a mushroom fan, but it wasn't bad at all, just not my favorite.  Third on the list was the french onion soup grilled cheese.  It had a very mellow, complex caramalized onion flavor which was really, really delicious.  I then had a bite of the sandwich they're most known for, the Pig Mac.  It's easy to see why this is a staple on their menu, pulled pork, mac and cheese, yeah, it was amazing.

But the clear winner of the night was the special.  The smokey bacon, the sweet fig, the creamy melty manchego, and the mustardy bite of the arugula all worked so perfectly together.  I may not live in Charlotte, but Papi Queso is now on my list of ""must-go"" places when I'm visiting.  And if you're reading this, add this special to your regular menu.

Quality of food and service has taken a nosedive. I did notice that it wasn't as crowded as in the past when I came here with a coworker for lunch during prime lunch hours recently and that should have been a tipoff right there that something was amiss. The restaurant was maybe half full if even that but it took forever just to order because the guy taking orders kept leaving the counter to do something else. Couple of folks were in front of us and the line moved at a snail's pace. When it was finally my turn, I ordered the Gyro sandwich and a lamb kabob on the side. Guy at the counter tried to upsell some extra sauces that I thought were way overpriced so I politely declined. Places that nickel and dime on the sauces leave a bad taste in my mouth. We sat down and waited for our food. My gyro sandwich came first. About fifteen minutes later my coworker's food came. Another fifteen minutes went by before my lamb kabob finally came. Perhaps the kitchen's timing and efficiency needs a little work. My disappointment didn't end with the service though - the vegetables in the Mediterranean salad stuffed into the Gyro sandwich tasted really off - like they were far from fresh. To add insult to injury, less than an hour later I had Alexander The Great's Revenge or Cleopatra's Curse or the King Tutskis - whatever you call food poisoning from a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean type place. Yeah - it's my fault for eating it anyway even after the warning signs went off but that is way too many strikes against this place. Never again.

I'll be upfront in saying the $6 for a single taco seems too damn high... But they do offer a lunch prix fixe for $15.99 that includes: 
-1 cob of Mexican street corn or guac and chips or the Mission salad.
-2 tacos of your choice
-Dessert (churro or paleta popsicle thing)

I've always loved the corn here, and both the Pollo Frito and Carne Asada tacos are pretty damn good tasting too. Although when I had the daily special taco that was Pulled Pork I will say I was disappointed. On the dessert front, I've tried both the Key Lime and Chocolate Peanut versions of the paleta and will concede they are a decent way to round out a meal.

But even though the food might be right near the 4 star quality mark, we are talking about a lunch that costs $21 minimum per person after tax and tip are taking into consideration, and that's not including a beverage.

For all my Vegas trips, I pretty much get a rental car, arrive at the hotel, valet the car, and I only see the car when I am checking out to head home. Why worry about drinking when you can walk or just take a cab? This way I don't have to worry about getting back to the hotel... well, at least getting the car back to the hotel.... I can't say the same for myself even if I take a cab. =)

The rooms are quite nice. Definitely in the top 2 or 3 in Vegas. The rooms are clean, the bed is soft, and housekeeping is awesome! The restaurants at the hotel are top notch (Julian Serrano is my favorite here), Liquid is great, and room service is prompt and on time.

On the last day of my stay, valet grabbed the car and unfortunately, I didn't noticed the rear passenger door had a huge scratch along the entire side of the door until refueling half way back home. Had this been my car... I would have pissed beyond belief. I am one of those people that park my car way the F out there because there are a lot of drivers who cant park right or just don't care when they open their car doors.  Fortunately, I always get the insurance on the car and Enterprise took it back with no questions asked (this really should be a review for them). Trip saved!

5 star for the hotel and 1 star for Valet being horrible. Negative stars if they knew the car was damaged and didn't say anything. Split the difference and you get 3 stars. I don't mind loosing cash gambling, eating at expensive restaurants, or dropping cash on the pool parties... but the line stops when you have to drop cash to fix your car because you used valet. 3 stars might even be too generous.",2012-11-13 16:19:08

Came for a late brunch and was pleased to see that this place serves brunch till four pm on weekends - at least an hour later than many competitors. Yay!

As I love both pulled-pork and croque madames, choosing their ''pulled pork croque madame'' sandwich was a no-brainer for me! I was really excited to try it out, but unfortunately the combination of pulled pork, fried egg, BBQ sauce and mornay was better on paper than it was in reality.

The combination of all the flavours just felt like an assault on my mouth. The pulled pork, which was marinaded in the BBQ sauce, was overkill sweet. The combination of that with the mornay sauce overpowered everything else - even the fried egg (my favourite part!!!!) I'm sure some people would appreciate the mix of ingredients, but for me it just clashed really badly. Too much going on.

It was also a small portion for $12.

After watching the weather all day we decided, ""Hooray, no rain"", and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave, but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy, but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table, she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes, just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate, two large ones, and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly. 

Small Plates: 
Boczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in, some of our other bread in it, and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure. 

Big Plates:
Pierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami / seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly, I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens, some turnips, and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic, the turnips were good, and the pierogies, they were ok. I liked the dough, I liked the presentation, I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others. 

Special Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple, but wowza, what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate, something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal. 

Dessert:
Tarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat.

Back again and tried out other items on the menu:

Hohomi Chicken Wings & Potatoes ($5.95) though crispy but tasted bland. I doubt I would order that again. The potatoes was meh too.

Hohomi Baked Chicken ($12.95) was not as tasty as the Roasted Lemongrass Chicken. The fermented soybean sauce was just overwhelming sweet and heavy.

Durian Sticky Rice ($6.95) was a little disappointing as the taste and smell of the durian was drowned in the coconut cream. This taste more like a meal than a dessert. I just want more durian!

Vietnamese Thick Crab Noodle Soup - Bánh Canh Cua ($9.95) is a nice fusion version. Love all those real crab meat inside the broth and my Yelp friend just finished everything. I enjoy the chewiness of the udon like noodle!

The ramen was also tasteless. There was about zero salt in it. The egg was hard boiled with a hard yoke, not soft like it should be. The pork belly was tough and didn't taste that good.

I admit, I came in with nothing. My truck had recently died so a junkyard came to get it. I went to Chapman Dodge because it was the closest dealership to my house. 

I will first say that the salesman I had (Scott) was awesome.  Not smarmy, not shady.  Really tried to work with me and get me a car that I could afford.

Like I stated, I came in with zero down and I make little money. I waited for 7 hours and finally got a 2010 Hyundai that I really liked and it was in my payment range.  They even called me a few days later to tell me that the bank approved me for a lower APR which I was stoked about.

Now the fun stuff... I get a call a few days after that and come to find out that the car they sold me belonged to someone else. Stolen or not, I don't know the full details but these asshats bacially did not do their homework.  I love how someone off the street can basically trade in a car with little to no information and Chapman turns around and sells it to me.  I had to return the car, which still smelled like cigarettes and was still needing the inspection. 

I did get a much nicer car for a lower price but I will never go back.  The incompetence level is epic. The finance manager (Chris) is a prick and the main manager is a shady piece of work.  All they do is apologize and keep you waiting and waiting. They seem to do everything ass backwards at this place and I will NEVER recommend anyone to buy anything there.  

So, here I have a 2010 Kia.  Let's see in a few days if THIS car is legally mine and not stolen.

Then they call me again the following day to tell me that the paperwork for the original car went through and if I want it, I can have that car instead. WTF!!!?

I can tell you, however, that the ""Deck the Halls"" tradition is something you should go to every year. This year the theme was Babes in Toyland, which could've been better, but it was still cool. Even better was the Nutcracker theme they had last year, which was great. In addition to the inside of the house being decorated with the theme in mind, the gardens are all lit up and open for walking through. The lighting displays are great outside and definantly worth the walk. The Corbin Conservatory, which is an on site greenhouse, is also decked out.

We've rarely (if ever) had to wait for a table, even on weekends. I'm consistently impressed by the service we've received. Everyone is constantly keeping an eye on our drinks to make sure they're refilled and we usually get a refill of chips after we've scarfed down the first basket (because why not?). 

I usually opt for the taco plate and leave stuffed with leftovers for lunch the next day. The ""Shrimp Jalapeno Bacon"" is a must-try; very flavorful and unique. Avoid the Carnitas; I'm usually a big fan, but every time I've tried them at Vida the pork has been too dry for my taste. 

This past visit I tried the ""Combo 1"" that included a red chile chicken taco, carne asada steak taco, and a green chili pork and avocado enchilada, plus rice and beans. I'm proud of myself for going out of my comfort zone, but still recommend the tacos for dinner. My favorite part about the combo meal was the chicken taco; everything else was good, but again, a bit dry.

I should have listened to my husband when he said he hasn't heard the greatest things about this place (we have an STK in Washington, DC). But the reviews were higher at this location, so I thought it was good to go. I called a couple of days in advance and made a reservation. When we arrived the hostess had our reservation, but she said they needed a minute before we could be seated. This place was pretty packed on a Thursday night, and there was really nowhere to sit. So we kind of had to stand around. We also had to wait 10 minutes or so before we were seated, which I didn't think it was cool--since we made a reservation. We were seated in the lower bar area-- which again was a disappointment since we made a reservation --I really wanted to sit up stairs in the less crowded seating area. But I didn't make a fuss and we sat in the lower area. The water waiters served us water a few moments after we were seated. After 5 minutes or so of patiently waiting we finally received our waiter who gave us an overview of the menu. He explained things that were off of the menu, and I was really intrigued about the lobster macaroni. He gave us a few more minutes to look over the menu. Finally when he came back we placed our order. The hubby and I ordered a steak, lamb chops, asparagus, the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of crab legs. After we ordered the hubby and I noticed everyone had bread while they waited and we didn't -- and we had been seated at least 30 minutes or so. We finally tracked down our waiter and I asked him do we receive bread? He said oh yea and it would be out shortly. About another 5 minutes later we finally received the house bread. The bread was ok, but it tastes even better without the cheese and garlic they put on top --- you can request it without the cheese and we did. So how was the food?

1. My husband thought his steak was pretty good but he said he has had better-- I wasn't impressed by his steak but I'm the seafood lady not the steak lady. 

2. My lamb chops were amazing!! Very well prepared! My chops were so good my hubby took a break from his steak and finished my plate. 

3. The asparagus was ah ok.. We like are asparagus soft and not crunchy and they could have used more time in the steamer-- in our opinion. 


4. The lobster mac and cheese was ok. I wasn't really impressed-- this dish also really pissed me off when we got the bill because it was $30 dollars!! My waiter didn't explain the price of this and if I had known this side dish was going to be so much, we would have left it in the kitchen. 

5. The side of crab legs were delicious! I really enjoyed! --worth $30 dollars

The vibe in here is more New Yorkish-- as in really loud and seats close together.. I think they are going for a club/restaurant vibe... The female DJ they had was on point, I have to give them props for hiring her.

Started off okay, she seemed friendly and she told us she was new. Service was really slow consistently (from her getting our orders to getting us our drinks), but we knew she was new so we were trying to be patient. What pushed us to leave was waiting for an hour without an entree. 

I think they started to notice about 40 minutes in that they forgot to put in our order maybe because of the dissapointed/frustrated looks on our faces and also because of our glaringly empty table. The server came by at this time to say that the food was coming out in 5 minutes. 10 minutes later the food was still not there so we put some cash on the table for our drinks and left. We were stopped by the manager saying the food was just about to come out, but we really didn't have the patience to wait any longer. My boyfriend voiced his frustration, the manager listened and apologized and appeared reasonable. The server that was supervising our server came out to apologize and also tried to convince us to stay, he also offered to have us take our food to go so that's what we did. (We actually sat down and had to wait another 5/10 minutes for our food to actually be ready). 

I have no problem with the food, it was great. I also thought the manager and the more experience server actually dealt with the situation reasonably too. But they shouldn't have let this happen in the first place. It's ridiculous to have customers wait an hour for their meal!

The Minced Pork Rice with Sausage was delicious. They used Japanese rice and the flavours were blended very nicely. Option of having an egg added too at no charge.

The House Special Beef Noodles were also great. Noodles had a great texture and the soup base was not too salty. Beef was tender.

Popcorn chicken is OK, nothing special. Worth a try and good to have as a starter but it's not a must have.

I always start off with the dumplings and gravy. They're priced at $4 for two dumplings and gravy and is great for sharing. I remember my first visit, thinking they'd be similar to the Asian variety of a steamed dumpling filled with some sort of minced meat. We initially ordered 3 per person, but after our server explained what it was (fried dough with oxtail gravy), we were advised that one each would be sufficient.

As for the entrees, I usually go for the oxtail combo with either jerk chicken or jerk pork. The combos come with your choice of sides; rice and peas and (creamy-style) coleslaw are the default options. The chicken and pork have a nice char to it and a light kick. They bottle their own hot sauce, which I tend to add to my meal to give it a bit more of a kick. The oxtail is always the star of the meal. I salivate thinking about the tender goodness!

There are nearly a dozen types of pho available coming in four different sizes, an appealing selection of rice dishes plus Vietnamese coffee and everything else expected of all reputable Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal. In the end, I opted for a large bowl of classic pho, the kind with thin slices of raw beef on top.

A warm pot of tea arrived with the menu and even though the restaurant was busy on a sunny Sunday afternoon in March, the service was fast. First to arrive on a small plate was a healthy portion of crisp bean sprouts, several sprigs of fresh mint and a lime wedge. My noodles arrived a moment later in an oversized steaming bowl, inside laid tender slices of beef, still pink in spots, covering expertly cooked rice noodles. Unfortunately, the broth was a murky brown and a bit heavy, not award winning, but passable.

I finished off the noodles and beef feeling satiated but not stuffed. I was obliged to treat myself to a Vietnamese iced coffee.  If you've never had one, they are incredibly sweet and milky and so delicious. The first sip transported me straight back to Saigon where iced coffee is a way of life. 

For about $15 Canadian dollars the bright atmosphere and ample good quality fresh ingredients will bring me back. Despite the experience of others, I thought the staff were doing a fine job, fast and efficient.

The savory baked goods are Pasty in vegetable or beef and are very large in size.

The medium size savory baked good is the house made sausage roll. 

Smaller but enough are the pies that come in many varieties.

We sampled two pies and one sausage roll. I thought the Steak Curry Pie was delicious and it was my favorite but the steak was a tad chewy just like in the Steak Mushroom Pie. The Sausage in the Sausage Roll was tasty but a tad dry with it's grease released in the pastry.

My husband did a great job eating the food so I had room to try a dessert.

They didn't have all the desserts for sale that they posted on the menu board but they were selling three desserts on my visit.

They were offering a vanilla slice that looked very similar to a nepolian, apple turnovers and an Australian Dessert called a Lamingtons filled and unfilled. 

I went with the Lamington unfilled. It was a DELICIOUS light spongy cake frosted with GOOD chocolate and dusted with coconut. The cake was excellent. It tasted like pound cake and angel food had a baby.

It's not crispy on the top, which I usually enjoy for the crunch, but still tasted awesome.  The omelette was a little too cheesy but overall tasty and big.  As far as service, the waitress was very welcoming (if not too welcoming, asking about refills and such literally every five minutes) but the food took very long to get served.  Usually ""Egg"" restaurants have very quick turnover and cook fast, but it took nearly 35 minutes for a crepe and an omelette.  The muffin came out first so there was some type of an appetizer, but the food itself was remarkably tardy.  

The price was around $25 for two full meals which is typical of most breakfast joints in Las Vegas.  I had a tasty meal and I still recommend Egg Works, but expect to wait to get seated and I guess at this location to be served as well.",2016-05-08 22:41:20

The Hubs and I (and baby-to-be) booked brunch at Southern Rail because we absolutely love Beckett's Table and had to give their sister restaurant a try. Loved the decor of this spot, open and very ""garage"" chic feeling. It seemed industrial, but quaint. Service was OK, not bad, but not great.

The food was delish... I had the honey lemonade, which I thought was very refreshing and the Hubs had some drink with milk in the name. He really liked it, said it almost tasted like a banana smoothie without the banana. We started with the beignets, which were hot, fresh, fluffy, and covered in powdered sugar... so. good. I had the fried green tomato benedict, which was so tasty and interesting. It was surprisingly sweet thanks to the tomato jam. I could have done without the frisee salad though. The Hubs had the savory dutch pancake special. It wasn't what we expected, but it was really good. Basically, it was like a skillet breakfast on top of a savory, egg pancake. He enjoyed it, but liked mine better (as did I).

There are two huge TVs, large spacious booths and wacky chandeliers. 

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in for dinner. I was greeted by a very cheery server who quickly brought us a pot of tea and the menus (with a photo album of course). They have a huge menu with pho, vermicelli, curry, stirfrys and a whole section of vegetarian foods. I had the vegetarian noodle soup, which was probably the best I've ever had.  It was a HUGE bowl with lots of rice noodles, large pieces of bok choy, tofu, mushrooms, potato, carrot, etc. I barely made a dent and I was stuffed.

It definitely seems to be the area's best-kept secret. There was a mix of young and old patrons, and there were plenty of people coming and going for takeout orders. Music was good. Hockey was on the TV.  I will definitely return. My only complaint is that it took quite a long time for our food to come out - apparently due to a large takeout order.

Thankfully, ""The Rush"" is a capable fill-in. 

Located just across from the Beck Center, it's a great place for burgers, wings and conversations with actors and neighborhood folk.

I've been there about 10 times now, and had the following:

Steak Sandwich-Not the best. Steak was GREAT, but in true Ohio fashion, it was again a slab of steak on a bun rather than sliced up. Some may like them this way, it can be a nice change...I don't.

Wings-Awesome

Burgs-Awesome 

Murray mentioned the chili-Simple? Yep. Great? Yep.

Even their little salad is good, with a bunch of cheese and a couple different types of croutons. 

The chili can also come on their nachos. Chili on nachos? Awesome.

They've got good beer specials, and you can find some wine here.

And one of my castmates lives on their chocolate martinis. Hey...me either, but she's beautiful and she can drink whatever the F#c% she wants. So suck on that.

A decent jukebox, tons of booths (some big enough to accommodate 10, with space to move and open enough to not have to shift everyone for bathroom breaks) and a great location on Detroit are some of the other features of this gem.

It's made even more awesome by the fact that they support local brewers and the Arizona Distilling Company! More on those facts later...

Once again, my girlfriend made a suggestion I couldn't refuse. We decided to grab lunch at the newest Angry Crab location in Goodyear. I've heard others talking favorably about this chain and I'm always down for sea food!

Sitting at the bar is one of our favorite things to do because the service tends to be a little better. Tracey took good care of us, was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions, including desert.

A couple draft beers (a Kilt Lifter and a Purple Haze) paired very well with our entrees. We chose a pound of mussels and a pound of snow crab with their Tri-Fecta sauce and medium heat. Wow! They don't mess around with the spices! Love the garlic! Throw in some potatoes and sausage and prepare to get a little messy!

Some people may be turned off by the idea of being served in a bag and having to work for your food. But if you're dining with the right person, and you know how to break down a lobster, it can be more fun than you realize. There's an intangible about dining like this because you're focused on the task, you're chatting, and you're constantly sharing the treasure you pried from the shell with your company. This was a fun meal!

The beer selection is more diverse than the average restaurant. While I would appreciate more local beers, I was happy my favorite from Four Peaks was present. And how about those spirits? They feature a vodka, a gin and a bourbon, all made in Tempe. I'm intrigued and will be looking for the Commerce Gin at my favorite beverage store. Once again, props to the Angry Crab Shack for featuring their products!

In fact, I would say that Palmyra gives the Mediterranean Cafe down the street a run for their money. The food is freshly prepared and the portions are generous. 

My mom and I ordered a lamb shawarma platter to share, and it was enough for the both of us. We weren't stuffed at the end of dinner, but we were comfortably satiated. For $11/platter (or $5/person), that is a really great deal. It makes for a well-balanced meal as well: meat, rice, salad, hummus, and a side of pita bread. Pretty healthy if you ask me!

Now, before I begin talking about the food, I need to make clear that I am not a big fan of lamb. It might be the texture, it might be the flavor, it might just be the fact that I'm eating an animal that used to be soft and fluffy. Whatever the reason, I'm just not a huge fan of the meat, even though the rest of my family seems to love it.

Having made this point, I must say that Palmyra does a fantastic job with their lamb shawarma. The meat was tender and flavorful and sliced into thin pieces which seemed to melt in my mouth. Can you tell how surprised I am about how much I enjoyed the lamb? It was truly, truly fantastic! 

I think Palmyra also does a great job with their hummus - I typically like my hummus (or any dip, really) a little sour, and Palmyra's hummus was perfect! I was literally eating it by the spoonful (much to my mother's dismay).  

The only thing I thought could use some improvement was the rice pilaf. It was a bit dry, but since it didn't particularly detract from the meal, I didn't factor it much into my review of this place. 

Honestly, I am so excited for this restaurant's menu, and I can't wait to try all of the other different platters and wraps that they offer! I think I've found my go-to restaurant for this summer! :)",2014-06-13 01:16:26

The food was all delicious. I had beef pho, and hubs had some sort of roll your own spring roll thing. This was some of the best pho I've had here, and I've tried more than a few. The broth actually had enough flavor that I almost didn't have to add the extra garnish, but of course I did anyways. It was salty, tangy, and just a little bit sweet. The beef was cut up into manageable pieces and there were tons of rice noodles. We had spring rolls and a strawberry boba smoothie that were equally good.

I was told the wait would be 30 mins after I paid.  I used the restroom and sat in a chair in the hallway.  Quickly 30 mins went by and a waitress stopped to ask if I was dining in and I told her I had an order.  I gave her the order number and she never responded back about it.  Yet, she came down the hallway often (backway to kitchen?), checked low drinks at tables, and seated two sets of people from the hallway.  I was sitting in the first chair in the hallway yet felt I wasn't as important since I had takeout.  Then 45mins went by and I got up to ask a waitress passing through the checkout line.  She grabbed my bag which seemed to have been ready for a couple mins or while.  Needless to say the meal was delicious even the Spicy Tuna which was a second choice for a little something extra to complete my meal of the Sweet Dragon.  I brewed some Oolong tea at home.  I will return for the Bento Box but I will call my orders in for now on.  Please call out takeout order numbers or have a waitress notify people when they're order is ready.

Next we shared a 12oz New York peppercorn steak cooked medium rare, garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. A good choice.

My only comment was that they did not know what to do with a shared meal. They brought out the meal on one plate and gave me a blank plate. This meant a bit of fiddling around to share. We do this a lot and most restaurants split the steak and sometimes even add more vegetables.

The major gripe I have about the place is the prices: $9 for meatballs, fine. But saying that they come with french bread when they literally come with one piece of crostini is not cool. $3.50 for a soda, absurd! $1.50 for cheese on top of the meatballs, mmmno.

Went here for my birthday and brought another couple.

We had Feliciano who is an outstanding server. The service was 5 star, no doubt.

The food. Well, the food fell short.

2 peoples meals had to be sent back. Medium rare steaks came out well. Sent them back and they came back out MEDIUM WELL! Thats unacceptable at a place like this.

Then they brought something out in the interim since 2 people were eating and 2 were just sitting there. The thing they brought out had PLASTIC WRAP in the food. We brought it to the service attention and they felt horrible.

Now, they comped the 2 meals they messed up. Which was nice. But to be honest, financial reparations is not something we were after. It's all about the experience at a place like this.

Maybe we will try again someday but unfortunately Kai has completely missed the mark this time.",2017-10-13 23:30:03

My dining companion and I were very pleased by this choice buy the end of the night because we had super attentive service from the bartender there. She set us up with drinks, informed us of the specials, and was very friendly and attentive.


We shared the hobo stew and mussels. I was expecting good food, but was instead treated to a dance party in my mouth. Despite it being August in Phoenix the hobo stew was so delicious I used my bread like a scouring pad to get the last bits of gravy. The mussels were a hybrid breed. They're nice and plump, served with a crusty bread you can soak up the spicy broth with. 

We decided on the chocolate torte for dessert. We were so stuffed from dinner we could barely finished half of it. Which was just fine because that means I got to have it with my morning coffee. Just after we got our dessert the owner came around and introduced himself, asked if we were enjoying ourselves, and praised his employees. Very nice touch.

The atmosphere is a lot of fun, colorful artwork all over which I always appreciate, natural & warm furniture, loud & lively & a beautiful outdoor space. It was busy when we arrived so I was happy to see it was popular! The hostesses looked a little overwhelmed & luckily the manager or sup on duty assisted us, waited about 10 mins. 
The seating was terrible, by far the worse part of the experience. We were sat in a section that was on top of each other & couldn't even slide our asses into the seat in between the tiny tables (I have no ass). To the left was a family of 3 somewhere from the South & possibly the loudest bunch in the entire restaurant & to the right was a mother with her daughter arguing. It felt like we were dining with all of them. Awful & annoying. Fix that terrible seating area!!!
The server was very friendly & everyone who delivered plates to our table were also very nice. The food is expensive & if I'm paying $4.50 for street corn I expect better seating. Our Mahi Mahi tacos lacked flavor & the traditional guacamole was bland. The chef needs to kick up the Mexican flavors my mouth was craving. Now the good stuff, my pineapple margarita was very refreshing & we enjoyed the queso with short ribs & I enjoyed all the different salsas & chips were fresh. Our dessert was almost perfect, crispy on top & very creamy but cold on the bottom :( just needed to be heated a little longer.

There are a few kinks that need to be worked out, such as long wait for rental tubes, parking, etc but its been less than a week since opening, give it some time.

The staff were friendly and helpful and there seem to be a plethora of lifeguards around that you don't feel uncomfortable letting little ones loose.  Wait times for big slides seem somewhat inevitable as the flow of the line was limited by people clearing off at the bottom of the slide.  

I think it's nice to have a water park back in town.

Before I get to what I ordered, let me make note on how important it is for a restaurant to have an eye soothing menu.  The online menu is great, but the restaurant menu is much more extensive than the short list on the website.  

Unfortunately for me, the menu was much too busy.  The colors were awful and I didn't want to look at it for more than two minutes.   Red and black text looked crammed and didn't stand out the way text on a decently designed menu does.  I barely read past the tacos.  

Ordered three tacos a la carte ($3.99 each). The mesquite cactus taco (I can't remember the dish name) with no queso, La Condesa Veggie with no queso, and the fish taco.  Also a side of guac which cost about $4.

Honestly the guac was the most exciting thing on the table. The food was filling but all three tacos needed some DIY spicing.  Ranking:
1. guacamole - made with dried cranberries and mango.  A bit tangier than I prefer, but palatable.
2. spinach taco - wished the spinach was chopped smaller
3. cactus taco - slabs of cactus made my mouth work overtime 
4. fish taco - too much breading on the fish, and just plain cabbage with bland white sauce drizzled on top.  Wish I had asked for no white sauce. 

The salsa bar is okay.  There were only a few salsas that I thought looked appetizing.  Most were watery and needed some DIY mixing of two or three to get a fantastic flavor.  And with the serving cups being so small, I couldn't grab a decent serving of a favorite salsa.  I refilled at the bar three times and then just gave up.

Our server was kindhearted and brought a sample of horchata.  I have tasted something similar to it, but didn't like it.  Sweet drinks with cinnamon flavor aren't my thing.

If I'm in the area and feeling hungry I would go back.  It's a decent restaurant, but not one to where I would plan a night out.",2014-10-30 03:32:39

Scramble is modern breakfast and brunch joint that will keep breakfast in your mind all day long!

I attended with a friend and was delighted by the atmosphere.  Light and bright with some buzz.  If I was tired from the morning; not anymore!  The place is hip and hopping, order in line and pick a seat kind of place.  I went with the Meat Lovers Scramble and cup of Americana coffee -- why don't they just call it a cup of Joe!  Anyways, they even have breakfast pizza here! Cowabunga!  That's definitely new and something I'll go for next time around.  My Meat Lovers was yummy, Applewood bacon, ham, sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese in a mesh of eggs and hash browns!  A running mans breakfast haha!  The bacon brought the saltiness, while the melted cheese supplied the sweet mush and the hash browns was a hit with the crunch.  Add some hot sauce and yippy!

Overall, great place for breakfast and brunch; plus it's down the street from where I live so that's always a plus in my books! - Enjoy!",2014-08-25 23:07:49

The interior hasn't changed much from the previous restaurant but there are some minor changes to the place. Like the tables and chairs. 

The menu they have is kinda small but I guess that's how they specialize in their food. They pretty much specialize in noodles, Chinese ramen noodles and Chinese slices noodles. But they also have rice dishes and BBQ skewers. 

I like their sliced noodles. The noodles are chewy and have a nice texture. However the soup base is what they need to improve on. I've been here a couple of times and the soup is still not as strong or flavourful as it should be. If they improved on that, the food would be sooooo much better.  

I've also tried their skewers. The meat is pretty good for both lamb and beef. But I still prefer the lamb one better because the meat is more tender. The flavours of these skewers pretty much taste like the ones you get from Chinese night markets. Totally recommended. 

As for service, id have to say, it's pretty bad. One time we ordered skewers and it never came. We asked them and they said the order wasn't put in. But they didn't offer to make us an order either due to their mistake since it was close to closing time. 

Another time I went, food took a while to come and we were missing one bowl. We informed them and They said that all our orders are out but they missed a bowl noodle for my aunt... 

Overall, a decent place for a bite. But remember to track what you've order because they miss out on orders a lot.",2017-09-21 07:56:13

I went to Papa Chang's and ordered a very simple dish, rice with Taiwanese minced meat sauce, a sausage, and an egg. It was delicious. Since I was by myself, I couldn't order any more food but from what I saw at other tables, everything looked delicious. I have to return with more people to try all the other foods as well. 

The wait time on a Sunday afternoon was fairly long (wait for food), not sure if this is usual or not. I originally wanted take out but was told that it would be more than 30 minutes, so I took a seat instead. Still waited over 15 minutes for my food, but it was worth it.

I'd never been to the Scottsdale location, so I was very excited to try this place.  I give the wood-fired oven pizza three stars because of the deliciously charred crust (keep an eye out for my upcoming Pizza of Phoenix list) and the rest of the establishment four stars.  Things to improve: flavor on the Schriener's Sausage pizza, lighting behind the bar (those CFLs have got to go!) and that's about it.  I went over happy hour (3-6 daily, half price on most drinks) and was thoroughly impressed by the value of the place.  I also jammed the cannolis down my throat (should NOT have eaten that much food...) and was definitely pleased with that as well.  I'd love to update this to at least four stars once I find the right pizza for me.  The restaurant is a little on the small side, with two very good-sized bars inside the restaurant and another long bar on the patio.

I still hold their teas in high regard. However, the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn.

We arrived and were sat quickly. Ordered hot tea to drink and that was brought to us quickly. Took about 10 minutes before someone came back to take our order even though we were ready when she took our drink order.

We ordered the family meal for two and an order of BBQ Pork Lo Mein. They brought out the sweet & sour pork on time and then it was about 10 minutes before the next item was brought out, broccoli beef. We had eaten about half of the sweet & sour pork by the time the broccoli beef arrived. We started eating the beef and finishing the sweet & sour. I had to flag someone down to ask where the rest of our meal was (fried rice and lo mein) to which she ran back and grabbed the fried rice.

About 15 minutes later we still had not received the lo mein so I waved to our waitress and from across the room she yell ""oh yeah, the noodles"" and then went back to clearing tables and didn't go check on the lo mein. By this time we're just about completely finished with our meal and 10 minutes later another girl brings out some lo mein and says this isn't the meat you ordered but asked if we wanted it or they would have to make a new order. I really wanted the lo mein for left-overs for lunch at work on Monday so I told her we would eat what she brought so we didn't have to wait any longer.

We asked that she box up the lo mein which she did and she brought the ticket. I was sure she would provide some discount on the lo mein since we didn't get it with our meal and we didn't get what we ordered. Nope, full price.

They did not check on us once throughout our meal and I had to flag someone down each time.

I emailed back and forth with Suzie, the owner, who was absolutely awesome. She reserved a table for us, organized a tour of the brewery, and was nothing short of helpful in every possible way with accomodating us and dealing with our crazy group. We were supposed to have dinner at the Crepe Cellar but with the gallery crawl going on and CIAA in town, and our group of 8, there was no chance of that happening. Lucky for us, NoDa Brewing has food trucks that come there and that night it was Maki Taco, who makes some pretty delicious Asian tacos of all sorts (I would write a whole other post on these guys, but the short review is that you need Maki Taco in your life. You won't be disappointed.) 

Suzie and her husband hooked us up with a brewery tour which my husband loved. The tour was only supposed to last a few minutes but again they accomodated us and let us hang with them longer in the back so my husband could ask all sorts of questions about the brewing process, which they happily answered. They had actually brewed a large batch of Coco Loco that day - a coconut chocolate porter that was super smooth and delicious. This was my drink of choice all night. 

Since my cake plans from a local bakery for my husband was totally screwed up (again, worth another post later,) I was SOL, but Suzie came through on this too - she happen to have 8 Irish Car Bomb Cucakes in the back from Fu Man Chu bakery that were OUT OF THIS WORLD, and my husband was a happy man. 

Summary: beer + asian taco food truck + irish car bomb desserts = prediction of how my summer Fridays will be spent. Toss in some live music, and it's a done deal. Thank you NoDa Brewing!!",2012-03-03 18:02:19

This place has been open for just 3 weeks and I've heard so much buzz about this place so it was only appropriate to pay them a visit on National Pizza Day.  If you have time to wait and are not in a rush, then you could probably just walk in.  Be prepared however, to wait for at least 30 minutes for your pizza.  I would highly recommend calling ahead to place your order.  They'd be happy to place your order either for take-out or dine-in (we dined-in).  

With respect to the various sizes, if you're having Chicago style deep dish pizza for the first time, don't go overboard by ordering a medium or large with a group.  Don't hesitate to ask the server either.  The small, in my personal opinion, is more of a personal sized pizza.  You'll have half at most and take the rest home.  Their personal size is a good size, if you're a light eater and you're not planning on sharing. They also do sell them by the slice.  Not sure if it was just today (aka National Pizza Day) but they had a $6 special for a slice and pop.  

Chicago Classic - Your basic pizza with pepperoni and Italian sausage.  We did however, add some basil which added such an amazing flavour.  If you want to keep it simple, then this is the one to pick. What I personally liked about this was how it wasn't greasy as you'd think it would be from all the meat and cheese. What I also loved about their pies was the crust.  It wasn't doughy but instead was pretty thin which made the edges crispy.  Very different from the other deep dish pizzas I've had in Chicago, IL (Giordano's) and in Hamilton, ON (Chicago Style Pizza Shack). 5/5  

Farmer's Market - A perfect pick for vegetarians as it includes roasted red peppers, mushrooms, red onion and spinach.  We added some anchovies for added flavour and man was that such a brilliant idea.  What Rachel Ray always says ""If you think you don't like anchovies, you're wrong!"" and she's right.  If you especially like saltiness, you need to have some anchovies.  You're welcome.  Also with their mushrooms, they were more like baby button mushrooms which were nice and juicy.  So instead of that meaty texture that you'd normally get with sliced mushrooms, you get a nice burst in your mouth. 5/5.

One thing that I wish they would add is ham. I wanted to build my own pizza and make Hawaiian but they just had bacon. I mean, bacon is the truth and all but ham is the way to go for Hawaiian. You can't give people the option to possibly build a Hawaiian pizza and have red onion and pineapple but not ham.",2017-02-10 05:14:09

The first time we tried to go to Khyber Halal, we were able to go inside the restaurant but they told us they weren't doing dinner service because they were catering a banquet dinner off site. No problem, we made arrangements to go back a few weeks later. Our next visit was during Ramadan. We didn't know that until we arrived to see a big sign on the door saying that they were observing the month long holiday. 

Not to be deterred, we came back a few weeks later and were seated by a friendly, young man (presumably, the owner's son?) and we waited. and waited. Finally, about 10 minutes later, I was able to call someone over to take our order and get waters for the table. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, mantoo, samosas and brown rice. The samosas were a bit dry and the chutney that was served with them was nice but in styrofoam containers. I have absolutely nothing but positive things to say about the rest of the meal. Fantastic, flavorful and probably impossible to beat for the prices at this restaurant. Our waters weren't refilled throughout our meal but we almost didn't notice because the food was so good. We didn't need to order extra naan as they make sure you get enough bread to feed an army. With an appetizer, a few sides and three entrees, our meal was less than $40. 

Our next 3 visits were a bit more of the same. Lackluster service, outstanding food. It's why we keep going back. I keep saying I wish someone would nominate Khyber Halal for a Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nightmares type show. They need a visual makeover and the sons could take a lesson in service. Again, they are super friendly but have probably never worked in a restaurant before. This place would be a 5 if they could get their skills up to par a bit.

The two of us split the royal Thai platter, pork jowl, khao yum and sea bream. The sea bream and a couple treats on the royal Thai platter were nice but nothing really stood out. Most notable was the khao yum, although it was notable for the price rather than the taste. Yes, it looks pretty but is otherwise just a $24 cup of naturally-colored rice with some herbs mixed in. Maybe there's a lot of labor that goes into it but none of that shows through in the flavour, and there's no way it makes a satisfying main course for anyone. (Well, maybe Kate Moss.)

Perhaps we ordered wrong, but the overriding theme was that none of the dishes we ate had any recognizable spice or funk to them -- aside from the green chili sauce served with the sea bream, you could even call them bland. I'd venture to guess this would've been the case with anything else we could've ordered.

We love Chef Nuit's other restaurants, and recognize this isn't just a noodle and curry spot. But the bottom line is nothing we ate was terribly interesting by any standard. I wouldn't even say Kiin is worth trying.

NB: We didn't order it, but the beef on the menu is not a ""beef wellington"" as so many people here have written, but a beef shortrib from Wellington County.

I was in agreement because I saw the large menu over the bar proclaiming various offerings like oyster po'boys and jamabalya for $7.95.  Good deal, right?

Wrong. This was for weekday lunch only. some of the things are not even available for dinner, and if  they were, the price was about triple.

We both ordered the fish and chips. ($23) Her bf got the shrimp and scallop combo.
($21). Ahem. In what universe are shellfish cheaper? I was assuming it would be a monstrous portion of gigantic fillets at that price point. You know what happens when we assume. 

There were four small chunks of battered fish atop  a pile of fries.  They were all crisp and hot, and the fish was nice and white, but come ON! 

I have no idea what kind of fish it was, but for that price tag, it damned better have been cut from a mermaid's tail.  And there was no accompaniment like salad or cole slaw either. Only spotting of anything green was pickle specks in the tartar sauce.

Could they be charging for the ambience? Well, considering the fact that it's cafe style seating in an open area of the incredibly loud, bustling casino, I'm guessing not.

The waiter was very sweet and seemed almost sheepish. I'd be embarrassed to bring the check, too, buddy, and I come from a long line of unscrupulous carpet merchants.

It was one of those occasions where you're forced to balance the scales however you can; up to and including scooping the entire contents of the cracker basket into your purse and leaving it all right on top, daring any intrepid employee to say a word.

It started off well - we were greeted promptly and seated quickly without reservations (it was about 1pm on a Friday afternoon).  We entered near the bar on the far end, so it was a little weird when the hostess sent us wandering by ourselves to meet our waitress 30 feet away, rather than have her come and collect us, but OK not a big deal.  We ordered drinks - blood orange cosmo for mom and a grasshopper alcoholic milkshake for me, which lead to being carded and a ""happy birthday"" from the waitress.  All good so far.  The cosmo was quite tasty and the milkshake was almost too decadent.  It was good, but so rich and filling that I immediately thought I had made a strategic error vis a vis my calorie intake for the rest of the day.

There are a variety of burgers on the menu, along with a few non-burger items (not much in the way for vegetarians though).  I went with the gold standard, with onion rings, while mom opted for the basic burger and sweet potato fries - both substitutions incur a slight charge of $1 or $2.  The burgers themselves range from $14 for the basic variety to $28 for one with kobe beef and foie gras.  The ingredients are of good quality, so especially considering the location, the cost would almost be justified except for...

1) they were not correctly cooked; we both ordered medium-well and got medium-rare.  Granted, people have differing ideals of what constitutes medium-well vs. medium-rare but but a burger that is light pink throughout is nowhere near 'well' - medium or not.

2) the biggest sin - the food arrived cold.  The burgers were room temperature and the sides were barely above that and cooled quickly.

We almost sent it back to the kitchen, but had already been waiting close to 45 minutes for it to arrive in the first place and had no interest in sitting there longer.  I ran the rest of my burger through the microwave when we got back to our room and it was quite good when at the proper temperature.  There was no salvaging the onion rings, though.  

At $70 for lunch, I should be able to get my food cooked to my specifications and served at a proper temperature for enjoyable eating.  I might come here if someone else wanted to go (and better yet, pay), but I would probably just order a drink and skip the food.  There are far too many good burger places on and around the Strip to risk being disappointed here again.",2013-05-12 16:11:31

It stocks a lot of new publisher's overstock material on tables near the front, then has used books shelved along the walls and in the back, but also has a fair bit of new reprints mixed into the used sections. Literature and recent fiction seem to take up the largest portion of the store, and then there are 1-2 columns of other types of non-fiction like history, science, philosophy and religion. There are also a few columns of used DVDs behind the service counter.

Overall, not a bad place to check in at once in a while, but a much smaller selection than is available at the other 2 stores.

Primanti Brothers sandwiches are often maligned, particularly when consumed at the original Strip District locale, but I will continue to vouch for the suburban satellites for they offer streamlined, more professional service, preparation, and atmosphere. Take your mother-in-law to this one and convert. 

But back to that sandwich on the Italian bread, the one with the slightly sweet sauerkraut-ish slaw, the french fried tater blades, the tomato, the onion...the bacon???

Hence the beauty of the suburban Primanti Brothers restaurants: the menus are more flexible and expansive. If you don't like the slaw, you can leave it off. Do you feel like a burger, pasta, pizza, or a gyro? This Primanti's has 'em, and will bring 'em to your table on that custom, bakery tissue-lined aluminum cookie pan that always evokes sheer comfort. 

And, unlike PB's grittier urban establisments, here one can indulge in dessert. In this case, we went with their...bread pudding? Hell yeah, you can have some of that here (brownie sundaes and pecan pie are also on the card)! Topped with a potent Maker's Mark whiskey sauce and raisins, this tart, spongy, honeyed, wholly housemade end to dinner brings to mind french toast or Bananas Foster sans bananas, if that reads sensibly.

I'm knocking off a star due to a slightly bitter aftertaste left by the slaw towards the last couple of bites. Was the cabbage cored before shredding? That faux pas aside, Primanti Brothers is a surefire way to make me smile on a wintery shopping trip, their sandwiches never failing to remind me why they are legend, clueless haters be damned.",2015-01-04 04:13:35

This place is soooo tiny but a great atmosphere in side! Our table wasn't ready yet, but they gave us complimentary glasses of sangria while we waited. 

Once we sat down, we ordered the pitcher of sangria, which was about two glasses of sangria for each of us. 

We decided to stick with all tapas for the night and ordered 6 different tapas (We ordered them two at a time so they came out in intervals). Probably could have done with only 5 because we were all crazy full at the end of it all. Note: you receive olive oil and dipping bread complimentary.
-Croquettas- I read online that these were delish....didnt let us down! The order came with 3, so we each got one.....Though, arguably I could have eaten 20!!! Warm, ham-cheese-potato mix inside! These may have been the highlight of the night.
-Pan de Tomate- The serving for this was 4 pieces of bread with a tomato spread on top. We probably could have skipped this....it was good but nothing amazing.
-Stuffed Peppers- These were stuffed red peppers. Not sure what the filling inside was but I know it was in the vegetarian section of the menu. Very good and I recommend. There were 3 peppers.
-Chorizo with onions- This was my friend and husband's favorite dish. Super caramalized onions with perfectly cooked slices of chorizo. Very good. There was plenty for the three of us.
-Eggplant Bruschetta-  Very good.....super garlicy! There were either 3 or 4 of these....keep in mind I was 3 glasses of sangria in (plus the cosmo from earlier!!!)!
-Clams in red sauce- Perfect end. The claims were cooked perfectly. We actually kept taking the bread from the table and dipping it in the sauce because it was that good. This portion size was very large for tapas.

The store is way too small for the amount of people trying to shop in it.  Forget about trying to use a cart.  My best advice is to only get as much stuff as will fit in one of their hand baskets because trying to navigate the crazy small aisles with a cart is pretty much impossible.  It's also good if you go in with a game plan .... a list of exactly what you want... .because browsing is also impossible without having to look over someone's shoulder or constantly move out of someone's way.

I love Trader Joe's food, though.  Their frozen foods are high quality and make dinner fast and easy.  They have a terrific selection of unique ethnic foods.  Some of my favs are their frozen naan and individual sized chicken tikka masala.  I also love their lavash flatbread. They also have lots of organic choices  -- canned and otherwise -- at very reasonable prices.

So overall, I would give Trader Joe's a 5 for their products and a 1 for their incredibly frustrating shopping experience... which comes to a 3 average.

They usually have the new line of shades that come out as well.  So as far as product goes, this place would be getting 5 stars from me.

The reason for the removal of 2 stars comes from their customer service.  Before walking into the store, there is a sign attached to the door warning that backpacks and large bags must be zipped up while in the store. Once I walked in, they were quick to ask me if I needed help finding something, and when I mentioned that I was just browsing for now, one of the employees made a comment that they should start charging people to ""look around"".  When I walked into one of the aisles, the employee followed me and watched me like a hawk.They probably have a lot of issues concerning theft.  I understand that they are trying to make a profit at the store as opposed to their product walking out of the store unpaid, but I don't appreciate the assumption that I would be stealing something. 

The constant surveillance made me feel pressured into either buying something or asking them a question pertaining to their products.  I was half tempted to just buy something so that they would stop bothering me.  But then I decided that I didn't want to spend money just to get them to stop staring and left.  When leaving the store, they gave me the death stare as I walked out.

UmZcnyrirkH5rXWLqrWUHA,avXKk5RYsDWeRgkHv1wfGQ,-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,3,0,0,2,"Zinburger is an interesting concept. I like the idea of an upscale burger joint coupled with a full bar. The look and feel of the place is casual and hip, with the clientele being mostly hipster/yuppies and business people. Although I am neither, I didn't feel entirely out of place. Maybe that was because of the friendly staff -- when people are nice and friendly to you, it always leaves a good, lasting impression. And, the one person that was utterly delightful and charming was the bartender.  I wish I remembered his name because I was quite smitten by him. His efficiency and friendliness only made the meal that much better. 

And the meal, at least mine, was descent. I had the turkey burger, and being the seeker of great turkey burgers, I'd say this one was right in the middle.  For my taste, it needed a little bit more flavor to it. But what the turkey burger lacked, the sweet potato fries made up for.  You can't beat a flavorful sweet potato fry for anything! Despite my average feelings towards my meal, my mom truly enjoyed her BLT salad. It was the perfect side for her, and she said she really loved the salad dressing. 

Zinburger has a lot of what I look for in a restaurant experience -- nice staff, cool atmosphere and good food.  If I could, I would give it 3 3/4 stars because it is definitely ""A-OK,"" but I'm not quite yet ""a fan."" I'll definitely go back again and try some of their other offerings and decide then if I should up it a 1/4 point.  Heck, I may even pull out a fiver!",2011-06-01 04:11:56

Omg. I was trying to decide whether or not this was gonna get 1 star, and ultimately decided to go for it. I don't even give 1 stars usually.

First off, the place was rather quiet for a Wednesday night, but didn't really get much service. The server seated us, asked us for a beverage, and that was pretty much it. Other than coming back to take our order when waved down, she didn't do much. 

Second, the wings were tiny. I mean, TINY! I go for wings almost once a week, and have gotten used to the average size of a chicken wing. These wings they gave us were so small, they couldn't possibly be counted as 1 wing. Unfortunately, Wild Wing doesn't charge by weight, but by the number of wings. A single order is 9 wings at $12.99. With at least half of those wings being tiny, you definitely don't get your money's worth.

I was even hungry after eating here! I have NEVER been hungry after going for wings! Sadly, the fries they served with their wings were crap, so I didn't even want to eat those!

All in all, a horrible place to go. Not full. Not satisfied. Not happy. Will not be back, or to any other Wild Wing for that matter. And will never make the mistake of going anywhere but my favourite (St. Louis)!",2015-07-17 01:45:41

I must admit I had really high expectations of this place, so I feel my review may be a little biased. The sushi burrito I ordered had tuna, salmon, scallops, tamago, hawaiian guacamole, pineapple chow, gochuchang mayo, avocado wasabi cream, taro chips, fried onions, dried seaweed, cucumber, and tobiko. They added lettuce, cabbage, and imitation crab.

The ingredients were unique and they were really tasty. The pineapple was especially tasty. However, I did not expect the additional items and they really threw off the flavours of the burrito overall. 

The cost is around $15 for a salad, bowl, or burrito.

The service was very friendly, but they had to ask several times about what I asked for, despite having the order in front of them.

I enjoyed the dining room and thought it was quite cute. It's very spacious and there is plenty of seats. 

My companion had a poké bowl and it was much tastier than the burrito, because it didn't have the additional ingredients.

I think it is a decent place, but definitely needs a bit of refining.",2016-09-19 02:27:09

This place is real cool on the inside.  They didn't even strip out the pews; they turned them into booths.  It was real cool.

For our meal we got the pizza.  It was also great.  We got the plum tomato pizza, and the cook even added our request of mushrooms on it.  My only suggestion is that they should let you get different sizes of the pizza because we wanted to try two different kinds of pizza, but we couldn't because the pizzas only came in the one large size.

Pros:
* The service is fast.
* The staff is really friendly
* They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bok

Cons:
* It's not located in the best area of Tempe
* The broth wasn't extremely flavorful (definitely beef based)
* You get a small portion for the price of the pho. $7.50 for what would be considered a small bowl of ho anywhere else I have been.

Ok, last thing, which was really, really...odd...the bathroom is located behind the kitchen. Wait, let me rephrase, through the kitchen, then behind the kitchen.

fNMmnT-TUzW9EG4W78ztWQ,PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,DXlDzOcpdUE_F21tok0fgw,4,6,0,0,"Ka is my first Cirque du Soleil show I've ever watched live and what a treat it was.  Although you can tell that the story is by no means polished and there's some unnecessary filler (with some flat humor), the show is both an ambitious triumph in artistry and technology that literally took my breath away.  

So what is Ka?  The basic premise follows a prince and a princess who gets separated under an initial attack.  The show follows their journey as they find out who was behind the attack and their many meetings and encounters with the strange and fantastical world of Ka.  

The first thing you'll notice when coming into the theater is that there is not only a stage that constantly changes thanks to the many movable props and a super-awesome moving stage but also some great features that extend towards the far ends of the entire theater and has parts played into the show.  Really cool.  

The second thing to notice is that crazy moving stage.  I've seen very few other productions like it in which the stage acts as so many different elements (a rock-climbing section which I won't spoil too much of here is nothing short of awe-inspiring).  And in connection with the stage of course is the actual performers themselves who simply rock.  It almost seemed as if one of the performers near the middle of the show in a complex section was about to fall off but luckily, he recovered and was the only 'error' that was noticeable.  The other effects are pretty awesome when they appear and surprisingly, comes quite often.  Ka makes smart use of both the complex and the simple (a scene near the beginning 'underwater' is one of the most clever 'underwater' scenes I've seen).  

My biggest complaints with the show lie in it's story and filler.  I hear that this is the first Cirque production that tries to incorporate a story and at it's foundation, it's not too difficult to follow.  However, although the context is appreciated in connecting the scenes together, expect to either feel a little lost as scenes tend to fly around with some recklessness and little guidance.  The filler didn't help either with the humor usually falling a bit flat and feels like it wasted some time in just setting up the next big stunt (which again, is understandable, but a really neat shadow play section shows that smart filler space could have made all the difference.)  

Service-wise, my biggest complaint has to be the lack of a 'will call' line, at least when we came 15 minutes before the show started.  Most of the line could have moved much quicker if the ticket counter were able to separate those that needed new tickets versus those that bought tickets beforehand so do take note.  Luckily, the inside staff is very kind even if you come in a bit late.  Not only are they 'in character' but they also lead you to your seats with flashlights at the appropriate moment.  Price-wise, do try to book early (they had a special $10 off booking about 5-6 weeks in advance in the summertime).  

Ka was an excellent Cirque du Soleil experience, especially being my first one.  It was such a technological marvel with some breathtaking feats that rarely stopped when it got going.  Kudos to the Cirque and all the staff for a beautiful performance and a great way to celebrate.",2012-08-16 21:56:39

We sat outside it was super cute lots of trees and shade  it's by the Aria pool as well 

We started with oysters since they are my favorite 
And she got the tuna poke  both were amazing the oysters were so fresh I loved the sauces they served with them different but very yummy nice to have somthing new to add to your oysters..... The tuna poke omg YUMMY! It had a little kick to it but it was probably the best I have EVER had! They serve it with some sort of bread and I wish I had the recipe it was so amazing   

Next we ordered the kale salad ( super green greens I love greens) the dressing was amazing I loved it... 

Next we ordered the meat plate (mostly for my friend) she liked it 

We also ordered the meatballs and the calamari ... Idk if I would do the meatballs again wasn't my favorite but they were good   

We ordered the Sunday it was also very yummy  we will totally b coming back hands down great food and service",2016-04-13 20:52:38

I went for lunch this week with no expectations and came out really happy, full and impressed, though a little lighter in the wallet. 

Service: 5/5 
Menu: 5/5 
Food: 4/5 
Vibe: 4/5 

The menu is all over the map, but in a really good way. Starters on the table were Persian soup, corn & crab cakes and calamari. Double thumbs-up all the way around. I had the soup and it was piping hot, incredibly flavourful and really unique. 

Entrees were sandwiches: brie+apple burger, chicken burger and the bison burger. I had the brie+apple which was clever, but unfortunately not as spectacular as I was hoping. I'd give it a 4/5 for trying really hard. The bison burger was a particular highlight: moist, flavourful and filling. 

I skipped dessert, but my cohorts each selected an oversized shot glass full of sweet goodness from a choice of eight. You can see pictures of them on Four's site and they're exactly as pictured and probably tastier. 

I'm definitely heading back for lunch, dinner and probably a hangout for drinks as the bar is pretty massive. 

Go check it out.",2010-10-08 20:09:41

For starters, the admission is reasonable, only $14.25 for adults.  Parking is free with plenty of spaces.  Upon walking in, I was given a map and took a few minutes to figure out which way to go.  I started with the elephant exhibit which was amazing!  I walked through the first area which was the outdoor pen.  None of the elephants were there.  I then walked through the indoor part to find the elephants eating and getting ready for their day!  I was able to get up close and personal with them, which I absolutely loved!

Then, off to the Flamingos!  Love these guys.  Their always up for photos, and I love the pink colors. Up next, I fed the birds. I purchased a cup of nectar for $2 and with some prompting, was able to feed them right then and there!  They were absolutely hilarious!  Two birds would come up, and one would push the other out of the way with their foot to get nectar!  

I then walked around and got to see a bunch of other animals in no particular order.  Lions, tigers and bears, along with Giraffes, birds and fish.  I did take the tram down after walking through the monkey exhibit, which was fun to do as the monkeys were actively swinging from the ropes.

At this point, I'm a bit worn down, and starting to feel the burn from hiking it for almost two hours.  There's plenty of benches to sit on, which I did to regain my strength.  But here's where I dock a star. First, the tram only runs from the Monkey part down to the entrance.  There's a second part the the tram runs, but due to construction, they weren't shuttling people up and down from that part.  BOO.  Also, none of the food or water stands were open, and I was there for a good part of the day.  Not that I'm looking to stuff my face, but a lemonade would have been awesome!

Also, I think I may have skipped an exhibit or two by sheer accident. I realized on the way out that there was the jungle thing admission, but I was so run down I didn't have the energy to see it.  Also, the gift shop seems to be geared mostly towards kids, and I didn't by a thing.  A LOT of stuffed animals and coffee cups, for sure.  I was looking for something on the smaller end, and what am I going to do with stuffed animals?  Maybe some magnets or picture frames would do.

Anyways, I had a blast and spent 3 full hours here.  I would go again weather permitting and was worth the price of admission.",2016-04-24 12:38:10

I'm so glad I made reservations because two parties ahead of us were told it would be a 30 minute wait, despite the parking lot and restaurant being empty.  When the parties pushed back, the host responded nicely that they were full with reservations. 

Jeffrey took wonderful care of us, refilling drinks quickly and even running back to the kitchen to verify ingredients in a dish.  Didn't hesitate when we requested more of their delicious bread, either.  The family-style house salad that was served was very good; fresh ingredients and lightly dressed.  My coworker had a cup of the baked potato soup and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Two of us had the lunch filet which was served with a really colorful side of fresh vegetables and cooked perfectly.  My (oddly named) Rope Sausage & Pesto pasta had a generous amount of sun-dried tomatoes and I'm sure I took more than half of it home.  The steak sandwich at the table was piled high with steak and onion straws and he said it was fantastic.  

I couldn't help but notice that the restaurant was still pretty quiet when we left.  There was a group of 8 near us and then some of the booths had 'reserved' signs, but no guests.  I wonder if they just don't have the staff to cover busy lunches....

Overall the restaurant is clean, quiet and modern with dark wood throughout.  I thought the prices were fair given the quality and quantity of the food.  The lunch specials were extremely well-priced, with a filet tip stroganoff running $11, which included a drink.",2017-12-19 20:09:22

I basically pointed at the picture on the menu and before I knew it there was14 different dishes on the table (refer to picture and you will see what I mean).

The beef was top quality and you can tell by how marbleized the meat was with fat. Sadly we over cooked the meat and it didn't come out as soft as it should have been. There is always a next time to correct this.

For $45 the meal came with the beef sirloin, two bowls of purple rice, lettuce wrap, seasoned lettuce, onion pancake, an assortment of 8 side dishes and a bowl of seafood soon tofu soup. I am a big eating as my user name suggests but I guarantee this will stuff even the biggest of eaters. Come with an empty stomach if you are doing the Korean BBQ option. Its not an AYCE but I definitely ate all I could eat. You get a good amount of quality beef for the $45.

It took about an hour before the appetizers reached us and the same time before we got drinks. Main course was an other hour after that.

pheSfGbKHjClZkV1Y1eGvA,6CoMpwA8D2s00RfzpKDuOg,Eg_M8eeu9SDEdbP7iUmVbQ,4,4,1,2,"Came here for brunch, with mixed expectations - yes, they're owned by the Eat'n Park Hospitality Group and I was half-expecting it to just be an upscale Eat'n Park. I am so happy to have been proven wrong.

The atmosphere could be described as... maybe modern home kitchen? The top 40 radio station was playing, the art on the walls was a little kitsch, the bar/oven area reminded me of a newly remodeled kitchen. The garage doors which are just begging to be opened out into the porch area, with its outdoor fireplace, fit in nicely.

The servers, as I'm sure with many newly opened places, are over-eager and super friendly. They get to wear a casual, comfortable uniform in a great environment so I don't blame them for being so happy. Our waiter was trying to get some kind of information out of us - have we been there before (no), were we celebrating anything (no), were we from out of town (no - we work in Oakland), were we doing anything special today (going to the Museums, maybe)? I was kind of pressured, in that friendly Pittsburgh way, into getting a Mimosa, but I didn't regret it. It was decent for $8 and so was my husband's Bloody Mary. I've included a photo.

Upon looking at the menu I immediately knew that I would absolutely have to come back for lunch or dinner, and brunch, again. So many things I wanted to try - word to the picky brunch eater though, the menu doesn't go into much detail. For example, I got the Chorizo and Eggs (which were pretty good) - I should have realized they were going to be super cheesy. If you're avoiding anything in particular in your diet, absolutely ask first, they'll be happy to help.

That said, though, it was amazing. Their potatoes are the best I've had in a long time. I really appreciate that they give you the little crunchy bits that higher-end restaurants don't want on a plate for presentation reasons, but they're the best part. They were perfectly cooked and came with an interesting house-made ketchup.

Husband got the quiche, which I didn't try because I was too busy devouring my own food. He said that the crust was excellent, and the filling (mushroom and swiss today) was good. It came with a small side salad, but honestly it was just mixed greens with a light dressing and not at all appealing. The ratio could use some adjusting - it was a small slice next to a big pile of greens. But he also got a big boat of those amazing potatoes to go with it.

If you've gotten breakfast at an Eat'n Park before you know they give you WAY TOO MUCH butter. They do the same here, too, but it just made me wish I had more of that amazing grilled farm bread. They give you such small slices - I would pay to get more if I knew they were going to be so small, just to use up more of that butter. Everything is made in-house here - the dangerously delicious honey butter, the amazing fruit jams (today's was blueberry and I wanted to eat it with a spoon). They even make their own seasonal sodas.

For two people, with two drinks, two entrees, and the aforementioned boat of potatoes came to $40 pre-tax and it was pretty much worth it. I'll give them another star if they hit it out of the park for a dinner.

Things I would like to see as they grow more comfortable:
- An expanded cocktail menu on a seasonal rotation.
- Less overbearingly friendly servers. Sorry guys.
- Please please please start a late-night half-price! Come on, it's Oakland, that's what the restaurants are known for - it's good competition.
- Turn off the top 40 music, I'm sure there's something more appropriate out there.
- Even though it's very borrowed, keep with the current dishtowel napkins (exactly like Meat & Potatoes) and glass milk jug serving carafes.",2011-12-04 20:24:37

The place is very romantic - candlelit, bar seating availability, quiet. Service was very fast and polite - our server was very helpful with explaining the dishes and helping me navigate the vegan options. Be warned though, fellow vegans - this place is not super vegan friendly as most dishes, breads, and desserts/drinks contain some kind of animal product. 

We ordered all vegan tonight for me - the pumpkin curry ($14) and chaat appetizer I still highly recommend. The dal makhani (they can make this vegan/dairy-free if you ask!) was only so-so in my opinion.  There was nothing unique about the flavors and the only spice I could really note was the spiciness. Nothing was overly spicy, but everything was spicy. Don't order the whole wheat non-dairy naan/roti. It's thin, dried, and blackened. If you want naan and don't have dietary restrictions, just go for the original buttery versions. 

There is a 3 course prix fixe menu for $49/two people, but we decided not to get it because it only had 1 veg friendly option in the main course selection.

I've been here quite a few times for dinner and once for lunch. The proteins are always fresh and very good quality. I never had anything under or over cooked here.

Amuse Bouche is one of the very few places that actually bakes you your own bread for dinner. The bread was HOT and nice and crusty but I do note did lack salt this time.

We decided to try the Risotto Cakes. I tasted the Fennel Cilantro Aioli and didn't think I'd like it on Risotto Cakes but I was pleasantly surprised that it added the right layers of flavors to the very well made risotto cakes. They were interesting.

They were offering a larger dinner menu than from my previous visits and were offering seven very different dinners of different proteins. I liked that my server informed me that they were flexible with the dinners meaning I could swap things around if something didn't suit me. 

I tried the Barramundi. The Fish tasted amazingly fresh and was simple but perfection.
The Crayfish Fondue was very well made but I thought the braised spinach seemed very average. Nothing was wrong with it I guess it's just me not being a big fan of baby spinach.

My husband tried the Smoked Pork Chop with Savory Apple Bread Pudding in a Cider Reduction also with Spinach. He said it was also prepared perfect. The Pork Chop was juicy and tender. He liked the smoke to it and the sauce was very well made. He also enjoyed the Savory Apple Bread Pudding. 

It was very hard to turn down their delicious dessert of Bread pudding that I tasted at the ""Flavors of the West Food Festival"" It truly might have been the best bread pudding I ever tried but I thought I had enough bread today so I went with their amazing Pot de Creme. The sophisticated grown up chocolate pudding is topped with fresh just whipped up REAL whipped Cream. For certain it's among the best desserts you can get anywhere.

Amuse Bouche is a very tiny B.Y.O.B. if you plan to come here you absolutely need to make a reservation. They charge $3 a person Cork fee .

The butter on top of the tender steak was heavenly & came with crispy seasoned fries and delicious green beans.  The French onion soup was good; cooked authentically with crisp baguette topped with melted cheese. A French person would approve. 

Beautiful French food with French Canadian accents. It's a lovely spot for great conversation and the Kensington vibe is comfortable, relaxed and unique.

Brd7R5bCZLz4qz67llT4Bg,L6nrDwHJDyV0KThjON-Kog,w-As0KSwy8pqMClOea-NLQ,5,1,1,1,Mob museum is an excellent place to learn about some good old vegas history. Very updated and modern. Located in downtown Las Vegas give yourself plenty of time to absorb all the information and facts in the massive 3 story building. There is so much information do yourself a favor with a little research before going to learn the key mob bosses and organizations. The museum itself is very visually appealing and engages the patrons through different methods. I personally did not realize how much influence the mob had building Las Vegas. Highly recommended for anyone interested in history or organized crime.,2016-12-05 22:07:59

1) Jumbo Fried Shrimp (4) appetizer... $4.25
2) Beef Chow Fun
3) Shrimp with Lobster Sauce
4) Orange Peel Chicken
5) Egg Rolls (2) appetizer... FREE with Yelp app check-in

Ambiance:
-upscale decor, tastefully designed without being the slightest bit kitschy
-A/C kept the place nice and cool (almost cold) in the AZ summer
-nice patio outside, great for cooler weather
-several tables during the weekend lunch
-TV in the corner, a bit distracting
-one male and one female bathroom in the back, a bit awkward when there's a wait.

Service:
-our busser (female) was very friendly and stopped by the table several times to inquire about our meals, refill drinks, etc. 
-the waiter (male) literally took the order and that was it, he didn't seem too interested in our table, specifically. Had to go find him to use the Yelp check-in freebie.

Food:
1) Jumbo Fried Shrimp: great appetizer, went way too fast, would recommend ordering more than one for your table!
2) Beef Chow Fun: pretty tasty, lots of noodles and beef, would like to see more green veggies, too. Next time I will order spicy, if possible.
3) Shrimp with Lobster Sauce: the shrimp were amazing, succulent, delicious; however there weren't that many in there! we were left with a plate full of lobster sauce and vegetables before the dish even got around the table once.
4) Orange Peel Chicken: crunchy texture outside, juicy chicken inside. Winner! I would happily order it again. Not spicy at all, would recommend asking for hot.
5) Egg Rolls: great as a freebie, wouldn't order it on my own. Flavorless, kinda mushy veggies in the middle. Not a fan of the sweet and sour sauce/mustard they give you.

Overall, this place doles out tasty dishes with consistent table-side service. I look forward to dropping in from time to time. Sure beats driving all the way down to PF Changs!",2014-05-27 22:46:40

For entrees we did the NC Amberjack with herbed new potato mash, tarragon aioli and mixed veggies. We also did the Grilled Salmon with roasted potatoes, braised collards, smoked vinegar and herb aioli. Both were incredible--highly recommend! 

For dessert we did the Cast Iron Apple Buckle and were fighting over who got the last bite!

Kindred has been on our wish list for some time, and after finally picking a weekend and making reservations (about 2 weeks out I might add) we made the 40 minute drive to Davidson and were glad we did. Definitely a top 10 dining experience for us. 

First off, be bold and explore the drink menu. My wife was braver than I was and went with the bartender's choice. You essentially tell the bartender (super friendly guys) what you like and they make something up for you on the spot. They did a great job with her pre-dinner drink and mine, which was essentially their take on an old fashioned. If you are real fancy, go for the champagne of beers. I highly enjoyed watching miscellaneous men order these 7 oz glass bottles of miller high life for $1. Then again, for the price maybe I made the poor choice. 

Pro tip - sit outside if it is a nice day and you can. The inside is all hardwood and tile and tight spacing between tables. The end result is a very loud dinner. The hostess was very accommodating and we ended up waiting an additional 10 minutes to sit outside, but the ambiance, noise, and space was totally worth it. 

For the meal, think small plates, but bigger than tapas. We ended up choosing 5 plates, which was more than we really needed with the bread. Yes - the bread is amazing. Other highlights for me included the sauteed squash, duck fat potatoes, and scallops a la Plancha. We ended up splitting a bottle of wine with dinner (a super tuscan) and found the bottles to be reasonably priced. 

Overall, a great date night experience for us. For a special occasion, I definitely see us coming back!",2017-08-30 01:06:12

After constantly driving by this place for the past 7 months and seeing the crowded patio I finally schluffed it up today and went in for lunch, in which I was the ONLY one there...hmmm, not good.

Whatever it was 2:30, I could understand as most people are not particularly looking to eat a meal at that time of the day other than the hungover in Vegas. 

So the staff was exceptional, friendly and very laid back, always a plus to see people act like they're not really working so that added to the fun.

Stax' concept is almost like it sounds, 3 ounce burger sliders that you could literally stack in front of you with options ranging from the traditional cheeseburger to more exotic items like the Ahi tuna slider.
 
Being my first time, I opted for a safe option and ordered the Wagyu (Kobe beef) that was from Australia, which had me confused, wagyu is SUPPOSED to be from Japan, not Australia, so why even bother serving it, that's like serving Canadian lobster and advertising it as Maine, very confusing...

Anyway I also had the chicken breast sandwich which was served with a very tangy pesto and spices that seemed to just make one's mouth go.... blllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnndd. 

I think the best part of the meal was the sweet potato fries served with an wide assortment of aioli's from honey mustard to roasted red pepper, if anything when I go back I'll stick to these and definitely different sliders as I wasn't too impressed with what I ordered.",2009-08-08 01:25:44

Having been raised in Japan, I grew up eating something similar but under a different name. It is called temakizushi (手巻き寿司), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. 

SERVICE
Their ""assembly line"" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.

FOOD
I ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. 

There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. 

You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.

CONCLUSION
I paid around $10 (tax and tip included) for a burrito that wasn't filling. Maybe I would've enjoyed my experience more if I didn't wait for so long. I will give another chance in the future but 3 stars for now.",2015-10-17 05:41:38

The drinks don't come with a coaster or napkin wrapped around the can. The staff aren't brimming with over layered swaths of fake sentimentality, and there isn't a wall of brand new 50"" LED's to watch the game on. But there is one thing that DD's may share with the aforementioned martini lounges I've just been pantomiming, and it's that the staff DO all wear matching black uniform shirts: They're t-shirts, and they all say Dangerous Dan's on the front. Now you know where you are.

This is not a new place by any means, so I won't say it's following along the lines of the attempt some years ago to create a new restaurant type of food with 'tude. But the attitude does come free on the side with your burger order (albeit in a tongue in cheek manner). It's part of your dining experience at DD's as they like to call themselves (the menu also states ""the burgers are bigger at the DD. Very clever), and it's part of what makes the experience here so much fun. 

As soon as you walk through the doors you are greeted boisterously by the head cashier/owner (I assume) and informed that the bright yellow menus are in a holder at the front so that when you are ready, your order can be placed through them.

The menu continues with the burger humor giving suggestions for items that may be favorites for recreational cannabis users (there is a asterisk that leads to a qualifier that this is meant for humorous purposes only just in case any hard cases find that a bit too cutting edge), and the burgers are titled playfully as well with names such as The Big Kevorkian, The Big Kahuna and The Big Pig gracing the menu pages, just to name a few. In the land of Dangerous Dan's burgers, size DOES matter, and none of the customers have a problem with that. They're huge, flavor packed burgers that are as delicious as they are ostentatious. The fries are also noteworthy, as they are one of the rare establishments that still serves steak cut fries. Perfectly cooked to a golden brown color, it's worth adding to your meal even if the burger is enough to feed a small family and you don't need them. When eaton here, 'need' is automatically prequalified to most of what's on the menu.

Drink selection is also good. Soda's, flavored drinks like Iced Tea and of course Beer is also available. But no martinis. And that's just fine!

Right on Yonge street near The Keg and Jack Astor's. There's street parking directly on Yonge and along the side streets, lot parking is also available nearby. 
Inside has a modern bright decor. Unlike other ramen places, it's very spacious but still limited seats (around 30 seats or so). Note there is a Saryo Cafe inside the restaurant, which you can order drinks and dessert as well. 
Staff were friendly and quick with orders. The owner talked to us for a little bit, friendly person and approachable. 

Food
Ordered their signature shoyu ramen, which is a soy sauce based with a clam broth. This place stands out from other place for their clam broth. It was my first time trying it and I like how it's fresh and light. You can taste the clam in the soup. The noodles (I heard were hand made) are very nice to taste and cooked to the right level. The pork (chasu) however was a little tough and dry. They may have used a thinner part cause there's no fat (whereas other places will be soft and chewy). 

The ramen does not come with an egg. I added it in for $1.50 and it was not as soft boiled as I thought. Small parts of the yolk were fully cooked, but I think this could be an easy thing to fix. 

My friends ordered the shio signature ramen, which had a heavier tasting of the clam broth compared to shoyu. Although it's a little saltier, but I would recommend it. 

Also order chicken karrage. Pretty standard as other places, crispy skin and soft meat. Not dry at all and it complimented well with the wasabi mayo. 

Overall my experience here was good, but not great. The hype makes the waiting time (45min to 1hr) a little turned on, recommend to come on less busy hours. Price wise I thought was a little high, perhaps cause it's Michelin guided. I would come back again once the heat dies down to try their other flavors.",2018-01-11 14:30:19

I got the ""noodle in soup"" with 2 toppings ($6.50).  I chose shrimp wonton and sliced beef for my toppings and egg noodles for my type of noodles.  My dad also had the ""noodle in soup"" but had 3 toppings ($7.50) - shrimp wonton, dace fish balls and beef brisket and egg noodles.  My mom had the ""lo mein"" with 2 toppings ($7.50) - shrimp wonton and beef brisket.

I liked my soup.  I got 3 huge shrimp wonton.  The wontons were quite possibly the largest wontons I've ever seen.  They were almost bursting with shrimp filling.  Each wonton contains 1 large whole shrimp surrounded by ground up shrimp.  The wonton wrapper was nice and thin.  The wontons here are fantastic!  The sliced beef, while plentiful was rather chewy.  I liked that the meat was lean and not fatty, but it was too chewy for my liking.  The egg noodles were thin traditional wonton soup style noodles.  They were nicely cooked.  The broth was flavourful and not too salty or oily.  I would have liked it if I had some vegetables in my soup.  The pictures on the menu show some greens in the noodle soups, but I didn't receive any.

My parents both enjoyed their meal.  They too commented on the deliciousness of the shrimp wonton.  My mom's meal came with some Chinese greens.  I guess that's why the lo meins are more expensive than ""noodle in soups.""  I mean they seemed to me like basically the same thing except the lo mein has the broth on the side while the ""noodle in soup"" has in all in one bowl.  Maybe it's because they have to wash an extra bowl.  

Anyway, service was not the friendliest, but they were very quick and efficient.  No one was rude, they just didn't smile or seem warm/friendly and it seemed like they wanted to get us in and out as fast as possible.  If I were paying big bucks here I would have been offended, but since our meals were so cheap, I found their behaviour amusing.  We had our meals less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  

The restaurant is a casual eatery with not much décor to speak of.  They have a place in the corner where you can help yourself to water or tea.  All beverages are served in Styrofoam cups - I'm not a huge fan of this for many reasons (environmental, health, etc.), but whatever.  There is a sign that says if you use more than 1 cup a person, they will charge you $0.25 per additional cup (?!), so yeah, I guess if you drink tea and then want water, you either have to pay $0.25 or use the same cup.

After you're done, you have to go to the cash register to pay.

The restaurant is in a strip mall.  There's lots of free parking.

Home of the Brave is a newly opened classic American eatery by the people behind La Carnita. Their slogan: Why can't Canucks make American food?

Reservation policy - drop by and leave a number (for parties less than 10). 

My fellow foodies and I went to check on HOTB on Friday night.  We showed up a quarter before eight and we were greeted with a one hour wait.  We decided to wait and see what all the fuss was about. 

Once seated, we took a look at the drinks menu. Surprise, surprise - everything was American inspired from vintage American cocktails (Blinker, Bronx, Honeymoon) to guest book cocktails (The Manhattan, The Wizard of Oz).  They also had beer by the bottle. I got a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon ($5). 

For my main, I ordered the Fried Bologna Sandwich ($9.00). I love how thinly the bologna was sliced like a deli sandwich.  I've never seen bologna presented this way - it's the most refined I've seen it. It's not the juvenile, thick sliced, bottom rung of the cold cut ladder luncheon meat that I am used to - that's for sure!  On top of that, the bologna was fried, browned here and there for some great texture.  The bologna had a good flavour to it except that it was on the salty side. The sandwich's saving grace?  Those toasted pistachios. They balanced out the saltiness of the meat and gave the sandwich an amazing crunch factor. The pistachios elevated the sandwich to another level.  Also having melted house made American cheese and spicy sour cream on this bad boy was the right call. 

We also ordered the Johnny Cake with Smoked Trout ($14.00): cornmeal griddle cake with savoury cream trout, maple syrup and chives. 

This dish played with sweet and salty elements. The perfect bite - sweet yet crunchy Johnny cake with savoury trout and a dab of cream. Great taste experience. Yet, it did get too sweet after letting the Johnny cake soak up more of the maple syrup at the bottom of the dish.

The Smoked Pork Belly Sandwich ($9.00) consisted of pork belly & shoulder, ranch sauce, cabbage slaw, and lemon zest. 

Getting to the meat of the matter, the pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. The shoulder was a great compliment of texture as was the crunchy slaw. And my Achilles heel?  Ranch sauce... You can never go wrong with ranch... A solid sandwich! 

The sides were more inexpensive if you ordered all three ($5 each but 3 for $12). The whole is greater than the sum of all parts?

Tater tots - they were super delicious!  Creamy mashed potato taste with a perfectly battered and fried exterior. Don't miss the gravy on the bottom - icing on the cake. 

Swiss Chard - simple, with shallots and garlic. Delicious. 

Beets - with lemon, dill, blackberry empire apple vinegar - I wasn't a big fan of this one. Beets were quite hard and I wasn't really enjoying the flavour. 

Bottom line: interesting offering of dishes.  Not ""dinner"" worthy in my eyes.  I would go back to lounge around, snack, and drink.",2013-09-09 14:14:06

What I meant by that statement is that it does not have Spam, Egg and Rice / Bread on the menu. They actually have some pretty decent choices albeit smaller compared to other Honkong cafe restaurants I've visited.",2017-09-09 20:53:21

Let's see... This place is pricy, and when we came in my eyes were definitely hungrier than I really was, but I am glad that I didn't follow through with wanting and NEEDING to try everything. 

So we started with the calamari as an appetizer which was fresh and amazing...
Crispy & not to salty.  It wasn't oily at all either & that's ALWAYs good.

Husband's orders first because it will probably be what I'm having this weekend.
He had the Pan Roast which is excellent!  Crab, Shrimp or Combination. Served with Wild Rice and Tomato Butter Sauce.  The sauce is so freaking good it's crazy.  The seafood totally compliments the sauce... 

And now for my boring order:  Fish & Chips... Which is good... But better with the pan roast!  

I really like here & will definitely try other things that will compliment my pan roast. :P

Service is great... And the two times ive been there we were seated quickly.  if all the tables are filled up, take a seat at the counter!",2012-05-30 06:31:23

DOZO Izakaya was about half full, quiet, and relaxed. The menu is extensive and it took a while to decide what we wanted. There are starters, Izakaya (skewers), sushi, bentos, and noodles (ramen, udon, yakisoba). We ordered a house salad, assorted tempura, a dynamite roll, and a carburetor roll (tempura shrimp, crab, avocado). My partner got an unfiltered sake. On a whole we were really happy with our food. The tempura was light and crispy. The panko shrimp were especially good. The salad was much larger and of a higher quality than I expected though some of the dressing was a little heavy on wasabi. The dynamite roll was great. We were a little disappointed with the carburetor roll. The eel sauce here is very, very sweet and the roll was sitting in it. Beyond that, more avocado might have lent some fat and texture to a kind of dry roll. The service was friendly though both our plates had spots of dried food on them and we could have used fresh plates after the first few items--a check in would have been good. About half way through our meal, the table next to us got ramen and I got jealous. They offer vegetarian broth and gluten free noodle options. We'll be back to try the ramen.",2018-07-08 06:06:17

Walking in I was very surprised how small it was;however, I never made it any further than the first table where we were seated and there's another room with more tables. 

I don't think it has your typical Mexican restaurant vibe, but again I only made it to the first table. Next time I will take a look around! But overall the atmosphere was cool.

As with any Mexican restaurant, or at least with any I've been to, you're greeted with chips and salsa. I've had a lot of chips and salsa and different restaurants and I can honestly say without a doubt that Luchita's has the best salsa I have had yet! It's enough for me to take the 20 minute ride just for some chips and salsa. Which by the way you can order to go!

I decided to stick to water but my friend ordered a margarita. It was $6 and pretty small but tasted well according to her.

My friend's boyfriend has the queso fundido which he absolutely loves...enough to not want to share!

Being my first time here I wasn't sure what I wanted so i decided to go with the combination ($10). I had a chicken burrito and a beef taco Mexicano with the rice and beans. Rice and beans were pretty average. The beef taco Mexicano was ok, definitely helped to have the guac and sour cream but was tasty. I was highly disappointed with the chicken burrito. It was simply shredded chicken in a tortilla with melted cheese. The chicken was poorly seasoned. I ordered fresh jalapeños to add a little flavor and kick to it. In hindsight I should've ordered that salsa to smother it in. 

I will return. Definitely for the salsa! Maybe to explore the menu at least once more.",2016-01-31 03:10:59

Service: 4 stars
We were greeted nicely and immediately upon entering... seated quickly.
The waitress took our drink orders and had them brought out while we figured out what we wanted to eat.
Food was delivered promptly and was served hot (but not burn your mouth hot).
Water glasses were kept filled without us having to ask.

Menu:
Good selection of curries, noodles, fried rice, salads and soups.

We started with the Tom Ka Kai (coconut chicken soup).... OMG!  
This is freakin' good....5 stars.  
The coconut milk makes this soup rich... so be prepared.  The lemongrass is a bit strong but it helps cut the coconut milk.  Big strips of chicken and the mushrooms were nice and succulent.

Then we had the Spicy Eggplant w/ chicken and Combo Fried Rice.  

The Spicy Eggplant wasn't all that spicy since we asked for #2... which is really mild... but we weren't sure how ""spicy"" spicy was... so we erred on the side of caution and added our own chili garlic spice as necessary to heat things up.  Anyways.... the Eggplant... I'd give it a 4 star rating and would order it again.  It was very nicely prepared in a light, flavorful brown sauce. (It was served with Jasmine white rice which was 'ok'.)

The Combo  Fried... I'd give it a solid 3 stars.... better than plain fried rice but it didn't knock my socks off.

Will we be back again?  Yes.",2011-03-23 05:48:36

I just purchased a car a few days ago and can I say it was one of the easiest and least stressful purchase I made in a very long time. First, I did my transaction via email through the sales manager Mike. I was a bit stand offish because I was so hesitant in thinking ALL salesmen are sharks and evil-doers. Boy, was I wrong!! Mike worked with me until I was happy with the numbers achieved. Since I do not live nearby to this Acura company, I wanted to make sure that if I was going to drive down there, I was going to be happy with my purchase. 

The moment I walked into this Acura dealership, I wasn't haggled by anyone or pressured into buying a car. I got out of the car and asked the receptionist if I could talk to Mike, but he was with a lot of customers that night (totally understandable). I talked to another sales manager named Allen. At first, I was a bit hesitant and wasn't sure if I should just wait for Mike or deal with him. I was afraid everything we talked about wouldn't be honored by this ""new"" guy I had to deal with. Let me tell you, I was incredibly surprised how nice Allen was. Not the typical salesmen that doesn't care at all what you have to say. I explained him what my deal was with Mike and he said, no problem, we got you. In fact, he stayed with us until 10:30pm (an hour and half after the dealership closed) to make sure our needs were met. After looking at the numbers, we told him I would think about it. I thought Allen would be upset, but he was understanding. I called Allen a week and half later and asked him if he would still honor the deal. I can't tell you how patient and incredible caring and sweet Allen was. I ended up buying a brand new RDX  and am happy with it.

My experience with Allen and Mike was incredible. It was worth the drive out there to make my car experience that much better. If anyone needs a car, ask for them!!! Gener, another salesman showed me the ins and outs of my car. He was awesome in taking the time to show me the car and make sure I knew I wasn't a buffoon behind the wheel. haha Impeccable sales service, great deals, and friendly people.. what more can I ask for...",2013-11-15 03:26:17

Or meander to the pool tables and hit some balls around. Or, if you need some fresh air, step outside on the patio... Most often you'll see a red/blue flashing light show. Fun times. 

It's not the easiest place to find if you don't know what you're looking for. I think the large strip mall across the street distracts you while you're driving.

We had the rings, totz and sweet pots plus the 5 various aiolis. My favorite was the spicy aiolis since the main ingredient was sriracha!

I have been there many times, and on every other visit I would have given five stars...however, after eating there last night I think this restaurant has started to go downhill a bit.

We had the tasting menu because (in my opinion) it includes the best of the menu: the caviar parfait, lobster pot pie (to be honest, the large lobster pot pie on the menu is so heavy and so much to finish, I actually prefer the smaller version on the tasting menu), and delicious wagyu. We chose to add seared foie to our steak since there is no foie elsewhere on the tasting menu. I highly recommend doing that!! There is also a huge foie gras you can order from the menu - but beware, it is enough for at least 5-8 people, so don't order with just a few people!

The food: The caviar parfait was not nearly as good as I remember from prior visits. Completely loaded with creme fraiche (as opposed to more salmon and much less creme fraiche previously) - a shame to drown it like that. The lobster pot pie is a stand out - a full tail and claw in delicious sauce. I even loved the butter-seared scallop, which is not one of my favorite foods normally. The steak is the best course - absolutely melt-in-mouth delicious.

The service: Our waiter was nice, but sadly, just not the caliber you should expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. He did not check back in with us mid-course even once during our meal, only coming by to deliver our next course or our next wine (and sometimes he did not even do those things). Before we ordered and began our wine pairing, we wanted to start with a wine or champagne. As we began asking questions about the wine list, it was clear he had no idea what he was talking about and instead of going to get the sommelier, he literally said ""Ummmmm"" for a long time, and then just pointed at one. I asked him to please check with the sommelier before bringing the wine, but I'm not even sure he did that. We didn't see a sommelier even once during the meal.

Ambiance: I love the open kitchen. Generally love the non-stuffy feel of this restaurant. However something happened that shocked us: someone came by with a huge camera asking if we wanted our photo taken! Turns out you can buy these photos later like you are on a cruise. We though it was hilarious, but pretty tacky. I think the old Mina management would be appalled...

The food was, for the most part, still very good. But I don't think it deserves its Michelin Star anymore and the service certainly leaves a lot to be desired for a $600 meal...I never leave below a 20% tip, but doing so left a bad taste in my mouth this time.",2013-07-15 01:14:42

It was eye opening (and stomach satiating) to be introduced to such simple yet amazing food. The deconstructed tuna tar tare mixed in front of you... the lobster pot pie carefully removed from the inverted crust topping and placed on your plate in the shape of a lobster... it was all new and amazing to me. 

Now, Mina (with the help of Andre Agassi's bankroll) is spreading his awesomeness around the country with establishments such as Bourbon Steak, Nobhill Tavern, Stripsteak and his signature Michael Mina found in the old Aqua location in the Bellagio hotel. 

Remnants of Aqua are still there... the lobster pot pie and the tar tare, but I went all fois while there. The seared scallops topped with fois gras were simply decadent. The texture and cooking temperature just blew my palate. They were paired with a little bit of citrus, vanilla, and a parsnip puree. I followed that with more fois... this time on top of a fillet (not my usual cut, but the fois was sure to add a layer of fatty type richness). The beef was served on top of a potato pancake, then topped with a nice slice of fois gras and had a perigourdine sauce drizzled over top. 

My meal ended with an outstanding trio of cheeses with some atypical accompaniments like tiny marinated mushrooms and jellied pomegranate. All in all, Mina continues to please with impeccable service and remarkable food.",2010-01-14 23:42:07

Ordered one and it was steaming hot.. all packed up in a sturdy white box and had the utensils inside all ready for chow down. I thought just that was appealing to see.

As I received my Truffle Tatter Tots, the aroma filled my nose with deep heavy scent of Truffles. It even made me salivate from inhaling this flavored Tots. The portion and size was beyond generous... amazing outer crust crunch. Crisp and light... the center was soft and steamy. I literally made the Oh face hot look. I like the fact that even when 20 mins. went by.. those Tots were still packed with steam. The flavor was sexy, fun, jammin'!!! Absolutely the best Truffle Tatter Tots to date.

Ordered a bunch of stuff - ribs, pulled pork, brisket, the original sausage, and a couple sides. Sausage was as good as can be expected but not great by any means. Brisket was kind of stringy. Everything except the sausage was too smoky and lacking in sauce (or much flavor beyond the smoke). I suppose you're supposed to use the sauces on the table, but do I really have to do that for every item? I've never had every item be this bland elsewhere.

The sides fared somewhat better. Mac and cheese was just this side of creamy and had sufficient cheese. Cornbread was really good, moist and a little sweet. Baked beans were too sweet and would have fared better with a smoky element to cut the sweetness (funny how that works out). Slaw was pretty good but not as fresh as a vinegar-based slaw should be IMO.

When I got off the streetcar I was talking to my friend and he asked  me where I was and he said  to eat at this place. 

I look up from my phone and here I am. Bingo   Oxtail it is!

As soon as I walked in I could sense we were on island time due to the line up and the slowness of it all and the miserable looking customers.

So I ordered the boneless goat special instead which had rice and peas and curried potatoes. $7

It took a long time to get this onto the serving tray and I cannot figure out why. The workers were busy but in no hurry.

So I can say it is worth the wait and they do have Dragon Stout in the fridge so its all good.

Lay back, relax, your in Trinidad and things take a while but its worth it! Home cooked Trini food made by people who care!

I would add a star if they added another person for the dinner shift to speed things up but 15 minutes is a bit much to make up a dish from the hot serving trays.

Of course, we had decided to have pizza the night before and weren't in the mood for more pizza. Oops. Oh well, let's give them a shot. 

The wine list was nicely thought out, it's so refreshing to have someone choosing wines that they have a passion for. It definitely shows and we got a great wine from Alsace. I'll definitely hunt down more for the house.

We got the seasonal salad with cous cous, salami, spinach, tomato and lemony dressing. This salad was absolutely perfect for summer... and beyond. Seriously... it gives Cowboy Chow's salad a run for its money. 

Next we got the mushroom risotto and the gnocchi with shitake dijon cream sauce. The gnocchi was seriously good...lick your plate good. 

I am so glad I remembered to mention them! We had leftovers and I can guarantee someone at our house just might lose a finger. Just saying.",2011-07-03 17:42:12

They serve some bomb ramen that I've been looking for here in Nevada.  The location is near my favorite Korean BBQ place Hwaro so parking is limited.  I did come here on a Wednesday night at around 9pm so there was some parking. The wait for 2 was about 10 minutes.  

The restaurant is really small which you know it's authentic because Japanese ramen bars are very small.  Its usually a eat and go kind of thing.  The menu is very simple.  There's a few ramen choices, add on toppings, and sides such as fried rice or gyoza.  Average price for a bowl of ramen is about $8.  I got the black garlic ramen because garlic is my favorite.  The broth is more on the rich and creamy side compared to a shoyu broth.  I switched my noodles to the thick noodles because I had thin the night before.  I also got the fried rice which would probably taste better with meat.  I had to remove the chashu because I don't eat meat.  Food wait was about 5 minutes.  I was not mad at all.  There are condiments you c ask for such as sesame seeds, vinegar, etc... I wanted to go here tonight but sadly I have no one to go with.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves ramen.

Everything I've ever had here was very delicious.  However, it's far from where we live and not so convenient to dine here.  Periodically I have come here with my extended family and food is good, but service is so-so.  

Although this is bad to say, I think if you're really Asian and going more to an Asian restaurant, although this does have an American flair to it, we don't tend to get great service.  Not sure why that is, but maybe it's a part of the culture.  Maybe if we were a bunch of white folks, we'd get better service, but then, maybe the food would taste different.

Authentic Asian food tastes better than the Americanized versions.  Thai Rama is like 50/50 and that's fine with me.  The Asian population is very spread out in the Phx area, so it's hard to do super authentic Asian (whether it's Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese or whatever) because most likely most of your customers will be more accustomed and want the American taste of Asian food, so I don't blame them.

Turns out I was talking to none other than Shipwreck himself, so his recommendation was fairly obvious. We got a shipwreck, a falafel burger, an order of fries, and a side of cole slaw - I have to try the cole slaw everywhere I go... I almost never like it as much as I hope, but I've gotta know. Blame my inner yinzer.

The food was quick and the wait staff was super nice, they joked around with us, and even though this place orders like a fast food joint(Order at the counter, sit down and you'll get served), the girls come around, refill your drinks, clean up after you, etc. I ran into service like this at Los Cabos, as well and I have to say, I don't like paying - more specifically tipping - before I get my food. Not that I would tip any more or less unless the service was amazing or awful, but it just seems to go against the spirit - more like I'm trying to please the establishment that will be handling my food prep with a number than the other way around.

Anyways, that was just an aside - I really loved the fries, some of them were super crispy, it's hard to find them like that in a lot of places but I love them. The burgers came exactly as we asked for them and they were well presented and covered in toppings. Amazing that they make it all the way to the counter neatly stacked, as they seem to get messy instantly upon picking them up. Well the Shipwreck did, anyways. 

The coleslaw was good. I like it a little creamier but it beats Primanti's(as if that's hard to do).. I could definitely eat it, instead of taking a bite and wishing I had grabbed something else.

I didn't try the falafel, unfortunately, I was way too stuffed from trying to eat every last fry(I failed), and it seemed really heavy(I mean it's a giant wad of solid chickpea mass), so half of that remains in our fridge for round two.

I spoke with Shipwreck a bit more about the place, he said the liquor should flow within a few weeks. I caught a meeting with Victory brewing company(thanks for the golden monkey sample a few nights ago, Victory lady!), so expect them on tap(not to divulge any trade secrets!)

Overall, I like this place, and I will like it more when I can grab a drink here. I think the atmosphere is spot on and the people are definitely friendly enough to hang out with, with or without a burger in hand. The pizzas looked good, so that will probably on my list next time.

Unfortunately, the burger has yet to beat out my favorite, Kuma's Corner in Chicago, but I'll take this on a regular basis to Kuma's less than once a year.",2011-06-03 02:30:51

Real unassuming front, interior-  typical, gaudy Asian decorations BUT this place is MORE than your standard Thai food.

Everything we ate had such fantastic balance in the flavor palate. It was a joy to taste so much delicious food.

I had the glass noodles with shrimp. Amazing.

The BF had the Drunken Noodles with chicken prepared spicy (you can request your desired level of spiciness). Since I didn't even get to sample any of his meal before he woofed it down, I'm going to assume he was well-satisfied with the dish.

There was a bit of a wait but dude for $4.95, I expected there to be a line. We got seated after around 10 minutes. So steak and eggs.

Kind of total opposite of the spectrum but I am not going to complain because I saw this coming for the price. Overall though, even though it wasn't cooked right, the value for what you get is something you can't complain about. You get eggs, steak, hash browns, and toasts. On top of that, the service was pretty good. The server came by several times to ask us if we needed anything. She was kind and I couldn't have asked her to redo the steak.

Other deals also available at night. Would probably not come at other times but maybe the food might be a bit better during non-peak times and not with these value prices.

He then laid out all of the available toppings, of which two will be toasted (marshmallow and walnuts). He then asked if we wanted nutella drizzle. Once the order was placed, we waited for several minutes while it was being prepared.

There was nobody in line so we ordered right away.. but with two staff, one took care of our party of 4 and the other took care of the party behind us..which I felt was quite inefficient.

First off, each ice cream order is to be scooped, weighed, mixed and finally put into a cone... by the time they had mixed the last cone, the person who got their order first was already almost finished their ice cream (or had it pretty much melted away).

Secondly, Marble Slab is quite pricey.. the regular price of a small is $5.29, medium $6.29 and large $6.99. The small did not have much ice cream at all..literally one small scoop sitting on a big waffle cone.

Thirdly, there was a lineup to pay..and we were delayed from devouring our ice cream for an additional few minutes (which is crucial when we are talking melting ice cream!) as when we finally got to the machine and asked to pay by Amex... the machine declined it. Why? Because Marble slab does not take Amex and the cashier did not tell us this when we requested to pay specifically by Amex.

Marble Slab currently does have unlimited mixins (seems to be permanent now) which is a fun plus, as you can add as many fruits, nuts, candies into your ice cream as you want! The waffle cones are freshly made but do get a little chewy at the end.

Yum Kai Nok Kata: a flavorful appetizer of fried quail eggs topped with dried shrimp, cilantro, and red onion tossed in a spicy lime dressing. Yummy!

They're mainly a mix of Life Fitness and Precor. Love the built-in TVs. Such a relief not to have to fight over channel choice with a roomful of people. Weight section is decent enough. Dumbbells over 100lbs, a few squat racks, graded barbells...and a ton of machines for people that are into it. No kettlebells or TRX on the floor, sadly. Flooring is a mix of carpet and rubber. There is also a little ""Fit-Fix"" room which has some dumbbells, balls and mats in the corner and there's a separate personal training studio. THAT'S where they hide the kettlebells. They're apparently planning to add TRX training but it will presumably be limited to personal training clients only.

 

There's a pretty wide range of classes including spinning and the times are convenient too.

 

Staff seem to be mainly former Extreme employees. The guy on the desk this morning was pleasant! Some of the trainers from McCaul GL are moving here and they're nice guys so that bodes well.

 

Random points: juice bar if you want to replenish any calories you might have burned and add a few extra for good measure. There's also a little business section with computers and a health centre.

 

Opening hours: 5am to midnight weekdays, 8am-8pm weekends

 

Overall: nice place! I'll have to check it out again during peak times though. Minus marks for not allowing the normal members to use kett",2013-05-29 22:10:40

The atmosphere is modern and open yet I found it quite comfortable.  The lighting was well considered and made the space very inviting.  I had the salmon which was on a base of spiced cream with a potato cake.  It was prepared quite rare which I enjoyed although I wasn't asked how I liked it cooked (if you like it otherwise, it would be a good idea to speak up proactively)\.  The steak frites were commented on positively by the group who noted the quality of the meat and that the caliber of its preparation was high.   The deserts were particularly well done both in presentation and in taste.

Being that I drive a GMC vehicle, I thought it would be appropriate to get my tire repaired at this store and replace my other tires when I was there. Arrived at 1230pm after I called at 1130am to let them know I was on the way with a donut tire. The parts department told me at 1130am that the tire I needed was not in stock but would be ordered. I had to demand my keys back at 300pm when the tires still had not arrived to the dealership. None of the staff including Greg (service advisor) kept me posted while I waited several hours (check in at 1230pm, left at 315pm). I drove from Scottsdale to Phoenix to Coulter Cadillac GMC. I called ahead and spoke to William at the Coulter GMC. He said the tires were not in stock but would be there when I arrived. I arrived and checked into Coulter GMC at 414pm, checked out and paid / drove away with new tires at 446pm. 

Today in mail, I get a letter from Vans that since I left due to poor customer service, I am not allowed back to the dealership. I wouldn't recommend any one go there and I certainly will not be back. When I called to speak to manager, Greg (same service advisor) answered, said that James was in charge. I spent 19 minutes explaining scenario to then be told he is not a manager. The manager will be back next week so  I can call back to repeat my story to Shawn, the real manager. 

Vans cost of labor = $40.
Coulter cost of labor = $24.
Vans cost of tires = $560.
Coulter cost of tires = $428.
Time differences explained above.

Lesson learned, go to Coulter Cadillac GMC on Camelback / 12th Street everytime. Cheaper and less wait time. Time is valuable and so it money. Make decisions wisely.",2013-08-07 00:55:53

Actually, the 2 places couldn't be more different, but our intent was to sample the lobster bisque from both places and see if we could arrive at a consortium regarding its preparation.  To start, I ordered the ""seafood stuffed jalapenos""...with ""Landry's seafood stuffing inside jalapenos with cream cheese and jack cheese"".  In a word, DELICIOUS!  Came piping hot with obviously scratch ranch dressing and crisp, not soggy onion strings.  I would definitely order these again.  Next, we both had the lobster bisque.  Hands down, Landry's beat Joe's in my mind.  More creamy, more real (not artificial flavor).  For the entrée, I ordered the jumbo lump crabmeat salad with pico de gallo and herb dressing.  My BF ordered the ribeye with a lobster tail.  He seemed to enjoy both of his surf & turf.  We shared the lobster tail and came to a draw.  In our concurrent opinion, Cappo's on west Sahara, serves the best prepared lobster (on special only) of all!  I tried a small sampling of the crab salad I ordered.  Was so full after the stuffed jalapenos and lobster soup.  I was so looking forward to the marriage of the lump crab and pico de gallo.  Unfortunately, all I tasted was crab and avocado.  Maybe the pico de gallo got lost in the richness of the crab or maybe the kitchen neglected to include it in the mix.  That and the measly ration of herb dressing, (along with a surplus of tomatoes...was that all they had in the kitchen for garnish) was enough to say that I wouldn't recommend this salad.

All said, my BF had an interesting observation.  As we waited for our appetizers, one look around the room showed the wait staff, obviously working in concert with the expeditors and bus people, a truly diverse work force.  I have no doubt, that a walk into the kitchen would reveal the same amount of diversity in the people preparing your food.  Amazingly enough, this diversity was also reflected in the demographics of the people frequenting the restaurant.  Not a one-note wonder from staff to patrons.  No one working there had to master a single language to transmit menu orders.  Kudos to the mgmt staff who recognize diversity and all that it has to offer.  While it's probably lost on most of their patrons, it was a memorable and noteworthy experience for me.  I should add, this place is ubiquitous or morphable., i.e. it could be your meeting place with your grandma after church or be a nice date place with someone special.

So she goes in the back and has some big guy come and say they close the lobby at 11:45. My husband says you guys close at 12 right? Because that's the time I'm leaving. The guy just walked away. Whole time we were eating we just heard laughs and giggles coming out the kitchen so they would let it be known they were talking about us.

In my opinion, the décor was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was nice they had a coat check. They also had a separate bar area from the tables so might be a good place to hang out with friends for a drink or two (or more). It was very busy but we were quickly seated by friendly staff.

Their Winterlicious menu was, well, a Winterlicious menu: portions were a bit small for me (I'm a big eater) and a few dishes might have gone better without (the appetizers which I'm not going to bother with). The tongue and cheek was my fave of the night; meat was very tender and flavours were just right. The portion was spot on; had it been more it might have been a bit too much tongues and cheeks. The grilled seabass was cooked to perfection; not dry at all and the sauce was flavourful. Might be a dish to try if you're a fish fan. The apple crumble was pretty good, not too sweet or sour for the apples, and the ice cream went really well. Their clementine sorbet was pretty 'refreshing' - would be a nice treat in the summer. However... it reminded me of the green tea ice cream you get at Japanese all you can eats... having said, you could've given a bigger scoop or at least used a better looking bowl to serve it in (just a suggestion).

Their Texas Toast is the best too.  I've never quite tasted toast like Raising Cane's Texas Toast.  Yum! cannot describe it.  The cole slaw they offer is not bad either.  What makes Raising Cane's my favorite fast food joint though is their sauce.  The chicken fingers are good but the sauce makes it better.  Raising Cane's is also very kid friendly.  They offer a kid's combo that includes cool Raising Cane's stickers.  I also like the decor and atmosphere of RC.  It's much more laid back an friendlier than other fast food joints.

A note to some skeptics who like chicken nuggets better than RC's chicken fingers.  Do you know what nuggets are made of?  Is there a part of a chicken that is called ""nugget""?

There were certain things I liked about the hotel and other things that slightly turned me off....

PROS:
-Location, location, location!!! Located in the middle of the strip
-Part of City Center, one of the newer 'sites' in Vegas with buildings, attractions, and amenities to admire
-As you walk into the lobby a sight whiff of vanilla greets you as well as a rather expansive lobby and waiting area 
-The casino is modern, dark, with purple plush scattered about
-room service is tasty
-well decorated, plush comfy beds
-the cabanas and the service you receive when you get a cabana is awesome: pool food was delicious; our drinks were strong; & our cabana boy was extremely attentive.  

CONS:
-the hotel room hallways are like a mouse maze due to the 'odd' shape of the building
-their standard room is relatively small compared to other hotels I've stayed at
-you control everything (lighting, curtains, etc) from a handheld device; sounds cool in theory, but in reality especially if you're stumbling back to the room at 3am a bit tipsy, trying to remember how to turn on the lights is a pain in the ass 
-an electrical port for the iphone is apparently installed in the rooms, but for whatever reason the standard iphone/ipod cord didn't work in Aria's ""iphone port."" We called downstairs to ask about it and was told a provided cord that would fit into the port was available, for purchase &#$!!
-bathroom is nice but have an odd set up: facuets are one hot and one cold (our particular room had issues with the water temperature); no place to hang towels/wet clothes except for the shower door; and the tub is in the shower

This being my first time staying at the hotel I was a bit disappointed and am not sure if I'd pay to stay here again when there are so many other hotel choices along the strip.",2011-08-28 20:06:22

AMBIANCE: Low lighting, mounted animals, and antler chandeliers.... oh my! 

SERVICE: We arrived a little early and our table ""wasn't quite ready yet"". No problem, there are multiple Pokestops nearby to hit up (judge me). Our waiter (dangit, I forgot his name) was great! Very friendly and personable and checked on us frequently. We made it halfway through our entrees when we got a phone call from our hotel for a noise complaint on our dogs. Unfortunately, we had to cut our dining experience short and our waiter speedily boxed our leftovers and expedited the bill process. We definitely appreciated this! 

FOOD: Winner, winner, duck dinner! Omg, the Dirty Pasta was sooooo good. We perused other Yelper's pictures that captioned the Dirty Pasta as ""their last meal on Earth""... I'm thinking ""yeah, right, stop, so dramatic"". Um, yeah, no... SERIOUSLY SO GOOD. Salty, slightly sweet, herbaceous, meaty, cheesy. DO IT! The brussels are also really good, very charred and covered in parmigiano reggiano. I've never had brussels with dill and it was definitely a unique twist. 

DRANKS: Kentucky Tea Party Punch was visually stunning and equally tasty. The cup was beautifully topped with a mint garnish and paired great with the Pimms and Jim. If you're interested to know what a hellfire shrub tastes like, then order the Wild Kind. I'm sure one could guess, but do it. I dare you.

The DVRAC consists of a small building that gives you the info about the history of the area, and what you are about to see outside. Once you exit the other side, you start on a short trail, that includes numbered stops. 

Your brochure has information about each stop. Or, you can wait until a tour starts, and have it all explained to you. There are also scheduled demonstrations and talks.

We were the only people there, so we really took our time, and examined everything. It's amazing how many petroglyphs there are, and so close together. You could spend a lot of time just hunting with your eyes. I did wish I had brought my binoculars, since some of them are a way up the hill.

We too, met Bear, who is actually not a ranger, but is employed by ASU. The property is owned by the company that built the dam, on which the building sits, and the facility is administered by students of ASU's anthropology, geology, and similar departments.

At any rate, since we were the only people there, Bear was able to spend a good deal of time talking with us. If you would like to meet him, hurry -- he is retiring soon.

Their sake collection is above average and fresh fruits and vegetables are vibrant--always carrying seasonal produce. Apple pears and soshito peppers are good now.  Even though they are known for Korean groceries, they also carry a variety of international products. 

Their food court offers many choices from sushi, pho, Chinese-Korean fusion, to of course Korean food.....as good as you can expect for a quick and simple food court at fairly reasonable price. Also, don't forget to stop at Lepidor bakery on the way out.

This place has a lot of promise.  The concept is solid, but the execution needs to be worked on.  There's a lot of open space for people to mull around, but there's nothing to DO for those folks.  There could easily be some blackjack tables in areas, or some slot banks.  Clearly, gambling isn't a priority here.  And that's fine, but it feels strange.

It wasn't too busy when we went earlier this evening and easily got two seats in a private booth. Service was also nice enough throughout our meal and we had no issues.

There were three appetizers that came out after we ordered: kimchee, sprouts and sweet sauteed onions. I only really liked the kimchee. I wished there were more options but it's free, so I guess I can't complain.

My husband and I got two dishes: the bibimbap and the pork belly and squid rice bowl. Both were $12 but the pork belly and squid rice bowl was the better value. It was more flavourful because of the spices mixed in to the sauce and had a more equal ratio of pork belly and squid to rice. 

The bibimbap was disappointing. It lacked flavour (hot sauce made it a bit better), barely had any meat in it, had a small handful of veggies and way too much rice in comparison to the other components of the dish. I wouldn't recommend getting this.

Half of me appreciated that and half of me felt like I was in a lab, not a spa.  Olivia was very nice and tried to make conversation, but I just felt like it was... forced?

She explained that the wax she uses is cold wax (whereas I've done hot wax for 15 years).  Allegedly the cold wax is supposed to adhere to the hair and not the skin making it less painful, but this was the loooongest waxing experience of my life.  Yowza.  I had my usual redness for a day or two after, but now less than two weeks later, the hair is already growing back and the skin is almost more irritated.  Apparently cold wax (or waxers) is not for me.",2013-10-08 23:38:25

The kiin breakfast was a bit pricy but you do get steak and chicken sausage. The flavours were wonderful but the portions were relatively small.

Did somebody say lunch time? 
Somewhere I heard someone say something about some food.

What a pleasant surprise this Little Saigon is. Nice openness - little rooms with big tables. The atmosphere was comfortable with a capital C - from seating, ordering, eating, to asking questions about the menu. I even felt comfortable being the typical annoying customer. 

Our servers were very kind and pleasantly accommodating. They informed the vegetarians in our party of chicken stock in the soup broth. Did we care? 

-- begin moment of silence --
...thinking of the chickens who gave their lives.
Uhhhh...a little animal flesh and blood never hurt nobody.  
-- end moment of silence --

Soup! Soup! Soup! Soup!

Food was tasty and plentiful. We ordered a multitude of items like three appetizers, boba, fried rice, tofu, veggies, spinach and onions, and a curry dish. Here were my personal choices:

1. Deep fried vegetarian egg rolls ($6) - six small crispy rolls accompanied by romaine leaves, parsley, mint, slices of cucumber and carrot. The rolls have tofu inside. I found one cube of it in each roll that was easily picked out with chop sticks.

2. Lotus root salad ($7) - sans pork. Tasty marinated lotus root and veggies served with four crunchy shrimp flavored rice chips on the side. Lotus is easily identifiable by sight, but its taste blended with the other veggies. The texture of it though is also unique. It reminded me of bamboo slices that get served in chow mein.

3. Bok choy soup w/ginger and onions ($8) - served in large bowl. Very good broth, close to a quart with dark green bok choy and few pieces of ginger and onion. The veggies alone would not be filling, but if you drink all the broth, you'd be full for the next hour or so.

4. Eggplant with onions and veggies ($8) - ordered spicy. It was good, but was not as spicy as I hoped. Took home leftovers.

I definitely recommend this restaurant to any vegetarian looking to try Vietnamese food.",2015-08-08 18:54:03

The food was really good! The first round at the salad/hot bar, everything was almost gone or not fresh. I had tried almost all of the cheeses offered, the cheese bread, the fried bananas, and the mushrooms. They were all luke warm but tasted so good so I went for seconds and thirds. We ordered the sangria pitcher which was delicious and reasonably priced, but took forever to comeout (20 minutes timed) 

The meat was okay. I had a few cuts of beef, and a bacon wrapped filet mignon. They were dry and had blood dripping out of all of them. They were all really rare, or rare.. not medium rare or anything in-between. There was also no way to ask for more or less meat. The people holding the meat slabs were almost non-existent and never came by our table so I was starving and had to get up 4 times to go to the salad bar. I was still starving by the time I left....

So I go back. The girl says ""what, that's not you?!""  ""No I am not a female named Arnold and my last name looks nothing like that.""  ""Oh.""  Fear strikes her eyes. She goes to the back. It seems they have lost my order. ""We'll get one together right away!"" 

-40 min after I originally started this madness (2 yr old hasn't had dinner yet=-O)-

I have my food, I'm at the register. They can't find my order so they can't ring me up. FINALLY check out after I had been there for almost an hour. 

Salmon roast wasn't packaged well and leaked all over my car. YAY! 

This whole experience blowed and not a single person apologized. I even tried to pry one out of someone by saying I would never do this again. Still no apology. Really?! I will not be doing this again. For real. I expect more from WF.",2016-11-23 02:14:51

Then, when we finally got to eat - well, everything (except the chicken, which was swimming in sauce) was dry.  Dry ribs, dry brisket.  The brisket was also fatty and tasteless.  No real flavor to any of the meat.  Pulled pork was flavorless.  I guess they cook the meat, and then since they have a pan of barbecue sauce at the end, you're supposed to add all the sauce yourself.  How is that barbecue?

Atmosphere: not enough ventilation for a bbq joint. Only 1 of 4 burners we had were working properly so we had to ask the kitchen to prepare our meats.

Price: overpriced for the quality of foods. Your required to order a minimum of 2 of the kalbi and bulgogi which is $30+ an order but when you cook it it's less than a small Plate of meat for 2. I guess I'm used to California portions. 

Food: I think if we had the opportunity to grill our own meats to the doneness of how we like it - it would have tasted ok. My kids came to dinner bc they offered sushi.. They didn't have sushi at all. Hot stone wasn't even hot stone it was rice no crispy under bottom. 

Service: we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu and the waitress never came back. My husband had to flag her down. Then well one of our burners didn't work bc our server elbowed our drink into the grill.  Changed it out but didn't work and then it seemed like it affected the burner next to it. They didn't replace the drink until I asked for it. Then we got a bill and still had to pay gratuity. After we paid our server came back and mumbled something about sorry for not giving us any service.

The french toast was a bit burned and didn't really taste like much.  The eggs benedict was good however a very small portion. Overall it wasn't bad but probably will never go back for brunch.

Phil immediately came by w/ menus & took our drink order.  He had water & lavash brought out, which I skip the water every where.  I'm very picky on water fyi. 

The Mezza Brio pasta & Riccotta stuffed tortellini w/ Vodka sauce was absolutely what we needed.  It was creamy & cheesy.  Also we add lots of red pepper flakes for that kick!   Phil was knowledgeable on the menu since I was indecisive.  I always get the Salmon w/ sweet potatoes salad on the menu & wanted to try something new.  His recommendations were awesome new favorites.  The Benzinger Chardonnay on a hot day is so refreshing also.  

Overall, I've never had bad service or food at Brio.  In Iowa & now at the Galleria Mall there is a 'Bravo' restaurant.

I like the california with salmon sashimi roll. I thought it was very tasty and the sashimi was quite fresh. 

The disappointing part was that one of my friends found a fly in his donburi and told the waitress. They told him they weren't able to re-do the meal. Kind of disappointing since what anyone would expect them to re-make the meal.

I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for some lunch while staying close by. The place had a good amount of people and usually will unless you come when they first open. This place has a massive inside and a ton of seating, although a lot of it is extremely uncomfortable thanks to most of the seating lacking any sort of back support. The menu here can best be described as Asian Fusion and offers a ton of options from Thai and Chinese to a good number of salads and tofu dishes. I ended up ordering the orange chicken (original, I know) and it only took about 10 minutes to come out (this place is usually super fast). The chicken itself was filled with flavour and delicious. The rice that went with it was basic rice but when mixed with the orange sauce was oh so good. The portions here are not massive, but they are what they should be. I have never left Salad King feeling hungry, I leave feeling good about the meal I ate. 

Overall, Salad King is a fantastic place to eat if you are in the Dundas Square area. You get quality food at reasonable prices and you can leave here knowing you didn't eat like a trash can. I highly recommend this place to anyone spending an afternoon/night downtown!",2018-05-29 12:11:41

I remember back in it's hay day when it was one of the few fine dining options in Summerlin and this place was packed....  It deserves to still be packed in my opinion.  
The food is excellent, the service is great, the wine list is reasonable and broad enough to please most, if not all palates. 
So let's start at the beginning...   Bread basket is fair, good, but no variety.  Had a lovely Belvedere Dirty Martini to start and it was well made.  We moved on to Aranici which was a special app and YUMMO! flavors were great, sauce was fresh.  I then had the half spinach salad, really good but HUGE only hate half the half lol.  We had a nice bottle of proseco with the meal, there was only one option by the bottle which was fine.  I then had the straw and hay, delicious but highly fililng, but my goodness there is something about fresh pees with cream sauce and pasta that simply makes me happy.  We finished with their dessert trio (which you can completely customize, just ask) we had the Tiramisu, Chocolate Cake and the creme brulee, I am not a Creme Brulee but the rest was awesome.  Coffee was fabulous italian coffee and they bring an entire carafe to your table.  The restaurant is beautiful, food is really good and service is great, I would highly recommend this place.  It is fairly bleak though as this hotel does not have much of a night life.  If the same restaurant was on the strip it would be packed I am convinced.",2013-05-30 12:59:52

We were staying at the Mandalay bay for the weekend & were looking for a place that had a UFC 196 viewing party. They offered $25 general admission for the standing room or $200 to spend on food & drinks for up to four guest at a table. Solid deal considering you'll be there 3-4 hours & $200 to split four ways is nothing.

Initially we were annoyed because the doors were suppose to open at 6 but there was an issue with some of the host being late that escort people up the elevator to the 64th floor so things were delayed half an hour. While waiting in line we talked to some people that have been there before & they assured us that the food will make up for the little delay we were all going through.

On the lounge side serve a limited section of the menu, it may seems a little pricy but it was worth every penny & I'm not the ""foodie"" type of person that typically defends expensive food just because it taste good. I think we went through five or six of the Yellow Tail plates, & two steak & chicken skewers. They made some pretty good drinks & the view on the outside patio is amazing.",2016-03-08 02:27:11
_RTusLGDN6q9FmUQMrIGEg,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,1,18,12,10,"Went here at 2 in the morning with my fam and some Yelp peeps after just getting done with our bowling UYE.

Already I have a bad first impression because as soon as the hostess saw there was about 12 of us, she told us it was gonna be about half an hour before we can get a table. As I looked around, it didn't seem like they were busy at all. I would say overall you had about 8 tables of customers being tended to. The feeling I was getting was that the hostess didn't really wanna be there.

So after about 35 minutes we finally got to sit down. It took about 10 minutes before our server came to get our order. We were all actually ready with our orders but she said she was gonna take our drink order first and to put that in. That's stupid. We already had 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide what we want but yet she insisted on getting our drink orders first. 

So she brings our drinks out after about another 10 minutes. We give her our order and off she went. What happened next almost made me walk out. It took 30 minutes, yes, 30 MINUTES for her to bring out our food. She could have refilled my soda at least twice in that time frame and for your information she never did. So by the time we got our food, it was just a little after 3 am.

I know what you're thinking. Since we had a party of 12, of course its natural that making that much food will take a while. Only thing was that all the food we ordered was off the graveyard special menu, meaning pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. So all the items we ordered were simple and quick things to make.

The first couple times I ate here around the same time, it was decent. This third time, I am now convinced not to eat here any more. It seemed everybody's attitude that worked there was like they did not wanna be there. If you don't like your job, find something else. We as a party did not demand anything special or were rude in our interactions. Even the manager I spoke to said it was usually slow around that time. I think he didn't wanna be there either. 

So in closing, just because they are 24 hours and they have graveyard specials, that doesn't always translate to great service and great food. For this place, the food is decent but the really bad service gives you a bitter taste in your mouth. I recommend going to Fatburger in the food court. They are 24 hours as well but I guarantee you wont have to wait an hour to get your food.",2013-07-14 05:26:24

I had a Chipotle Chicken Flatread thing which was kind of like a soft taco eating experience, but it was on a soft fluffy pita type of bread. The chicken was super tender and flavorful - perfectly cooked and beautifully seasoned. Most places overcook chicken which makes it tough and chewy, but the chicken here is juicy morsels of deliciousness. My sandwich also had bacon and cheese and veggies inside - all of it tasted just as fresh and delicious.

The prices here are unbelievably low for the quality you get as well. My sandwich was only like 4 bucks, and it was better than similar meals I've had at twice the price. It's so much healthier eating here than at a fast food place, but the price point seems to be in the same league. I know there was bacon and cheese in what I ate, but I still feel like I did my body a favor eating here instead of somewhere like Sonic or Subway or BK etc... It's strange because the prices here suggest those as their competition, but the quality of the food and fast-casual setup suggests more upscale. 

I suggest you eat here before they come to their senses and raise the prices appropriately. This is a family owned franchise... really nice folks. If you twisted my arm to come up with a gripe, I would say that the noise from them whipping up smoothies can get kinda loud if you're dining it, but this is the same issue at all smoothie places.

So we decided to order a couple drinks at the bar, and after about 20 minutes they said they can seat us but it still will take another 10 minutes before we can order food.

We finally order our food. I ordered a build your own veggie burger and a side of garlic Parmesan fries. My husband was dieting so he ordered a buffalo burger salad with no olives. He HATES olives.

It took about 25 minutes for our food to come out. The good news is my food was excellent for the most part. Their house made veggie patty is excellent and one of the best I had. The ciabatta bread I ordered as my bun was perfect. The Parmesan fries baffled me. The fries were lying on a bed of shredded Parmesan. Like about a cup of Parmesan. It seems to me it was thrown together very sloppily. Once I stirred it up the fries were pretty tasty.

My poor husband's bowl came out with a whole bunch of chopped olives on top of his buffalo. He really did try his best to pick out the tiny pieces of olives but the brine seeped into the rest of his food and made it taste like olives. He told our server and she took it back. When she brought it back and he tasted the food, it still tasted like olives. They didn't remake it, they just scraped the olives off. He complained and they remade it for him. Took another 15 minutes.

They apologized and comped us for his meal. Which is good because I thought everything was overpriced for what it was. Our server was very nice though, and I felt bad for her as this was not her fault but rather bad kitchen management.

I'm not paying uptown prices for mechanically separated no-name meat product which smells and tastes EXACTLY like those pork-tubes that Lido throws at you. Everything else in the dish was fine.

The place: It's small and the layout is awkward.  After you walk in, there's a staircase that leads upstairs almost directly ahead of you, and if you hang a quick right, there's the bar and a few seats by the window. It's all very cramped. If you squeeze past all that, there's a downstairs bit too. 

Decor/Ambiance: I didn't particularly care for either. Why? Because I didn't feel like there WAS a vibe. Maybe it was because I went right after work but I mean, it was a Thursday so you would think more people would be showing up between 5-7pm. They do have a kickass chandelier made from various wine glasses and champagne flutes thought. I mean, if that's your thing. The decor is ordinary and nothing to write home about.

The wine: I am not a wine connoisseur by any means, but I know what I like. Pullman has a very nice variety of wines from different regions that you can purchase by the glass or by the bottle. Take note - like any other place that sells wine by the bottle, they do so at inflated prices. I ordered a glass of white that was delicious - unfortunately I have no recollection of its name. And no, it's not because I was boozin'! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made some great suggestions so kudos to him. 

The food: Over. Priced. The theme here is tapas, so you can share your dishes or keep them all to yourself. I ordered the Mozzarella di Bufala with confit tomatoes and fennel. The portion was quite large and could easily be shared between 2-3 people. I did enjoy the dish, however the Mozzarella wasn't fresh and it was a little too cold for my taste. The tomatoes added a nice flavor, the fennel was well, fennel (I love fennel!), the vinaigrette  was a little too vinegary and the sliced capers seemed out of place in this dish. My friend had the quail, as well as the shrimp and Chorizo. I tasted this last dish and wasn't impressed. There was a weird flavor to it and the Chorizo was pretty darn firm and lukewarm. I then tried the goat cheese cheesecake with maple meringue, which was quite nice but the meringue was a bit dry and therefore crumbled very easily. You either had to take very slow and deliberate bites or shove the whole thing in your mouth, which just isn't ladylike. The maple meringue wasn't overly sweet but it seemed chilled. I would have liked it to be at room temperature.

Service: Meh. Despite 3-4 waiters hovering around the bar, it took forever to get service. One of the waiters kept walking by our table, looking me in the eye each time, but not once did he stop to ask if we needed/wanted anything. We had to get up and go get our bill as well. 

The price: Inflated. For one glass of wine, the Mozzarella and the dessert, it cost me $40. No thanks. I can get better tapas and equally good wine at a place like Dolcetto and not break the bank.   If I could just go to Pullman for the wine, I might go back, but I think you have to eat to drink - or at least, you used to.",2014-05-09 10:35:16

I'm always a little skeptical when dining someplace where someone has their name on a restaurant outside of Vegas, but I was so pleasantly surprised!

The waitstaff was a little slow for having two servers wait on each table. Surprisingly slow. I sat with my oyster plate in front of me long after I was finished. Same thing with my salad plate (both were obviously finished). I actually had to call the waitress over because it was beginning to get ridiculous. It still took a few more minutes to get it out from under me though.

The bread they serve is a warm sourdough (or some variation thereof) and was so soft and delicious. The butter on it made me feel like it was all I needed to be completely happy as a meal. 

I ordered the Blue Point oysters and they were of course delicious. They didn't offer any horseradish which I thought was strange, but I didn't need it anyway. My customer ordered the seared ahi tuna and I didn't like it nearly as much. It tasted a little dry, but he seemed to enjoy it. 

I also ordered the house salad and it was probably the best I've ever had. It had artichoke, tomatoes and cucumbers and tasted so fresh that I could have sworn they picked it out of the garden for me. I loved this. 

For dinner I ordered salmon and asked for it grilled. It came out perfectly cooked and flaky with a beautiful pink color. It was very good. As a side I ordered grilled asparagus which was a great accompaniment. 

My customer ordered the chilean sea bass. It was actually much better than I thought it would be, I just had a little bite, but I would definitely try it if I go back. 

For dessert we decided to share the very chocolatey  souffle. When it came out it had fallen and was undercooked so they brought us this huge slice of chocolate cake. The first bite I knew it was frozen. I asked and they confirmed that while it was made at the corporate office it was still frozen. This is my biggest pet peeve. Fine restaurants should NEVER serve frozen cake, it's disgusting. I'm surprised more people don't complain because it was just so...fake. We ignored it. 

One last thing, while we were there the comedian playing next door, Ron White, wanted to dine here. The waiter came over (our other one) and said that he would be sitting next to us and to please not disturb him. I thought it was pretty tasteless to think I'd interrupt my not-so-cheap meal in order to gawk at and fawn over some cut-rate comedian playing a casino. Not classy at all. 

The food here is incredible, I highly recommend it, just don't expect phenomenal service to go with that.",2014-04-02 04:46:47

I tried a Ham Roll.  It was savory with a small amount of ham inside.  The texture of the bun was soft and chewy after microwaving it for 20 seconds.  This was my favorite one of all the new ones I tried.

The Pork Sung Bun looked like a popover.  The top of it was layered like puff pastry.  The filling was dry shredded pork, like tiny bacon bits.  I would not get it again.

The Custard Bun with Maple Syrup was like the bun from a dim sum house, except with a smooth top.  The custard was soft and creamy.

I bought a combo pack of mini cheese, ham, and corn buns.  
The Cheese Bun just had cheese on top.  There was nothing inside.  
The Ham roll was a mini version of the one described above with ham inside.  
The Corn Bun was unusual.  It had corn and ham on the outside.  I would not buy the Corn Bun again.  It came in a larger version too.

To finish, we had a tiramisu, panna cotta with amarena cherries, aged balsamic and salt, and a latte. The tiramisu tasted like chocolate than coffee.

Located right next to The Greene House (another Fox restaurant concepts restaurant). We got seated right away for dinner around 5:30 pm. Although the table was small and very close to other tables, the restaurant was definitely ""homey' enough for it NOT to be distracting. 
Our server came to us with a plate of olives (which none of us ate unfortunately)

We started with the bruschetta appetizer. Prosciutto with asparagus and crescenza cheese. Although pricey and portioned small, the flavors balanced each other well enough to satisfy the taste buds. 

After asking our server, we decided to split the Strozzapreti dish: pesto sauce with pine nuts and crispy capers. Add chicken for a little extra. The portions were perfect to be split. A hungry customer would've definitely been able to finish a regular dish to themselves though. The dish was a little bit salty because of the capers. Otherwise, very tasty. We asked for bread to neutralize the ""saucy-ness"" and they happily gave us two slices no charge. 

Tiramisu for dessert. MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. so good!

By the end of our dinner, the lighting was dimmer and the restaurant a bit louder. They do have an open kitchen which makes the restaurant a little more casual. My main complaint is in the small dining area, people stare at you and your food and it is sooo obvious. Moreso because their tables are so close to yours, its as if you are sitting at one table but...not really.

They carry all the instruments from guitars, drums, harmonicas, bass, tamborine, keyboards, even DJ equipment and most surprisingly they even have lightings and disco balls which I find hilarious cause I always wanna have one for my bedroom (well probably one day..). My first impression when I walk into the store is finding how noisy it is, probably because all the customers can try out the instrument with amplifier and just play it right on the spot, if we are lucky enough, we would hear a really good music coming out from all that amplifier, but most likely every time I go there, I always find people who try out their instruments like they are having a rock concert, banging and strumming it out loud (if you are having a headache, stomachache or toothache definitely not recommended to step into this place without ear plug). The minus is they don't carry all of the brands. It really hard for me to find Warwick bass and they have to order it from another store and they told me if I return it I must cover the shipping fee, which is totally surprising consider the store which they gonna take the bass from is not charging any shipping cost. The good side of Guitar Center that I really like is having a really good sales like Paul. He's always there to guide me whenever I need something and really patient in giving thoughts and ideas or even fixing my instruments. The other thing that I enjoy the most is they always have a really good sale (discounts) and they can match the price if you found cheaper price from other store (even online ones). The manager also offer to cover 50% of the insurance so you only paid half of the insurance price whether its 1 or 2 yrs warranty.

Mismatched everything! Cute interior! Those were my first two thoughts when I entered this place with my family. Well, that and the fact that the heat wasn't working on a Sunday night, but since we were all wearing thick jackets we decided to stay, especially seeing the positive reviews here. 

The restaurant was empty when we arrived at around 8:30pm, with only two tables occupied. Regardless, we stayed and looked at the menu, which wasn't very extensive and mostly covered the fundamentals of Japanese comfort food. I ordered a curry gyu udon, added a grill squid as an appetizer, and topped it off with a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows due to the lack of heat in this place that night.

The hot chocolate came first, and I liked how the marshmallows melted into the hot chocolate as it was sitting. The taste was a little bland though, and reminded me more of a latte than actual hot chocolate. The grill squid came after, and after mixing the squid with the sauce and bonito it tasted very good! The squid is chewy, but not too tough or not too soft, and the sauce was done perfectly. Finally, the curry gyu udon had excellent curry and decent beef. The udon is good if you like it on the chewy side, but I can see some customers not liking it due to the slightly tougher than usual texture.

If you order any of the donburis, it comes with a free miso soup. However, I successfully requested one despite me ordering udon, and I must say it was one of the better miso soups I've drank.

My parents possessed two free uji matchas, so I decided to try one for dessert. It was quite good! Since it's matcha it's not as sweet as your typical green tea ice cream, but still quite flavourful.

This place is a great addition to the already busy and diverse New Kennedy Square/Peachtree plaza, but I am a little worried about whether the demand will be there for this place.

Their chairs are the nicest ones I've experienced. In addition to that, I opted for a deluxe pedicure and received at least 15 minutes total of foot rubbing.

Holsteins is located at The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino directly across the entrance to the Marquee Pool and Day club. Because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  We did have a reservation and were seated on time. The decor at Holsteins is eighties cool. Cartoon Artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. After looking over the menu, my wife Simone ordered the Meatball Parm sliders and I ordered the Nom-Nom burger topped with melted cheese, Potato Chips and House made thousand Island dressing. The food came out fairly quickly, and on the side I had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin french fries. My burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). An overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. The burger could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. The Chips on top were the best part of the burger. Medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to the burger, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. Simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. The meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. They were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. I so wanted to steal them from her and I had total meat envy.  We finished off the meal with a Reese PB adult shake spiked with Frangelico called the Drunken Monkey.  Any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because I could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. It was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.

We didnt even have the menu yet!!!  He was annoyed with us for some reason!  When he came back to ask again any question, I asked if he can tell me about the veal...his answer, ""its good!""  Wow...thanks! No details, nothing...maybe tell me a bit more...after all, YOU asked me about if I had any questions!  
After we ordered and more guests came in...I was surprised to see how friendly our waiter was to everyone else. They got the specials right away, friendly chatting, ...I never felt so unwanted in a restaurant before.  It was also cool to hear from our waiter (when he was so friendly to other tables) that we were sitting in the old pool area of the plaza! The space is small, so you can hear everything, specials and cool stories!  To top everything off, when asked about dessert, I stated I would like to take advantage of the Yelp check in free dessert special...oh boy, did I get the eyes rolled for that. With a heavy breath...our waiter rudely stated, ""For that, you have no choice, so no need for a menu...""  Pretty dramatic of him!  Ya, never again...I knew I was not welcomed there, and shame on them for employing such a judgmental, rude server. Obscenely obvious, you did not want to wait on my wife and I! I have more class than you to blow your name up on here, but I do have your name and know I will never recommend Oscars because of you.",2016-12-20 02:23:33

The potato purée went so well with the egg, really surprising at how good those two went together. It was topped with chives and some sea salt. My only complaint is that there was a bit too much salt, and I had already mixed it all in. I wish there was an option to add shredded bacon to it, that is the only way it could've been improved upon.

In the last few years Ruby's changed their decor and menu to differentiate themselves from the Applebees, TGIFridays, etc and went a little more upscale.  It works.

Of course they kept the salad bar which I think they are the only restaurant of its kind with a salad bar anymore.  

Things that are good at Rubys are the Turkey burger, the lobster dishes (very reasonable), their mac and cheese, and more.  The salad bar is hit or miss.

I think there is room for so much creativity, and you can pack a lot of flavors and awesomeness between two buns. Often the difference between an amazing sandwich and a mediocre one comes down to one toping or sauce so the unforgettable sandwiches shops are the ones that have picked every ingredient with some thought.  So needless to say that I was very excited about TLP and been waiting for a day that I might ""forget"" to pack lunch and stop by. Entering the place they have all the right signs for a fantastic little sandwich shop. Small space with a couple of seats, simple decorations and a short but interesting list of options on the menu with creative unfamiliar names for each sandwich. 

I tried the Harrison which was almost like a burger with a layer of fried cheese and jalapeño and chili relish and garlic aioli. It was very big (as were all the options it seemed) and did taste pretty good. However,  I do feel like it was missing something. Maybe it just needed some salt or some sort of kick (I expected the relish to be spicy(er) but it wasn't). I did like it overall but was expecting a bit more for some reason. I am going to try their other sandwiches as I'm sure I'll be back again. Also , their fries were really good. Thick cuts, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The prices were also reasonable.

I tried the tuna, it was funky & I tossed it :/ I tried my son's California roll as a result, and it was the usual but for a roll, I'd rather go for the fresh crab roll pre made a Glaziers over this.

Positives were: 
They did pack everything nicely & didn't forget anything or mess up the order ( since I eventually ordered to-go). They even remembered the cutlery & soy sauce. It's the small things! :) 
The citrusy ginger side salad was as good as any lunch special Japanese side salad. The dressing was flavorful. So overall, just too lackluster.

If someone requested no onions, then the employee should've explained that - what if I was allergic? *hint, hint* The guy was just a jerk all around & I feel their menu is too small & doesn't offer enough variety.

Pros: During the day it's not too bad minus that you get talked to in multiple languages despite you clearly are not of Asian/Filipino bloodline. They have super fast service and 8 of 10 times it's fresh. 

Con: Do not bother with the night staff and the service in drive thru. 9 of 10 times no matter what you order and even if you are the only car there you will have long wait just to order and then a long wait to get the food. Usually the process at night drive thru service is about 15mins even if you are the only car there. That's from pulling up the the speaker box to the moment you get your order. However, there has been more than one occasion where it took double that time. One time they greeted me and ask for me to wait a moment before I placed my order. They didn't come back on the speaker for 11mins. There was only on car ahead of me in the driver through and have been at the window when I arrived.

$4.49 STEAK & EGGS !!!!!!!!!!!!

It used to only be $3.99, but the price raised the extra .50 cents a month or so ago, because they now offer this spectacular deal ONE HOUR EARLIER ! Unlike most steak and egg specials which start at midnight, this establishment now offers it at 11 pm. 

It's not the greatest thing you'll ever eat, but for a broke college student who tends to either party the night away or study the night away - this is a God send. Service is usually pretty quick [again this is late at night, I'm not sure about their peak hours]. 

I'd recommend ordering the steak one level under what you would usually order. For example, if you like Medium, order it Medium-Rare. The cooks usually over cook the steak. One time, a group of us ordered steak ranging from Rare to Medium Well, and each and everyone one of our steaks was cooked to Medium. Which of course, made me happy as that's how I like my steaks, but my fellow steak and egg eaters were not too happy.

Very difficult to find which makes this place even more alluring once you finally find it.  It's in the plaza right before the jade/ramen area.  You'll pass by a few law firms and an acupuncture clinic before you find it nestled as the very last building. 

Until 04/30th there is a promotion going on for buy one get one 50% or 30% with a yelp or facebook check in.

Setting: Very cute and they did a good job at going for the coffee shop fad that is going on now. The music playing is your typical bon iver type radio station that isn't on too loud like it is at serenade or cafe darak. There are plenty of places to sit which accommodate mostly couples but there is a large that fits six.  Another highlight of this place is the amount of outlets available. This store definitely took the effort to install outlets to help techies like me stay charged.

Service: The female manager was very kind and delivered a convincing story to her coffee shop. Basically, ""We don't serve drinks that we don't like,"" which makes total sense.  Why conform when you should create a product you yourself would want to buy?

Drink: I got the hazelnut frappe which could have been blended better but it was still good.

As with most Korean restaurants the service is so-so. They are quite nice and friendly if and once you get their attention. Also I find that the system they use for customers waiting for a table is not that great or organized, which is really no system at all. But they make up for it with the side dishes! They always give the pancake and noodles and potatoes and other rotating dishes, at least 8 total. I do get full from just eating the side dishes. Our fav go-to dish is the bulgogi table cooking. The meat is generally tender and well mariniated. You can cook yourself and get it freshly cooked from the hot plate to your prefered wellness. Also comes with some yam noodles and your choice of soup! I usually get the tofu soup with seafood because it's not spicy.

The decor is a bit outdated but it's a very traditional Korean style. It would be nice if they could update it a bit. The parking lot at the back is a bit run down but at least there's free parking, if you can find a spot.

I oped for a veggie dog in the seasonal style with a roasted pablano and pumpkin cream. I was skeptical but it worked well.

We started off rocky a week ago with a porchetta sandwich that was a little light on the por and super heavy on the... uh... etta? More fat, less meat. There we go. Tamar loves you guys though, and she's like my Jewish mom. Mom said go back. I did. And I'm happy I did. 

The chicken salad sandwich is pretty spectacular. It's served on toasty sourdough along side some greens with a zippy little dressing that's a lil sweet and a lil sour. Chicken isn't overly dressed in thick mayo-y mayhem. It's super light, packs quite a punch, and you should love knowing it's local. 

Not typically a dessert eater pie grabbed my eye, and when I asked the gent for a rec (Scott maybe?) he said blackberry was the way to go. And so I went there. He warmed that bad boy up post sandie and then I shoveled it in my mouth the second he dropped it off. Seriously at one point I remember saying to myself (internally) ""take a break... you've been going at this thing, you're in public... breathe... enjoy."" But it was too good. Flaky crust. Tart berry inside. Coarse sugar sprinkled atop. The only thing missing was cloyingly sweet aftertaste and corn syrup which they apparently don't use to bind fruit. (Big ups for that.)

And now a plea: Furniture builders of Madison... craft a cool table to run the entire length of the wall and give these guys more seating. They're growing, and it'll be impossible soon (like tomorrow) for mass peeps to eat and enjoy. Donate a mean mesa and I bet they'll put your cards out and tell everyone they know about your rad add.

So instead of walking another 50 yards to the entrance and blister our feet, we jump over some rope that's three feet high. We start to wade in the pool and some life guard tells me I need to get out and walk to the entrance.  Of course I look at her and tell her it isn't happening.  She then says she's going to call security, which she does. I tell her don't bother, we're leaving this freaking park. 

So I walk to the customer service people - who were the only ones not rude in that park - and tell them what happened. They get the supervisor or AKA stupidvisor of the life guards because that's what this guy was - and he begins to tell me what the rules are and I tell him if he implemented those rules and my feet are blistered, then Wet N Wild would have a law suit as a result.  He gets nasty with me and tells me those are the rules and if you don't like them you can leave the park. What a jerk!  Fire the guy!

Nevertheless, we got our refund and left the park.  This whole experience was all within 10 minutes of entering this ridiculous park.  WET n WILD, you're in freaking Arizona and you have a responsibility to make sure you provide a safe environment for those customers that over pay you for your services and you have failed to provide that. Look at SunSplash and the Wave.  They have watered paths to their rides. And speaking of ride, several of your rides were closed, and you have the freaking nerve to charge full rate!

NEVER GO TO THIS PARK UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO BE DISAPPOINTED.",2014-06-30 11:07:48

JZBWolnvYhq05ApqEKNNMw,-rlIN1BFK65MyHWt_HhPJg,eZDXz_RylvdD0tHEA8I0NA,4,0,0,0,"Sushi is a funny thing in Charlotte.  You have your ""high end"" places and you have an expectation, then you have your ""standard"" places and you have another expectation.  New Zealand breaks the mold, driving up you figure it's a standard, lower end poor quality place....once you are served you realize it's quite the opposite.

I came to New Zealand on a recommendation from a co worker who, so far, hasn't let me down.  Lunch time on a Saturday I walked in and saw a cramped space bustling with activity.  A huge party and everyone smiling.  They handed me 3 different menus and when they were opened I was impressed at the selection.  My Daughter who has celiac was with me and upon telling the server he gave me comfort that they would take care of her, and when then brought the bottle of gluten free tamari I was sold!  

I started out with the shrimp soup.  It took a bit to arrive but it was worth the wait.  Broth had these fried onion things which gave it such a great flavor and it was a perfect start to an amazing meal.  I had the Tom Roll which was fresh, and when I say fresh you can tell they take pride and judging by the amount of sushi coming out of the kitchen nothing there lasts long.  The roll was hearty and well done and I smiled while eating it knowing I had a new place for sushi.  My daughter had a special California roll and was happy with what she received.  

New Zealand may need to expand soon as it was packed and people were waiting outside.  The staff was friendly knowledgeable and the guys rolling sushi didn't stop the whole time I was there.  Not sure what level I have to order so that I can get my meal served on one of those huge sushi boats but I'm doing it next time, I swear.

New Zealand, I love you and will be back soon with friends......",2018-08-05 21:01:27

The food was very good but it did not react well that night with my stomach. Probably not their fault so I did want to give them another try.  I was waiting in line for over an hour which I was fine with.  When I was about to order they said they were out of ribs.  While I was standing in line for the hour they could of informed us they were running low or out of ribs.  The first sign of them telling us they were running low on ribs was about an hour of me waiting in line and I was next to order.  This was very unprofessional.  So note to everyone , if you go about an hour and a half before they close your probably going to have to wait in line and not get ribs and not be informed about it.

Maha's is a small family run Egyptian restaurant in the Leslieville area.

I went on a Thursday afternoon with a friend hoping to avoid any long lineups. Upon arriving we were quickly seated and the place is quite small and quaint and probably seats 20-30 people at most.

We ordered the Cairo Classic ($12 plus tax), the Pharaoh's Po Boy sandwich ($9 plus tax) and Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken sandwich ($7 plus tax) and a Turkish coffee ($3 plus tax).

The Cairo Classic ($12 plus tax): it was fresh, well executed and nicely presented. It was good but not  amazing, it's more of a hearty, comfort food breakfast meal.

The Pharaoh Po Boy sandwich ($9 plus tax): This sandwich drizzled with lime juice was amazing. perfectly seasoned, nice light batter and the shrimps were cooked perfectly. Something you have to try at Maha's.

Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken sandwich ($7 plus tax): Another sandwich that was really good, marinated chicken tossed with chopped parsley, onions and tomatoes in a sauce that consisted of tehina, mayo and garlic.

Turkish Coffee ($3 plus tax): It's really hard to describe this because I have never had Turkish coffee before but the taste is very distinct and at the same time very strong but in a good way.

Overall, I think Maha's is a great small family restaurant that offers great Egyptian food that is hard to find in Toronto. It's a small quaint place and as I mentioned before it probably doesn't seat more than 20-30 people, so I can see how busy it can get on a weekend. Nonetheless, it's definitely a restaurant worth trying with great food and friendly service.",2015-02-25 05:55:18

I thought we'd missed it and decided to give it a try since it was listed as one of Pittsburgh Magazine's best restaurants of 2016.  That list is usually pretty great, but they definitely missed on this one.  Attempt #2 here produced another variation of the same overly sweet, gloppy, soggy mess that we got the first time.  There was no spice at all on the entrée and the rice seemed old and dry.  The wontons were super chewy and did not come with any sauce.

I am just underwhelmed. It was the thought I had for most of the night and exactly what +1 said when we left. It had that ""good, but not great"" for as much awesome praise I've heard for Butcher and The Rye. Especially after being taken to a beautiful sugar bread dream brunch at its older brother Meat and Potatoes, I wanted a spiced bread dream dinner here.  Not the case. I don't want to leave three stars as I did enjoy it, but we probably won't be back.

We made reservations, which you should probably do (and can do, right here, on this page, on Yelp!).  The place itself is a wreck of gothic damask and mixed sets of encyclopedias meets cabin full of taxidermy.  There are a few themes going on here, and it is looking rougher than Kennywood's new version of Noah's Ark. When you walk in, there are big, reclaimed wood style tables and a massive bar which is gorgeous, but upstairs is a different story (the 2nd story, that is.. ha!).  We were seated in the hell that is parties of two along the wall where even I had a hard time wedging between them--and we're a small people.  When others are eating, they do not typically want my bum on their table.

With our drinks, the Jessica Rabbit and the Frankly, My Dear, we were all right. The Jessica Rabbit was a generic gin and juice.  Frankly was a little bit (emphasis on LITTLE BIT .. it was a third of a rocks glass) of whiskey with a whole buncha sweet.

But the real deal here is supposed to be the food, right? I had been scouring the menu for over a week as I don't eat beef or pig (AKA why did you go here, lady?).  Luckily, they had the mac n cheese and focaccia for which I threw my lactose intolerance to the wind and went for it. +1 eats anything, so the pig candy and onion soup sounded great.  Everything came out in these tornados of small plates to the tiniest table.  The focaccia was all mine.  A loaf covered in onions--some cooked, some not so lucky--and not much else to note, served with a ricotta whip that could have been Philadelphia, a white bean paste which tasted exactly how it sounds, and an olive tapenade that could have been roasted red pepper mush for all I know.  I hate having no positive opinion on something, so the bread itself was not bad.  I actually did like the mac n cheese a lot, if only for the toasted shredded top.  And they were shells! Praise the pasta gods.  +1 didn't rave about anything. The candy was a square of pig, the onion soup tasted very .. earthy.  I ended up saying forget it, box up half the dinner, order another drink and dessert.
The second drink was probably the worst choice of the night.  The ""10th Circle"" is listed as gin, lime, chartreuse, rosemary, ginger, curry tea. That's all.  When I received a typical looking gimlet, I was excited.  But then I found a heavy sprinkle of what I guess was cayenne on top.  Why. You forgot to tell me that part. Welcome to the 10th circle?  Probably should have seen that coming. I passed most of it off to +1.

I had been dreaming of the s'mores all day.  A scoop of fried ice cream with bourbon marshmallows and chocolate? Absolutely.  This was worth it.  Everything else didn't hit it off with me.

I actually recommend to come here for just dessert.  I wonder if they serve ice cream at the bar.",2015-03-19 16:21:59

However, Carolyn in the cash register area is an absolute gem. 
She went out of her way to help me, she was kind, caring and professional. 
I continue to shop there.

Places like Off The Strip set the standard for pricing and I remember an Italian restaurant that tried to match their pricing except for one big difference--Off The Strip gets it and they didn't. SOOO, they went out of business. Owners: it's a cautionary tale that you have to take seriously. You can't charge super pricing for this type of food. I know I know, you already got your flyers printed....but guys, that's cheap to replace. You also have a digital menu...changing that is easy.

Hands down best customer service of any fast food place, every staff member is super helpful and polite. Also ending everything with ""it's my pleasure."" Now I am sure they are trained to say it, but it also seems like they genuinely mean it. 
How many other fast food places come around to your table if you are dining in, and ask if you need refills on your drinks. None that I can think of, except for something like Showmars, which I categorize slightly differently that your ""typical fast food'.
Food is always hot and fresh, I have never had an order messed up, can't say that about any other fast food.

Came here yesterday for a break away from my daughter with the great company of my grandmother. it was super packed, which I had never seen before. especially at 1pm. Great sign that business is booming!

Walking in, I knew I wanted something cool and refreshing since it was over 80 degrees out. So i ordered a 16 oz carmel mocha frap. On the other hand my gram is old fashion and was craving coffee so she got a plain old black coffee. I like that when you order plain coffee, you receive as much as you like. Which is a great deal you cant sway from. 

Since it was lunch time we wanted something small and filling. Looking at the top, far menu behind the counter we couldnt read well. Yes, I have bad eyes :P The young lady at the counter was sweet and helpful and handed us larger, clearer menus that said the sandwiches and what was in them. We finally decided upon the Turkey, bacon, guac. I was watching my carb intake, so I couldnt decide between their two options listed. The girl was kind enough to offer a third, hidden choice.. it was their healthy spinach wrap. that was what we went with. I being the fatty asked for a side of mayo. 

Sitting, the coffee was ready within five minutes or so. The sandwich took another five or so and they made it fresh in front of us. It was the most delicious wrap I had ever had no joke. The bacon was extremely crunchy. The guac wasnt overwhelming and there was a huge amount of turkey. I was impressed. They had cut it in half and it was a generous size sandwich wrap. 

Love that this place is 24 hours, dogs are allowed out on the patio (they have doggie water bowls outside), free wifi (with code), has a drive through, tasty coffee and reasonably priced breakfast and lunch sandwiches. sounds like a winner to me. This is def going to be my favorite spot from now on!!",2012-05-01 04:37:53

This is equivalent to Terribles Buffet back in the day but at 4x the price.
$21.99 (but we had a buy one get one that came in the mail).

-It's close to my house without having to deal with a ""real"" buffet on the strip w traffic, etc...which is why I think it gets customers in the door at THAT price and with THAT food.
-The tandoori chicken was decent and somewhat authentic

The lows:
-Very cheap meat (brisket and some other hunk of beast next to it)
-No steak...not even a sirloin cut? $21.99 and it's Brazilian night...throw something out there
-Egg drop soup was watery
-Chicken noodle soup was too salty
-Limited ingredients to make a garden salad...tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, cheese and dressing...no croutons, no onions, no carrots, no broccoli
-Limited options and since nothing was excellent, I didn't leave stuffed

I love the baby buddha bowl with crispy tofu on brown rice -- don't be fooled by the word ""baby"", as it's a generous enough serving for a full meal. Ask for the house-made hot sauce to make it even more delicious. I've also had weekend brunch here which is also nicely done; the Tex Mex Tortilla Scramble is a hearty and satisfying meal for $11.

Aside from the food, I also really like to make my own juice combinations -- my current favourite is apple, pear, pineapple and kale. If you get a 32oz juice to go, you get a take-home Fresh glass bottle and a 15% discount whenever you bring it in for a refill. 

Be warned, as this location gets pretty busy (no reservations) and it's not uncommon to have to wait up to 20 minutes for a table during prime hours.

The smell of barbeque is wafting in the air from the parking lot since their smoker is out in front smokin up some ribs. The menu selection is simple but full of delicious homestyle comfort food choices. So I chose the two meat combo plate with choice of two side dishes (mine were Cincy style fries & Sweet Potato Casserole)  and Texas toast. I was in for a real treat!
 
Ribs and Pulled Pork -  Excellent!! This is way the ribs are done!  Sweet, Smoky and just a kick of Spicy! The seasonings they use for their dry rub are flavorful, you do not really need much sauce for it. That's a pet peeve of mine; when BBQ places drown their ribs or pulled pork with sauce. So I love how they use BBQ sauce here as a compliment for the ribs.  Smoked just right. Meat tears away from the bone easily.  Same deal with the pulled pork. One bite and I am forever hooked to Top Notch Barbeque for sure! The 2 meat combo plate came with 2 ribs and a huge portion of pulled pork. Mr. B ordered the smaller combo (yeah I know make me look like the piggy!)  It was $14.99 for 1lb of pulled pork 2 sides and Texas toast. A very good deal for the portions you get. This place beats out the chain BBQ places in every way.
  
Cincinnati Style Chili Fries - This is good stuff!  The fries are the thicker cut type topped with Chili and cheese.  Cincy style chili beef is finely grounded so the texture is not as chunky, it's almost like a meat sauce. The blend of spices are more on the sweeter rather than the spicy side, I tasted the cinnamon right away. For a side dish served with the combo the serving was plentiful.

Sweet Potato Casserole - It's OMGoody goodness!  Came as one of my other side dish choices. The whipped sweet potatoes were pack full in a mini bowl and topped brown sugar candied pecans. If you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll love this side dish. It's not over the top sweet, but this dish can also pass as desert in my opinion. In fact I did order an extra side to take home and will have it for my dessert. It was just that good!

The restaurant is part of Doc Hollidays but there is a separate entrance and it's divided from the bar/gaming part so families with younger children are welcome here.  The dining area is large, pretty light and airy, the walls have western motif deco going on.  Plenty of seating. Couple of booths against the walls and table/chairs that can be easily arrange to seat large groups.  Service was good! Our server Tommy  friendly and attentive, greeted us as soon as we stepped in, had our drinks out to us right away, took and got our orders promptly, refilled drinks when needed.  The  owner and THE Pit Master himself Jimmy also came to our table to check up on us as well.   Top Notch Barbeque lives up to it's name. Looks like I found my first lunch spot for 2013!

I ordered probably the most basic Italian dish, but the hardest one to get right! Spaghetti and meatballs, and OMG were they bland! Besides being bland, they lacked moisture and were a bit to hard for my taste! I love to taste the cheese in my meatballs, the bread crumbs , and the parsley! Idk what they do or don't add to theirs, but they were so plain! I would not order that again! 

As far as the Italian wedding soup, it should be called chicken noodle soup, because that's all it was, we legit got two tiny meat balls!!! I've never known it to have shredded chicken, weird! That wasn't horrible  flavor wise, but the broth was kind of thick, the meatballs must of been boiled then sautéed cause they had a crust! Once again meatballs should be tender, and a boil for them in a soup like that is all that's needed! Lastly the noddles were big, we all know how small of a pasta this soup is traditionally served with!

If you go on a Fri or Sat evening, you better have a reservation or be prepared to wait for two hours.

I called early on Sat around lunch requesting a reservation that evening. I was told they had reached their reservation capacity. The story is they only allow about two thirds of the inside and outside tables for reservations so they can accomodate walk-ins. While that may be true it still feels like they make you wait so you can stimulate their bar business.
They were successful with our party of five.

We got there at 830p and were seated at 1030p. By that time, half the restaurant was empty.

The inside tables were closing down so they seated us on the patio. It was only about 85 degrees. 

They did have a guy singing and playing which was cool, mostly covers and we were all impressed that he would attempt...'Don't Stop Belivin' by Journey.

We all had Sushi...it was good...not stellar or exceptional but good. I had the Chef's Nirvana platter, mosty everyone else had the LaVa platter.

I don't know, man..... I just don't really know what else to say. This place was just average I guess. I was there for the lunch buffet and to repeat Misti Y., it did seem like for what they offered combined with freshness level, it was a tad pricey. I did think the food tasted really good, and I liked the vegetarian dishes and both dessert options. They had a carrot/raisin pudding and a sweet rice noodle/coconut pudding. Mixed together, it was so friggin' GOOD! 

Now here's the major bummer. One of my favorite things is Indian ""Nan"" bread. I was NOT feein' this place's nan (at least, not on the buffet). It's supposed to be somewhat fluffy and soft. This place's nan seemed like it had sat out too long or something, because it was flat and pretty hard in places. It was disappointing, because it is meant to be ripped up and used to scoop up the yummy rice and curry mix with your hands. I couldn't even rip off a piece anywhere without getting a hard, unbend-able hunk of bread.

I was recommended to try the Kingfisher beer, which apparently is a popular beer consumed in India. It's a light beer, but has a bitter, hoppy kick to it.. Unfortunately, I had to flag down a waiter just to order it. 
They sat us down, and just left. My mom wanted to go up and get a plate immediately, but I told her to wait a few minutes because at a buffet, they are supposed to come over and ask what you want to drink. No one ever came. We just sat there staring at each other for five minutes while waiting for someone to stop by the table, to no avail. Kinda odd.

With a great location, I can multi task, by visiting the local stores in the same complex, and make my trip downtown worthwhile.  It has ample parking, plenty of deals, and best of all, my size.

If you find that some of the other Marshalls don't have what you are looking for, give this location a try as it is slightly different.

From Lucky Brand Jeans, to Ralph Lauren, Tommy and others, this is a designers showcase, even in larger sizes.

The only real downside can be the wait during a busy dinner hour, but since they've expanded the back room that wait is a lot less frequent.

There are several excellent vegetarian options that are delicious and they can alter most non-vegetarian items if you prefer fake chicken, fake sausage, or a veggie patty. Their fake chicken is my personal favourite. Most dishes come with a variety of sides from which you choose (coleslaw, salad, fries, rice) and all are delicious. 

The service is stellar, fairly relaxed and friendly. On the odd busy night, I occasionally feel a little rushed near the end of the meal but this is to be expected when there is a line of 10 waiting at the door. 

The beer selection is limited by the number of taps they have but they typically have my favourite beers on tap so I don't mind much. 

On top of all this, the prices are extremely good for a nicer than average, funner than average, and friendlier than normal restaurant.",2010-01-18 03:03:23

Charlie Paler Steak has come into it's own and is now a great steak eatery.  Non steak eaters will not find much to eat (couple of fish dishes, a lobster, chicken breast, rack of lamb).

Yes it exudes elegance. Yes the service is steakhouse proper versus steakhouse friendly.  It's steakhouse service that guys would be comfortable bringing their ladies to.  

Straight forward steakhouse starters (oysters on the half shell, shellfish platter, prawn cocktail; nothing wrong, nothing stands out.   Excellent American Wagyu tartare with fried quail egg.  Hand cut beef, balanced seasoning.  Very good without being too cloying.  The pan seared foie is inventive.  The traditional sweetness and acidity is provided by a pineapple upside down cake and a strawberry gastrique.  Stunning.

Steak mains now impress. The Kagoshima A5, yes A5 filet mignon ($40/oz four ounce minimum).  Eclipses the A4 quality at other top steakhouses.  Simply seared and seasoned with sea salt.  Sublime.  Sweet, clean beef flavor  and it literally melts in your mouth.  Think otoro tuna.  The wet aged USDA Prime charcoal grilled filet is excellent.  Extremely high heat charcoal creates the perfect crust.  The charcoal imparts a good smoky bitterness that elevates the sweetness of the usually boring cut.  Finally the 28 day dry aged porterhouse.  Well trimmed with a more mild umame finish.  Nutty but not much bleu cheese flavor.

Sides are steakhouse standard but the standout remains the twice baked truffle potato.  Seriously good eats that adds a deem earthy flavor and richness to any steak.  Why more steakhouses don't make twice baked potato is beyond me.

Not calorie counting and wanting to splurge?  Add seared foie or bone marrow to any steak and put it over the top.

Tip:  Do check out their prefix menus which include bottomless pour wine pairings.

Excellent wine list with many smaller, hard to get producers.  Good selection of pinot noir.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.

I also tried the french toast due to the raves about it, and, again, it was totally standard home kitchen fare. Nothing I would go out to get.

Had the Milk Tea Boba and the Strawberry Slush with small tapioca which both were very good.

The Strawberry Slush tapioca was almost too much but were pretty good, will try it next time without the tapioca to see the difference.

I ridiculously love their Thunderhop IPA and it is always my go-to beer if none of the seasonal varieties peak my interest. I'm not a fan of the Celestial Gold but my (new-er) bf, who is not much of a beer drinker and prefers wine or mixed drinks, enjoyed it and said it's ""perfect for non-beer drinkers"". Since I last reviewed any of the menu options, I have sampled a lot, hence the need for an update! 
As far as apps go, the Spinach, feta, and smoked gouda dip is  great for sharing and has that oozy, cheesy ""comfort"" taste to it. This is always a winner in my book, particularly because gouda and feta are my two favorite types of cheeses. The chips are, well, just chips. Maybe warmed pita bread would be a tastier substitution to the chips in the future. The bruschetta is also a solid appetizer to share. The ratio of toppings to bread (which usually annoys me when ordering bruschetta because I constantly feel like I'm left with either a lot of topping and no crostinis or the exact opposite) is perfect!
 In addition to the wild boar BBQ pizza (which will always be my favorite pie at CBW), I've also had the pleasure of enjoying the Artichoke, spinach, and feta pizza and the chicken and sundried tomato pizza. Both were very flavorful and served pipping hot right out of the oven. The ingredients were very fresh and evenly distributed throughout the pie. The sundried tomato pizza I enjoyed actually was ""on the house"" because the bartender (such a quirky guy but well-meaning) clearly forgot to ring in the order (the big clue was when it had been 25 minutes and he asked what we had ordered again). Being the pizzas here are a bit on the pricey end, I greatly appreciated this generosity particularly considering the inconvenience as well. 
I've also had the opportunity to sample some of their sandwiches, and I was pretty impressed with those as well! I've tried the Buffalo burger, the chicken and brie sandwich, and the pulled pork sandwich. The buffalo burger, cooked to a perfect MR, was so flavorful in it's natural juices that I did not use any condiments or have any add ons (like bacon or sauteed mushrooms or onions-perhaps next time since all of a sudden that sounds amazingly delicious!) With the chicken and brie sandwich, I loved how the brie complimented the granny smith apple slices on the sandwich! It was cheesy yet not overly so-very delicious! The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty too-particularly the BBQ sauce which I believe to be the same used on the Wild boar BBQ pizza!
And just a general statement on the atmosphere-pretty freakin' awesome! How many people can say they have drank beer in a decommissioned Catholic Church?! For that fact alone, you should take my word and check out CBW for yourself!",2015-04-02 19:32:38

Thank goodness for our server AJ. He turned our dining experience around. He was attentive to our needs and we never had an empty glass. He was pleasant and not too social. Needless to say he earned a great tip at 50% the bill.

1. Jalapeno Burger:

My boyfriend ordered the Jalapeno burger and he said it was outstanding. His hamburger did fall apart on him and he wasn't happy about having half of his meal falling onto the plate as he tried to take a bite. He did say he would come back to watch a game and have a burger so all wasn't lost.

I ordered the Au Poivre and even though the beef was tasty, there were WAY too many peppercorns throughout the burger.

I'll try another burger next time. This is also a burger you need to eat with a fork because it falls apart. I had to ask the waitress for skewers to stick into our burgers to try to hold their shape. They seriously need to rethink the height thing and go for width because their burgers are messy as heck.

3.Truffle Fries:

Got these for FREE during a Yelp checkin. SOOOOO GOOOOD!! Ordering these again for sure.

4. Hand Cut Fries:

He ordered the normal fries and ate them all. A+ on their French Fry skills.


Overall I would go back. Make sure you ask for the skewers to help hold your burger together or you will be knife and forking it.",2016-11-23 20:54:26

This place is hit or miss. Sometimes you get everything you asked for quickly, and sometimes they take a while and forget something like salad dressing for the Greek salad, and you have to wait longer for the driver to come back. 

On a good day, I got a single dinner delivered in under 30 minutes with no extra fee for 2 substitutions and delivery, totalling roughly $20. This is a great value when it comes to delivery!

On a note-so-good day, I get the same thing but it takes 45 minutes to get here, the garlic bun is with barely any garlic on it, and they forgot to include the dressing for my salads.

The meat, all 3 times I've ordered, seems to be consistently somewhat dry. My expectations are not high for delivery in general so I wasn't expecting out-of-this-world souvlaki so this doesn't really impact my rating. It is still flavourful and the tzatziki makes up for it.

Good value for Greek delivery. Much more impressive when they get everything right though. It's crazy how an impression can go from 5 stars to 3 stars... I gave them 4 to average out my experiences. If only they were consistently awesome, I would love to rate them higher.",2014-07-15 01:59:01

We didn't make reservations which I suggest doing because they were packed! Luckily they were able to fit us in. 

We started with some drinks, Sarah and I went with the Uptown Girl. We both loved it! The boys had beers. Then to share, we went with the Crispy Confit Duck Wings and Fried Cajun Oysters. They were both very tasty, however, when you split with three other people, you only get like one duck wing and a fried oyster or two. I wish there was a little more to go around!

For the entrees I ordered the Southern Fried Picnic Chicken, which the server told me was a hit and a favorite. He was right. It was SO freakin' good. It was hard to give up a bit for people to try. I highly recommend ordering that. The rest of the table order the Seared Wild Salmon and Miso Vegan Ramen. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes but were envious of my order.

    I went on Truecar.com and got a fair quote for a Juke. Within 24 hours Dave called me to see if there was anything he could help me with. He also sent me an e-mail with several Jukes to look at. I called him back and we went over what I was looking for. He called the next day to tell me he had at least three Jukes that fit what I wanted so we set an appointment for that Monday. 
  Monday came and Dave was great! I not only got the exact Juke I was looking for but he made the whole process as painless as possible. My cute red Juke was living in Utah and Dave said he'd drive there that night to get it. He even sent me a txt with a picture of it when he got there. Very cool!  I drove off with my new ride the very next day.

I went with a waffle with almonds, bananas and Nutella on it for about $6.  The taste of it was OK, presented and cooked well, but nothing too special about the batter.  The disadvantage was it took what seemed like forever to get it (maybe just because I was hungry?).  I also got a hot chocolate which was just so-so.

The change in management/ownership was pretty recent--and sudden--but my family was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to check it out.  Bottom line:  no, it's not the same as Gallo and I think they're still working out the kinks, but I'll be back.

We ordered chips and salsa to start.  The chips are thick and crispy and come with four different salsas.  The creamy avocado one was our favorite by far, but the green/tomatillo salsa was nice as well.  The spicy red salsa was OK but a bit too smoky in flavor; I thought it could use some citrus or something else to balance it out.  Pico de gallo was the last of the four and seemed like it had been made up a day before and didn't keep well; it was not much beyond what you'd get at a grocery store -- edible but nothing special.  We still inhaled a ton of chips and finished off most of the salsa, though.  

For main dishes, I ordered three tacos: 1 chicken, 1 shrimp, and 1 grilled vegetable.  I thought all were good, but it would have been nice to get some lime wedges (or some of the red and green sauce bottles that Gallo used to have).  My mom ordered the Ensalada Peruana, and was underwhelmed.  To be fair, the first ingredient listed on the menu is quinoa, but it was too heavy on the quinoa and the vinaigrette wasn't really noticeable, making the dish kind of bland.  (I tried a bite and agreed with her.)  My brother ordered a cheeseburger and fries with horchata to drink and liked it all.

They didn't have a printed drink menu yet and only had about 4 or 5 mixed drinks to offer, but I'm sure that will be developed with time.  I'd also like to see more agua fresca options be offered in the future.",2015-02-17 03:27:44

I would gladly give the soup 5 stars, the green curry is 3 stars, and the pricing is 2 stars.  Composite score is 3 stars.

Major score factors:
1) Pricing - this place costs 33% more than it should be.  The soup was about $10 for a large bowl and it was mostly delicious broth, so I would have been happy at $8.  The pricing completely loses meaning on the green curry, it was $14 and it was probably not much more than the soup, so I would say $9.  On the entree we are overpriced by 50%, and the soup at 25%.  I didn't even get drinks, but I don't include drinks because they are a category onto themselves.  Be warned - the green curry is a very sparing serving size.
2) Serving sizes - the soup has an excellent serving size both in the bowl and in the cup.  The entrees are undersized a bit, usually I can't finish an entree and a cup of soup, but this time I was able to finish a bowl of soup and polish off most of the entree.  If I hadn't gotten soup I would have had to stop at the hot dog stand on the way back to the office.
3) Flavor - the taste of the soup was spot on.  Not too strong, not too weak.  I could have handled slightly stronger soup, but it had such a satisfying coconut flavor the lack of lemon grass notes was just fine by me.  For whatever reason the soup so dominated my flavor receptors that the curry tasted downright bland.
4) Menu options - I am not pleased with the lack of lunch menu and the options on the menu.  There were some Thai dishes I was looking for and didn't find - some Amazing Chicken would have been amazing.",2018-01-10 18:23:40

Madhouse does offer a wide selection of non-dairy milks, great for people with allergies. I usually opt for coconut milk but they also have almond, hemp and of course the ubiquitous soy. These options are great to see and I wish more coffee shops would follow suit.

Prices for some items are a bit steep, something that would be perfectly acceptable if the quality was consistently high and service on point.

Unfortunately the dodgy employee training and high turnover rate here result in drink quality that is hit or miss at best and customer service that is essentially nonexistent. 

My usual drink here for months has been a blended Matcha with coconut milk. When made properly it's excellent. When ordering at Madhouse the barista's do not usually repeat the order back to you to confirm, they simply say ""ok"" and start making your drinks. After getting several Matchas made with regular milk when I ordered coconut milk (and paid the upcharge for it), I started asking the person who made the drink if they used coconut milk before accepting it. After I started asking I found that they used regular milk by mistake more than half the time. If you get the wrong milk the drink has to be remade and it's done in a hurry. Every time that I've had drinks remade here they are not properly blended until smooth, filled with obnoxious chunks of ice.

After getting three drinks in a row on three separate visits made with the wrong milk by mistake and then remade without being properly blended, I decided to go back and raise the issue with management.

My last drink at madhouse was a blended matcha that I was unable to drink because it had large chunks of ice that got stuck in the straw every time I tried to take a drink. I happened to get the drink at the drive through on a Friday morning with some friends on our way out of town for a road trip. After already holding everyone up by getting my drink remade due to the wrong milk being used by mistake, I wasn't about to drive back and have them re-blend it yet again. Instead, I went back with my receipt on the following Monday when I was back in Vegas to see if I could get a replacement. I was told by ""Ricky"" who claimed to be an owner (I have no idea if he really was) that there was nothing they could do. He said that if they replaced drinks with just a receipt that everyone would take advantage of it to get free drinks. Maybe some people would do that, but what about the rest of us? This kind of policy will just alienate their paying customers whenever they encounter a problem and have a legitimate complaint.

With better employee training and a more customer-centric approach to service, this would be a great little coffee shop. As is, Madhouse is probably best avoided, especially if you have dairy allergies. I'll be making my matchas at home now and saving the $11 I was normally paying to Madhouse for them so regularly.

It smells amazing, but what you make with these spices will taste even more amazing, I guarantee it.  They can get a little pricey, but you are paying for good, high-quality ingredients.

Staples are: bottles of the vanilla and almond extracts - if you get the double-strength vanilla, you can cut the called-for amount in half and still have the full flavor.  The Dutch-process cocoa powder makes anything chocolate that much better.  Ceylon cinnamon.  Krakow nights seasoning.  Peppercorn of any kind.  And the soup starters.

I doubt I can add much value to what's already been said.  If you're looking for a particular spice, extract, dried herb, etc, chances are, they have it.  They also have pre-made gift sets, make your own sets, and empty Penzeys-style jars available.",2014-05-08 15:14:57

qZAuf8odJWBkdd3Ow-fm7A,_i3IZYU28R3xgV4hxkmKjw,_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,1,6,5,0,"This was a total disaster. I do monthly dinners for groups of 10-25 of my clients in town from around the country. This month I had the dinner at T-Bones as I using the hotel for my guests. This was due to SEMA being in town and my normal facility was booked. Normally I use the Silverton and Twin Creeks Steak House. I was looking forward to the change of venue as I eat at the Twin Creeks monthly.

This was a beyond disappointing. The facility is very nice and has a nice private room that holds about 20. I had a smaller group of 15 so it was plenty of room. I was running about 30 minutes late and was more than a little surprised when I showed up and that everyone was still without appetizers or even bread baskets. I ordered a drink and greeted guests. I would say 10 more minutes and my drink arrived and then it was about ordering appetizers (45 minutes after people had arrived). I thought that was way too long to make people wait.

Well we ordered dinner and skipped appetizers because people were getting hungry at this point. I like to wrap up about 930-10 and at this rate we would be there till 11. One server and one busser was all that was allocated to our table and I am sure they had other tables outside this area as well because it was slow service. 

One drink later and another 45 minutes the food arrived. Presentation was terrible on the steaks. I should have taken a picture of it as it was actually funny. Two small semi crisped tomatoes on a plate with a New York Steak. They all looked the same. Just lazy looking. Why garnish it at all? A steak would have been presented alone just fine. People were actually laughing which is not a good sign. So I had ordered the blackened halibut. It came with a type of spice on it (wasn't sure what it was). It tasted okay, but was overpowering of the fish to say the least. I didn't mind the spice taste, however the fish was overcooked. It was dry and and seared more that a third through. Clearly indicating it had been left on too long. I chewed my way through it which was uneventful. I had also ordered Broccoli and mushrooms as side dishes. 

Side dishes: This was just ridiculous. Numerous people ordered the broccoli with hollandaise sauce  and literally the serving size was massive. The server should have made the corrections knowing that we had just ordered enough broccoli to serve 20-25 people. So it arrived, steamed. I mean steamed. Nothing else. It came with a sauce which they didn't bring until 10 minutes later after having to ask for it (meaning they forgot it on numerous orders). It was steamed and not even close to worth the $10 as I literally could have made this in 5 minutes at home. I love steamed veggies but this was so plain and massive it seemed wrong.

Overall I saw three of my people with steaks that were done wrong. Medium was well done. I mean done! Torched. Another was medium rare, was a plate full of blood. I cant imagine a $60 steak looking so poorly but it was right there for me to witness over and over again. I sampled my girlfriends New York. Cooked too long, but more importantly a grisly tough steak. I swear a NY from Albertsons was better quality.

I probably wouldn't be so harsh in this review if I was at a place that was priced accordingly . This however was almost worth calling Vegas Metro and filing a theft report. It was low quality ingredients, low quality service, and prepared lazily without expertise. I am not a food snob at all and mostly eat in Chinatown and often look past the lawn furniture decor and such to have exciting and well prepared meals. This was the opposite, as if not to notice the food was terrible the decor and price tried to impress you. I am not impressed even the least. 

Now the BEST PART of this experience was a day later when at least three of us came down with unexplained bowel movement issues. This place was a colon cleanser for at least 3 guests and who knows didn't admit this fact. Either food poisoning or low quality food preparation put my clients and crew riding the porcelain chariot all for the price of $110 per head.

- Quick service (a lot of nail salons have staff that seem in no rush to get started - not here!) and reasonable prices ($33 for a deluxe - sugar scrub, callus removal,  massage - so luxurious)

- Genuinely pleasant staff:  immediate greeting and real smiles from the moment you walk in.  A warm and fuzzy feeling that I never associate with nail salons.

Got a dozen cupcakes, which cost $25 for a dozen, otherwise they're $2.50 each separately. These cupcakes were delicious, and not overpowering in the sweet department. I got a different flavor for each cupcake - vanilla, chocolate, marble, strawberry, peach, reese's, salted caramel, chocolate chip, oreo, pumpkin, red velvet and carrot. As far as I know, these don't have a filling to them, but that's ok, cause I think the places that do a filling and frosting on top are too sweet. I had the pumpkin one myself, which was just yummy, and so moist!  Anyways, all the flavors were perfect. I will definitely be going back to this place again for cupcakes.

But sometimes other people's reviews seem a little too gloried.

I had the Szechuan Chicken lunch special, which came with an egg roll ($8). It was a small portion size compared to most lunch specials. The chicken was chewy like it had been microwaved. The sauce was tasty, but not a hint of any spice in it. It also came with fried rice that was pretty dry and flavorless. The waiter could barely communicate with me.

This is not Szechuan food despite what it says on the door. Needless to say, if you love American food, you'll probably like this 'Chinese' restaurant. I saw tons of Gweilos happily stuffing their faces with General Tso's Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork at neighboring tables.

For one, they have a giant menu which covers breakfast, sandwiches as well as dinner specials. Basically any meal you wanted for the day, it is there.

For breakfast I suggest getting their eggs Benedict. I chose their greek one and was not dissapointed. The serving size was huge and the leftovers were even better. It was even served on this amazing twist of a bagel. Oh my, delicious!

For dinner I suggest the Jewish sliders. They come on challah bread which is made fresh. Sometimes it can be a bit greasy but it is worth every bite.

As for the deli. They have great selections of things you won't find anywhere. I like to stop in for a bagel in the morning. Their bagels are always fresh and the cream cheese is perfect. Not too hard or soft, just right. The also carry different bagels like salt bagels. Crazy, righr?!

Lastly their desserts are amazing! definitely share it or get it to go. I like the chocolate box cake personally. They also have breads and other selections to take home.

Honestly, what can be said that hasn't already been written? The Peppermill has a great atmosphere, decent food, and hefty drinks. I brought an out-of-town friend here who, like me, has an appreciation for the ridiculous and the brightly colored, which this venue has many times over with tons of pink neon lights and 80's music videos playing on repeat. 

We grabbed a seat just above the fire and water sunken living set, and were greeted promptly by a server. We ordered a few drinks and went with classic mozzarella sticks and the Sriracha chicken bites. The food was pretty basic, but I would recommend the Sriracha chicken bites, especially if you're just going to sip and snack. 

Beyond the normal vodka soda and martinis, we opted for the Scorpion Bowl. This juggernaut of alcohol and sugar is best served over ice, but if so inclined, you can add ice cream into the mix for that creamy dreamy diabetes fueled coma. The Scorpion Bowl was ok, but insanely sweet and definitely needs to be shared with a fellow boozehound.

service, very good, waiter was attentive although a bit sheepish and seemed like he was new, but still very nice. 

now on to the part that matters: 

food:

fried tomatoes, not bad, clam dish, horrible, not sure if they were actually fresh tasted a bit too much like 4 day old ocean, where was the lamb sausage they spoke of? couldn't find much in that broth
duck, probably the worst thing ive had in a long time, reminded me of a $7 duck dish youd find in a shitty chinatown restaurant. bland, boiled, no flavor, some rice, yuck. ifi had had a temper id have sent that and the clams back. btu the waiter was nice and it was a date and why scare the chick away.

It fits right into Legacy Village: fancy (and full) bar and dining area, intimate lighting, flat screen TVs over urinals... wat? Happy hour specials and stays open late... wat?

What really matters though is whether the food is legit. After having the goi cuon (fresh spring rolls) appetizer and bun thit nuong cha gio (vermicelli noodle dish with grilled pork and fried egg roll), I'd say that there is room for improvement, but they definitely pass the test. While the grilled pork tasted great, there was just too much of it. This is usually a good thing, but Viet food is all about balance, and the abundance of meat threw it off. Not saying decrease meat portions, but consider more noodles and definitely more veggies. Another easily fixable gripe is that both the meat and the egg roll should be chopped. The pork came in giant slabs and there is no way you can palate it with a pair of chopsticks. The egg roll was delicious but also came whole, which is the first time I've seen that anywhere. The egg roll isn't a side, it's part of the meal. Fix these and you have a bun bowl that stacks up with the best of them.

The food was definitely good but I don't know that it warrants the price tag, even with all the bells and whistles of the place. If all you want is some good Vietnamese food and nothing more, there are better options out there. Here, you're still getting good food but you're also paying for the experience.",2012-05-30 19:31:43

It was this past Saturday night and I actually expected to have to wait after reading the other reviews. My advice to anyone going when they're busy is to watch the list!! My party of 4 waited outside for about 40 minutes. After noticing people being seated that arrived after us we decided to go back inside the crowded little waiting area inside to look at the list. Our name was not crossed off but the 6 lines below my name were. Just then we watched as a table of 4 got up to leave and looked for the hostess to call us over. Instead she looked at a young asian man standing directly in front of me, to come over to the table. I said out loud ""Wait we are next on the list!"" It was futile as I was completely ignored. I then grabbed the list and walked over to the server/hostess that seated them and pointed out to her how we were obviously next to be seated since every name above mine was crossed out. She pulled the ""I'm going to act like I don't speak English card"" and mumbled about a mistake. She pointed to another table where the diners were paying their check and said we can sit there. Ugh! If my family wasn't so hungry after waiting for so long I would've walked out at that point. What bothered me the most is the fact that the hostess never even looked at the list before motioning for the other party to be seated. Would I have waited 2 hours to be seated had I not gone inside to inspect the situation? Now for the food...the regular fried rice was not very flavorful but had a nice meat to rice ratio. It was also on the greasy side which I like. The cod fish eggs over rice was not edible. It looked great but tasted really fishy and not fresh. I tried dousing it with chili oil and then soy sauce but nothing could quash the fishy smell. The kuro Ramen with black garlic oil was fantastic and is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. It was very salty, which I love, and had 3-4 pieces of chasu. The broth was the star of the dish. The pork wasn't bad but a little bland, while the noodles and green onions seemed fresh and tasty. My family ordered gyoza, which they warn you will take 10 minutes to cook. I didn't try any, but the kiddos liked it.

The restaurant has a nice central location for downtown Cleveland, and I was impressed how they remodeled and added their own touches to the old Vivo space.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (the Gene Wilder version) was running on some flat screen TVs, which I thought was a nice touch.

The food is alright, but I wouldn't call it anything special.  For the first lunch, I had the Turkey Berry, which is a turkey sandwich with a nice raspberry mayo.  The second time I had the Mac-and-Cheese Bar with grilled steak and caramelized onions.  The dish was really sub par.  I've had better frozen food mac-and-cheese from Stouffers.  For drinks, I had a flight (I won't say how many were in the flight...) of half-shots of Kahlua served in little, edible, chocolate shot cups.  Those were pretty good and certainly not something you can get many places in Cleveland.  I had the shots accompanied by their Belgian Chocolate Mousse Cake on the recommendation of the bartender.  It was...okay, but I had slightly higher expectations from a place dubbed ""Chocolate Bar.""

Service-wise, lunch was a little uneven.  Perhaps they are still working out the kinks, but my lunch the second time was a disaster.  There was a long wait after our orders, and finally when we piped up, our food was brought right out--as if it were just sitting there the whole time.  Despite that, we asked to see dessert menus after our meal--surprisingly, that was another long wait.  In fact, the wait was long enough that we just decided to forgo dessert altogether.  The chocolate cake from the third time I went also seemed to take a bit too long to finally get to the bar.

The rest of my meal - you got it, all damn good!

3 of my companions had the potato pancake filled with meat & gravy (aka goulash) that Kim B writes about in a previous review. And she's right, I too stared at their dish green with envy (but I don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent). But no worries. I was able to take some home. And even the day after it was damn good!

Our other companion had the ribs and that too was apparently damn good! (I didn't try any though.)

Great, efficient service. Very reasonable prices - I'd say you get too much for what you pay for. Tasty, hearty, delicious Polish food. Cozy ambiance.  We did however get a few initial odd glares from some customers - don't think they've seen 4 Filipinos accompanying 1 Caucasian step foot into the restaurant at the same time before.

Nothing with some texture, much less crunch.  Mush upon mush.  Thank goodness I ordered the osso buco because that was actually really good.  But what was that out of 4 different tapas?

I can handle al dente.. and thats what my cousin tried to tell me... but seriously what I scooped out was hard rice, not cooked properly.  Others told me theirs was ok so I thought I was insane UNTIL others took a scoop of paella from a different area and they too came across the hard uncooked rice.

As the name says, you don't want to drink this if you're driving afterwards.

The layout of this Wet Willie's is actually nicer than the ones in Savannah and Chucktown.  There is a small stage where dj's and bands can set up, complete with a dancefloor, plus a patio in front and one in the back overlooking the amphitheater,  There is also a nice little room in the back with couches, seats, and tvs where you can relax.  

So, if you happen to be at the NC Music Factory for anything, dip into Wet Willie's for a frozen concoction.",2011-07-30 17:37:20

I actually had my stay at the Aria recently and am updating my review based on that.  

With respect to the credit card issue, it took about 3 weeks after cancellation and a post on Yelp to get this rectified.  I still recommend watching your credit card statements because they were definitely a surprise.

The hotel itself is pretty nice.  It's a newer hotel compared to the Bellagio and you can see that during the stay.  The bed is as comfortable as others have noticed and the rooms were clean.

The food selection at the Aria is fantastic.  I am one of those folks who hates dressing up but still likes having nice dinners.  Most restaurants at the Aria allow casual dress but still have excellent quality.  

Happy Hours are plenty.  A number of the restaurants on site have happy hours with discounted food and drink.

Awesome spa.  I bought a pass to use the spa facilities (around $30-$35) I believe.  The spa facilities include use of a private pool, multiple Jacuzzi's (Cold, Warm, and Hot), sauna and eucalyptus steam room, salt room, and Japanese Stone beds.  All of them were awesome.  The amenities are also some of the best I have seen out there.

There were some things that kept me from giving them the full 5 stars.  Most of the reasons are based on my past experiences at the Bellagio.  Both are MGM properties and both are AAA 5 diamond award winners.  Here are some things that the Aria does not do:

1. Turn down service is not done for standard rooms
2. Location.  It is a little more of a challenge to get anywhere outside of City Center from the Aria.  Even with the train, it's still a pain to get anywhere
3. Level of service was kind of dry.  Not sure what it was but I didn't feel as though the staff was willing to do what it takes to make a customer happy.

I'm glad I had a chance to try the Aria out.  I will definitely be back for their awesome restaurant selection in the future and possibly stay there if the price is right.",2014-10-13 19:38:00

After an accident last year, they've changed the last big scene. With the new scene the show feels cheap and unfinished. I wish they would rework it to create another impressive ending.

The lighting was fantastic-- the subtleties were not lost on me as the scenes progressed from comedic to utter sadness, and I could almost FEEL the sunshine coming through the large windows whenever scenes from Lock Willow played out, and the cold winter air surrounding Jerusha's dorm that winter as she wrote to her ""Daddy.""  The ushers were very friendly and eager to help those who needed it, the cookies looked wonderful by the bar, and the women's restroom was tidy.

Now, if we could only get HT to emphasize in many places that it offers $3 parking validation...

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  

I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend ""Daddy Long Legs"" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)",2012-01-05 07:51:55

And, what a treat it was to savor new flavors at Michael Mina.  I had always been a fan of Chef Mina's cooking mastery from earlier forays to Stripsteak at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and Stonehilll Tavern at the St. Regis Monarch Beach Hotel in Dana Point, California.  So, I highly anticipated this initial encounter with one of Bellagio's best restaurants, and thought that I would like what I found here.  Yet, even so, my expectations were exceeded.

In really opulent and elegant surroundings, my party of four began our repast with nice warm baguettes of real sour and salty Sourdough Rolls presented to us in tongs by an assistant server.  There were other such rounds once a roll disappeared from a plate.  In fact, we enjoyed tremendous attentive service throughout the night.  

Wagyu Ravioli Short Ribs were salty but delicate and tasty.  Phyllo-Crusted Sole was simply excellent, with a light, buttery battered mild exterior and a moist interior, accompanied by great Crab-Horseradish Mashed Potatoes.  A lemony Veloute Sauce was very nice just underneath the fillet of fish, although pea shoots on top really added nothing for me.

Michael's Root Beer Float, together with an edible Chocolate black & white straw, was an inventive dessert, made even more sumptuous by the addition of two gooey Chocolate Chip Cookies.

There were other special touches that I applaud.  For instance, a long spoon for Iced Tea was nice, and cloth napkins were gently placed on guests' laps.

Not one to pass up on a free glass of wine, we decided to check it out.  As luck would have it, many other wine lovers were also there.  However, the two bartenders I saw working behind the bar were fast, friendly and efficient in getting customers their glasses of wine or whatever drink they had requested with minimal wait.  I was immediately impressed with 35 Steaks' wine freebie because the bartenders were pouring restaurant standard 6 oz. glasses of a red or white wine, and the red wine being served was an Estancia Meritage, which was a full bodied, very drinkable and enjoyable.  With our glasses of wine in hand, we decided to enjoy it with food, so we went to hostess to see about getting a table for dinner.  Since it was only a little after 6 pm on a Thursday night, there were plenty of available tables and we were seated immediately.  

We split orders of the Shrimp Cocktail ($17), which included four Black Tiger prawns and a Belvedere Citrus cocktail sauce; the Ahi Tuna Tartar ($16) with Asian pear, Korean chili vinaigrette, fried wonton chips, and micro shiso; and a 14 oz. wet aged Choice New York Strip ($43).  As unfair as it is, I hold all shrimp cocktails up against my shrimp cocktail standard of the St. Elmo Steakhouse in Indianapolis.  35 Steaks' rendition was good, but did not meet that gold standard as it was a bit pricier and did not deliver a cocktail sauce with a fraction of the sinus searing horseradish power of St. Elmo's sauce.  The ahi tuni tartar was a very satisfying dish.  The fresh, diced tuna was imbued with a nice spiciness from the vinaigrette, which contrasted with the mild sweetness and crunch from the slivers of Asian pear.  The micro shiso provided subtle earthy notes and color contrast.  It was a satisfying dish.  We normally go for dry aged, Prime steaks especially with strip steaks where the intramuscular marbling really helps to give the cut a little something extra.  However, we decided to try a Choice cut subjected to the wet aging process.  35 Steaks graciously sent out our steak sliced in half on separate plates.  Even though the NY Strip was just a Choice cut, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, quite tender and flavorful.  Honestly, I don't think I would've been able to tell the difference it and a Prime NY Strip!  It was an enjoyable piece of meat.  

Frankly, my expectations coming into 35 Steaks + Martinis were relatively low.  In the interests of full disclosure I had a $40 food credit from the Hard Rock's Backstage Pass loyalty program, which we ended up using here.  That said, bad food and bad service will trump any discount.  35 Steaks + Martinis served up solid, satisfying food.  Given that there were only a handful of other diners in the room, we also received very personable and attentive service throughout out meal.  I'll put it out there, 35 Steaks + Martinis served up one of the biggest culinary surprises we received during our week in Las Vegas.",2013-08-06 03:28:16

Boogies has several options for pesco pollo vegetarians so we have found a place that works for both of us. 

My husband loves their burgers although he finds them messy. I have had their Buffalo Chicken burger and their National Lampoon Hawaiian Vacation burger - both very tasty but messy too. Even being served with a huge steak knife which allows you to cut the beast in half, it still requires eating near a steady supply of napkins! They would earn a fifth star if they used unprocessed chicken breasts for their chicken burgers. 

Boogie's milkshakes are outstanding. I have had the mochaccino both times I have been and it is bliss in a cup. The first time we went we also split a small order of spicy fries, which tasted okay, but it was just too much food. We now forgo sides and just go for a burger and small milkshake.

I am a very loyal Platinum  Elite and value my relationship with Marriott. Two recent stays at the renovated Charlotte Marriott Center City have given me some insights into the goods, greats and just ok's of the property.

First the greats: Club M is a great concept well executed at this property. Eliminating the Concierge Lounge on a discrete upper floor not only yields more profitable room space above but creates an environment that all patrons will be curious about. This club is really comfortable staged well and serves terrific items throughout the day and even weekends when most concierge lounges are closed. 

The resto's  on the main floor are very attractive. I will say that the employees seem to have been hired more for their attractiveness than for their service and social skills. 

The comment regarding resto staff carries over to the front desk staff. Plenty of bright shiny pretty faces none of whom seem to be able to accomplish much. No drive no can do attitude but great keyboarding skills and good looks. I say this after giving them such challenging tasks as retrieving a delivered fed ex package, making change for tips, and setting up the shipment of a package, and my causing them the trouble of having to print me a regular magnetic key when the app key would not open Club M. They acted as if I was the problem. Note to Marriott frequent guests. The app for mobile check in and mobile key is the bomb. I love it. Please make it available at more properties Marriott!

The gym here is amazing if poorly thought out. Great facility they even have a spin studio that is supposed to have on demand spin classes complete with big screen and surround sound. I was thrilled to see this as a cyclist and spin enthusiast. The bad news is when you give the public access to a computer it's going to get messed up. As it did here. The control screen had numerous error messages, capacity messages etc. I finally got s class started and the audio did not work. Make this thing idiot proof and you are on to something!!

The rooms,  Beige.  Just Beige. A most comfortable bed in a well appointed room as well as a great bath. The room is however just screaming for some color. A painting or a poster or some color is really needed here.

It appears you may have been recently renovated - but it looks kind of like maybe it was done in a rush (read: shoddy work), your plumbing is simply horrible - my sink doesn't drain, the bathtub filled to my calves while showering (yes, with the drain OPEN), and the maintenance man had to come unclog the toilet last night - seriously, and when I arrived yesterday evening (around 7pm) you gave me a barely warm stale cookie. :(

I love DoubleTree hotels, but what was up with this visit? You must have sensed that I'm a Cleveland Browns fan.

Some helpful hints: 
1. The hotel parking is around the side of the building (on the left if you're facing the front), it's a garage but it's valet only ($22/night on weeknights and $20/night on weekends, if I'm not mistaken).
2. This hotel is about a six minute walk to Market Square... where you can find some good grub (NOLA, Las Velas, Chipotle, or the classic Primanti Bros. to name a few).
3. If you need something quick, there's a 7/11 attached to the building and a Dunkin Donuts and Qdoba across the street. 
4. The double beds are tiny (& about as soft as a cot), so request a King if you're coming as a couple.
5. They give you a key to plug into the wall that turns on the room's electricity - so they're environmentally friendly (or cost conscious perhaps)!
6. The fitness center is open 24 hours - & includes weight machines, floor mats, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and treadmills.
7. Flat screen TVs in the guest rooms are a nice touch. The $16.99 they wanted me to pay just to watch Bridesmaids, not so much.
8. The staff was super friendly and was more than happy to accommodate my late check out (1:30pm) request.
9. Complimentary Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. 
10. There is a shuttle available that services the Downtown Pittsburgh area on a first-come-first-serve basis.

It must have been my deer-in-the-headlights-what-the-f-did-he-just-say look because he gave out a chuckle and then went into detail step by step showing me different examples of finishes and what not so I could make a more educated decision as to what I wanted. He was very patient and the color came perfect!

My second and third experience here was purchasing Christmas lights with my brother. My brother drove so my insecurity in the parking lot went right out the window due to him having a huge truck. I think guys have a sixth sense for where items are located because he went straight in said ""hi"" to the greeter who was in the process of offering help and found the holiday light section. I wanted icicles so he grabbed them (or what he thought was icicles), along with a timer because I will not remember to unplug them, and an extension cord. We did the self serve check out and left all within 10 minutes of getting there. So we get home and check out our purchase and realized someone didn't grab icicle lights. After I gave him a hard time, we went back to the store. There were two people in front of us in the return line, the first person was just finishing up and the second person was helped. He had a broken tree without a receipt or identification on the bucket the tree was in saying what type it was and were it was from. ""Great, this is going to take forever,"" I was thinking. Well, the lady at the counter paged someone from the garden section to come and identify what it was, but istead of just waiting to finish with that return, she had the customer step aside so she could help me! Awesome! Quick and easy return as I had my receipt (take note broken tree person)!",2011-12-01 17:11:12

I was looking for something local and good and I remember I had bookmarked Rainbow Club & Casino after reading that there was a dinner inside that served really decent food.

Located on Water Street in downtown Henderson it was close to home and easy to find. The casino was small, very local and quaint. The dinner is located towards the back but there is not much walking to do as the place is not very large. The restaurant is called Images. The staff is very friendly. We were seated right away, it was around 8am and the place was packed. By the time we left there was people waiting in line waiting to get in, I don't blame them...it's worth the wait!

I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the menu. Breakfast Casino   specials starting at $1.89!!! There are $5 lunch special with soup or salad and half sandwiches. Dinners specials every day for less than $8  like juicy Prime Rib on Tuesdays and Saturdays and Steak and Shrimp on Wednesdays. This occasion I was craving the NY Steak and Eggs for only $6.25!!! It was delicious, it came with hash browns and my choice of toast or biscuits.

The food was amazing, the prices you couldn't beat, the staff was super quick and friendly and the restaurant was clean and amazingly I didn't get a headache from excessive cigarette smoke. I will definitely be coming back to try out their other specials :)",2014-02-07 21:04:42

We also had a Jones Street Pizza, it was a good pizza. Nothing to wrote home about. The small was enough for my boyfriend and I. We've had the beer cheese before, it was grainy on my tongue, similar to powder cheese I guess... idk. 

They have an excellent beer selection.  Nice outside patio. And bar access from inside and outside.

So onto the food part. I ordered a fire burger (medium) with onion rings. When my burger came out I took a bite and my burger patty started to fall apart... Seriously, I asked for medium not burnt to hell. Another observation I had was the sauce and or the burger was just destroyed with salt! All I could taste was salt... the Onion rings were amazing, so i'm glad its hard to mess those up. Overall I gave this place 3 stars.

A few people have asked me now if I've been here, and it is just so far from my house!  It was totally worth the trip though.  I was impressed.  Benjarong is a gourmet Thai restaurant that is taking American Thai food to the next level.  I ordered the Salmon steak green curry ($15.99) and the Crab papaya salad ($8.99).

The crab papaya salad was pretty good.  It was slightly sweet with no vinegar, but the flavor went well with the crab legs.  The crab legs themselves had to be cracked.  They weren't the best crab legs I have ever had, and there were only three of them, but this was a really nice addition to the dish.  The one downside is that I wouldn't say this was an authentically flavored papaya salad, and Thais might be disappointed in this classic dish.   The portion was huge though, and I couldn't even finish half of it.  

Next up was the salmon green curry.  This had a beautiful presentation, with a light green curry sauce with green peas, spread in a thin layer over the dish.  The portion of salmon was healthy, and the quality was too.  The curry sauce was a bit sweet, but I could tell it was a homemade curry sauce, and was well made.  It reminded me of the style of curry served at Pan Asian, but lighter.  I liked the fact that there wasn't a soup of this curry.  That would have been too sweet.  The curry was used like a light sauce rather than a traditional fully loaded soupy or chunky curry.  It went really well with the salmon in such a refined way.  The salmon, while deliciously prepared, did have a few bones. In Thailand, the bones are eaten, but this could bother some Western patrons.  Take it from me though, the dish was worth the few little bones.  

I was impressed by this Thai restaurant.  It fits in well with the area, and goes for an affordable, but upscale atmosphere and food style.  There are a few dishes on the menu that I don't believe I have tried.  Some of the dishes are definitely a bit Americanized, but they are done well.  I have a feeling that digging deeper into the menu would result in finding some good, authentic dishes.  I wish I lived closer so that I could explore this Thai restaurant a little more.",2011-08-01 03:51:04
