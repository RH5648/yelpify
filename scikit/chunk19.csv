The owner, a French man who used to be a manger at the Eiffel Tower back in the day, created the most beautiful concept of a French cafe. The service is on point every time. The employees are so genuine and they care about their job and it shows. That's really what makes Baguette Cafe such a success for me.
I usually go for their chipotle panini which was recommended to me by the gentleman working and it's dynamite, but everything I have had is delicious! I love the simple side salad, it's always fresh. 
The location is a little hard to find the first few times, but the owner has put up signs that lead you in the right direction.",2015-04-14 21:45:44

The Kickstand - burger with sundried tomatoes, onions, tomato and garlic - Brie cheese and cranberry chutney is my go to when I can't decide. The Mushroom and Swiss is always a classic. Their sides are very good! Especially the onion tanglers... but I would shy away from the sweet tots. 

They have a good selection of local brews and a good atmosphere. The service is good and the ambiance is nice. If you are a football fan, you can watch the games there and it's not super busy.",2016-10-13 02:40:17

The first time I tried the Peach Tea drink, baked goat's cheese, pickled vegetables, and pretzel bread.  The pickled veggies are something you should split with a table, because the pickling is very strong and it's hard to eat that many pickled things.  The pretzel bread is good though not exciting.  The baked goat cheese was also good but the bread that came with it was so hard that I could barely eat it.  My Peach Tea drink tasted great but there was barely any alcohol in it, so I didn't get another one.

On my second visit, I had the Lamb Ragout and a French 75.  The drink was delicious.  Much better than the Peach Tea.  My meal was fairly good.  However, I expected a Ragout to be more saucey.  This dish was mostly dry--just a lot of ingredients tossed together.  The pea shoots were undercooked so it was hard to eat them.  The gnocchi and lamb were cooked well.

I think their menu items are interesting, but not exactly well-executed.  I will come back here again but if I don't find a dish that stands out soon, I will probably give up.

The decor is nice, bathrooms are clean, service pretty good.  It is really friggin cold inside when the AC is on (like most places) so bring a sweater.",2013-07-10 16:24:08

There are some certain specials I will stop by Arby's for and this one is near my house. The food is not bad and the fact that it seems to take long in the drive-thru I am OK with because I am hoping that means it is fresh! 

Uggg-the employees tho: No matter how nice I am, there is NO trace of happiness in their voice. I actually leave feeling bad for them like 'why do they hate their job and/or life so much?"". It's all mono-tone and almost like 'here, take your food and go.."". 
I don't go looking for cheerful employees I guess, I go for the food and I know working in fast food can suck but there are a lot worse places to work in the world.

I went back for round two. She was right. MUUUUUUCHOOOOO better! It was actually sweet this time (she also informed me that she made sure all of her employees know how to make it properly too) They only thing that was a little weird were the whole cumin seeds in the drink....I just couldn't get past that. but, it was EXCELLENT as long as I didn't chew the seeds......

While I was there I ordered the soup of the day.....vegan (of course) potato leek soup......I hate to say it, but it really wasn't good. I didn't know it was a cold soup....had I known, I probably would have ordered something else (I think potatoes with aromatics are just mean to be eaten warm....it's just hard to stomache otherwise) This is the only reason I'm not changing my rating to 5 stars.

The food quality and servings have been very good. Deserts are excellent - at that point you are too full to try the full range especially at the buffet or brunch.

Brunch quality is generally okay although on occasion the beef is a bit tough or dry. Seafood dishes on one occasion was fishy but for the most part good.  There is pasta, mashed potatoes and sauteed root vegetables. Raw salad bar and a small desert selection as well. Pricing is fair given the quality of food.

I came here on a Sunday morning and I was contemplating moving on as I drove by and witnessed a line coming out the door of this place, but that also intrigues me a bit and so I  found it necessary to see what the heck was going on. The smells billowing out the door drew me in as the line was moving quite fast with a very good system of helping people get what they wanted. Before I knew it I was up to the counter and a jumble of words came out of my mouth of everything I wanted to try a baguette, apricot thingy danish, chocolate chip croissant thingy, and omg is that a cream puff. Well they all ended up in a bag for me. I thought to myself what have I done but when the cashier rang me up it only cost me $8.50, I don't know if they screwed something up but that is one heck of a deal.

If you're like me and have a hard time deciding between some of their awesome looking side items here's my verdict: garlic fries take a strong 1st place, onion rings 2nd, and fried zucchini 3rd. I didn't care much for the flavor of their ranch dressing as it tasted pretty bland. 

I'd also recommend going next door to the coffee shop over ordering their iced flavored coffees that were just ok.

First of all, the variety seemed rather limited, which is surprising for a buffet.  I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.  They also had a lamb curry (ok, but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good!), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.

Ambiance: 3. Jukebox: check.  Patio: check.  Great atmosphere: .... well the first two are all that really gets you excited about this place.  Tables are plan, bar is standard, nothing stands out to me after multiple visits.

Cost: 4. Just barely a four.  You can find similar prices in Tremont/Ohio City if you look around, but XYZ has some good drink specials and deals.

Food Quality: 3. After seeing reviews and pictures here it looks like this may be a better breakfast/brunch spot.  But several dinner visits and I'm still underwhelmed.  Some better Chicken and Waffle options in town (think Southside), burger was standard and my chicken sandwich was a bit overdone the first time I visited.  Only highlight was good bruschetta that I can remember.  Sound beer selection.

Service: 3. They're certainly nice which is half the battle, but the help seemed discombobulated most of the time I've been of late considering how small of a place this is.  The good news even Friday night I've been able to sit down usually with no issues around prime time.

This week, my husband and I decided to come see Spotlight, which had been on my list for a while, but after the Oscar win, I couldn't just wait for the dvd.  Since it had been out for a while, I decided to skip the online purchase.  We got there just 10 minutes before the start of the previous and there were plenty of the good seats available.  Really, I don't think there are any bad seats anymore, since they have all reclining big seats.  We ordered some wine and margaritas and an artisanal plate.

Our group of 6 was out tonight to enjoy food, drink, each other's company,
Joey's was chosen due to its NW location and the menu variety. There seems to be something for everyone no matter your diet or how picky you are.
Dinner took quite awhile to come (no appies were ordered), no water was offered and drink orders were very slow to be taken.
When the food did finally arrive, a couple of our friends could not believe their side of veg they specified that they wanted - 3 thin slices of mushroom and one small quarter size medallion of zucchini on each plate for pricey dishes of salmon and steak. They were so not impressed. They quietly mentioned it to our server who shrugged it off stating that was the portion. No resolution offered. It was even more downhill from there and no one really wanted to ask for anything after that. Had our waitress been more attentive tonight and gave a rat's ass about service, she would have had a far better food/dessert/bar bill in which to garner her tip from. Oh well, she just was not into working tonight. A hiked up little black dress can only get you so far in life, my dear.
I had the Panang Red Curry Bowl. The flavor was there, but my food obviously sat at the pass for awhile as it was a step away from being stone cold. I did not have the heart to send it back as our table already had 2 pissed off diners.
Had the experience been better, we would go back again as we go out fairly enough.

Very small place that doesn't fit a lot of people inside the restaurant but even if they have a full house, don't worry, the waiting time isn't too long because food comes fairly quick and people eat and go.

The servers mostly speak Mandarin, but understands Cantonese and English. That isn't an issue at all because you don't really need to communicate with them. (sounds a bit weird)

They give you a menu full of pictures and a sheet of paper that reflects the items on the menu and you just mark the quantity that you would like to order beside that item. The sheet of paper has all the prices listed also, so you don't have to flip back and forth between the menu. If you know what the dish is, you don't even need the menu to help you. They also have pictures with English and Chinese along with prices posted up all along the walls. 

The quantity of food you're paying for are actually worth it, for 12 dumplings it's only around $4.99. We ordered the pork and leek dumplings and it was amazing. The freshly steamed dumplings, dipped in some vinegar, hits all your taste buds in your mouth. As you bite into it, the juices from the meat explodes into your mouth like a flavourful meat soup. Be careful when you try to take them apart from each other in the steam basket because the skin is thin which eliminates the doughy thick texture, thus if it pops, all the juices from inside will leak out!!

We also ordered a spicy lamb hot pot for only $9.99. They actually serve the dish on a gas stove, in a pot that allows you to control the temperature of the dish while you are eating it. If you would like to continuous keep it boiling so the spiciness never leaves or heating it up then letting it cool a bit to eat slowly, all decisions in your hands. The amount of veggies that are in the pot are unbelievable, it seemed they dumped a bunch of veggies in it until it didn't fit, then topped it off with a tons of thinly shaved lamb meat!  For $10, you can't ask for anything more!!

If I'm ever in the area, this place is always a choice on my list except maybe the weekends where the wait is a bit longer than usual. But other than that reasoning, there's no reason why I wouldn't go back again!",2015-08-05 17:23:52

I asked to try the Bolognese sauce thinking it would be as easy as putting some in a bowl, however I later found out they prepared a small portion just for me to taste...  It was very good...

Comparable to my favorite Regency Auto Spa on Maryland Parkway, Craig Road Car Wash is my second favorite car wash.  Being that I don't live near UNLV anymore, I had to find a place that can satisfy my desire for cleanliness and still provide that 5-star rating customer service.  And I found just that with Craig Road Car Wash.

Located at the intersection of Craig Road and Decatur, Craig Road Car Wash's service battles for loyalty from it's patrons with Fabulous Freddy Car Wash on the southwest corner of the intersection.  But with Freddy across the street, CRCW continues to keep busy and keeps their patrons satisfied without cutting any corners off the littlest of details, ie. me!  They tend to be fairly busy during the afternoons, so I suggest hitting them in the late morning to beat that after lunch rush.  When you arrive on the drive-way, there is a windshield repair guy that offers to fix the chips in your windshield.  Personally, I've allowed them to fix my chips and with a short call to my insurance, they've fixed the chips no charge and no problem.  No increase or anything to my insurance.

They offer different levels of service for a decent price and like I said, they do not stiff you on the detailing.  As soon as your car comes out, the employees of CRCW are right on it!  You can lounge on their shaded patio while you wait for you car to be wiped down and detailed or you can chill inside on the computers with free internet or lounge in a massage chair and watch what's on the news.  After you pay for your choice of wash, don't forget to grab yourself a free air freshener (Cherry is favorite!).  Once your car is done after about 20-25 minutes, feel free to drop a tip in the mailbox for the workers!  I like this specific part about CRCW because you know the tips are going to be shared with the other workers.",2011-01-03 06:57:00

Heard about the place in the past and came by for a friend's birthday party.  I felt like I was at a ghetto Waipahu graduation party though, #nostalgia.  

Its a decent sized place and decorated with that Macau look.  There are really cool accent chairs up front and a more lounge area at back.  The bar separates the two and noticed that they added a little arcade game that gauges your punching power.  The bartender has a running tally on the high score.  Anyone that tops the high score is honored with a  shot of their choice.  Pretty cool.

However, the bar is loaded, it lacks on its beer variety and serves up the regular domestic selection.  The wildest thing they have is Lagunitas IPA, but, they did have some Japanese whiskey that I must say was a pleasant surprise.  Got a little tipsy that I failed to get the name of it though.

There was a creepy DJ guy though that spun old school 90's hip-pop and sang along with them.  He had a lame Karaoke shirt that read, karaoke ninja...or something to that effect.  Can you say weirdo??  My buddy Reno was offered an opportunity to spin there with a few of his friends a few weeks later and was more my speed.

Also another downside is that they do not serve any food here.  What they do is order from Pho Kim Long or other nearby diners and bring it in.  It's a bit tacky, but guess its better than nothing.

The inside of DiBella's is much nicer than all the other sub shops. Coffered tin ceilings, Norman Rockwell-esque art and vintage soda shop detailing makes it seem like you're stepping into a time warp and into a much simpler time. 

Besides decor, I think what sets them apart from the others is their bread. A fresh loaf, baked on site that's hearty enough to support toppings, firm enough to not end up floppy and soggy like Subway's bread, yet not too crusty where it would chip a tooth like the competitors toasted variety. 

The method in which customers are attended to is different from other sandwich shops. Instead of getting into a single file line and each customer being waited on one at a time, there are multiple sub makers with individual stations. When I visited this location, I counted 4 or 5 customers being tended to at once. Choose your sub persuasion, choose whether hot or cold, the sauce and your personal sandwich artist will hook you up.

My potato cheese soup was hot with potato slices in it, comfortably bland, and incredibly filling. 

Soda was crisp, bubbly, and not watered down at all.

Cookie was the star of the show - melty chocolate chips and soft center.

My future in-laws were trying to decide on a place to make a reservation for about 20 people for dinner two nights before my fiance's and mine wedding.  They sent us on a mission to try out Old Tortilla Factory and Carlsbad Tavern.  We knew the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern, knew it wasn't what they were looking for, and found Los Sombreros on yelp.  They had good reviews and what looked like a very cozy atmosphere on the patio so we gave it a try.  We tried both restaurants and could not express how much better Los Sombreros was, the atmosphere, the food, the service .... hands down, we wanted them to book the dinner reservation here.  Well that's where my five-star review is a one-star review and I felt the experience trying to book the reservation outweighed the dinner service so they now have a one-star review.  My in-laws called them, spoke to Miriam and requested to reserve the patio for the night in question (mind you, this was about 6 weeks out so we were giving them plenty of time .... they said the more time we could give them, the better it was for them).  Miriam took the reservation but needed a credit card to hold the spot.  My in-laws thought that was weird but gave it to them anyway.  There were a few questions that she couldn't answer so requested their contact information to have her manager Jesus call them back the next day. No one ever called them back so two nights later they called again and reached Umberto.  They explained what had happened and that no one called them back and requested to speak to a manager.

-Nice decor
-Lots of vegetarian options
-Spicy (if you request it)

Went there for the first time with my boss and a group of coworkers from India. We had the lunch buffet and the food was very good. Sadly they didn't have Golab Jamun (the fluffy cheese balls soaked in syrup), neither I saw the free chai most Indian buffets have (I like both because in other Indian buffets I sweeten my (free) chai with Golab Jamun syrup)... Well, Fulla A.'s review says this is food from the Chennai area, maybe chai and Jamun Golab are not from there : (

OK, back to the food, they had interesting and varied options, all of them very tasty, and also had good options for vegetarian dishes (paneer dishes and vegetarian biryani)...

I don't remember the names but I tried almost everything and it was very good. They had like 3 different chicken dishes, 2 soups, salad, and various other items.

And they bring potato dosai to your table.

The hubby and I went there for dinner last night. They only seem to have the buffet for lunch, so we ordered from the regular menu.

We shared Chicken Tikka Masala (it comes with white rice) and garlic naan.
Everything was very good. The chicken tikka was delicious. The sauce was the tastier and creamier we have ever had. I noticed it had like pieces of green herbs... usually the tikka sauce in other places is just orange-like color, this one had dark small pieces.

Service was good as well. Our hostess and server were 2 young girls and they were very polite and stopped by several times.

We will be back even though it is quite a drive.",2012-12-22 19:56:47

The full size pizzas come in a huge variety of toppings.. We tried the goat cheese and artichoke pizzas. I recommend the goat cheese pizza as it had fresh cuts of grape tomatoes.

In my opinion, the shoe selection, as well as the clothing section, is more diverse than some other local Targets.

The fried pickles are served differently than I have had them down here.  They slice them into quarters and use a little more breading.  I think personally they taste better this way.
Finally the burgers.  You get a decent sized patty and they do a great job of cooking it medium rare which i prefer.  I have done the Trek and the morning ride.  The trek is an all around great burger. Though if you think you can handle it I would do the morning ride.  Fried egg, hollandaise, bacon all served on an english muffin the size of your head.

We decided to try it out and it was quite possibly the best meal I have had over a year. I started with the Cauliflower Bisque with Truffle Oil - I am a sucker for anything with truffle oil, but this was hands-down the best soup I have ever had. The texture was perfect and the hint of truffle oil made it absolutely delectable.

I came with two friends, and the waitress recommended that we order 5-6 small plates. The menu is not extensive, but it was still difficult to narrow down the choices. We finally decided on the Spinach Salad, Crispy Pork Belly, the Focaccia Flatbread, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and the Crab Beignet (on special). All were great, but favorite was the Flatbread, which had the perfect (and unexpected) combination of butternut squash, goat cheese, smoked bacon, and arugula. I also very much enjoyed the Crab Beignet, which was like a crab cake, and the Spinach Salad, which was served with a mild blue cheese sauce, pear, and pancetta. 

Since we couldn't decide one dessert, we ordered both the Chocolate Beignets with Salted Caramel Sauce, and the Pumpkin Cheesecake with Cinnamon Whipped Cream. Again, both phenomenal. The cheesecake was huge and the whipped cream was perfectly creamy and sweet with a hint of cinnamon. I do not typically enjoy chocolate pastries, but after trying one bite of a beignet, I couldn't help but finish it off. It was almost like a deep-fried dark chocolate brownie with salted caramel - yum!!

Since we didn't plan on coming here in advance, we couldn't take advantage of their BYOB, but I noticed it is only $5 per table. What a great deal! I'll be back VERY SOON.

I had some of the same plates, but also ordered the shrimp and grits, as well as the pumpkin ravioli which was on special. The shrimp was a bit burnt, and the pasta was undercooked which made the ravioli tough to enjoy.

Consistency - I've only ever had ramen at Ajisen and it's remarkably consistent in terms of flavour even across locations.  The broth flavours are rich and enjoyable.

Steak - Teppanyaki steak is done nicely.  The steaks come out rare on a sizzling hot plate and cook to just the right temperature.   Meat is fatty enough and tender.  I'd say pretty good quality and I would get again and again.

Stamps - Added bonus to get free ramen.

Price - All items on the menu are jacked up now, presumably due to minimum wage increase.  $11.50 for a basic tenderous pork ramen.  I'm pretty sure it used to be $8.50 or something.  At this price point, you might as well pay $2 more to get steak ramens.  Prices are starting to close in on higher end paces like Sansotei.  Cucumbers used to be $1 and now it's $3.50!

But staring, alone, at the dragon on the wall for a good half an hour plus before food arrived sort of tainted my out look.  I was tempted to start wandering around asking my fellow diners what they were eating, how did they like it and ""could I have a sample?"".  For sure, every thing looked really good.

Then I got my food!  This wonderful pile of goodness.  I got stir fry silver noodle with chicken ($9.25) and a Thai ice tea ($2.00).  Not knowing, I was surprised by no sauce, either on the food or with it.  Just the seasoning.  The mound of food I got was huge and served on a family style platter with a covered bowl of steamed rice.  Manners to the side I just used the serving platter as my plate.  I managed to finish it all but it was more than I needed, or should have eaten.  I am thinking maybe a curry dish next time to try something different.

My delay in getting fed was a run of circumstances.  I arrived a few minutes after one to avoid the lunch rush.  When I arrived there were six tables in use and only two of them had food.  The other four still had not ordered yet as evidenced by the menus being read.  That makes me fifth on the list for the one waitress/server/bus person.  And that is the order in which the orders were taken and the food served.  But food seemed to be coming out in fairly rapid fire order.  About 15 minutes after the folks just ahead of me got their entrees the waitress came over and said there had been a mess up in the kitchen and it would be a while yet, Ya Think?  As the restaurant was starting to clear my food arrived and I Hoovered (word from Donald S) it down and got back to work.  I was in there a full hour and eating for 20 minutes or less, hard to accommodate on a work schedule.

The dining room itself is very cozy.  I found it hard to get into my seat as the tables are the style with the four legs at the corners, but I am not as limber as I used to be.  I will go back again just because I like the food.",2009-04-26 19:00:40

So they come out after about 25 minutes. Four bacon wrapped scallops. However, they were covered in a peach BBQ glaze What an awful idea. Scallops are one of those foods that needs a sprinkle of salt and to be served with a half of a lemon. God makes them naturally flavorful. Anything heavy will overwhelm that flavor, which was the case here. So I forced myself to eat these candied scallops. I have no one to blame, but myself, for not reading the menu in detail and ordering seafood at a steakhouse. It simply isn't a smart move. So I'm not going to dock them for having a menu item that seems like a bad idea. The Roasted Corn-Jicama Slaw was unique and tasty. Service was fine.

It comes with cotija cheese, cactus leaves, onion, jalapeno, tomatoes and maybe a few other things.  The best part is the sauce.  It really ties the dish together.

I had the combo; steak, chicken and shrimp.  The steak was a little tough and not to flavorful.  I could have done with out that.  It didn't matter thought the sauce made up for it.  It was a big dish - big enough for 2.

The sauce really was that good.  It is like an enchilada sauce but with more flavors.  I think I tasted a hint of chipotle.  It was a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  It really was just a bunch of stuff in a heavy hot bowl... but the sauce... makes it MOLCAJATES!  That sauce was so good you could have dropped some cat turds in there and it would have been good!!!!!!!!

Mom told me that Dad -- a born and bred South Sider from the years prior to gentrification -- wanted a gift certificate from Bloom Cigar Company being that's he's been a stogie fan since he was a young man, before it became hip. 

When we found the place, a private party was going on. A woman at the door told me there was a $10 cover charge, and aside from the errr...curious presence of a few provocatively-dressed young ladies (strippers? escorts?) lounging in the laps of well-fed middle aged men wedged in couches, there were no women. Feeling that Kay would be uncomfortable in this jook joint, I had her stay outside once I was allowed in by someone after explaining my intended purchase. 

After buying the gift certificate (the 'cashier' found it amusing), I left and smelled like blunt vapors, coughing like Tony Iommi did at the beginning of Black Sabbath's ""Sweet Leaf.""

I didn't believe him because the Henderson/Silverado Ranch area is a barren wasteland in terms of boba/bubble tea. I'm a fan of the Spring Mountain location, so having one closer to home is amazing.

I've been getting the iced mango green tea with mango jelly and the oolong milk tea with boba as of late. The iced mango green tea is refreshing and light especially during these hot summer months when the temperature is well over 110F. The mango doesn't overpower the green tea, so you're still able to taste the tea behind all the mango. A plus is that it isn't premade, you can watch them shake up your green tea!

The oolong milk tea with boba was also great. I usually don't go for oolong milk tea, but it's becoming one of my favorites. Unlike some other boba places, you can actually taste the tea instead of all milk which is great.

Here is problem 1, the tasting is one bite and the cake is obviously thawed out from being frozen. Not moist, rather bland and being only one bite its difficult to tell if you and your soon to be spouse really both enjoy it wtihout another taste.

Owner told us that we should come back again and sit down with a designer to get an exact price quote and what we wanted. So..I called back to make the appointment and the owner wanted ANOTHER $25.00 to come back and sit down with them. I told him, we already tasted the cake, why do we need to pay you another $25??? He said ""our policy"". What a joke and quite frankly poor business ethics.

We had the Scallops, the Chef's Cut Ribeye, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Drinks, and Wild Mushrooms. All was really terrific. 

The service was very strange. The Managers were very kind, and seemed to help us more than our actual server did. Our server checked on our appetizer and our entrees once each, but both times before we had a single bite. We were given our appetizer pretty much when the bread was brought out, but then waited a good 30 minutes before dinner was served.

My wife was really excited about getting the Butter Cake for dessert, but the strangest occurrence of the night was that they never asked us what we wanted for dessert. After 15 minutes of just sitting and waiting, they brought us a piece of chocolate cake, so it was pretty awkward when we had to ask for what we actually wanted for dessert.

Pate is one of my favorite French comfort foods and is done very well here. However, be certain to ask for different bread.. I know I said I wouldnt bitch about the bread but I lied.. it sucks.. horribly dry, bland and uninteresting. I hate to say this but they need to get away from making their own bread and order it from a local bakery. Epi bread would go awesome with their pate!

Everything was tasty, and the mini-ice cream cone-esque tuna appetizer is a really cool outside-the-box type of treat.   Winning!  I will say that the raw oysters had just a tad too much salt, but they were obviously high quality, well sourced and none-the-less good.  I love that this place is green and utilizes sustainable seafood, which is flown in and it's as fresh as you're going to get in AZ. 

 After grabbing some apps, we cozied up to the bar and had a few beverages.  Our bartenders were friendly and attentive.  No complaints!

Loved the layout of the restaurant.  The patio seating areas were nice, and I like that it's only one row of tables per side.  Makes it a little more intimate.  Inside, the bar area was welcoming, the raw bar area with the scooter seats was unique and it's shape gives you the ability to see what's happening and socialize with the other patrons, should you choose to do so.

I already was pretty lukewarm on this joint, it's very mediocre, the crowd is kind of douchey, and the beers are expensive.  But my friends wanted to go on a saturday, so I joined.

I ordered one beer.  One.  ONE.  ""Do you want to keep your tab open?' the bartender asked.  Sure.  Why not.

10 minutes later my friends say ""This place kind of sucks [they're right], let's go!""

Hey bartender, can I close my tab?  ""Sure, let me just find your card.""

It's been 10 minutes.  One beer.  8pm on a Saturday, not 1am and mayhem.  Cant find it. ""We're getting it for you."" they tell me.  They're trying to act like they DIDN'T just lose my debit card.  

Finally 20 minutes later they ask me again for my name and what it looks like.  Can't find it.  Keep looking in the same five spots over and over like it's going to magically re-appear.  Can't find it.  

I'm so pissed at this point...I have no other way to pay for anything on me, when I go out I just bring my license and my card.  I need gas to get home.  I wanted to have a good night.  Nope, they ruined it.

I leave, tell them I'll be back in an hour.  Go to San Tan, where they don't lose cards after 10 minutes.  Go back to Irish Republic later.

""I dont know what to tell you man, it's like it just disappeared!""  I'm livid.  I'm probably being a dick to the guy that tells me that.  I tell him I have no money to get home now, because of their irresponsibility.  ""Yeah we'll keep looking.""  

When I tell him he can probably call off the search because it's incredibly obvious that they didn't LOSE my card, they GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, he shakes his head.  ""No that certainly didn't happen.  It's here man.  Sorry!""

For instance, this is the place where Real World Las Vegas was filmed. Many companies will rent out this place for special meetings or gathering.

The other part of what makes it so special is the backyard. 

You can find a large Chess game, life size Jenga, Life size beer pong, and a small little court yard for smaller beer pong games.

Everyday there usually a different venue going on, live music, trivia, live karaoke, wednesday is roller skating night, sometimes there's a DJ spinnin up the jams...the list goes on.

If you're in downtown Fremont, make this a stop. Pop in and get to meet the bartenders. They're the best mixologists in downtown Fremont. 

Who knows, maybe, I might run into you - let's cheers and chat it up!

The Hostess greeted us and was very friendly, as she seated us in a back corner.
I ordered the Cheese Enchiladas. Portions are very liberal.
The dinner comes with rice and vegetarian beans. The meal was so appealing. It also came out within 7 minutes.The flavoring was just right. The Waitress was so friendly and helpful.
The atmosphere was great. Even though the bar crowd was very alive, the wall between the bar and the dining area was great for acoustics. We could talk without having to raise our voices. In the summer months, they also have a perfect patio outside.College kids and 20-30 something's love to regroup here. But Hudson neighbors also abound. The meal for  2 was 26.00.
There is something for everyone on the menu And the menu has a glossary of terms,
How refreshing!

I've had a greek salad with gyros that was generally flavorful, but just of average quality across the board.  On my second visit, I ordered the portobello mushroom pita with a greek side salad.  The girl behind the counter let me stand there for almost ten minutes while she took a phone order from someone who could not figure out what they wanted and then when she finally did take my order was rude and seemed put out to have to do so, typical of restaurants of this caliber located in the ASU area.   My food arrived on two separate plates which at first seemed puzzling.  After the first bite of my pita, I realized why.  The portobello mushroom was of average quality and had decent flavor as did the pesto that was included, and the wheat pita itself was fresh and of good quality.  What I wasn't expecting, though, was the absolute geyser of liquid that shot out the end of the pita that I bit into and sprayed all over my face.  Similarly, the other end of the pita (the whole thing was wrapped in foil) was gushing liquid as if someone had managed to hide a garden hose somewhere in my pita and had stealthily turned it on as a joke.  By the time I was done eating, I'd gone through an entire stack of napkins and my plate was filled to the point of nearly overflowing with liquid. I could barely manage to carry it to the bus tub where customers are supposed to place their dirty dishes without it dripping onto the floor.  I still can't explain what all that juice was.  I love portobellos and make portobello burgers at home all the time and have never experienced anything remotely like that.  Be forewarned, if you're planning to try that item, I would suggest slipping on your rain poncho first.",2011-06-24 02:28:00

No, but even so, I am confident that Inn Zone on Rainbow is the most spirited Go Blue establishment within a 300 mile radius. The walls are painted yellow and blue; the floor is tiled with a giant M; the bartender plays the appropriate cow bell melodies, and if I had a $1 for every time the regulars shouted ""Fuck Ohio!"" I would be about $100 richer. This is all thanks to an old school, charming bartender named Jaime. He grew up a fan, and when he was hired here, his one requirement: it had to become a Michigan bar. 

Jaime is super friendly. It's a spot where regulars know each other (they're having a chili cook off on November 5th!), and the drinks are cheap. You can get some bar grub for cash only at a little window in the back. There are pool tables, video poker (of course), a CONGO pinball game and Golden Tee Live.

I loved all the food I tried. The perogie appetizer was a great starter to share. The perogies had a slightly crunchy shell, were stuffed generously and garnished in a way that added to the flavor. The order came out with two perogies, even though our server, who had never seen the dish before, said there would be three. 

I had the salmon for my main. The portion was a bit small - it was basically served a la carte. The salmon however was cooked perfectly. It had a slightly crisped exterior and flaked nicely apart. It was simply, but perfectly seasoned and I would certainly order it again! I mopped up every ingredient in my dish. 

The four desserts on offer also sounded good. I tried the bread pudding. While I am not a fanboy of bread pudding, this one had a bit stiffer texture to it which I appreciated. The bacon and bourbon were also appreciated and made for a very light and tasty end to the meal. 

The signature cocktail menu was excellent as well. The Murray Hill looked, smelled and tasted amazing: Tito's, tomato, basil, simple syrup, balsamic salt & pepper and a garnish of basil and pearl mozzarella. The time it took to make the drinks was one of the issues I had with the service experience, but the finished product was stellar! 

Overall the taste of everything I ordered was excellent. The server was friendly, really knowledgeable about the drinks and drinks in general, and was happy to make menu suggestions and general conversation. 

The management however would be wise to figure out what takes the bar so long, to ensure all staff has seen if not tasted every dish, and to better train the runners - the one who interacted with me being just both rude (i.e., mute) and clueless.",2016-07-21 20:43:12

The service was attentive, but awkward (the logo company was still applying the lettering to the doors and windows), so maybe she was nervous and distracted?

What went in my belly:

Bellini ($9) - A darn good one made with real peach puree.

Strada 241 Caesar Salad ($9) -  This certainly isn't your run-of-the-mill Caesar salad. Romaine and radicchio leaves were lightly grilled with the leaves still crispy and juicy. The salad was lightly dressed and had a subtle lemon flavour. My only complaint would have to be the ""croutons"" which came out a little burnt. I also would've preferred them bite-size as I had to eat them with my hands like a cracker.

Zia Rita Pizza - tomato, nduja sausage, fire roasted onions, rapini, parmigiano ($15): I really enjoyed their tomato sauce and their nduja sausage was a stand-out for me. The spiciness of the sausage was balanced out by the slight bitterness of the rapini. As for their crust, while it was chewier than I would've preferred, it was not bad. Overall, a pretty solid pizza!

The food was ok, nothing mind blowing and I was disappointed that there were no decent pastas on the menu. I do like that the menu supposedly changes daily but they are recycled so we got other people's oil drippings on the paper menus from the day""s lunch crowd.
2 of us got the halibut. Very pretty plate, a healthy option with all the steamed veg but the fish was very dry. I do recommend the scallops as an appy. Pricey for 3 on the plate but cooked to perfection. You have to ask for the pepper mill and you will wait for it. The tiramisu - do not bother. It was served in a wine glass and it did not justify the price. My husband said it just tasted like leftover cake with whipped cream on it.
The food also took forever to get to us, all courses. Had we ordered coffee I am sure we would be sitting there until Monday! Our food was cold too so who knows how long it sat at the pass. The restaurant itself is very nice inside, it was dim and moody, like our server.

Homemade Lemonade ($2.65) can be a tad too sweet, but you can always order it half sweetened.... BTW, I love freshly squeezed lemonade too! 
 
I love the small business homey vibe! This place makes me feel like I am in a food stand at a fishing village eating the catch of the day! PS it is a sin to deep fried fresh fish!!

When I first moved here, I used Safelite, as, well, everyone seemed to.  MISTAKE.  New windshield had to be redone, as it was uneven, and leaked.  Seriously?

Scottsdale Auto Glass was referred to me by an auto detailer in the Airpark who does high end cars.  And thank God they were.

Over the years, I have called them three times for new windshield glass.  The owner personally handles all calls, will phone your insurance company for you, will talk through the job with the insurance company, and facilitates all claims directly.  Ridiculously easy and seamless.  I've never seen a bill, nor had to deal with the paperwork.  I LOVE that!!  Also, they have replaced glass same day in all of my cases (though I think the worst case would be a day wait to secure the glass).

To the work...they offer mobile service, will give you a two-hour service window, a heads-up courtesy call before arrival, and will do the install in your garage or driveway.  The techs are fantastic - super experienced in all vehicles, but definitely excel in luxury cars.  If you drive a high-end car, then you know what a whining baby you are (admit it!!) about your car, and how you expect work to be meticulous and clean.  This is what you will get with Scottsdale Auto Glass.

I would never use another auto glass vendor for my car (self-admitted whining baby here), and give them the highest recommendation possible.

Screw Safelite.  If you love your car, value quality work, call SAG.  :)",2014-07-07 23:14:08

We went with the tacos and ceviche. Both were almost decent. Almost. Decent. Apart from the god awful pricing, the food isn't bad. The tortilla for the tacos is good. Fresh. House made for sho. There are more meats available than just ground beef and chicken, but way short of what's authentic. No cow tongue, skin, or brain. But all they throw on these $3.00 tacos is a portion of cilantro that is just ungenerous as the meat. No cheese, lettuce, good lord, dare I suggest avocado. Nadda else. 

Then more Canadian-ness kicks in. 

Chips and salsa? Oh, there's a charge for that because they ""home make the chips, you see"". The server said that with great pride. Apparently all the other places in the world that give free chips and salsa only use tostitos and old dutch salsa. He pretty much said it that way. You see it in his eyes, such conviction: the other guys? Inauthentic. This place? Super authentic. We're so authentic, we'll ding you for it. Just 'cause..you know?

Then the Ceviche came with a dozen of the chips. There was no way we could eat them with the 12 chips they rationed. Seriously, I got more generous portions in Havana. So we asked for more. They brought them out... at the tail end of our dinner. Whatever, at least they didn't ""forget"". Oh, but when we got our bill we learned that those over-rationed chips were $3.50. Fuck off. I fucking lost it on the server, and he wouldn't relent on this bull shit charge. Out comes the proud manager. I went all Chicagoian on his ass and said I should charge for ketchup and salt at my burger joint if the urine sized cup for ketchup isn't enough for the fries.

We had the usual Chinese banquet: 1) Roast pig, the slices were quite thin with equal proportion of skin to fat to meat. I don't know if that's your thing. 2) Stir fried geoduck and shrimp and celery, which I thought was pretty good not too oily. 3) Shark fin soup, I am not a huge fan but this was way too watered down. 4) Broccoli with abalone, abalone was small but was done well with good texture and flavour. 5) Vegetables with King oyster mushrooms, again not too oily or salty, good taste. 6) Soya sauce stir fried lobster, there was a good portion and flavour, and not overcooked, which is pretty important. 7) Rice and efu noodles were decent. 8) Dessert was red bean soup, cookies and what resembles a mango mochi filled with cream. I thought the mango mochi was creamy and light tasting but definitely fatty! 

Overall I was satisfied with the food, not too oily or salty and nothing was overcooked. The venue was okay, the decor seems really grand and extravagant and maybe clashy,  but for a Chinese restaurant it's not so bad. The washrooms are in the basement but seems newly decorated. As I said before the few rooms seem to be quite segregated so you won't get a big hall that can fit too many people. They also had nice linen and charger plates, nicer than what I thought would be here. The service was pretty good, they catered to everyone even other vendors. The manager checked on us all the time, but we were the only one there, it was a Wed but really?

4) Drinks/Dessert/Coffee
Nothing too memorable; Dessert was a little to sweet for us; nice Decaf Latte
Score:  3.5/5

Service Score:  95
- we really enjoyed our chef table experience, we can feel the heat to their stove, that'll how close we were to the food and chef cooking in the kitchen
- chef in the kitchen occasionally will talk to us our answer our questions on his cooking style and ingredients
- we also see them in action when the place was packing up, great team work in such little amount of space
- our food did come a little slower, but we were pre-occupied with all the action in front of us
- we even saw Chef Harding in action, he was greeting guest and plating most of the time, he came by often to ask how our food was, we can tell he took pride in his menu and saw him a little upset when certain clients wanted to change his menu

Atmosphere Score:  90
- It is rustic, the floor do need some work, but it will be a nice place for date night or a group of friends to hang out...or sit at the chef table for some action

I Bought a Nissan Juke less then 8months ago w/ all the extended warranties just to feel covered and secured. I got my first oil change after about 3 months but at that time they tried to up sale me stating ""You need brake fluid and it isn't covered in the extended maintenance/warranty package you bought"" which is funny because while I was going thru the finance department the manager told me specifically ""you really want this package because it covers EVERYTHING, ALL YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS CLEANING YOUR CAT FOR THE NEXT 3 YEARS"".  (LIES LIES LIES) Anyways, I woke up today with my car not starting so I got it towed here and now they are telling me that I can't get a rental car until they diagnose the problem but it might take up to 4 hrs for someone to check out my car... WTF?!? I just bought a car less than 8 months ago and you can't give me a courtesy car for a couple hrs just until I get off work?!? This place is a joke! 

Another Update: I took my JUKE in to the dealership because my driver side door wouldn't unlock, The flimsy/brittle middle console snapped off and the knob that controls which way the air flows cracked. (I know this car is falling apart) Anyways, when I took it to the service department the service writer tells me that all of these components will be covered with the ""EXTENDED BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY"" that I paid an arm and a leg for. Now I just got a call from the service writer saying that NOTHING Is covered with the ""WARRANTY"". He said ""We unlocked your door multiple times, every time your car unlocked so we can't fix that and all the other problems with your car isn't covered""  So basically it goes to show AGAIN that the finance manager blatantly lied about ""EVERYTHING BEING COVERED"" with this extra $4,000 warranty that I bought!",2018-03-31 16:02:30

We came to Morcilla after church on Sunday and arrived right as it opened, so it wasn't crowded at all.  We decided to eat at the bar because it looks welcoming and you get to watch the charcuterie preparations and cocktails.  Plus we like to talk to the bartender about his or her drink recommendations.

The Ambiance:  I am a sucker for a well thought out restaurant and bar, and this place was well thought out to me.  You can visibly see their pieces of meat aging right before your eyes, but it isn't creepy or anything.  I really like their material selection from the tiles or hardwood on the floors to the wood/tile selection on the walls.  I could imagine myself in a restaurant in Europe.  It is legit.

The drinks:  They have a nice drink selection.  I'm personally a HUGE gin fan, so when I heard they made their own tonic water I nearly jumped out of my seat to hug the bartender.  I appreciate fine taste!!!  I had the citadelle and it was floral goodness.  I also tried the botanist and it is my new favorite!!! Sweet and floral. My husband had a red sangria and it was probably the most potent sangria I've tasted.  It was REALLY good.  Apparently they have a red, white and rosé sangria option.  The bartender recommended the red and rosé.

rGLANi5hzDM0rRoPOzVDTw,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,ncsg2Dj8q8oqQPkGAMTM8Q,5,5,3,6,"If I learned anything from reading Donald Trump's self-help books, it is to surround yourself with beauty. One day a week, I strive to surround myself with beauty. This philosophy brought me to Red Rock Canyon's La Madre Springs this past Saturday.

 This is what the Red Rock Canyon Keystone Visitor Guide says about La Madre Trail, ""The trail starts at the Willow Springs Picnic Area. The first segment involves walking up part of the 4x4 Rocky Gap Road. These springs are a good place to watch for wildlife including desert bighorn sheep."" It also says that it is a 3.3 mile hike that takes around 2 hours. 

  Now this is what I have to say. Generally speaking, the La Madre Trail is two separate segments. There is a concurrency with the Rocky Gap Road (travels northwest) and the La Madre Springs Trail proper  (travels north). From the 13-Mile Scenic Drive (mile marker 7) to the Willow Springs Picnic Area parking lot, the road is pavement. Hikers share the road with motor vehicles. This is the only part of the hike with toilet facilities. Past the Willow Springs Picnic Area parking lot, the road develops into a rocky dirt road. Hikers share the road with off road vehicles. The Rocky Gap Road segment of the hike travels through a valley of awe-inspiring mountains. Throughout the majority of the hike, the mountain to the right has a presence. Past the valley, the trail leaves the Rocky Gap Road to travel up a gradual change in elevation. Very gradually, the trail travels away from the mountain to the right at a 45-degree angle. As the trail gradually climbs elevation on a rocky and sandy surface, greenery supplants the desert.  To the left in the distance the Spring Mountains tower over the forest. This is Red Rock Canyon's back yard. In a sense La Madre Springs Trail travels through a wide valley between Red Rock Canyon and the Spring Mountains. The uphill climb is so gradual that the trail's rocky surface is relatively safe. Ironically, it is the few steps in elevation from the trail to La Madre Springs that has been a slip hazard. When La Madre Trail travels further from the mountain to the right, and what looks like a bluff straight ahead, La Madre Springs will be approaching on the right. On the way there will be a junction for the White Rock Loop. Pass over turning right, and stay straight.

   La Madre Springs is small in size and large in charm. It is a place to relax with nature. It is a serene soundtrack of running water and singing birds. 

 The walk back to the parking lot is downhill. The mountain that was to the right, now looks prettier on the left. The downhill turns and straightaways award the hiker with incredible vistas of the mountain. I highly recommend timing the walk back at sundown when the sun illuminates the mountains. This is a nature scene that is as good as it gets.

  This was my forth time doing this hike. Every time I hiked it I never had the problem finding a parking spot, which is contrary to the trail heads prior to mile marker 7.

  Hiking is about experiencing the unexpected. This weekend it was an unexpected experience to hike in a  winter wonderland in the desert. It was a winter wonderland with the snow covered Spring Mountains towering over a snow covered forest and cacti (I included pictures). The awesome thing about the La Madre Springs Trail is that the scenery is never exactly the same.

  When I surround myself with beauty on the La Madre Springs Trail, I leave my cell phone reception behind. From my experience, the reception has been nonexistent to the point that check-ins are useless. Nature is the Duke of the La Madre Springs Trail. So please respect it, and have a safe and happy hike.",2012-12-20 04:55:38

The restaurant was pretty full, we were greeted quickly and walked to our table. However, we sat there for a good while before anyone gave us menus. Then we got the menus however the server did not go over any specials and kind of seemed like he was in a hurry to get away from the table (which happened all night). 

When he came back we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks took forever to come and actually arrived after the appetizers. I had a sangria that was decent, but a little watered down. We had the bruschetta and arancini for appetizers which were mediocre. The risotto balls lacked flavour. The spaghetti carbonara was a good pasta and very filling and flavourful. My date had the tagliatelle with braised rabbit and it was very tasty as well. On to dessert which was the chocolate almond cake with gelato on top. It sounded better than it tasted and left much to be desired.

I tried Holler & Dash after reading about its opening in one of CharlotteFive's email blasts. Right as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee who offered us menus and walked us through popular favorites. I ordered two of MY favorites: gravy biscuit and tater tots. The gravy was better than I could have ever expected it to be.. so good I had it again the same week, but that time with the cheese grits; which were everything I expected cheese grits to be, but better because they were seasoned so perfectly. I also tried to take my mom this past Sunday but the line was out the door for more than 10 minutes and we were on a time crunch for the day.

[The Gravy]: Think Cracker Barrel, but seasoned better. ($4.5)
[The Biscuit]: Dense but still fluffy inside (how?!) and nice butter milk flavor.
[The Tots]: Just your average tot, but the dipping sauce takes it to another level. ($2.5)
[The Grits]: Seasoned. Cheesy. Thick. Heavenly. Great portion for to-go. ($2.5)

The Agua Fresca!!! How could I forget?!? 
So, So good. I thought I loved OJ with breakfast, but I was wrong; it's Agua Fresca I love! It's a not-too-sweet, not-too-watery strawberry drink with the perfect amount of slushed ice we all love so much. Wishing refills were endless on this one. ($2.5)

Based on the rave reviews here I made an appointment with Chura. The salon is cute and extremely tiny, but with a good enough layout that you don't feel cramped. I first had a consultation with my stylist, Kazuma, who tried his best to understand what I wanted from a haircut. I'd probably do better if I knew how to speak Japanese, as it was a little hard to communicate. This is not new to me, however, as I've been going to hard-core East Asian salons since my 'tweens' (I can't believe I used that term). 

There are two stylists and 1 or 2 assistants who do things like, wash hair, assist in blow drying and ring you up at the cash. They were super gentle with the wash, but I wish they wouldn't rub my wet hair with a towel as it's pretty damaging.

Kazuma was super skilled and worked the scissors as a pro with tremendous attention to detail. As a girl with thick hair, I was thrilled with the results since he also thinned out my hair really well. If I ever want a blowout, I'm definitely coming back since he can blow dry like it's nobody's business.

Anywho, what I love about Sprouts is that the prices are cheap and their specials especially double Wednesdays. DoubleTuesdays/ Wednesdays (not sure)!?! It works like this the specials from the week before run from wed. to wed. and the new specials take over the same wed. ending... so let's say the special running was 4 apples/$1 and the following new week it was 5 apples/$1 so on that wed. from the week it was 25 cents an apple and the new week it's 20 cents so with the savings combined you get a very good deal. How's that for customer appreciation... LOVE IT!

I settled on getting the Firehouse Hero sub - Premium roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone. It was a good sandwich and I got it with the combo (chips and a drink). The soda machine is pretty cool as well with your opportunity to customize your soda as you want.

Even worse is that he walks around the dance floor and lets overly drunk girls yell into the microphone to get onto the air.

The dance floor is spacious, which is a great plus.  You don't have to awkwardly struggle to move away from that creepy couple that's practically having sex on the dance floor.  You have some semblance of personal space.

The music itself is hit or miss.  Sometimes they play 5 really great songs in a row, and then you stand around for 20 minutes while they play music that can't be danced to.  Perfect opportunity for a drink refill, though.

The service: Don't know if they were short-staffed or what, but the staff was not at all friendly, and almost had the attitude of doing us a favor by giving us their opinion on the 1-2 dishes we asked about.

The food: I don't think I have ever eaten heavier or greasier Italian food than this. My partner and I both ordered pasta dishes, and I now wish we had ordered pizza instead. His dish (linguine with chicken, spinach and tomato sauce) was tasty, but quite greasy. My dish (linguine with shrimps and tomato cream sauce) took greasy to a whole new level. After a few bites I started feeling uncomfortable and belching. Then I noticed grease floating all around my  linguine, and drained 9-10 tablespoons. Since I was full with only a few bites, most of the dish went untouched. Taste was decent.

The wine was good on flavor and price (White Zinfandel since we wanted something light).

Total bill for 1/2 liter wine and 2 pasta dishes - $51

My first time at Stripsteak and it was excellent!  I usually don't order steak out as it is almost always overcooked for me.  Based on the good reviews on Yelp, Stripsteak became an addition to my Restaurant Week list of places to go.

Amuse bouche:  Three containers of seasoned fries - garlic herb, truffle, and bay-seasoned.  There were three containers for dipping the fries one mustard and bay seasoned, truffle aioli, and ketchup.  Pace yourself here.  All tables are served the amuse bouche in lieu of a bread basket.  Since I was alone, I could have totally pigged out on these tasty fries.  5/5

Course 1:  Duck spring rolls.  Duck confit with sweet and sour cherry drizzle.  The duck was excellent and what a great appetizer.  5/5

Course 2:  OK, so I decided to get a steak.  It was the Kansas City strip steak with small sides of creamed corn and mushrooms.  The steak had a grilled small red onion and a yellow tinkerbell pepper.  The pepper is very mild.  The steak was grilled exactly as I ordered - black and blue. 5/5

Course 3:  Beignets and vanilla creme brulee.  Perfect ending to the meal.  I forced myself - yeah right - to finish the beignets.  5/5

As mentioned in other reviews, when you get ready to leave, you're given a small bag of candy popcorn with the Stripsteak logo to take as a gift.  It will be a TV snack some night.

My server, Alexis, was always available and attentive.  When the two eating next to me left for a bathroom trip, she refolded their napkins while they were gone.  I noticed this attention to detail and good service throughout the night.  

I was quite pleased to see the number of families with young, well behaved children.  There was a concert with someone named Selena Gomez at the Mandalay Events Center and thus the large number of children. Alexis had to explain to me who this Selena was.

It was great to be intimate with my favorite musicians.  Those venues are long gone and I've seen many shows since then at large venues or small venues that just didn't have it right... Those small venues being bars or clubs that moved some tables or have a stage but a terrible sound system.  The Crescent Ballroom is everything I want from a small music venue.
There is sufficient patio seating for the smokers to have their breaks.  There is also a large main bar area with seating for those dining.  This area is awesome and always open to everyone who just want to hang out downtown where delicious vodka and tasty nachos are served.  
You can then enter the large space where the concerts are held.  There is plenty of standing room and plenty of stair seating (think high school gym bleachers).  There is a large bar in that area so you don't have to leave the music to get a drink.  I recommend finding a spot in the standing area in the middle.  Find those speakers and stand below them.

I can say, without even thinking, that so much of my houseware items, such as throw pillows, decorative mirrors and pictures, candles, towels, area rugs, and kitchen accessories, to name a few, have come from here.  Their pricing is typically unbeatable, and they do offer many different things, including some interesting food items.  I admit I have a mustard problem.  Best condiment ever.  One thing I have found is that Big Lots carries some of the most unique mustards.  I have purchased Russian, Polish, German, Beer Cheese, Bratwurst, jalapeno, just to name a few.  Some may be afraid to try their select grocery offerings, but I have never had a problem with out of date items or items that were bad.  Nope just really unique finds at great prices.  They also have some of the best ethnic food choices outside of specialty stores.  

Another great thing about the Lots is the Buzz club awards.  You can sign up in the store, get a card and they will email you offers such as 20% off or $5.00 off your purchase of $20.00.  When I get these gems in my inbox I quickly schedule a time to make a visit.  They also offer a decent selection of furniture, outdoor and automobile items, seasonal items, pet care and food, health and beauty items, and toys for the kiddies.

I assume there is a mix of locals & bargain-hunting tourists here; it's not a real pretty/affluent crowd, but it's not terrible either; there's a surprising amount of decent dining options; and then there's the semi-secret super-high-end Michael's if you're up for a major splurge on dinner; pretty impressive convention/ballroom area; also a pretty big cinema, and a large bowling alley on the 2nd level; suprised to find the pool still open and crowded on a Friday night, though it's mostly families/rugrats; best craft beer bet = slim pickings; every bar has the same draft beers (which includes Goose Island & Gordon Biersch); I say go to the hotel store, buy a 6-pack of a decent beer like Moose Drool for less than $8 (same price as you would get at Total Wine) and find a way to keep it cold!",2014-08-09 06:13:59

It's kind of like tacos costing $8 per taco - they just dont cost that much to make so it seems hard to justify high prices.

I am sure they will accommodate with all of the margaritas that they have!

Which leads me to my next point - the service. Our waiter was very on top of the work for a busy Saturday night. Additionally, management came over to the table multiple times to make sure everything was taken care of. 

My friend and I ordered and split the al pastor chicken and the barbacoa (spelling ???) tacos (3 tacos per order) and a side of guac (because who can go to a Mexican restaurant and not order some guac!!).

I personally liked the barbacoa tacos the best ! The rice and beans that come with it were so so and the guac had tomatoes and to much lemon lime taste which wasn't my thing and is the reason for the 4 stars. 

Atmosphere was busy for a Saturday night but not to crowded. This may not be the place to go if you have children or people who are sensitive to loud sounds because of the loud music the band plays. The music did not bother me - I thought the band added to the ambiance but I could see how it may bother some people so that is just a heads up.

Time will tell.

The class is on the 3rd floor and signing in was very easy. Staff were very smiley and friendly and we were asked to sign our waivers. I didn't access the ladies change rooms, so I went into the hot room first. We were advised that the area by the windows would be the coolest. My bf and I ended up being in the middle row.

The instructor was great and no complaints there. The only thing I was slightly grossed out was on my way out of the class, I saw this big puddle of water on the floor...(blech!) On that note, I did see someone sweep the floor after my class which means before each class begins, there is someone that wipes the sweat away.

My bf and I had a great time, and this class was great. However, because I don't live or work in this area, I probably won't be coming back here again.

One, the people who work here are really nice; I hadn't visited this shop in months and they still gave me a big hello when they saw my face again recently. Two, I can appreciate a nice set-up when I see one, too, and the entire shop is just filled to the brim with shelves and shelves of jars and more jars, each filled with another kind of coffee bean - needless to say, coffee lovers, give yourself time to browse!

I was delighted when we finally got a chance, thanks to Yelp Seats, to see the full show with a group.

Some of the other similar shows on the strip use flashy props and sleek music and dancers.  Mac King mostly relies on his wits and some pretty bare props such as little tents and ponchos, string, cards, and not much else.  Oh fig newtons and tiny boxes of breakfast cereal are also prominent in his show.  As I said above, Mac King is a huge dork after my own heart.

The food, which is local and fresh, is VERY hearty and probably not for someone trying to keep his/her hourglass figure. With selections like Roasted Pig's Head, Beef Shin, and Chicken Fried Lamb Steak, you can see what I mean.

We started with the Animal Style Frites, which were unfreakinbelievable. The frites were cooked in duck fat (!) and smothered with brown gravy, amazing mustard, two fried eggs, bacon and mozzarella cheese curd. As a long-time lover of Yours Truly's Notso Fries, I can safely say I have found their more sophisticated equivalent at Greenhouse.

For the main event, I had the Chicken Fried Lamb Steak, which was really tasty and served with a strongly vinegar'ed cabbage slaw and creamy mashed potatoes. My sister had a lamb burger, which was good as well, although it would have been nice if it came with something more than garlic and cheese on it. My mom had the pumpkin and duck pasta which, while I thought it was fine, she wasn't a big fan of. I think we all assumed it'd have larger chunks of duck in it and a heavier pumpkin flavor.

Dessert was good, but not great. We had the vegan Butterscotch Pudding. It definitely had a unique flavor, but didn't blow us away. Next time, as strange as it sounded on the menu, I'll try the Buttered Popcorn Pot de Creme.

We had THE BEST server... very cool, conversational, fun and handsome.  We really enjoyed our time with him.  

We each ordered a chicken and a beef taco.  The flavor of the tacos was good and it was great to see a place claiming to serve Mexican food ACTUALLY USE MEXICAN CHEESE!   But $13 for two tacos was a little steep, regardless of how good they are.

Overall, my experience seems to be better than some on here...but YES it is a tourist trap.

We arrived after 130am. We did inform the hotel prior that we will be checking in after midnight.
The check in was fast however they did not have our booked room available (king) and the lady unfortunately did not seem the happiest on earth either. 

The room had a horrible view of the parking lot but toward the new strip. The room itself was quite big!
New furniture, new carpet, a tiny new flat screen TV. 
The bathroom.. I know a lot complain about the bathroom size. I figure those people must live in a spacious mansion or something because our apartment bathroom has the same size...

There was NOTHING wrong with the bathroom size. Either the persons complaining are 300lbs whales or 7 feet tall. We (6' and 6'4) didn't have any issues with the bathroom.

Everything was good except the A/C sorry.. the heater works btw you just need to set the machine to RED button for HEAT :)

Beds are comfy, but the pillows... are like nothing, so thin! even with two, it was like sleeping with none :(

The casino itself is old and it is smelly. It makes your hair stink very bad. But all downtown casinos have this lingering old cigarette smell. We obtained the rewards card and got some nice perks.

This is a unsuspecting place, lots of room inside and most of it empty, but don't let it fool you, there was a constant stream of people picking up and a few dine in's here and there.

Looked over the vast menu, we decided on the Chicken Chow Mein, Jerk leg of Chicken, Chilli Fish and Curry Beef. Food came as it was prepared.  Dinner size portions were spot on, food was made fresh to order and flavors were very good! 

Noodles were slightly soft and not spicey, but, went well with the heat of the jerk chicken which was juicy and tender. The Chilli Fish was tasty, crispy coating outside, soft and tender inside, the sauce was on the salty side. The curry beef was one of those black sheep dishes that did not go with the Jerk spices which  overpowered the curry. However, we had it on a separate night, it was very good with a nice level of heat and tender beef. 

Tommy is a great place to have a variety of Chinese, Caribbean and Schezwan dishes all at one place. Weather you decide to dine on or take out, The flavors are pleasant and food is very good. Another great place to try in the Vaughan area.",2018-07-31 05:24:34

This darling cafe in the middle of a nondescript car park is whipping up some of the best bistro fare I've had in Vegas. Under the charmingly watchful eye of Chef Olivier, breakfast lunch and Illy coffee creations are being served up to a bustling in-the-know crowd. 

Chef Olivier is a vegetarian, so anything can be modified for your dietary choices. Soups, salads, fresh bread and tempting pastry await you. Met Vanessa N. for lunch at 11:30 and the line was nearly out the door already. 

Since Vanessa is a regular, she suggested the Three Cheese Panini. When Chef overheard us discussing this being my first visit and I'm a non-carnivore, he suggested modifying one of the daily specials. To my utter delight it was Apple with walnuts, Brie, Gorgonzola and sautéed mushrooms on fresh baked bread. Was able to taste both sandwiches and brought 1/2 the special home for a light dinner. 

We split a 70% Cacao chocolate tart with creme Anglaise which was absolutely heavenly and worth every calorie. Beautifully presented on two plates with whipped cream and cocoa dust, though I don't normally care for chocolate, the Cacao dark taste won me over. Next time I'm going to try a fruit tart, as they are my favorite and clearly prepared by expert pastry chefs. 

There were many people in and out while we dined al fresco, moving inside for dessert. The Iced Green Tea du Jour with Pomegranate was refreshing and fresh brewed. Fresh is a theme throughout your dining experience. 

We implored Olivier to yield to Yelpy pressure to open on weekends. He explained (in his fabulous French accent :::swoons:::) that he did not want quality to suffer. Clearly he cares about the food he's serving and every bite is a testimony to that. 

In a final note: he rescues cats! Does that make him a better Chef? Nope. But it makes him more awesome in my book. Anyone who cares so much about fabulous food and furry critters is 5* in my book all day long. Go see for yourself!

Things looked promising when we were first sat down. The waitress was friendly and began to take our drink orders. A few of us ordered iced teas and one of my coworkers next to me requested lemon for his water. When she returned she did not bring any sweeteners for the iced teas and forgot my coworker's lemon. We kept waiting for her to come back around so we could request them but it was very hard to catch her attention. Once we were finally able to it still took a long time for her to bring them as she kept waiting on other tables and taking orders. Finally she returned with the sweetener and took our orders. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. We began to notice that people that had come in after us and ordered after us were already eating and there we still sat waiting. We all began watching the time on our phones - after all, we were all at lunch from work and really needed to get back to the office. Finally the food began to arrive in piecemeal fashion. I ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Bun and the Fried Forbidden Black Rice. The Pork Belly Steamed Bun was excellent and left me wanting more. The bun was soft and the pork belly was cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I could have eaten another 5 of those and been happy! It left me really wanting to try the other options they have. My Fried Forbidden Black Rice was good too. The flavors really went well together and the number of shrimp was commensurate with the amount of rice. However, my first reaction when I saw the bowl was ""...$15 for this small amount?!...""  It did fill me up but I couldn't help but wonder if I would have still been hungry if I hadn't had the pork steamed bun beforehand. The rest of our party (for the most part) was happy with their entrees. I did hear that the chicken was overcooked on the Chow Mein's and the Chopped Salad was described as ""very heavy"" but nobody had any big complaints. When she brought the bill we realized we had forgotten to ask her to give us separate checks and she stated she wasn't allowed to do that on groups over 6 anyways. She told us that we had to figure out how much we wanted on everyone's cards and she would run them that way. Some of my coworkers found they had been charged for the protein in their Chow Mein's and when they inquired about it the waitress explained that it doesn't come with - even though the menu is very misleading and states ""choice of protein"" in the description. So needless to say their total came to more than they had bargained for. So I don't know if I will be back - at least for lunch. Although the food was good, I just felt that it was very pricy for what you actually get. Maybe it was because it was lunchtime and they don't expect the portions to be as big but if that's the case then they should knock off something for the reduced portions during lunch.",2017-09-06 23:03:29

I came here to do some quick work on my laptop and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be serving this place no justice. Looking at a menu as variety heavy as they have of tea options can be as overwhelming as a foreign language could be. But then, the cashier (Catrina, I believe) asked if I needed help. Trying to be an adult, I said no. Totally disregarding my declination for help, she forced some suggestions on me anyway. And, of course, they helped. 

I ended up grabbing a ""PB crepe"" which disappointed me at first because it's topped with literally 3 slices of strawberries & 3 slices of banana only... but then I cut into it and it was STACKED with them. And peanut butter. And ice cream (worth the upcharge). I've never seen one so fat before. 

I ate it outside because this place was popping like a madhouse and the only table outside was the only one that opened up and I pounced on it. I ordered it to go when I saw there was no table, but they saw I found one and made the order for here just to be thoughtful.

The main reason I would write a review is to promote a good company or at least try to get the company and public to recognize bad business practices.

So Rick ""The Rug"" Duran meets my wife over at our fathers house who just passed away and now we have to remodel. My wife said he was nice and explained things to her. He measures it out and hands her a card with a price on the back:  $2997.00. The  whole house is 806 sq. ft. and the carpeted area had to be 700 at most. No furniture. That is $4.28 a SQUARE FOOT!!!! I'm not sure where they get their prices or material, but that is ridiculous. He gave the BS line of we have extra carpet that we can give deals on.
I wouldn't have an issue if this were a good quote and he didn't write it on the back of a card. I called him and asked when we were getting the estimate. He said they don't give written estimates. He said that's company policy. So a number/price on the back of a business card is company policy????? 
Will they tear out old?
Will they replace broken tack strips?
Warrantee information
Padding options?

Although I couldn't really taste the uni but the freshness of the salmon and snow crab stood out. And I looooove tobiko! Salmon Oshizushi was also good. Flavours were great and blended well, better than KaKa. Also liked the freshly prepared okonomiyaki fries and karaage. Who doesn't love okonomiyaki and fried foods? And mayo! The hot rod roll looked great on the plate but I thought lacked flavour, couldn't really taste the tuna inside. But I've never had good fried sushi before, it doesn't seem like a good idea. 

The rice and noodle dishes (carbonara, oyakodon) didn't really hit the spot for me. Lacked flavour and execution. We will leave those off our list next time. The grilled squid was also meh for me, tasted a bit overcooked or not fresh. 

Otherwise really liked the nice quiet atmosphere. Courteous service. Allowed us to eat cake we brought and gave us the complimentary squid for my birthday. And the sushi and rolls were fantastic. This place is kind of hidden in a commercial building, that might explain the low traffic at night time. I will definitely be back for the crepe cakes!!!!",2016-03-15 17:40:34

The decor is Mexi-sexy, with low lighting, booths and tables both, and a great outdoor patio. The bar area is small, but cozy and always well stocked with local and imported beers.

The service = outstanding. Over the years I've been going, I have never had anything less than stellar service. I am one who is a stickler for good service (great food can be made OK when the waiter is a jerk), and this place gets 6 stars in that department.

Foodwise, I've never had anything that didn't make me say ""Oh my god, try this!"" to whoever my lucky date was. A good mix of texmex and authentic, I oftentimes get the 3 tacos with rice and beans. Now I am not ussually a taco person, but their taco options make it near impossible to resist: a chicken taco with pineapple salsa, taco al pastor with pork and greenchiles/habeneros salsa, a vegetarian hard taco smothered in red sauce with a medely of perfectly cooked vegetables inside that makes you wonder why you ever need to eat meat again, and a carne asada taco with onions that is so good you want to high five a cow. 

Other hits include the pork entree (slow cooked in spices, falls off the bone, right into my mouth, mmmm), salmon (best salmon of MY LIFE), and the Nutella pie dessert. That dessert.... just try it. It will be one of the best decisions of your life besides having sex, getting married, having kids and buying that winning lotterry ticket. 

Can you tell I love this place? If you're looking to go out with friends, a date, your mom or your parole officier, look no further. Cantina has something for everyone, with unmatched quality and superior service.",2011-01-29 21:25:23

Nonetheless, I made the trek here prior to leaving Montreal to see what the hype is all about.

We got two dozens of assorted bagels and munched on a few during our drive back. They smelled amazing in the car (especially the garlic one) so obviously I started with that one. Sad to say the bagels were hard and the garlic was burnt.

It's over in the NC Music Factory, (which is a great spot if you haven't checked it out yet,) and sits in a cool space that has a very industrial feel to it, with brick walls and nice lighting. I had high hopes. But in all honesty, aside from the company we were with, it wasn't the greatest experience. 

*Disclaimer*: this review is based off of my experience dining with a 35-girl bachelorette party, which of course is going to be different than getting a table for two, for, or even six. For this reason, I will probably try it again. But if you are thinking about going with a large group, read on...

The PLUSes: 

*when we sat down we noticed that they had put together a menu specifically for our party, with the bachelorette's name on top. We all thought this was a nice personal touch (both on the bridesmaids side as well as the restaurant's.)

*we had our very own waiter dedicated to our party. Having waitressed for many years, I thought this was strange to only have one person taking care of a party of 35, but I thought hey, he must be THAT good.

*they put up with our crazy bachelorette games the bridesmaids had planned. (My apologies if you were part of the nice party of four behind us trying to enjoy a quiet ""couples night out"" - we really didn't mean to interrupt your dinner with flying ""Weener Cleaner Soaps"", and we hope we didn't accidentally sprinkle your salads with ""horny goat weed"". Yup, all grown up, I know.)

*they did not rush us in the least.

The MINUSes:

*the menu, although it was a nice thought, didn't go over too well. It took our food forever to come out (yes, even taking into consideration the large party), and some of the orders still came out wrong. 

*about 30 minutes after placing our drink orders, we looked over to see if our waiter was on his way back - turned out he was still taking drink orders on the other end of the table. Not. Good. Thank god the bridesmaids were prepared with those games.

*from start to finish, it took us a very long time to get our checks and get out of there to continue on with our night. We sat down at 8:30, and it was 11:30 by the time we were able to pay our bills and get to Butter. 

Overall, the food was okay - the caesar salad was pricey and a bit overrated, and the salmon was very salty and dry. But I do want to give this place another try with a table of two or four. I want to also add that they did make it right for us: after someone in our group spoke to the manager, they followed us over to Butter and got us all a table with free drinks. What more could a bachelorette party ask for? The timing even worked out for us, since we still had plenty of time to party, but just an FYI for large groups - be prepared to stay for a while. Hopefully a better update will follow...",2011-04-08 15:33:42

Kahunaville Restaurant and Party Bar are separate but I'll review together. They are each 3 star in my eyes.  We had a coupon for drinks and one for food. We had dinner plans later but it was our last opportunity to use the deals! so we called ahead to reserve the first available dinner spot. I think it was at 4pm (or around there). We were told we couldn't use the deals simultaneously (go from dinner table to bar for refills). WEll that's crap. The bar was dead. Why is this a problem?

TRAVELZOO DEAL:
$25 - Treasure Island: 6 Drinks & Bartender Show, 55% Off

GROUPON DEAL:
$26 for Island-Themed Dinner for Two at Kahunaville Island Restaurant & Party Bar (Up to $54.96 Value) Diners receive two side house salads (a $3.49 value each) and choose a total of two entrees (up to a $23.99 value each).

We started at the bar while we waited for the restaurant to open.

While the drinks were good, the bartender was inattentive. Took forever to get some change so that we could both gamble at the bar. Only one other couple at the bar. Upon ordering our third drink, we asked about the included ""show"" and she tossed the bottles around as she poured. Wish we'd asked on the first drink. The drinks were good though and we were allowed to bring the final one to the lunch/dinner table - good timing.

We couldn't order off the full menu because of our deal. I really need to read the fine print because this broke my hungry heart to hear. Groupon had a link to the full menu when I purchased, so I didn't think there would be restrictions. I'm sure it said it somewhere. Instead of crab cakes I ordered the macademia crusted mahi mahi ($25.99). Husband had flank steak and grilled shrimp ($26.99). We both had caesar salad ($3.49). The salad was heavily dress but the croutons on it were incredible!! I had to share mine though since his salad only had two and I had a bunch. The drinks must have nicened me up - I rarely share food as good as they were!

My fish wasn't bad ,but wasn't great. He hated his steak because it was pre-cut into strips and overcooked.  I liked it though. And we both enjoyed his shrimp.  Had a lot of food leftover - which I took to the room and ate in the morning - and picked at the following day. Would have been nice to have a fridge.

Service was fine. Our server was great and the one at the table next to us was friendly also.

The money paid would have been better spent elsewhere for the food and service. There were very long lags and even getting a menu took a very long time. It is the type of place you would want to linger and enjoy everything but the wait for everything was ridiculous. I like my filet steak rare and it was way overcooked to the medium side. They eventually corrected it but I ended up watching everyone eat their steaks. The other big thing is that the sides were stone cold - the garlic mashed and the asparagus. I was dining with non-picky type people and even they sent these back. The mushrooms braised in red wine were funky and a few of us were feeling these later into the next day. What was delicious was the starter - lobster chowder. SO good. Crab cakes not bad. And the table bread - very good. There is a very extensive wine list and you can get many good ones by the glass for a decent price.
The ambiance was very nice. Classy.
On a busy evening, they were able to bump up our reso to be seated a bit earlier so we appreciated that.

In general, Thai food is spicy and sometimes some dishes can be compromised in flavor if you order mild.  This is not the case with Thai'd Up.  I can order my pad Thai my old and it will still taste like pad Thai!

We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme Ça, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CRÈME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is true, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier "" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!"" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies.

We started out on the front porch in the rockers for a glass of wine. We then moved to the courtyard for sandwiches. Never felt rushed or bothered. We were there for 2 hours. Totally got lost in the atmosphere Luci's has created. about the staff- they all are so happy to be working there and seem to genuinely feel a part of the success. Who doesn't want to frequent a place like that? I'm all in. Definitely will become a regular weekly stop for me. Thanks folks. Can't wait until the cooler months,2016-09-14 17:52:56

One of the few fine dining restaurants in Charlotte that attempts to step outside the boundaries of normal gastronomy. The words ""safe, unambitious"" will not appear as adjectives to describe any of the three dishes I consumed during my wife's birthday dinner. I began the adventure with the chefs soup Du jour, Braised Boar and Rice Soup. Fantastic starter, if a bit on the salty side. I've never been afraid of a little sodium, so I consumed every last drop. 

For a main course, I again chose one of the chefs specials; Duck Breast, with a cauliflower puree, bean puree, broccoli rabe, finished with a honey gelee (read: honey jello). Now, I'm not usually one to fall all over themselves for kitchen gimmickry (i.e. honey jello squares garnishing the plate, purees of this and that, finished with an emulsion of blah blah, etc.); I prefer to let the locally grown ingredients (which this place boasts) speak for themselves. However, in this instance, I was pleasantly surprised at how all the flavors played off one another. The insanely bitter-but-delicious Broccoli rabe, paired with the sweet honey and savory fatty duck, was sublime. My only critique would be the two purees on the plate (albeit very delicious purees). Fortunately, the crunch of the lightly sauteed broccoli and crispy skin of the duck breast swooped to the rescue with just enough texture to save the dish from becoming a plate of baby food accoutrement. 

For desert, I always play it safe. If a menu declares creme brulee, then creme brulee I do order. I don't know what it is about this simple, delicious vanilla custard that commands my attention. Being a purist, I prefer the vanilla bean creme brulee over other variations, but Global forced me outside of my traditional boundaries (just as they had with the two previous courses) by serving me a trio of brulees; a mocha and a chocolate brulee accompanied my vanilla go-to. And I was happy to have the experience! Chef Bernard came out at the conclusion of the meal to make sure everything was to our liking.  This little touch is lost in today's culinary world, but greatly appreciated by myself and my fellow diners.

I hope this place makes it; an odd location in a seemingly abandoned business park, coupled with the menu being prohibitively expensive for many a dining budget, will make it challenging. Fortunately, I believe that Chef Bernard (executive chef) and his wife Shannon (front of the house) are up to the challenge!",2011-05-19 17:12:06

The good:
- Upon check in, they gave me tickets for either free drinks or free continental breakfast. I didn't end up using them, but it was nice to know they were there.
- Great atmosphere. The lobby looked very festive since they're all decorated for the holidays, but aside from that there are plenty of cozy chairs, a large fireplace, fountains, and a big community table.
- The ""backyard"" is simply gorgeous, especially at night. Heated pools, lots of cozy little secluded fire pits all over the place, and beautiful lights.
- Complimentary drinks and light appetizers every night from 5-6 pm in the lobby. I'm talking wine, champagne, and hot toddies, folks. Note: that 6 pm end time is strictly enforced. I was there at 6, and couldn't get another glass of bubbly. ;)
- Room service was prompt and the food was pretty darn good. I did have an entertaining 5 minutes trying to order - I'm not sure if I was talking to a new employee or what, but he just did not understand what I wanted. Once we got it straightened out, I was really happy with my food. 
- Aveda products. 'Nuff said. 
- This may sound weird, but their shower curtains are the bomb! This is the first place I've stayed that has netting at the top of the curtain, so you can look out while you're in the shower. This is very important if you've seen Psycho one too many times and have a phobia about showering. I'm not saying *I* do, but I'm just saying.

Firesky, this is definitely as good as it gets.",2009-12-11 14:04:35

So I've been shopping here for a few years.  Lived in Vegas a long time and always went to the Skechers outlet at the Premium Outlets, and one time they told me to check this location.  I didn't even know it existed, so when I made the drive out I was amazed to see the size.  They have a much bigger selection than any other Skechers outlet I've seen, and their prices are even cheaper than the other outlet locations in town!

It's not exactly in a great neighborhood, so the store can get a little ghetto at times, but when you walk out of the store paying under $50 for 2 pairs of shoes, life isn't so bad.  They always have Buy 1 Get 1 50% off going, so once you pick up one pair you might as well get two. :)

Why did I come in today to Yelp about them?  Well, I bought 2 pairs of shoes 3 months ago, and I've been wearing them both back and forth.  One of them got a hole in the top of the shoe at the stitching, so I brought them by to see if there's anything we could do.  Without a receipt, the manager happily took them back and gave me a brand new pair of the same kind.  They were down to $24.99, so I would have been fine buying a new pair if I had to.  But it's nice to see a store manager taking responsibility for their defect and saving their customer a huge hassle of going through corporate.  No mess, no fuss, new shoes.

If you like Skechers shoes at all, I highly recommend you stop by this shop if you haven't already.",2014-11-07 04:27:40

ask the server for some direction of portions! i felt like my party didn't and regretted how big some of the portions were! the price point is similar to hobak and magal in town and despite my five star rating, i can't say this spot is better than either of those.

only thing we didn't care for was the steamed egg and kimchicheegae because despite how much we love those two sides normally, they weren't prepared right here. the steamed egg was too dry and not fluffy at all. texture was harder and dry, lacked flavor and overall was bland. the kimcheechigae tasted lackluster too because it was way too salty with lack of much content.

From the moment we walked into the door, we knew we made the right decision choosing here!

We were greeted immediately by a girl who welcomed us to our first visit and explained how the ordering process works. The collections of homemade soups , the variety of subs, and fresh ingredients for the salads made choosing which combos to go with more difficult - you can choose two out of the three and it comes with a slice of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. 

I went with the lobster bisque and the bbq chicken salad. Although the name of the salad sounds too ""rich"", the salad was surprisingly refreshing and perfect. The soup was flavorful, but lukewarm. My boyfriend got the avocado turkey club and the new England clam chowder. He devoured every bite, so I'm guessing he enjoyed his meal also. We only spent $20 for two combos, chips, and two soft drinks -- what a deal!

I would describe zupas as a nice alternative to the bland flavors that are delivered at panera bread. It feels like a healthier choice also. I can't compliment the atmosphere enough -- they have a charging station where you can plug your chargers for any of your electronics, an array of hot sauces as well as flavor pumps for your drinks, and digital menus and displays around the dining room.

My wife and I really liked the booths for 2, they are really a nice touch and provide some privacy away from the larger groups and even the couples that are right next to you.

My favorite part is desert with the rice krispie treats, fruits, and various pastries. On the other hand, the meat/seafood I feel are ordinary and over priced. I know that its meant to be a 3-4 course meal, but I don't feel like it would hurt to give us more than 2 -3 cubes of beef and chicken. 

Good for special occasions or maybe a date night (my wife and I don't get out very often and it takes about 2 hours to eat so you have plenty of time to talk), but not some place that you have to eat at frequently",2012-04-21 19:05:08

My dad made the reservation almost a month in advance, so he got to pretty much pick whatever time he wanted.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated, spacious and clean.  Definitely feels a lot more upscale than the average Chinese restaurant. There were a lot of waiters around, and they were much more attentive, so I thought service was definitely better. 

We order the deluxe duck, which the chef cuts and plates into a pretty flower in front of your table. The duck was very yummy, we each got our individual sauce and green onions (usually it's just a shared plate), and apparently the cucumbers were organic. However, was the taste worth 3x the price of other peking duck places? I don't think so... So my conclusion is that you are really just paying that price for the brand of this restaurant and the ""experience"" of seeing it plated nicely into a flower. When the waiter served our duck, he didn't say much. However, there was a big table nearby who seemed to know the manager, and they specifically asked the manager to give a speech when they got heir duck. The manager gave a very nice history of the restaurant, a lot more details about the duck, how they cook and cut it and how they plate it. That was actually very interesting. I wish this was offered to every customer who ordered the duck.

We order a few other items. I thought the other dishes were actually quite good, and noticeably better than other restaurants. The price were still slightly higher than average, but I thought the other dishes were more reasonable given the better quality.

Overall, if I had $$ laying around, I would probably come here over other peking duck restaurants.  However, I don't, so if I really wanted peking duck, I would probably choose another restaurant that has much better value.",2017-12-12 04:26:49

So I got a bagel sandwich, specifically the spirited kokobelli. 

Line forms pretty quick if you get here after 10:30am. 
I came at the right time. However, there was still a slight wait from the previous people that ordered. That take a little bit longer as there's maybe 3 people prepping the food in the back. 

Waited about 15mins. They also came out and reported they ran out of sausage, so I had to use Ham substitute. 

Food: Spirited kokbelli comes with egg, pepperjack, salsa, and suppose to be sausage but I got ham instead - on jalapeno bagel. Taste was pretty much as expected with those ingredients. Nothing different or spectacular, but a clean basic ingredient sandwich. I thought it was ok for a pre-hike meal. Not oily and won't bog you down before hiking. 

Price: $6.47 total for just the sandwich.
Not too expensive. 

Service: slightly slow, you will wait if their busy, but thankfully not too long. Just don't be hangry when you arrive and find a line 

Misc: They have a lot of different bagel selections if that's your thing.

Parking: bit parking lot outside. 

Pro: Free bagel samples at the counter",2018-05-05 19:46:06

1.  Open 24/7.  If you need something late at night, you can always count on Galleria
2.  Great hot meals sale. They have so many varieties of hot food and they're great when they are discounted. I go here for food when I don't have the time to make something. It's great for the price.
3.  The little restaurants and cafeteria. They have korean restaurants right beside the counters and they are great. Options include soups, sushi, noodles, etc. I love going to Wow Korean Restaurant because their soups come at a great price (between $6.99 to $8. 99). Please note that these restaurants are not open 24/7
4.  They have great Korean snacks that you can't find everywhere else. My favourite is the Toppoki chips. 
5.  They have baked good sections with so many varieties of bread. They have pizza bread, which I usually get when I don't have time to cook my meals. They have sweet breads and many more.

Here are a couple of not so great points about this supermarket:
1. The products are a bit pricey if you compare it to T&T and other asian grocery stores
2.  Parking isn't that great. Either you park really close or you park farther away. You never find good spots because it's always so busy.
3.  You can't really find Chinese or other asian products here. Almost all products are Korean...well, because it's a Korean grocery store. But something as simple as spring roll papers, I was unable to find last time. This supermarket's target market are obviously Koreans. But a lot of Asians go here too...so I think other basic Asian products should be sold here.

Overall, it's a clean place with many products. Open 24/7 and have great deals on hot food.",2015-01-27 02:01:00

The vibe is bumping, and the crowd is full of young students. There is additional seating upstairs but the vibes were better on the main floor.

The service was decent. We ordered the bul-dalk (spicy chicken hot plate) at the waittresses' reccomendation, and it was spicy but tasty. It came with several service (free) dishes of corn, french fries, and radishes.

The soju selection was not bad and the beers were reasonably priced. My only issue is that when I ordered my Soju, 3 shot glasses arrived with 1 of them being completely cracked. Sharp glass shards were sticking out from the glass, making me confused as to how she did not notice this.

The restaurant is small and when it's full, you'll notice. Also, if you have a group of 6 or more, there is only one large round table in the whole restaurant and it is by the front door so be aware.

Other than that, the food is very tasty so no disappointment there. The food also comes out quick.  I think it also helps to have someone who can read or communicate in Chinese in your group as they seem to have a number of special items posted on the wall and they aren't written in English.

I sent the video to the guy who owns my house and he quickly called Lodi (the number was on my garage door). They called me that day to schedule an appointment, unfortunately I travel for work so we had to make it for the following weekend. I like they didn't charge additional for a Saturday appointment. 

We scheduled a time of 1-3 as I was running a 5K that morning and wasn't sure if I would require hospitalization after since I am out of shape and it was my first one (I survived).  

At 12:30ish I received a call from the tech asking if it would be more convenient for me if he came early instead of the hours of 1-3. The way he asked was very polite and he made it all about me (great quality in a guy) instead of insisting he come early since it was easier for him. 

He was there in literally minutes and I'm lead to believe he called me from outside my house. 

He was extremely friendly and efficient (not to mention easy on the eyes). He was in and out in just over an hour. He only provided one remote with the install but after insisting I needed two, he grabbed one from his truck. 

Because of his professional behavior and how he seemed to go above and beyond I would definitely recommend Lodi in the future.",2014-12-09 18:21:59
UHWxsaVRPPbCcj8P8eW53A,iwDP-y8NJG3Vem2z242LDg,A7waf6G3cvnLfAqKeLL8DA,3,2,0,3,"Dinner at Buca was OK on the night we went, but it was a Sunday so atmosphere was lacking somewhat. I also wish the menu included some of the items in the pictures that other reviewers had because the night we went, there wasn't anything overly mind-blowing to choose from, though everything we had was good--just not spectacular which was what I expected as Buca has always been highly recommended.  

We originally planned to go to Terroni as I was craving one of their pizzas which kind of comes close to the pizza of all pizzas I had in Milan, but their lineup was too long and I was DAMN hungry so we headed for Buca where we were able to snatch up a table right away. If you've never been, it's on King--next door to Cheval--they're separated by a laneway that leads to Buca's doors. Go through the doors and down the stairs to discover a beautiful space with exposed brick walls (I know, cliche~), and two dining rooms (one is more a wine cellar), dim lighting...romantic if you want it to be. 

We ordered:
- the nodini were OK; they're adorable little nubs of bread doused in oil & garlic, but I probably won't bother ordering them next time
- lamb skewers - I let my friend go to town on those and he was practically squealing with delight between bites whereas I am not a lamb fan, though I wish I were!
- breaded, fried eggplant layered with fresh basil leaves, parm & ricotta and a squirt of burrata on top - judging from the description, I was kind of expecting something similar to eggplant parmaggiano (minus the tomato sauce) which is one of my favourite dishes but instead it was very bland; not a single ingredient besides the basil offered any flavour  
- salsiccia pizza - very good pizza, served on a long cutting board and as everyone else mentioned: scissors for your convenience, which I've only ever seen in Korean restaurants
...I was torn between the veal tenderloin and the sea bass, when my eye caught their list of pizzas and their scamorza seemed to be a close fit to the pizza I would have had at Terroni so I went with that. While I enjoyed every bite of it, instead of us ordering two pizzas, I should have had one of the other mains so as to get a real taste of chef Gentile's range of talent (I'm sure he's wonderful). You know what this means...I'll have to go back.
- Buca's got this crazy-extensive tome of wines so if you're a wine-lover, I am sure you'll be pleased.  
- (Wait, I'm not done!) We shared the dessert of 3 big balls of gelato of your choosing. Ours included lavender (my friend nearly threw up when he tasted it; I guess it's not for everyone), hazelnut (TONS of nuts throughout, like I've never seen--which I loved), and blood orange (SO GOOD), all sprinkled with toasted spices. I am guessing they make their own gelato, which was clearly the most popular dessert.

Along with your bill, you get the cutest little packet containing a tiny nougat-ball with their card attached. I love it when restaurants go the extra mile with such small details! Service was excellent--I always get a kick out of places that insist on reciting your order back to you as each dish is presented at your table, though I'm not sure all the waiters were Italian as many suggest. Whatever the case, I found most of their service to have a real old-school polished-ness about it which is not terribly common, so that was nice. 

Considering this was an unplanned, passing-by situation on a Sunday night, the meal was a bit of a splurge, though not totally insane. Buca is definitely on the pricey side but prime location, excellent service, and chef Gentile all come at a price, though I will definitely go back to Buca as I am curious to try their other dishes which I am sure are amazing. To say I LOVE them is a bit of a stretch (for now) but their food is fresh and service professional, which is enough to warrant another go.",2012-03-23 06:02:51

The cheddar chive biscuit that the poached egg is on, was pretty much like a brick.  I could not cut through it. They had burnt the bottom of it, so it was rock hard. We had to ask the servers to bring another edible biscuit twice because the first server completely forgot. The second biscuit they brought, was almost ice cold in the middle.

My nails chipped in 2days (Shouldn't happen with a 2 week manicure), I noticed the polish was SUPER thin which means they put polish remover in it to stretch it which ruins the integrity of the polish. They also use scrappers on the foot, WHO DOES this STILL??? The Pomice should be used for skin on the food to avoid skin peeling.

The instructor is a beast but I have worked up to keeping up with her.  The class will give you a full-fledged workout.  The facility also has an indoor track that is upstairs and circles the gym.  They have a number of exercise rooms which makes alternate classes available.  The Zumba class is also a blast.  That instructor is a fireball!  This is one of the nicer facilities although I don't think the weight room is large enough.  They also have a steam room and sauna in the male/female locker rooms.,2013-01-27 02:45:54

My girl and I visited this place to see what all the yelp excitement was about, and boy were we are glad we came. This place offers a personal-sized pizzas with as many toppings as your heart desires for around $9, and I must say it is a pretty cool experience to build your own pie! First, you start off by choosing the dough (regular or whole wheat) and then you are guided through all the yummy toppings you can choose for your personalized pizza... and you can choose from several different kinds of sauces, meats, veggies and even fruit! The staff makes you feel like an expert chef and will guide you through the build process and even offer suggestions if you are not well versed in the art of mixing flavors ;-)

You cannot leave this place without trying their Nutella and s'mores pizza. Decadent and irresistible, this unusual treat will be the perfect closing to an awesome meal. Enjoy!",2013-02-18 19:13:07

I'm guilty myself that I haven't gave them much of a chance because after being spoiled on the strip with MLIFE and all the MGM hotels I really had no need to stay here. My only gripe would be the customer service but I won't ding them too bad because the property and pool is beautiful. I came here last week for a private party that hosted a pool party. When I walked in and asked the front desk or concierge person about this party they apparently didn't know anything about it and the lady was rather rude about it. Gave me a look like I was from outer space. Weird but anyways it's a good thing that another guest standing by knew something about the pool party and was able to direct me in the correct place. Not the job of a guest but sure glad they knew because I wouldn't have got up. You would think that for big events everybody would be in the loop but that wasn't the case. The pool itself was amazing and the entire property was so clean. We went also into one of the suites and again just spectacular! No complaints on that end. If you are wanting something off the strip and away from all the strip craziness then this would be the place!,2016-03-30 21:43:48

The famed Muay Thai Bowl is nothing short of perfect: a twenty-ingredient salad that leaves room for leftovers (dare I say, enough for two meals). The contents are delicious and perfectly balanced. Seriously, I'm generally not one to pay for salads (and have cooked at pretty salad-heavy restaurants) and this place knocked my socks off. Oh and it was $10 (with a fried duck egg on top).

The juice I ordered was also wonderful and incredibly cheap. For a fresh pressed ginger zinger it was $7 and I had almost too much of it.

On top of everything the staff was incredibly sweet. This kind of establishment (or at least comparable places I know) tends to favour the apathetic-white-girl-with-dreads kinda staff while these guys are absolutely the opposite.

The saki is always a necessity and well with that comes the beer! 

This is a place that even the ""I don't like sushi"" type can go to and not complain that there is nothing on the menu to eat. Very nice non-sushi selection.
For the sushi lovers and the courageous foodies........NOM NOM's galore. The selection and price are just to ""YAY"" about and for the times you are so sushi craved the all you can or care to eat lunch buffet ($10.10) is the OMG. I can sit from 11:30am-2:30pm and never eat the same piece twice or thrice unless I want to. They keep the rolls a flowing and change the types every time a new plate goes out. Also get a whole hot bar section as well with calamari, chicken wings, salads, soup, Chinese selections, and dessert.

If I'm paying .50 for each cup, you'd damn well better fill the cups all the way!  

Also, avoid paying with a credit card, cause there's a .50 charge for that too.

We've stayed at GVR several times previously and have always had a pleasant stay however, I believe it's about time they updated their décor--the room we stayed in had an old musty yellow color pallet that reminded me of something you'd find in your great grandparents house.

I initially thought of getting an ice cream sandwich but the base was two chocolate chip cookies which seemed like it would be overly sweet. 

The scoop of the salted caramel snapper lost its lustre after a few bites, but was made up for by the toasted marshmallow ice cream which quickly took me back to pleasant childhood memories around a campfire. 

Prices are fair given that the portions are large, especially when served in a waffle cone. A double scoop in a waffle cone was ~$6.

I love all of the little nooks and spaces! Nice little patio, the bathroom was clean, the server was friendly, the DJ was decent, and there is lots of parking right there! 

As I came by here after an after party, I needed no further booze and something to eat on the quick. I ordered a Pepsi and a poutine. The poutine was okay. Decent size, not even close to authentic, but good to absorb the alcohol in my stomach. Had I been completely sober, I probably would have been disappointed. Now as for the pop... 

Herein lies one of my big pet peeves with bar and restaurant staff that use a soda gun. First of all, the Pepsi was $2.50 for a standard size glass. Fine. After I was finished my poutine, nearly done my Pepsi, and my friend was about 2/3 done his beer the waitress took the empty plate and asked if I wanted ""a refill"" on my pop. I looked at the glass thinking we'd be leaving soon but figured while she's there and asking I might as well so said, ""sure, why not"". When the bill came I was charged for two Pepsis. Now aside from the fact that that is just plain cheap - considering the actual cost of the drink is about 5-cents - it's rather irritating. I would not have accepted the offer of ""a refill"" had I been aware that I would be charged. Generally, if I say I would like ""another one"" I expect to pay. If it's ""a refill"", the assumption is that they are refilling the glass that I already paid for. Whatever. Now I know. And you do too.

I was wrong on both accounts. We started off with Cold stale bread dropped off at the table, after mentioning it to the server, without saying a word, he took it away and brought back some nice fresh warm bread. 
He never apologized just set the new bread on the table and walked away. 

I ordered linguine and white clam sauce for my entrée, it included a hunk of clear plastic wrap that had obviously been covering the meal in the refrigerator. 

When I showed him the plastic, he gasped, apologized and wisked the dish back to the kitchen.
He did offer to replace the meal with a different choice, as he was minimizing the fact that it was only plastic saran wrap that was in my food, but I was in the mood for linguine and white clam sauce. They remade the dish and it was just satisfactory.

By 12pm on Sunday, there will be a wait to get in. It is located on the second floor of a small shopping area (I wouldn't call it a shopping mall or a shopping complexe due to its size). Luckily we arrived somewhat early so were seated immediately.

For Dim Sum brunch, the concept of this place is that they have servers who push carts with various Dim Sum items through the restaurant. For the Asian/Chinese patrons, they will generally pass by your table and say what it is in Cantonese as they pass by your table. If you don't understand Cantonese but you are Asian, you will generally have to stop or ask them what it is since they will assume that you speak/understand Cantonese. For the non-Asians, they will stop and show you what is in their cart (and possibly give you a description). You pick what you want from the carts that pass by your table and the servers then takes the paper located on your table and marks the number of items next to the price of the item. At the end when you are finished, you wave down one of the waiters/waitresses wearing a brownish vest and they tally up the bill for you.

The negative thing about this type of dining experience (Dim Sum in push carts) is that if you're on a budget or have a limited amount of money to spend or want to spend, you might need to ask the price of each of the items that pass by your table. It depends on what you select but generally I am full (but not stuffed) at around $15/person. Whenever I go for Dim Sum (and I'm paying), I generally factor in $15/person. However, if you get the Shrimp Crab Claws, these will be expensive (don't quote me on this but I believe that they are over $5 each piece).

Now how you choose to react to them that is what makes the difference. You can have a bad day but make a conscious choice to minimize it, force a smile and make it work. After a while and maybe a few cups of coffee, the day can smooth over if you let it. 

I know this sounds so trivial, what could this possibly have to do with food? Well in life and the restaurant biz, you really have to make an impression. When the person taking your order is grumpy maybe a little bitchy even, no matter how good the food is, it may never live up to it's full potential. 

Unfortunately this is what happened on a recent visit to Sonora Mesquite Grill when the guy at the counter couldn't even muster up a hello, but simply, ""yes"". Now I would have blown this off if he hadn't been joking around with the people in front of me in line. It's just this sort of thing that just chaps my behind. Really, how hard would it have been to crack a smile and save me from having to share this? I persevere, taking the high road, and get my ordered started because I've been hearing some really god things about this place. 

The buzz surrounding Sonora is it's self proclaimed ""best carne asada this side of the border"", which is a pretty tall order when it comes to carne asada. Think about it, we have so many places that serve good carne asada around town, even the 'berto's drive thrus don't really suck that bad. If you've never heard of carne asada, it's thin sliced beef that has been marinated or heavily salted then grilled or roasted to a caramelized perfection. Then, wrap all that up into a hot flour tortilla with pico de gallo (chopped onion, cilantro and tomato) and fresh guacamole, trust me on this, you'll love it. 

Green Chile Rajas with Cheese ($6.25) was an excellent way to make up for the lack of friendliness. A juxtaposition of roasted chiles, onions and peppers served with either corn or flour tortillas popped with flavor and texture. I would strongly recommend the flour tortillas, so light and flaky, characteristics not common with the usual bready type. 

Okay so getting to the Carne Asada Burrito ($7.49) you'll first notice the price tag a bit high considering that the burrito while large is also stuffed with rice. For me if I'm going to pay that much for a burrito, it needs to be more meat and less filler. Now with that being said the meat inside the burrito was not only perfectly cooked, it was amazing. The first bite fills your mouth with a certain salty beefy mesquite smokiness that's both flavorful and satisfying. The only thing that made the meat better was the addition of Sonora's killer house made Guacamole ($1.50), green salsa and red salsa. Both salsas were delicious though neither offered any sort of heat.

I then ordered the Philly Cheese Burger. It's sort of a mix between a Philly Cheese Steak and a Hamburger. The burger itself wasn't bad. The let down in the burger was it was pretty expensive for a burger (which wasn't even that big.) I think I should have just stuck with the wings, but that's it.

It's within a short walk and drive from nearby offices, so its the perfect place to have breakfast and lunch. I dropped in on a Friday after 1pm. This might be an opportune time to visit because it's after the lunchtime rush and City Hall is closed on Fridays. 

The menu choices take a twist on traditional breakfast-lunch favorites, and there are also some unique items. Making a choice was difficult, and I was wavering between pancakes or burgers, but I ended up ordering the latter. 

Let me give thanks to their Thanksgiving Burger. The open-faced burger is pretty dang bomb, and it's mainly due to its truffle bread pudding, which I can eat just on its own. It's so good that I'd give this place 5-Stars just for that. The turkey burger patty placed on top was thick and tasted fine, but it would've been a plain ol' patty without the homemade orange-cranberry sauce on top. The burger comes with a side of french fries which was a refreshing sight to see among the restaurants I've been to that require you buy your fries on the side -- that's just unnatural and un-American to me. The Thanksgiving Burger gives Cap's Bobbie Sandwich, which I consider to be Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form, a run for its money.

For the uninitiated and the uninformed, these pierogis are *not good*.

They are, in fact, terrible.   

The dough is too thick and fills your mouth with the most unappealing flour-y taste.  The ""crimp"" along the side is way too huge - thereby accenting the ""I ate too much peanut butter"" mealy-, clumping feeling.  The various ""flavors"" provided - like pizza - are not generous and fresh-tasting.

If you want very good, authentic pierogi in the West Side Market - visit Irene Dever's Dairy.   They have the traditional varieties (potato, cheese - not cheddar cheese but sweet'ish, dry cottage cheese, sauekraut, and the barely authentic potato/cheese mix.  If you call ahead, you can order prune (very good - try it) or apricot.    If you are very motivated - drive to St. Josephat's Ukrainian Church on State Road and buy pierogi from the little old ladies in the back building.

However, I was so disappointed. I ordered a Black Tea with Cloud Cap and the amount of cloud cap that you see in the pictures is not the same as what they actually give you. The cloud was so watery and runny like the consistency of a milk. Being a fan of sea salt caps, I already know how it should be. It should be thick with a consistency of a heavy cream. The quickest way you would know if it's a good sea salt cap is if it DOESNT MIX right with your tea. They should maintain a separation, as long as you don't mix it. But with theirs, you could see the cap mixing right away with the tea just when they pour the cap on top. They should take notes from Taste Tea or ITEA on how to make the right sea salt cap. 

The boba was also a disappointment. It was soggy and you could feel the starch of the boba melting in your mouth. Yuck! Boba should be chewy, with a little crunch and resistance when you bite it. It's either old or that's the way they really make it. 

I still wanted to give them a chance. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I had a ""bad"" sea salt and boba that day. If they truly have 5 Stars, I don't know how they got it though.",2018-09-12 00:07:05

Menu items: All you can eat gnocchi

Happy Gnocchi Day Toronto! Every 29th of the month you can celebrate lucky gnocchi day with the folks at Piola with an offering of all you can eat home-made gnocchi for just $14.95/person.

History has it that once upon a time, on the 29th of an unknown month, in a small village in Italy, a missionary arrived upon a very poor house asking for food. He was welcomed to their house and was offered the only thing they had on the table, ""Gnocchi"". The missionary was very thankful for their warm reception and wonderful food. Soon after the missionary left the house, the poor family found some gold coins right under their Gnocchi plate... Since then the ""Lucky Gnocchi Legend"" has gained recognition all over the world. Families gather together every 29th of the month and enjoy Gnocchi in order to have luck and prosperity in their lives.

And now in Toronto, you can celebrate every 29th too and wish for prosperity in your lives, all courtesy of the international restaurant, Piola. A place that has claimed territory on 1165 Queen West, becoming famous for its great execution of those potato, flour and salt concoctions called gnocchi.

From pesto, to basil and tomato, four cheese and even Alfredo sauce, Piola delivers on its promise by offering the best quality, home-made gnocchi one can indulge in, for a dime. Their gnocchi is tender, ethereally light, nicely potatoey and able to stand up to all the sauces offered during lucky night. On the 29th of every month, one can easily be served over 6 different types of gnocchi flavours. Waiters come and go with their bowls steaming with the oeey-gooey delicious nods telling guests what they have in them, and then proceeding to serve onto plates.

Piola gets packed the day of and reservations are often advised for lucky gnocchi days. At Piola, the service is so wonderful that you are sure to be served the best experience on this day. Though I still have to give Piola a run for their pizzas, I am and forever will be their number one fan when it comes to gnocchi.

However, when you want something healthy when eating out, there's not too many choices in the neighbourhood.  The service is great here, they greet you immediately at the door and seem genuinely warm and friendly with the customers.  

The California Salad is my favourite thing here, it's a mixture of greens and a variety of nuts that provide just the right amount of crunch texture with each bite.  Be warned though that if you aren't a regular heavy veggie eater, your body will take some time adjusting to the copious amount of fibre the rest of the day if you catch my drift....",2014-03-12 19:54:26

It's probably a 2.5 in my mind but I guess I would admit this was probably one of my least favorite steak houses i've been to in terms of their steaks. 

Bread was served cold and you are given sour dough and raisin/nut bread. I prefer the raisin/nut bread. 

Prime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so. 

Filet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.

Dry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.

The sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette. 

Mushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...
 
Potato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must. 

Cream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?

Regardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party. 

I would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me.",2014-09-24 01:14:42

The girls who work here are rude. I've only once sent my coffee back because it tasted like water. After telling the girl it didn't taste right she acted like she didn't understand or wasn't willing to make me a new one. So I tell her it tastes watered down, and since she wouldn't make a new one (every other dunkin has always made a new one) I asked her to add more chocolate. She walks over to another employee and so rudely says ""it tastes like water!"", basically making fun of me to the other girl. 
I received my coffee and left only to be unsatisfied for what I paid for. Ever since when I return I always get a nice girl talking through the intercom but once I pull up to the window get treated with a snotty personality. Seems like they might need some male staff or a new manager.

The location is rather small and parking is a bit of a challenge but you can maneuver through this and try this place out.  The food we ordered was very good, the quality of the product is definitely worthy of the price which is a bit higher than your average spot.  Clearly one of the areas that they strived on was their service, our server was very attentive and constantly would check in with us making us very comfortable.  Try the crispy spring rolls, they are winners but the big one that left me looking for more was my PHO.  The PHO was very bland in taste and the meat and veggies were very scarce.  I almost felt like I had the last scoop from the pot because there was little for us to enjoy.  

To me PHO is the staple to the Vietnamese shop just like Pizza is to the italian restaurant.

It's really a hidden gem.

They have such a huge variety of Laos and Thai dishes. 

The best part is that everything is good!

I can honestly say I've tried just about everything.

They have curries, soups, noodles, stir frys.

My favorite thing is that everything is served family style so the portions are large, the prices are low, and it's easy to share.

It's family owned and they're all so nice.

The food comes out pretty fast.

Just some side notes: it's in an older plaza, but it's very sanitary.

They also have a weekend buffet for 7.99. I've never had it but my family chooses that at times. I've seen the buffet and there's a big variety of dishes.



Try these out:

Issan sausage with sticky rice. At home version has more fat, but they serve theirs with traditional dipping sauce.
Pad Thai. Their pad Thai is hands down my favorite in town and I've tried a lot! Theirs is very saucy. I know it's one of those dishes that is different every where you go. This one is my favorite.
Tom Kha Gai. It's coconut milk and galanga root soup. I get it with chicken. 
For dessert get the coconut ice cream in a coconut! It's so good! Their are palm nuts and sticky rice in it.

Just about every dish is under $10.

When the girl brought our waters out, she only brought 4 waters. Then brought out some bread and salad thing (yum!!) and still... no extra water.

She asked if we were part of the players club and I said I'd go get a card so we can all have the $20, but in the end she didn't even need to see the card so we should've just said yes! grr.

So with the AYCE, it's anything on the menu, limit 2 per person per time. Finish and order more. So we tried 20 different things, some were great, some not so great. The ones that are notable is definitely the sea bass skewers (amazingly moist and flavorful), tater fries, nuttin honey (must try. very yummy!), tuscan pizza (order last because it was a pretty decent portion), smalls balls, and... can't think of anything else.

I scheduled an eyebrow wax with the same woman, hoping for the same amazing service I've received in the past.  I was very sad to learn the hard way that things are much different now.  I checked in 10 minutes early and waited on the couch with a fresh glass of water.  Despite being 10 minutes early, my waxer was 10 minutes late.  Upon leaving my glass of water, I noticed last minute that I was drinking out of a dirty glass.  The glass had lipstick marks on the rim of the previous woman (or fashionably fierce man) who used the glass.  I was grossed out.

My waxer seemed to be speaking to me in hyper-speed.  Asking me what I'm doing with my life, what i'm doing back in the area, etc...which is nice of her to ask, but it felt rushed and it seemed like she was only asking to convince me that she's making a connection in the 7 minutes it took from the lobby to wax to car.  The eyebrow wax itself wasn't the most beautiful arch like she gave me last time, and when i got home, I discovered they were uneven.  One side was thicker than the other.

Yes, yes, I know I get to look into a mirror when I'm done at the salon, but the woman was so quick and direct that I felt like I didn't have time to really look at the service.  I felt I needed to get in, get waxed and get out so she could get to her next appointment.

I'll NEVER go back to John Robert's again.  The overall experience was terrible and not worth the $20 + tip when I could get the same service, done with more TLC somewhere else.

This place conjures up images of super cool Geisha chicks wearing modified robes (ie super short) with white boots dancing to ""These Boots Are Made For Walking."" I just love the fun vibe here, which is carried through to both the cocktail and sushi menus.
 
It's not just about vibe, though. The food is Wham Bam Good!

The veggie gyoza is possibly amongst the best I've ever had and I've had a lot in my time. I'm talking about whole edamame in the dumplings! Wrappers are slightly crisp, perfectly pan fried. 

I also recommend the tasty veg soba noodles. A very simple dish, but one that I all but inhaled, because it's perfectly prepared.

The veggie sushi roll was slightly disappointing. As it's the only vegetarian sushi option that I found on the menu, I ordered it hoping for more than the usual carrot, cuc and...? (no avocado to be found and I think it should always be featured in a veggie roll to keep it from being too dry). The whole shebang is just really tasteless. The avo/cuc roll I ordered never arrived, but I know our large table ordered up so much that it's not really a big deal. If I had really wanted it, I would have asked for it. I do think that because Geisha is a post modern take on a sushi joint that they could stand to get creative with the vegetarian sushi rolls.

Now, let's turn to the fun karaoke rooms! Never did the private room thang before and although the machines kind of confused us (as did the song choices, quite honestly), the super sweet and lovely waitresses/hostesses never left us hanging and tried to be of assistance whenever they could.

The minds behind Patria are not new to the block, Harji and Khabouth (Nyood and Kultura; La Société and Ultra; and Weslodge). But they're not known for kicking out high quality food. I give them this - they know how to create the ultimate environment, one you want to be seen in and one you gravitate towards for its style, grace and precence. Patria is no different. It's a beautiful restaurant with a wonderfully long terrace. It's just north of King Street behind a brick facade. It's hidden (unlike Wesldoge) and the only marker is the wrought iron gate that you'd miss, unless you're looking for it.

Apart from design, they got it so right this time. The Spanish cuisine coming out of their kitchen is banging, right down to the ibérico they're slicing and serving. Iberico is deliciously divine. It's more expensive because it accounts for just 8% of Spanish cured hams.

My favourite duo and I spent some quality time while I was in Toronto, including classing it up at Patria.  I lament not trying the paella, but we weren't that hungry when we went. By all accounts, it seems Patria's paella is worth the $40 and serves about three, or in my case, just me?!?

We did get to try the paraíso naranja, aperol codorníu cava blood orange. $36 for a pitcher, but it was killer good. I recommend that or the sangria...by the pitcher.

Then we snacked on these:

Albóndigas con salsa de tomate-Traditional lamb meatballs tomato mint $12
Dátiles con Tocino ibérico-Dates ibérico bacon manchego guindillas $9
Patatas bravas con huevos fritos-Crispy potato spicy tomato fried egg $9

The meatballs are good, but compared to the other two they became forgettable. 

The dates came highly recommended by our lovable and knowledgeable server. Be warned that service here is hot and cold: the hostess was annoying with a side of pretentious, but our server was warm with a dash of precious. She was also dead right - those dates are a winner. Really, really, really good. A must order. Same thing goes for the patatas bravas. Just get in there and mix and mash it all together. Perfect bites of crunchy, tangy, gooey garlicky greatness.

It's wonderful Spanish tapas made with quality ingredients. They didn't compromise anything this time. Every plate was fabulous - simple ingredients melded to make bold flavours.",2013-08-02 15:20:53

The atmosphere is very modern and perfect for downtown Madison. Pizza is one of my favorite foods too. I've been here twice and this review is mostly in regards to my last visit (yesterday, a Monday night). The specials and happy hours are decent and unique to the restaurant. If you plan to eat here take a look at the daily specials/happy hour before you come.

Pizza - My BF and I decided to split a steel pan pizza prior to attending a concert at the Majestic. We ordered the Pepperoni & Onion pizza. The pizza came out hot, on a round pan. The best part of the pie was the caramelized cheese crust surrounding the outside of the pizza. We both agreed the sauce was over the top. To me it tasted more like spaghetti sauce not a pizza sauce. It had sauce in between the cheese and crust then poured overtop. I ended up scraping the extra sauce off the pizza. I think the pizza would be much better with less sauce, and more of a basic sauce. It over powered the pizza. 

The serving size was plenty for 2 people I was full off of 1 1/2 slices. We had two slices left over that we could have taken home but since we were attending a concert after we opted to not take the leftovers. 

Drinks - Monday's special was 50% off any craft cocktail that starts with a letter M. Our server stopped right away to take our drink orders and mentioned the special. Asked if we wanted mojitos, Moscow Mules, and one other drink. I opted for a mojito, and my BF ordered a beer. Drinks were served quickly. My mojito was not good at all, tasted like it was a premixed drink, with a sprig of mint as a garnish. The mint was not muddled at the bottom. Disappointing to say the least, at least the presentation was nice? My 2nd drink I opted for the Mule and that was very tasty. 

Lastly - The server was very nice and quick with getting us our bill as we mentioned we had a show to see. When the bill arrived I about fell out of my chair the bill was $75!!! We only ordered a pizza $19, a beer $10($), and two cocktails that were $9 & $10 but 50% off.. After looking over the bill we noticed an extra pizza and another food item was added. We brought that up with our server who corrected the issue.",2018-04-24 15:24:56

I went to Salty like years before to start my cinco night out with a goal of sipping a refreshing margarita, unlike years before, the patio didn't seem that crowded (maybe it's a larger location?). My friend and I went to the main bar, and proceeded to wait patiently for the bartender to take our drink order. It was busy with more than 4 bartenders serving customers along with the manager, my friend and I were able to secure two bar stools, and we waited. There was a group of people to the left of me who got a drink order in even though they had been waiting shorter than us but I ignored it thinking she (the bartender) was just busy and hadn't noticed us, mind you we were sitting in front of where she was working. I remember a group of guys who were standing behind us asked if we were closing out because we had our cards ready but we said no and said we were waiting. 20 minutes had passed and still no margarita, so, we waited more, yes, I could see she was busy but I also noticed she was talking with the guys sitting to the right of us, and she was talking with a colleague at the cashier but for some odd reason when it came to us two sitting IN FRONT of her line of vision, she chose to ignore us, yet again stayed patient because that's how I am, I only get angry when I am being blatantly ignored BUT when the guys standing behind us moved to standing to the left of me, and SHE asked for their order, that was it, I had enough! So, I did what any annoyed customer did, I yelled a HEY! to her to get her attention (prior to that I took her picture), she then turned around (surprise surprise, apparently you need to show displeasure to get service here), and snapped back with, I don't serve people who swear at me! EXCUSE ME?!? when did saying ""HEY"" come off as swearing? And that was the last straw, I couldn't foresee myself staying there for a drink. 

I asked for the manager as any customer would and I shared my displeasure with the lack of service I received. Yes, he offered a drink BUT that's not good enough, I refused because I just couldn't see myself spending money. So, imagine this Salty Senorita, afterwards my friend and I went to El Hefe and got ourselves a margarita, then afterwards we were looking to have dinner and proceeded across the street to Hi-Fi, and ordered food and more drinks, when our intention that evening was to go to Salty Senorita, grab a drink or two and have dinner. We spent close to $80 that could have been spent at your establishment but because of the discourteous service of a bartender who lacked the attention of scanning the bar as well as to check who needed orders and such, you lost a few customers. Now, that's sad.",2014-05-06 17:48:23

Yes, they are slightly pricier than your average cone at DQ or other ice cream shop, but when you are investing in your health isn't the extra couple of dollars worth it?? When food is cheap it means it is made from cheap, low-quality ingredients that do nothing to benefit your health. To the people complaining of the price - it's the same as saying you are annoyed a fresh, folly-loaded salad is $10 but you can get a McDouble for $2 - duh. Remember, you get what you pay for. Dairy, sugar, artifical flavouring and preservatives are cheap bc they are terrible for you. These guys are using wholesome healthy foods and quality comes at a price.

I have walked passed this place many times over the years but it never really caught my attention. From the outside, it is small and obscure but once you step in, it is ever so inviting. It's warm, cozy and rustic inside. The seats are comfortably laid out with plenty of space between you and your neighbours and the vibe of the space is cool and calm.

Aside from atmosphere the food is spectacular and service is courteous and on point. Anything from salads, proteins to seafood, each dish is delicately prepared with care and attention to details to ensure you get a well balanced experience one bite at a time. Each little dish is completed and complimented with various combinations of flavours and textures; crispiness with silkiness, fattiness with acidity, earthiness with herbs...etc. Everything was great with maybe the exception of the octopus but that's a personal preference. I find it a bit too tender the flesh seems to fall apart a bit -- which is quite an unfamiliar texture one would expect from octopus.

I was also pleasantly surprised at how affordable the meal was and the portion sizes. You do get more bang for your buck.

I am definitely disappointed and little sore that you reviewers cheated me. I tried the rolls and, like most places, they cover their rolls with so much junk, you really can't even taste the fish. It taste like rice with a heap of seasoning and spices. I even ordered 2 nigiris and there is nothing to rave about. 

I'm not a sushi snob, wait... Okay, I am a sushi snob, but granted where I'm from the sushi is fresh and always delicious. Now, I'm not trying to compare apples with oranges... but Cleveland doesn't really have good sushi places.

I've been to several in different states and you receive the same world class service at each and every one.  As soon as I pulled up someone was there to open my door for me, told me where to go to check in and said they would give me my different options for parking or valet.  I had my dog with me and all of the staff came over to pet him or talk to him.  The girl at the front desk was very friendly and efficient, she got me checked in quickly and gave me a map with directions on how to get to my room and where everything was (the restaurant, fitness center, pools, parking, etc).  When I went to go back to my car the valets held the door open for me.

The parking and buildings were easy to find, there are building numbers on the gates outside so it's very simple finding your room and parking near to it.  The room itself was very nice as well.  The bathroom was good sized, there was a little area with a couple mirrors and a sink for getting ready, a mini fridge, flat screen tv, desk with a chair and my personal favorite part was the little patio.  There are these pretty french doors that open onto a decent sized patio with a couple chairs viewing the courtyard.  This was especially nice since I did have my dog with me so rather than having to walk him through the halls every time he needed to ""do his business"" I could just go out the back patio to the yard.

Room service was great as well, very prompt which surprised me at 7:30 on a Friday night but I probably only had to wait about 20 minutes.  The food was still hot and tasty when it got to me as well.  I was a little disappointed that the pizza oven wasn't working as I had wanted to try to the Margherita pizza but the cheeseburger with mozzarella was a yummy alternative.  The tiramisu was good as well, I liked how they served it in a little chocolate cup.  For breakfast I planned ahead and used the door card where you fill out your selections the night before and what time you want it served and then you can just wake up to breakfast rather than having to call and order.  I decided on the continental breakfast and chose the assortment of pastries, orange juice and coffee.  That ended up being a delicious flaky croissant, two muffins and a side of fruit.  The coffee was excellent quality also.

I didn't want to leave but alas my stay-cation had to come to an end.  Checking out was as easy as checking in.

Seems everyone is advertising a gourmet burger. If it is a gourmet burger you can charge 3 to 4 dollars more. I looked up gourmet burger and read what three different people said. The one that made the most since was any burger that is more than hamburger, lettuce, tomato, cheese (American cheese which to me is plastic cheese), can be called a gourmet burger. Which does not mean it is any better tasting than a regular hamburger done right.
I don't remember the exact burger I ordered but I asked for it without a bun and no fries. They did what I thought was the right thing and said I could have a salad instead of the fries. Nice!! Most places will do this but want an extra dollar or more. Hats off to Red Robin. They sandwiched the burger between two pieces of lettuce that consisted of about three leafs each side. Again hats off to Red Robin I was impressed with the presentation. 
As they say two out of three aint bad. I am having a hard time putting a finger on it but the customer service could of been better and something abut the layout of the restaurant did not appeal to me. Price is another factor.

This hole-in-the-wall is nestled amongst the seedy massage parlors and stripper clothing stores. GPS led me right to it. They are opening a new location at Spring Mtn. and Rainbow this week, so try that one if you're looking for more ambiances. 

Korean food in Vegas is usually sub par and way over priced. This place was a complete surprise and a wonderful new experience. Not a place to take a first date, but a great place for home-style Korean and Hawaiian food. The menu said fusion, but the dishes were not really fused. Korean food was just like mom makes, and the Hawaiian food was just like I've had in Hawaii. Didn't see anything like Moco Kim-chee bap. 

My group of 5 enjoyed everything we ordered. Here is the breakdown:

Me - I ordered the Loco Moco. Although I've only had it at chain stores like L&L and Ono Hawaiian, I can say that Island Style's is hands down the BEST. The gravy is awesome. It is Loco Moco, so I'm definitely going to gain a few lbs from it, but it wasn't as heavy as the chain versions. Highly recommend. 

Wife - Soon Du Boo. Excellent. Just like the local spots in L.A. Very authentic. 

Daughter (6yrs old) - Spam and eggs. ""Yummeee!!"". If you like Spam and eggs, how can they get it wrong? 

Sister - Curry lover say the curry is as close to home made as she's had. She is so picky that she doesn't even like Curry House. 

Mom - Madu Guk. Even my mom was impressed with the taste. She said it tasted really homemade. 

Overall a wonderful place to stop to get a great meal that tastes very authentic.  Husband is from Hawaii, and the wife id Korean, so they really know what they're doing. The fact that the menu had both styles made me real nervous, but the tastes were not sacrificed in any way. The hospitably was top notch. Both the husband and wife were super friendly and overly generous with the side dishes, tea, boiled peanuts, and even gave a dish of fried wontons for us to sample. The kim-chee was super authentic and the pickled cucumber was awesome. As soon as we got close to finishing a dish, they brought out another heaping dish.

They're only open late-ish, but they're super-friendly, local and, do I really need to go on? I can't say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it's a hell-a-va lot better than chain-imo's and greasy hut. Plus you get the warm fuzzies of supporting local business. 

I would stay away from the salad. It's huge, don't get me wrong, but it's a whole lot of what you don't want. For one, I don't like 3lbs of cheese on my salad and it's got to be fresh. And trust me, this thing weighs 3lbs. Also, lose the canned mushrooms. Is it really that much more expensive to have fresh ones? I can't handle those rubbery, soggy things on my 'zza.

yxOBgIRa5b82-8IwOumLgw,cIbbfJEGLB3B-c8Po4AL5g,ap2yPjW2fsAOXkVeiE8STQ,4,49,14,14,"I was one of those college transfer students who spent two years at Ryerson after doing a three year International Business Admin diploma program at Seneca College in order to get my BCom.  The quality of education varied from top notch to very poor.  Ironically, some of my worst professors were also the more educated academics, which goes to show that a greater education doesn't equate to better teaching ability.

My favorite classes were some of the elective courses.  A couple that stood out were ""The Geography of Food"" and ""The History of Modern Propaganda"".  Both were very interesting.

The stigma of Rye High appears to be more significant amongst other students (UofT students love to show school spirit by putting us Rye folk down).  And to all you UofT students -- I got into your school but chose to go to Seneca College.  How do you feel about that?!?!  In the working world, I've never been discriminated because I went to Ryerson.  In fact, I was chosen over 250+ other students in Canada for with first job out of university (a Department of Foreign Affairs internship overseas).  There goes that theory.

Furthermore, Ryerson's MBA program is really beginning to gain recognition -- competing, placing, and winning a number of MBA competitions in Canada.  The rise of the MBA program is also changing the face of the professors (not sure if its a good thing).  They're focusing on hiring more academics now rather than the traditional experienced industry types.  I hope they maintain a balance of both.  An interesting study just came out profiling MBA grads, and they match up to all the other major GTA schools in terms of starting salary: http://www.ryerson.ca/mba/news/General_Public/Salary_Stats_2009.html

My biggest problem with the school is that it's essentially a commuter school.  It's in a great location being in the heart of Toronto, but students simply come to school and retreat back to the suburbs.  I guess it lacks school spirit or loyalty.  You're sort of an outcast amongst other outcasts.

If you want a more hands-on practical education and go to a school where the professors actually know your face and name, Ryerson is the way to go.

1) Food is SO GOOD - the Quinoa Apple Salad with Avocado is one of my new favourite things. A good portion for only $5?! Best deal ever. I also split an order of onion rings and despite what a previous reviewer said, we loved them. They were sweet and sticky and hit the spot just right.

2) Good Vibe - Yeah it's loud, but sometimes that's exactly what I want. I love that this place plays music videos on all their screens, some of which were total throwbacks to the 2000s that made my night. The vibe was youthful and party-like, just full of great energy and good service. 

However, when it comes to cocktails, SKIP THEM ENTIRELY! We tried three different ones and they all were disgusting and pricey--yes, this includes the margaritas.

It ain't no average night, first night out in A-Z,

We got it going on, from the west to the east
Our team is now complete, and so unique
We yelp with passion like we are possessed
Reading the menu, sushi's good but not the best
""One of these yes oh please."" to the waitress I screamed
Write it down but takes a while, still she could waitress the A-team
Our group was, one of many that she had served
Refilling and chilling so big tips she would deserve
The sushi was decent, even with Fritos poured on
The edamame that we got was so soft and warm
But the real story that you should find in a book
Was the private karaoke room, and boy it could cook
Dropping my beats left a stain on my brain

Stop that train, I wanna' get off

The atmosphere is definitely one of the things that keeps me coming back to this place: great music, hip crowd, and awesome furnitures.  Only downside is that it can get really crowded; at least they have a patio with plenty of seating for those warm summer nights.

Aside from the ambiance, the drinks are also that damn good!  Perhaps one of the better Sazeracs I've had in town.  Heard they even have a seasonal menu offering interesting concoctions with all being eight dollars; watch out for special cocktails served on events such as First Friday!!  Can't decide on what to drink?! Leave it off to their skilled mixologists since they really do know what they're doing.  Craft beer selection is also great if you're not the liqour type.

I've walked past The Crepe numerous times, but decided to give it a shot for a dessert option after dinner with a friend. The restaurant is located in the Market Place of Tivoli Village. It really reminds me of a beatnik coffee shop, complete with people painting and live music (at least on the night I was there).

The menu is comprised of sweet and savory options. Honestly, the menu was much more diverse and had more selection than I thought it would. Crepes are represented by country, so I had The Venezia ($10.90), which was an indulgent crepe with cannoli cream, black and white chocolate drizzles and chips, and a dollop of whipped cream. 

It was a yummy crepe and nice for dessert. However, the pricing is putting me off from returning. Perhaps if I'm in the area I may try a ""savory"" crepe next time.

I took a date here after work on Friday.  I knew this place was usually pretty busy so I made sure to grab a reservation on OpenTable just to be sure.  The restaurant is on the east end of a super busy shopping and dining complex on Indian School Road.  Tonight we had to park almost two blocks away the area was so busy.  The restaurant itself has a modern interior and feels very open and roomy without being cavernous. They have a decent sized patio out front as well, though we opted for inside tonight since its starting to get toasty outside.

We skipped the appetizer menu this time, but I do highly recommend the grits and sausage appetizer.  The grits are super creamy and the sausage is locally sourced through Schreiner's in Phoenix and adds a nice kick.  Opens up your taste buds immediately.  The last time I was here I had the cast iron chicken dish with biscuit and bacon stuffing which was excellent.  Tonight I went for arguably their most signature dish.  Their short ribs.  Wow, talk about tender.  They slow cook it all day and serve it with a red wine reduction.  The meat practically melts in your mouth.  The waiter also highly recommended we try a side of their bacon cheddar biscuits.  You catch the bacon and cheese notes in the biscuits immediately, but the real star of this side is the apple butter they serve it with.  That butter would taste good on almost anything.  For dessert, I've had their famous chocolate bacon dipped s'mores before (a must try if you're a first timer), but tonight we decided to try their homemade fig and pecan pie.  Admittedly, I'm not a pecan pie fan, but this was nothing like any pecan pie you've seen or tasted.  You really taste the figs more than the pecans as the pecans are essentially grinded down into smaller pieces.  But what makes this dessert is the ice cream they serve it with.  Its a mix of cream cheese, vanilla and lemon zest that immediately catches you by surprise.  Complements the pie slice very well.

Altogether, two glasses of wine, two short rib entrees, an order of bacon cheddar biscuits, the pie, plus the tip, set us back about $95.  The short rib dish is pretty much the most expensive entree on their menu which pushed the price higher.  Sooo worth it, but the rest of their entrees are cheaper.  One thing I have to especially compliment them on is the speed with which we were served with each course.  Even on a busy night like tonight, we never had to wait long for any of our food and our waiter was very attentive without being intrusive.

If you want to try this place out for a little cheaper, Beckett's is a regular participant in Arizona Restaurant Week.  For $30/person you can have a three course meal here including a free glass of wine during the Restaurant Week promotion.  As I said it can get busy for dinner so I would recommend using OpenTable or just calling in a reservation just to be sure.

Will absolutely be back here again at some point.  And I'm very much looking forward to trying Justin Beckett's newest restaurant concept on 3rd Ave and Camelback in Phoenix called Southern Rail when it opens in mid 2014.",2014-04-12 14:33:31

I was craving Korean food but didn't want to haul my butt all the way to Las Vegas since I live in Henderson.  (Next time, I will!)  I recall eating at Jun's Korean Restaurant a year ago and the bulgogi and spicy squid were decent.  Since my mom wanted to eat some spicy squid too but didn't want to dine out, I decided to order ""Take Out"" -- which was a HUGE mistake!  So, I ordered bulgogi for my son, spicy squid for mom and spicy soft tofu soup with beef for moi.  

When I ordered over the phone, the lady never took my name.  I thought that was odd so I said, ""Don't you need my name?""  She said, ""That's ok. We have your phone number"" -- Caller ID, I suppose that's what she meant.  When I got there, there was only 1 customer in the store.   I went up to the counter and said I have a ""to go order.""  I literally repeated my whole order to her since she had a blank look on her face.  Suddenly, the light bulb went off and she reached out to two bags and gave me the total amount to pay...$30+.  Since the place was pretty dead and there were only one other togo bag, I made the mistake of NOT DOUBLE CHECKING my order, tipped her a couple of bucks and left.  

When I got to Mom's, you can only imagine how baffled I was to find ""Spicy pork saute with kimchee and tofu"".  Huh?!  Where's the squid?!  I was pissed 'cause I was so looking forward to that for Mom so I made a phone call to Jun's.  The same lady answered the phone and she basically argued with me that I ordered the kimchee pork and she knows nothing about the squid. Wow!  She didn't even apologize or try to make amends -- and I knew I was wasting my time so I just hung up.  Mom was disappointed but we gave the ""new"" dish a try since we were hungry.  If you like pork and kimchee, I guess you'll like the dish.  We just prefer our kimchee as a ""side"" dish -- not an entree, thank you very much.  

Sad to say, the soup was horrible!  It was bland... it tasted like kim chee water ... not kidding!  The tofu was the only thing that was edible.  The menu said ""soft tofu with beef and vegetable"" ... um,... ""Where's the Beef?!""  The better description would be: ""soft tofu with a strand of beef and kim chee and we just pour water over the kim chee and call it soup"".  To make the night worse, after my 3rd bite, I looked closer and WTF?!!  Am I seeing a strand of hair?!  (YEP!  It sure is!  GROSS!!!!!!)  I was no longer hungry and decided that I'll boycott this place!    

Needless to say, Mom and I were sadly disappointed by Jun's.  The One Star given is because my son ate the bulgogi.  I asked him if he enjoyed the dish and he said, ""There's no hair in mine.  It's definitely better than yours and grandma's!""  Haha!  He's a funny kid!

I guess there'll be NO ""next time"" here.  If I have a craving for Korean food in the future, I'll make the drive to Spring Mountain.  This experience totally ruined it for me!  Sorry Jun!",2012-03-22 03:39:53

From the first phone call I made, to when I walked out the door the staff made my visit easy and comfortable. 

I was offered paperwork e-mailed to me ahead of time, I was offered an option an appointment days and times, the receptionist was friendly on the phone and very kind upon my arrival. My future appointments were set up quickly, and even though my appointment time seem to be at 'rush hour' you would never have known.

The main physical therapist taking care of me is Kevin Thomason. He takes his time and listens to what I have to say about my recent injury and was careful about what I could do and not do during the appointment and afterward at home. Kevin is personable and explains exactly how he relates to injuries having had injuries himself. So he knows exactly what you're going through. 

He always told me what to expect during the appointment and after I left, he informed me who would be seeing me on one of the days I was scheduled but he was off work.

I guess if I have an off comment to make it would be that the front desk is a bit tall. I know that sounds a little weird, but doing businesslike payments and paperwork across the desk so high made me feel awkward.

I was impressed by the fact that the toppings were in bins that had a magnet to keep them open while you scooped the toppings.  A small thing, but very well thought out.

I had the side patio all to myself.  It just made the stop at Menchie's a very enjoyable one.  This was my first visit to a Menchie's and it was super!    I'll be back.

Come here for darts!  Come Here for English Pub Ales on Tap!  Come here for Soccer matches!  Come here for a  Scotch Egg!  You can even come for an English Breakfast or Sunday Dinner...they will both suffice, but I can't truly rave about either.  And you can certainly come with friends for a good time!

The food is solid (Fish & Chips / Pub Style Curry...and I'll mention the Scotch Egg yet again!) but not worth coming here for by itself.  The Beer is mostly English & Irish Favorites...more than the average pub, but not everything a beer snob is looking for...again not a sole reason for the average Joe to come here.

Everything here was really good, the food definitely fits the ambiance and the excellent level of service. The sides, the appetizers, and the entrees are all excellent. I'm pretty sure the sides are huge as well. The only strong memory I remember from Ocean Club is my halibut entree, which is somewhat unfortunately. While the grilling was spot on, for some reason I found my fillet lacked flavor, whether that be from the fish or the lack of seasoning I have no idea.

Lately it's been the latter of the two unfortunately. Going here for food wasn't bad. In fact, it was delish, but going here and experiencing the night life has not been awesome as it once was. While it is in part due to the people that go here - a bunch of douchey guys and the girls that go with them (it is Old Town) - I can deal with them cause mixed in there are some cool people. What I can't deal with are some of the people working there, starting with the door guys who seem to relish the power and enjoy letting people know it. And if they weren't bad enough, let's get into the bartenders. 

I've known some bartenders and I did the whole bar tending thing and no where in all that I learned and know, did they mention giving people crap service. I get it, you're busy and you get slammed, but you get through it and they should want to take and make as many drinks as they can rather than being all selective and choosing certain people over others. I'm sorry, I don't want to swoon over the bartenders, I just want my drink. And, when they finally decide to deign me with their presence and place my order, they get it wrong. And trying to flag them back over after they hand you your bill to point out the mistake wasn't even worth trying since trying to get their attention the first time too a bit of work. 

The servers were all right; haven't had anyone exceptional to rave or rant about. The music is usually pretty awesome. And as I've said, there are some pretty awesome people worth going back for, as well as their food. I do enjoy their happy hour menu.

The Ahi poki starter was fine, although spicy enough to drown out the side portion of Tobiko caviar, which was a shame. The Sunrise at Haleakala role - a delectable sounding roll of salmon, aji, hamachi, and asparagus, was a disappointment due poor ""tempura"" frying of the whole roll. The batter was more like a fish fillet batter than a tempura, and too greasy. The overwhelming taste was fried batter, not fish. The scallops encrusted in foie gras were ok, but not the standouts for which I had hoped. The accompanying blackberry plum reduction was too fruity and sweet to complement the scallops. The dish included 5 giant scallops - I would have preferred fewer and better. 

Service started out almost oppressively attentive and dwindled to virtually nothing (except water refills) by dessert. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up so we could ask for the check. The server was stumped by my question about if they have a chardonnay that is not oaky. He pointed out that one that was ""buttery but not oaky""... hmmm, he needs a wine 101 lesson. And of course described the ""artesian"" vanilla ice cream. Again hmmm...can't say I've ever seen vanilla ice cream spurting from the ground under pressure.

A well check every six months is one thing, but more routine visits and questions about my new pup is quite another.  A tiny tick found on the new pup several days after we rescued her (and during the holiday madness) sealed the deal.  I needed a change and fast... I searched Yelp and made a few phone calls to see how quickly we could get an appointment.  

Ingleside for the win!  I scored a same day appointment and met Dr. Chiles later that afternoon.  I was super pleased with my 5 minute commute, and even more pleased upon entering the building.  It was clean and the front desk staff were friendly.  Dr. Chiles (and all of the techs we've met since) were super attentive and made sure to answer all of my questions and explain everything they were doing in detail.

I went back for a follow-up this evening, as my sweet little lady wasn't 100%, and sure enough, she has Giardia.  Once again, we saw Dr. Chiles and our tech this visit was Kim.  Both were personable to both me and Georgia.  I started Georgia's treatment and I'm hoping to do one follow-up and only visit Ingleside for well-checks moving forward, but even if we have to go more frequently, I'm just happy to know that we're in capable hands and that Ingleside is just a short commute from home.  

Even so, I'll take all the good dog karma I can get... feel free to send it my way (Georgia and Minnie thank you!)

You choose a bun, ""meat"" (they have lots of meats, but also salmon, veggie patty and portabello mushroom), cheese, toppings and sauce.  They also provide a side with the meal, which is really nice.

I had the portabello mushroom  in a whole wheat bun with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, avocado (slight upcharge) and BBQ sauce, and it was delicious!  Feel free to get exactly the same thing - you'll be glad you did.

My husband ordered the veggie burger with buffalo sauce, goat cheese, pickles and some other veggies.  I stole a bite, so I can tell you the veggie patty was clearly homemade and very smooth and flavorful.  I got the skinny fries (good but not outstanding), but my husband's sweet potato fries were really tasty (I swear I let him eat most of his meal).  

Our friends really enjoyed their meal, too.  They took advantage of the gluten free bun option (so great to have that available) and chose  zucchini fries, which were thick and soft in the middle with crunchy breading - pretty interesting and tasty.

Isn't bourgignon AND shepherd's pie supposed to be more like a stew at the bottom?  It seems like mine was over reduced, I ended up with mash with chunks of meat and a few carrots that tasted like burnt sauce.  The potato topping had 2 whole cubes of potato in it, which I'm thinking weren't supposed to be there.  

We also got the mac and cheese with and without pancetta - it was kind of bland.  Not very cheesy, not very much of anything really..  

The fork tender spare ribs were tasty but I've had better.  The pork chile stew was actually pretty good but the taste was a bit strong.  It had the same taste as chipotle steak - maybe its cumin?  The corn bread that accompanied was unlike any I've ever had..  it was airy, not dense, but kind of dry at the same time with a crunchy crust - maybe too much butter?  I love corn bread and I did not like what they did to it..

The desert was interesting - we got the bacon smores.  The bacon was way too salty, or maybe it needed a couple more dips in the chocolate to offset it better but the saltiness overpowered anything else.  The quality of the bacon seemed good, maybe they can get a reduced sodium version?  The death by chocolate was good, but it was very chocolatey - I do not recommend it if you don't like fudge dipped in chocolate on chocolate ice cream.  The one thing about the plating..  the lil smear of thick chocolate sauce (mousse?) does not add to the attractiveness whatsoever..

The service was great and I love the decor.  That being said, the portions are small for the pricing and the food is not very good.  Don't try to be fancy if you can't do it well.",2011-08-24 16:20:49

How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good. 

A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately. 

For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal. 

We started out with the Roti Telur. ""Pancake"" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!

My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce. 

I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate. 

Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy! 

The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department. 

Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon. Cheers!",2012-05-28 02:28:35

That's my story with Fuego Tacos.  

Two years ago I wrote about the awesome spicy veggie tacos at this joint.  Man, they were good!!!  Despite numerous trips back to Phoenix since that time, I was never able to make it back to Fuego despite that craving for the tacos.  Lo and behold, I finally get an opportunity to go back and now I wish I hadn't.

I was suspicious that something had changed because the menu descibed the tacos as being housed in a crispy shell.  That's not at all what I remembered.  I recalled a melange of hot, spicy veggies cased in a warm corn tortilla.  I even asked the waitress who haughtily informed me that the veggie tacos had always come in a hard shell.  Hmmm.... that should have been my clue.  I figured maybe the shell won't make a big difference.  Wrong.  What I received instead was cold cabbage and other unrecognizable cold ""stuff"" jammed into a taco shell with shredded cheese on top.  Not the least bit appetizing and not at all what I remembered!  I was extremely disappointed.

On my 1st visit, my tech was a man who had a thumb nail missing on his right hand (sorry, I didn't get his name). The pedicure was good and the massage that went with it had just the right amount of pressure. Now to my hands. He was very particular on how my elbows were positioned. He kept repositioning them. I found that odd and annoying. 

My 2nd visit was with Tricia (if I was solely basing my rating on her, I would have given it 5 stars). She was very good. She worked quickly and seemed to be quite the perfectionist. My nails with her lasted almost 5 weeks without a single lift, even with painting the house and doing some spring cleaning. 

For my 3rd visit, I called and asked for Tricia, but she was off. What nail tech takes Sunday off? (Well, good for her) So, I walked in and hoped for the best. I ended  up with Ivy. She has a permanent pleasant 'smile' on her face. The massage part of the pedicure was weak and my nails were thicker than I like, but the experience was still a good one.

The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup!

They have countless assortments of coffee too.  You can also buy bulk cheese and they will slice it to your liking.  They have homemade tortilla chips that are awesome!! Great prices for quality and service.  The employees are generally smiling and always willing to help!

I stroll up Central Avenue soft breeze in my face sun kissed all the way and I pass a couple friends returning from where I'm heading, Food Truck Friday, oh yeah!

The Jamburrito truck had the longest line of the fleet which only made my cravings for Cajun much-more stronger. I was torn between the chicken jambalaya bowl and the fried catfish jamburritto. The guy ahead of me in line was raving about the catfish and that was all the indirect intervention I needed to make my decision. The fried catfish jamburrito is a girthy handful and loaded with chunks of freshly fried catfish, jambalaya rice, Cajun tartar, black bean salsa, shredded jack cheese and shredded lettuce.

Have you ever gone into a place and ordered and just get this bad feeling? Yeah...that's about every time I go into here. 

The place is never clean. Which kind of makes it feel like an authentic Tijuana taco shop. Honestly. It's always the bare minimum of clean....Which is kind of expected with a 24 hour place. But, maybe closing for a few hours on a slow night for a deep cleaning would help.

So, I always get a kind of feeling that I'm gambling with my stomach but the first couple of times, it was actually pretty decent after I finished eating.

I usually get carne asada fries. I mean...throughout my life, carne fries. Years and years in San Diego and SoCal and this has always been my go-to. I've gotten it here and it's surprisingly one of the better versions. I say surprisingly because just about every taco place I've been to in Vegas is kind of disappointing. Even the upper scale taco shops. But, this one makes it exactly the way I like...loaded!!! Loaded with piles of everything. It's a meal! 

But, this last time I got my alternate go-to because I wanted something a little smaller. California burrito with guacamole added ( because apparently guacamole isn't included ), which is basically a carne fries in a burrito. $7.50

It took an unusual amount of time and it wasn't that busy so I started getting an uneasy feeling. The cooks were talking a lot with each other and I don't like that happening when I'm waiting for an order especially if it's taking awhile. There were a couple of customers and a strange air filled the place. I noticed everyone waiting started looking over at why their orders was taking so long. A bad sign.

About an hour after eating, I started getting stomach cramps and now at 4am, I'm waking up with stomach pains. Not sure what else it could be because that was the only thing I ate all day. 

I may still give the place another chance but it will not be a priority for me. The lack of cleanliness alone is usually enough for me to find other places.",2016-11-20 12:42:40

Lastly we finished off with desserts - Boca negra and dobos torte - BOTH AMAZING. Yes we ordered two desserts. We were on vacation. So neener neener. Back to the desserts - both were amazing.

We were a little confused considering the restaurant opened at 9 and they were not super busy. After she finally came to the table she gave one menu. It took another 10 minutes for her to come back and we ordered our food and drinks. After waiting for a total of one hour we asked how much longer? She responded I don't know. We replied can you check? She said sure. After she came back she said there were 5 tables ahead of us and she had no idea how long it was going to take because they were large parties. We responded ok well 30 minutes and hour? She replied I don't know. We asked for the check because we were hangry af! When we got the bill they charged for our food and drink even though they hadn't even started making our food. My boyfriend said ummmm we aren't paying for the food. Then another lady came over and said we are really busy on Saturday and Sunday and we have a small kitchen. Moreover, we can only handle two orders at a time. We said ok well we want to leave.

I add cheese and get it on white bread. Yes yes...I know, you hardcore deli people, that you're supposed to get it on rye, but I'm just not that kind of gal. Anyways... 

One Las Vegas trip with the parents, I was waiting for them to come back to room from gambling for dinner. They never showed up so eventually I made my way downstairs searching for a restaurant and found myself in front of Canter's. Whenever I am famish, I can't settle for something new. I have to get something I know I like. Since I already have been to the one in Los Angeles, I was ecstatic they had one at my hotel. Then I noticed the menu was a lot smaller than the original location. I have only had the French dip. OH NO!!! After 10 minutes of reading the menu (more like staring at the menu), I decided to take a chance and eat something new in my state of hunger. 

This is how my relationship with the Canter's corned beef sandwich began. When I got my order, I couldn't believe how good it was. My favorite part was the coleslaw in the sandwich-so sweet, so delicious. A few minutes later, I found myself finished. I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing by myself. IT WAS HUGE!!! 

I eventually came back to this Canter's and found myself ordering another one. Supposedly food taste better when you're starving, but this sandwich is just as good as when you're just moderately hungry. 

I would of gave it 5 stars, but I'll save it until they add more items from the the original location to the menu. I love the bakery in the one in Los Angeles. I can't get enough of their chocolate cheesecake. 

As for now, I would recommend Canter's to anyone looking for a quick place to get a sandwich. You order your food at the cashier, pay for it and then wait at your table. It will not disappoint. 

Random side note: Don't forget to ask for a side of Thousand Island Dressing. It totally adds to a corned beef sandwich. Also, the Lox and Bagel is good too. HUGE SERVING!!! Also, yummy cream cheese.",2009-02-01 18:05:03

Eric R. was pleased with unlimited toppings at a flat rate ($8.95).  They eventually will have wheat and gluten-free dough but today was just the regular.

I got the spicy diavolo sauce (tasted it first - whew nice and spicy!) and a combo of mozzarella and jack cheese.  Then, the only non-pork protein option: chicken.  My veggies...basil, roasted red peppers, artichokes, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, jalepenos, sundried tomato oil....I think that is it :)  After it came out of the oven, they zinged it with cilantro.

It was pretty quick, with a charred crust and 4 big slices.  It theoretically could be 8.  I ate 5/8ths of the pizza before saving the rest for my lunch tomorrow.  Eric R. enjoyed his pizza and saved some too.  It is quite filling!  He was happy with sample breadsticks at the cash register before we got our pies.  While eating we ran into friends who happen to live near the restaurant.  The owner came around and gave us a charred pizza dough roll stuffed with marshmallows and nutella for a free dessert sample - and it was like s'mores!!!  MMM!

 I already had a membership at LVAC and I personally enjoy lifting weights on my own but I immediately fell in love with the class aspect and having someone telling you what to do was a really nice change of pace for me. I was in a rut at the gym and right around New Years they had a 14month for 399 deal and I bought the year knowing I would absolutely get my moneys worth!

 I frequent Liz and Martins classes the most. However, the schedule has changed 3 times since I joined and I am a creature of habit and frequently go at the same time every day. The first schedule change they canceled my absolute favorite class (Kettlebell & battleropes). I consider myself to be very athletic and that class challenged me mentally and physically EVERY TIME! Needless to say, I was super sad, but okay, it's just one day a week. 

The next major change to the schedule moved all of my favorite classes to ~1hr later in the morning. That made things a little harder, but I loved my instructors so I was willing to go with the flow. 

I have to say I have had 3 separate very frustrating run-ins with one of the owners there, Luke. Something must have happened because I no longer see him there and the other owner is fantastic and extremely approachable. Regardless, the instructors kept bringing me back even after those confrontations and it is the single best thing they have going for them. Liz&Martin are fantastic. 

Aside from the fabulous instructors their studio is super modern and they have lockers for you to use when you are there. The showers are so convenient with shampoo, body wash, and conditioner.",2014-04-11 03:51:29

The goat cheese, oil and other seasonings that come with each piece of juicy watermelon is absolutely heavenly.  The tuna deviled eggs were good but we both felt needed some kind of cracker to put it on.  My friend was starving by the time we got there and added the kimchi fried rice to our order as our terrific server was walking away.  I enjoyed that was well.  Talk about a spectrum of flavors just for the apps!!

For entrees, I got the crispy pork belly which was the biggest portion of pork belly I'd ever had.  The fatty juiciness of the meat itself really complemented the crispy and crusty exterior.  But what really blew us away was my friend's duck dish.  Perfectly sliced pieces of duck topped with Kix cereal.  Why Kix?  Why not!  One of the best duck entrees I've ever had.  I already know I am getting that on a future visit. 

They had a great cocktail menu.  Our server was explaining how she was in experimenting with a cocktail containing siracha that she wasn't ready to unleash yet .  Maybe I'll try to make it a happy hour request.

First off, I have to remove my hat before entering the dining room? Sure, forgot it was 1956. Oh, look at how the wait staff is dressed... like they are in 1956 working on a plantation in the south. Next the hostess pulled the table out of the booth so we could get in.... pulled it ALL the way out. I guess if I was in my 70s with bad hips, that would be a blessing (though, they didn't pull it when I was leaving). There was a lot of dishes dropping during our dinner. At least 3 separate things within the first 15 minutes.

I had the prime rib lawreys cut. It was good, but nothing that stood out compared to prime rib at any other restaurant. The salad was pretty good. I think they deep fry their croutons.

Second, the parking is horrible at night, esp. the weekend.  Third, there might be a wait at dinner time.  The wait is...Krazy long.

No polish for him and gel for me.   They do a great job at accommodating both men and woman. My gel pedicures have lasted the longest 4 weeks.  I strongly recommend gel to everyone vs regular polish. One reason... When you leave your nails are completely dry!  Well worth the up charge not to ruin your polish as soon as you walk out the door.  I always recommend an appointment but they do take walk ins.  They have a variety of options for scrubs and services for pedicures.  I appreciate the fact they open a new packet of tools for each customer.  Place is clean.  Everyone is very nice and prices are very reasonable.  They do offer you water but I wish it was wine.  Lol.

Anywho, the big gripe on yelp is the price of the food. Yeah, it is a little steep (nothing crazy), but maybe these people forgot that they were at one of the premier casinos on the middle of the Strip in a little town called Las Vegas - which is not exactly where you go for bargains on food. That aside, I was not overly impressed with the food, but it was solid and the ingredients were quality. The menu is crazy-extensive, so there are many dishes to come back to - if you can get past the price point. The atmosphere is really impressive, but a bit sterile. (The gold fish are awesome.) I read multiple problems with the service, but I did not have any problems on my visit - I was seated promptly and the service was attentive. Will I go back? With a Chinatown's worth of options a mere few miles away, probably not. Yet, if I was on the Strip and had a taste for Chinese, sure.",2013-10-23 19:57:20

It's that good.  Been going here for years and have pretty much had everything on the menu and there is NOTHING I wouldn't order again! That good. Service is always superb (well, we had one visit when it was subpar but Monika the General Manager showed how much customer service means to them and took care of things for us! She's amazing!). 

Starters for us always include the spicy bean dip or the lentil and corn beignets. Amazing. The greeny curry sauce for the beignets is the perfect complement to a superb dish! The conch fritters are not something you see elsewhere in the Burgh and worth a try! Entrees are spectacular and range from  crispy fish tacos with cabbage slaw (Highly recommended!) to jerk pulled pork quesadillas with that yummy jerked flavor, to specials like barramundi (which might have been the best fish dish I've had in years!) and skirt steak so tender it melts in your mouth.

And with all the burger talk in the city, don't sell Kaya short in that category! Oh no! The Kaya burger may be the best burger offering out there!! The juicy, perfectly cooked burger topped with fresh avocado, fried egg, Kaya sauce and whatever mystical ingredients they supplement it with is enough to make me dream of burgers! I've even ordered it for brunch! Yeah, I know - so good. The salmon eggs benedict for brunch is killer. KILLER! 

And let's talk about alcohol, shall we? Happy hour cocktails and beer are half off. Cocktails are imaginative and super tasty. And the draft beer selection is among the best around! Huge selection of craft beers that rotate frequently. May be in the top two happy hours I've ever been too.

And am I ever glad that I found that groupon! This location is in the Esplanade in Phoenix, and there were not many people down there when we went tonight around 7pm. This could either work in their favor, or against it. Could go either way at this point. But it was good for me because I hate waiting for tables and I hate crowded restaurants. Neither of which I had to deal with today. Got in right as we walked in the door, and there were only another 20 or so people in. 

We sit down and our waitress promptly takes our drink orders. I ordered tea that for some reason tasted like chap-stick. The waitress took it away and off of our bill. Thank you! I also ordered the Hawaiian punch, and HO-LY SHIT! That thing had so much alcohol in it, I am STILL recovering. Half way through the drink and I was pretty much buzzed. And $5 for all alcoholic drinks?? Yes please!

So I went with my mom, husband and sister. I got the vegetarian tacos which were really spicy and good. Next time I think though I will get them with the soft taco shells. I was not too crazy about the hard shells. And their beans are amazing!! Have I told you how much I love beans? I especially love vegetarian black beans, and an entire plate of them. SO GOOD! My husband got the baja fish tacos, mom got street tacos I think, and my sister another meat taco. All were happy with their choices. And even though it looks like not that much food, everyone except the half drunk me left food on their plates. They are really filling.

I always have trouble finding the food I need at Petco because they only stock 2 bags & when it's gone it's gone. This Petsmart had plenty on the shelf & more options I never knew the brands of food I buy even had. 

Huge selection of Science Diet, Nutro Ultra & Nature's Recipe. I have 3 sausage dogs, each with different needs & easily can buy their food in one visit instead of having to check back every few days at Petco for food they never seem to have on the shelf or in the back. 

Most Petsmart locations I've been to are so large it's easy to get lost looking for what you need OR overlook it altogether. I really liked this location. It was small like Petco but so underwhelming I found exactly what I needed & a few new items down the treat & rawhide aisles. 

This location isn't convenient but it's not too far from Silverado Ranch off the 215, and this shopping center is crazy busy on weekends.

The decor is uber casual. There are plenty of seats either at the high tops, bar or the couches in front of the TV. The staff is wonderful. Every employee we've encountered has come across as really happy to be here. And I really appreciate that when the drive thru gets backed up, they send out an employee to take the orders to make the line move faster.

You can find out pretty much everything you need to know on their website. Check it out because you may want some time to craft your perfect soda experience. Did you ever take Jelly Belly's and try and make different tastes? Well, this is the same thing with soda. Get creative and have a blast. But, if you want the hard work done for you, the great folks at The Soda Shop have already assembled a nice list of pre-concocted masterpieces for your consumption. (Try the Fruit NInja, C swears by it)

They have 4 drink sizes, 16 base soda's including Coke Zero and Sprite Zero. Crazy. But, I do take away points because they do not have Diet Rootbeer.

Then add flavors, Creams, Fruit slices, & Puree's. And yes, everything you add does cost a few cents but check this out. You can get a 32oz soda with 2 added flavors and it still only costs $ 2.17. Where can you beat that? And, if you're into the float experience, you can also add a scoop of custard for $1.49 so making a Blue Powerade Float for example is super easy. (Not that I would ever...)

Add one of their amazing cookies for $1.89 and for under 5 bones you'll have a great time, a totally custom soda and a super good cookie to boot.

The Soda Shop also offers Concrete's, Italian Soda's and Fresh Brewed Teas. So check this out. Have you ever gotten a ""large"" Tea at one of those fancy coffee places? Over 4 bucks. Here, a 44oz Tea is $2.29. It's amazing. And, really, really good tea. 

Like I said, C and I have been here a lot but this past week we brought K over for her first experience. At first she was a bit skeptical. ""A soda shop? Can't we just go through the Micky D's drive-thru?""  Well, suffice it to say that after she finished her first Soda Shop soda, she hasn't stopped talking about it. She loved the menu so much, she even ordered a second small to try some different flavors. She's truly hooked as will you be.

I'm born and raised in Vegas and have been coming to these games since they were the Las Vegas Stars and I've seen and had so many wonderful memories here. 

I bought tickets to last nights game for the ""final home stand"" at Cashman field before they move to the new Summerlin stadium. I bought tickets for my wife, son sister in law (pregnant) and her husband.  We were especially excited that they were giving away final year jerseys too with the 51's and Golden Knights logo on them.  We got a email from them stating that the jersey would be given away at 6.  Game start at 7.  

We get there 2.5 hrs before that in order to be ready for the lines.  Little did we know that they would have the Gun vs Hoses softball game and that all those people would have first pick at the jerseys so all jerseys were gone before 430.  

So here I am rambling about a free jersey. Blah blah blah. 

It gets better.  They run out of nachos, beer and lemonade in the 4th inning.  No biggie to me but my pregnant sister in law was in need of a lemonade as it's 100' out.  She goes to get one and they say sorry we are out.  She says ""can I have a glass of ice as I'm very thirsty"".  The guy charges a pregnant women $6 for a glass of ice?

I love the FISH TACOS entree & it comes w/ plantains & coconut yogurt dipping sauce.  You can also order the same fish tacos for the happy hour special, minus the plantains which are to me dessert!!  Similar to how my mom makes them.  The tacos have big chunks of lightly battered mahi mahi, lite pico de gallo & a chinook type mayo dressing.  I add Cholula of course.  It is like being in Hawaii to me.  

I was hooked on the STEAK SALAD for months cause of the tamarind dressing!  The slight sweetness it adds to the steak, potatoes & dressing makes me order extra dressing every time!  I love the Roma tomatoes w/ alil salt & pepper.  Also the dehydrated type of mushroom they use adds a wonderful touch.  I promise everything it comes w/ is well thought out w/ that dressing.  

Top two entrees.  I will Yelp about three other favorite entrees and apps soon since I visit there weekly.  One Vegan, but you can add meat.  Also desserts are in very large portions!!  They are absolutely rich & flavorful.  Love the presentation of all in the dinner menu.  

The HAPPY HOUR menu is so well worth it!  The Duo of Dips, believe it or not is incredible.  Now I only order it w/ only the two cheese dips.  Coconut shrimp is butterflied & served w/ a tropical dip that compliments it.  Also my friends & I were in love w/ the Pork Quesadillas w/ this amazing goat cheese.  

The wine selection such as the Raeburn is my go to Chardonnay.  I prefer the Dark N Stormy, a rum drink, to cocktails such as martini's & Mai Tai's.  They are all tasty such as the Coconut Cloud & Key Lime Pie martini!!  The two I absolutely recommend if you're not into rum.",2016-08-23 02:09:27

I can only hope this was a bad experience because the restaurant was overwhelmed with the holiday traffic.  Went in on Monday night with our family for dinner.  Our server, Ana, greeted us and took our drink order.  She seemed very stressed with the amount of tables she had.  Some time later she returned with the drinks and offered to take an appetizer order.  We gave her our choices (bavarian pretzels and chicken nachos).  She asked if we also knew what we wanted for our entrees.  We told her yes and gave her those choices as well.  After about 20 minutes when nothing had arrived and our beverages sitting empty she stopped by the table and asked if we wanted something additional to drink.  We ordered another round and inquired about our apps.  She said they were almost ready.  My wife said, "" Ok, I just want to make sure our entrees don't come out at the same time.""  Ana assured us they wouldn't because of how she had rung it all in.   

Well, 5 minutes later guess what happened?! 

Yup, it all came out within 60 seconds of one another.  Ana must have sensed our frustration and apologized for the ""kitchen being overwhelmed!""  The kitchen?  No accountability on her part whatsoever!  

Ok, so you messed up or your kitchen messed up, who cares the important thing is to make things right for the customer, right?  Ana's solution, ""If there are any apps you don't want I can take them away and take them off your bill.""  REALLY?  How about, ""I'm really sorry about the timing of your food.  Please enjoy the apps on us and I'll have them taken off your bill.""

We told her to take the nachos away since they were actually COLD, clearly sat in the window waiting for other food to finish.  She did and they were taken off the bill.  

Final result - Our check was presented with no mention of the nachos on it so she honored her commitment there.  Everything else was on it though, FAIL!

My wife did fill out a comment card and gave it to the hostess on our way out.  Will be interesting to see if she here's back from any of the managers.",2013-12-26 06:01:40

We figured out there was a Nordstrom near our hotel and went first thing Saturday morning (10:30AM) so we could spend some time by the pool.

If you've been to a Nordstrom built in the last ten years, you've been to this Nordstrom. Nice, spacious, with high-end gear all around. Basically the same layout as the Nordstroms in L.A. The selection of men's swimwear was slimmer than I would've expected in such a hot town, but Matt was able to find a handsome pair of RVCA trunks that wasn't unduly expensive. No line or hassle at either fitting room or register.

As long as we were there, I wanted to pick up a few make-up items I'd been meaning to buy over the past month. I sidled up to the NARS counter, where I wanted to get a lipstick that was sold out the last time I was in a Nordstrom and a Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base. (Make-up tip from someone with few to offer--this primer is the only thing I've tried that prevents mascara from smudging under my eyes.) I was helped by a sales associate named Christine, who was very friendly and helpful. Nordstrom was having some kind of pre-sale that would get me a big-ass gift set if I spent like $75 or $80 (I forget the amount, but I was almost there with the two things I was already getting). I added a lipliner to my purchase and had her ship my order when the sale went into effect. Ended up spending more than I'd planned, but not by much, and the gift set was pretty legit, with a nice zip make-up bag and probably $30 worth of products. Everything arrived as promised, with a hand-written card and phone call from Christine.

I realize this whole thing makes me sound like a sucker, but I was pleased with my haul and Christine was perfectly lovely. There was no high-pressure upsell, and I got more than I paid for. Matt did well with his swim trunks, and I've already used all three of my purchases. I like Nordstrom generally, and would recommend this one if you're looking to shop in Phoenix.",2015-11-05 20:19:21

The place is busy and Cane's was busy, even when my husband and I stepped in a little after 9 PM. This Cane's is open until 1:30 AM. Pretty good place if you have a late night fried chicken craving.

What I like best about Cane's is their customer service. Employees are nice to customers and that makes the ordering process better than most fast-food places. Also, in case you were not aware, Cane's gives a discount to military and military dependents. You will need both your ID and your spouse's ID to get two discounts per combo meal, but it is worth it! With two discounts I saved over $2 on mine and my husband's food.

The combo meals we received were great. Nicely fried chicken strips, not greasy, fries, also not greasy. Came out with the much needed Cane's sauce (for me anyway). And of course, the mandatory chunk of bread. I'm not a huge fan of the bread, but it's all right.

Five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the ""tree house"". This is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. 

We were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get Paul as our waiter. Paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. Knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. 

He was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. I ordered the dungeness crab cocktail and the 22 oz bone-in ribeye. I love seafood and was planning on the seabass but couldnt resist the ribeye. Our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and Gnocci with alaskan king crab. 

The crab cocktail was excellent. Served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. It was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). The ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. It had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. Beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. 

The gorgonzola mac and creamed spinach ($14) were both really good. We were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). I found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. For dessert we ordered 3 of Mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. 

Paul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate. The butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). They can easily be split  between two or three people.

It is no Five Guys (my favorite).....But I think AJ Bombers is a cool burger joint.
Where else can you find a Stella's hot cheesy bread bun to go with your burger? 

It seems like there are some rough patches after reading through other Yelp reviews, but after having multiple burgers now at AJ's I can in all my honesty say, I think they make a good burger. I have not had a bad experience yet.
 I didn't say Great.....but I did say good. 

Who is going to complain about ordering tater tots with your burger. Not this guy.
Well.... one complaint I guess----No free sides. If you are coming to AJ Bomber's be aware that if you want fries or tots, (sweet potato fries too) you're going to end up paying extra for them. This may come as a shock to many, including myself. at least one side should be free in my opinion. 

I think the beef makes a great quality burger. A little greasy. But I like it like that. 
Another complaint: Why do I have to pay so much for the extra's on my burger? I'm not a fan of that. 

Going on a Monday the last time was awesome. They had a special going on that you got to add another patty for free on your burger ""More Meat Monday"" Elizabeth R. calls it. Awesome! Now this was well worth my lunch hour.

Service was great. The food quality was excellent! What I like a lot about this place is the sushi doesn't come with humongous rice to make you full like most AYCE places. All the raw fish I had today was really fresh, and the yellowtail was just so so delicious. 

To my surprise, they also had a lot of tasty appetizers and entrees that is included in the price, like Korean short ribs, kimchi fried rice, garlic fried wings, fried shrimp sew mai, oysters and these amazing fried prawns (must try). 

The conveyor belt is a fun concept as usual, but the coolest part is the little machine that delivers food right to your table on the top of the conveyor belt- this is my first time seeing it so it was a really exciting dining experience for me. It looks like a little sushi express train rolling out from the kitchen! 

For dessert they have Melona bars and other fun Korean ice creams. Don't forget to grab a stamp card at the end of your meal, it's their loyalty program for a free meal after 10 lunch/dinner purchases.

My meal at Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill made me wish I didn't have this policy.

We arrived around 11:30 on a Saturday and the place was mostly empty. Though the restaurant has plenty of brunch options, I was in the mood for a hamburger, so I went with the Smashed Ground Chuck Burger (""housemade BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, iceberg lettuce, special sauce & Yukon Gold fries"").

It took a while for the food to arrive and, as I quickly discovered, it was not worth the wait. The toppings were all fine, but the patty itself? A complete and total disaster. First of all, it was cooked to almost well done. (I wasn't asked how I wanted it, but why is their default well done?) Far more problematic was the burger's dryness. It was a thick, dense patty devoid of any juiciness, so each mouthful was a struggle. This thing required more chewing power than a badly-cooked steak. I mean, it was atrocious.

My dining companion also got the burger and he had exactly the same experience that I did. I have to wonder if this is how they always cook/serve their hamburger or if the chef was just having an off morning?

This time around I chose to order the veggie wrap. The best way I can describe this dish is a pasta dish with no pasta. It was a warm mess of grilled vegetables doused in basil pesto. The oil from the pesto, or addition of more oil, made for a messy wrap. Plus, the flavors were just, well, blah. 

Let's break the two stars down: 
1. GREAT Fried green beans. I've never had fried green beans before. They're now on my list to try at more restaurants. These were great because they green bean had a bite to them and the batter to green bean ratio was just right. 
2. One of the few bars in the area worth giving a try. Unfortunately, Fitchburg isn't the best place for eateries. Funks gets a star for being one of the better options in Fitchburg. (Doesn't say much, does it?)

It was a nice intimate place with cool decor and we had the whole room  to ourselves!

I started off with the Hank's Signature Salad and the hubby started off with the Tuna Tartare. My salad was good, a lil on the over bearing on the dressing. Tuna tartare was decent, nothing to run home and Yelp about. We both went with the Bone In Rib Eye (originally I wanted the Prime Rib, but they were out....boo =(!!!) I definitely liked how they provided different types of sauces to accompany the steak, real horseradish sauce, Bearnaise sauce, etc. Steak was cooked to my liking and tender, but I barely put a dent in it. All their steaks are PRIME as they mention when they hand you the menu. The sides were my favorite, garlic mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, asparagus, sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Someone ordered a baked potato and I liked how they provided a couple of side items, bacon, chives, sour cream, etc. I finished off the company dinner with a creme brulee. Huge portion of yummyness with fruit! My favorite item of the night was the KOI martini...which I could probably drink like water if only it wasn't so strong!

When we inquired as to why, the server said it was the Corporate Chefs decision and the local on site chefs are NOT ALLOWED to change it even if they want to.

This is a BAD policy as there are people who are low carb and cannot eat potatoes but can eat cauliflower and it can be made to taste amazing without using potatoes.

Small meal choice: Panda bowl with Honey Walnut Shrimp.

The spicy bean dip that comes with the chips is really good though, but that is not enough to make me come back again.

Long line-up to get in the door just to tell the front of house your reservation name (there was clearly no space for people without reservations)... I was irritated, but then I saw the people I was meeting already seated, so I slipped past the line.

It looks SO DIFFERENT from Shopsy's - awesome!!! Very sleek, modern, mostly black & white... greys, neutrals, almost Asian-inspired. The feng shui was rocking in this joint, as it were.

I wouldn't go here again for a business lunch where conversation is a priority... it's quite loud, and I imagine always packed as it was on my visit.

I had the mini Margherita pizza (tomatoes, bocconcini & basil) with the spinach salad (with the most delicate slices of green apple I've ever seen and a nice ""honeycup mustard"" dressing) - you could choose fries instead of a salad, and you could also have a Caesar or mixed green salad. Mine was $11.95. Pizza was absolutely forgettable. It was fine. I wouldn't say good. The salad was OK. Presentation was awesome... but I was expecting more. It seemed to suffer from a half-hearted effort and lack of inspiration.

One of my dining partners ordered a large Caesar with chicken and the other ordered the (somewhat famous) macaroni and cheese with chicken, goat & Balderson cheddar cheese, with peas for $14.95. Both cleaned their plates, as did I, so I assume it was all good. Portions were HUGE. Is this just an O&B thing?

We also tried the daily fresh juices - today was strawberry lemonade and very nice. I love that.

The server must be applauded for her upselling - she asked me if I wanted whole wheat dough (no), asked us if we wanted to start with something, offered add-ins to everyone at the table, and pushed coffee and dessert like they're going out of style.

Frankly, if you're in the area and looking for a nice lunch, skip this place. Go next door to Biff's instead!",2010-11-02 15:33:43

The most attractive feature is the craft beer menu. But what to pair with?

From reading the Mains, I am not particularly keen on trying them, but the salads sound delicious! I had to settle for the Grilled Flatiron Steak salad because the Smoked Trout Nicoise was sold out.

It was served in a large bowl with enough greens and veggies to complement the dollop of blue cheese and steak. The vinaigrette wasn't heavy, which I forgot to ask on the side. I asked for the steak medium rare....It came out more rare than medium-rare but I ate it. So, I'm really not complaining! The dijon in the vinaigrette served to season the steak.

Located off of Cottage Grove Dr and Maryland Parkway as the main cross street, you can park in the structure that is right next to this place. Since it was after school hours, you didn't need a permit or have to pay to park. Yay!

The theater itself kind of has an old school feel to it. I guess you can say it has an early form of stadium seating. Be careful when looking for your seat here because there are quite a bit of steps involved leading to your seat.

The music acoustics of the place is captivating. This place is truly designed for live musical instruments. In this case, it was a whole orchestra lead by a conductor. When they play their instruments, the music seems to float effortlessly through the air and into your ears. I like the fact that they did not use any microphones next to any of the musicians to amplify the sound. It was definitely not needed. You can hear all the instruments nice and clear.

As for the voice acoustics, well..........I think it can use some upgrading. On stage they had I would say about a dozen mics set up for the performers. When I say upgrade, I mean that they need to either get better mics or a better sound mixer/amplifier. It could also be the speakers they were using as well. Reasons why are whenever the performers would do their thing whether it was a solo, duet, or group act, not all the mics seemed to be tuned at the right volumes. When you hear them sing coming out of the speakers, it sounds like it can use some clearing up or some form of higher amplification for a cleaner sound. Of course this doesn't mean the people singing were not any good. Matter of fact they were all excellent worthy of a big name production company sponsoring them on a major tour.

So any time you have chance of watching a show here with live instruments, don't pass up on that opportunity for you will experience and appreciate what live music really sounds like. Hopefully after this review they improve upon the voice acoustics so it can compliment the former. Until then, it is 4 solid stars for me!

Fries Both the steak fries 2/5 and the sweet potato fries 3/5 were over cooked 

Margarita pizza 2/5. It was very bland. We didn't notice anything unique about the crust either. 

Environment was unique which we always enjoy. 

We probably wouldn't go out of our way for it because the sides weren't great. Unless I was in a Hot Rod mood - wish it came in smaller 1/4 patty size.",2015-06-14 19:30:39

If you can nab a groupon, you get incredible value here. We paid $49 (+tax and tip) for four people for a three-course meal. 

Cost aside, the food is somewhere between ""okay"" and ""good"". The desserts were definitely their strongest suits, but they were also very ordinary desserts, so it doesn't say much about the quality of the restaurant's specialty cuisine.

YUM:
- Bread pudding: great! Can anyone really mess up bread pudding?
- Butter tart: delicious, but again, butter tarts are always delicious and this could have been store-bought for all I know. 

MEH / OK:
- Catfish filet: decent
- Blackened chicken: decent
- Jambalaya: a mountain of simple, singular, unexciting flavour
- Polenta stacks: probably the most flavourful dish we ordered, primarily due to the cheese, but still only marginally better than the other dishes

SKIP IT:
- Salad: soggy and salty
- Hushpuppies: reaaaaally dough-y, floury, and dry. I'd skip this no matter how much the servers try to hype it up

There wasn't a single dish that was bad, but there wasn't a single non-dessert dish that was delicious either. So if you're trying to decide whether or not to come here, it's a question of whether you want to be full or whether you want to be wowed. If you want to be full, this place is perfectly fine.",2017-06-02 02:20:25
Fy-jTucq66yVNioch-KL4A,5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,4,18,4,8,"I owe this place a review for all of the trips I have taken here and for my past summer trip. Yes, this is old school Vegas that was updated about 10 years ago with their Go rooms.  I remember when they first updated the rooms. I think they comped us several trips to get us out there. If you have to stay there I would recommend a Go room.  I have stayed at the Flamingo about 10 times. This place is not as fancy and as glamorous as the newer hotels but I am sure they will one day run their course and be outdated as well. One of the main reasons I stay at Harrah's properties because of my rewards. They have great rewards and offer lots of comps for hotel rooms. I recommend partnering up with another player to maximize your points to reserve a room, someone like your significant other or a friend. Make sure to check in online when you get a notice. The line is much quicker and the entire process is easy. 

If you are not familiar with Vegas I recommend staying here because it is central to most of the strip/tourist area. Very convenient to most places and the airport. The hotel is not that expensive but I have seen prices get a little high at times. Very close to tons of shops, restaurants, and bars that are more than willing to take your hard earned money. They don't call this city Lost Wages for nothing. 

The pool area is nice when compared to some of the other Harrah's properties, much nicer than harrah's and bally's. The adult pool is free to hotel guests of course and $10 for non-guests. The service at the pool is great. All of the servers are nice and super friendly. Drinks are very expensive of course and your stuff does get searched before you enter. Remember to hydrate properly because that desert heat is unforgiving. The shade starts to hit the pool about 4pm. You can always hide out in the grotto under the waterfall. 

I stayed in a Go mini-suite. Perfect size for me. Had a great view of the strip. There is a stereo system, fridge, flat screen, electronic curtains, couch, comfy bed, and great bathroom. I was with a big group of friends but I prefer to have my own room. It was a good place for us to hang and have some drinks before hitting the casino and town. Use the elevators by the Garden Bar near the buffet. The elevators there usually are not as crowded as the main hotel elevators. Make sure to charge stuff to your room, especially if you are getting comped. Always use your players card. Plenty of comped drinks while playing any of the table games, slots, and especially in the sportsbook. Come out and have a good time. Remember this is not a 5 star resort. It's a casino with a hotel on top. Lots of fun and good times involved whenever you can mix in the booze and gambling. See you this summer. Good luck!",2016-05-03 19:16:53

Looking forward to checking this place out, we dined in late on a Sunday evening after a busy weekend. It wasn't very busy, we walked in and ordered. Sadly, they were out of lamb for their Gyros and were out of the pasta salad. The hostess was apologetic, but i was really craving a lamb Gyro. 

We both ordered the grilled chicken Gyros with different sides and the Taziki app. 
The customer service was great, the food was just okay in my book. This place reminded me of a Greek version of a Panera.  A lot more of a chain type fast casual place than I was expecting. Not a bad quick, relatively healthy option if you're out and about, but I don't think I will be visiting this place again.",2016-07-13 14:47:50

I loved this place well before I moved across from it, but the move has not dampened my enthusiasm for it. Lots of green grass to chill, toss a football, throw a frisbee, or play baseball on. Tennis courts too. And tons of benches. Plus a gulley for you to let the dog off leash, if you're so inclined. It's pretty clean, too.

I don't know where'S my Review but I've been going there a lot lately and it's pretty much my favorite thing of the Hour. Why? Staff is friendly even though they sometime (and that's quite polite) lack skill in French but hey I don't even care 'cause the food is that good. I go there with a REALLY empty stomach each time to make sure I can abuse in quantity. 2 super ultra hungry person is like 55$ with tip and 1 drink each. There's two menu. White people not to say Non-Asian get what I call (you'll guess it by now) The White People menu. ASK FOR THE DIM SUM ONE! They'll kindly get a menu for you. I'll tell you 2 things for this review: The type of guy I am in terms of eating and the stuff I believe that everybody that kind of «get me» should also try. 

Ok I like everything at least once and I'm not disgusted by anything. If I hate it it's still an experience that brang a result: Knowing I don't like it. I personally have a fun game with friends as willing as me: Find something on the menu that you know the other might not like and ask that friend to do the same thing. The result are usually disappointing in a good way: You end up liking it!

1: Crab Roll. This is a big-filled-with-crab-crispy ball with nice tempura-ish  (see picture)
2: The Pork dims sums: Whatever the religion, cross your fingers and dig in: Simply put a huge bite of amazing flavoors. 
3: BBQ Pork Steam Bums: Nough's said.
4:Shrimp Rolls: Since when there'S too much shrimps?
5: Sticky Rice Balls: They are filled wit meat: What meat? dunno, I just know I like it.
6: Sweet Tofu: Hot Tofu with ginger sweet sauce. Just great!

The staff, when you are smiling and friendly with them and show empathy for their lack of french-speaking is very pushing harder to help you have a nice relaxed meal. 

Je pense que mon avis a été effacer ou j'ai une revue sur un autre avis du resto mais peu importe. Ces derniers temps je suis complètement méga-giga accroc au Dim Sums. En gros, c'Est juste un excellent coin ou manger comme un cochon pour pas plus que 55$ pour 2 personnes (avec tip inclus).

Dans le fond pour cet avis je dirais simplement quel genre de foodies je suis et puis les mets que j'aime prendre chaque fois que je vais là

1: La boule de crabe croustillante. C'est juste tellement plein de chair de crabe, cE'st génial.
2: les Dim sum au porc; une explosion de saveur en bouche
3: Les pains à vapeur au porc BBQ.
4: Les rouleaux  de crevette: Juste encore des crevettes mais c'est juste trop bon
5: Les boules de riz collante: un peu comme les onigiri japonais. Cest juste délicieux enveloppé de feuille qui sent le thé.
6: Du tofu sucré. C'est du Tofu chaud (assez liquide) avec du sucre de gingembre: Superbe

UCL08Y9kTuTooKhZ98j0RQ,eRDWzHCldd6YXypRECvHYg,QNfh79NwsNnl-AngRhg2ww,3,1,0,2,"I love lunches that offer bento boxes-love trying a little bit of a lot of things. Kingyo in particular offers one really interesting dish called ""KINGYO's super famous delux Makuno-uchi"" bento (limited only 10 sets per day) for $17.

Here is a bit more about the restaurant.....

Kingyo is another Japanese restaurant that has made the move from Vancouver to Toronto, following the success of Guu, Guu Sakabar, Kinton, Hapa Izakaya and Ramen Raijin.  Koji Zenimaru, formerly head chef at the original Vancouver location, is joined by a team of former Kingyo and Guu staffers. The 120-seat room has plenty of goldfish paraphernalia (kingyo is goldfish in Japanese).

Well, what sold me on this restaurant is that they offer their lunch menu on weekends! And after reading many reviews, reviewers consistently noted that the lunch menu gives you more value for your buck.

The Good

The reservation process was very straightforward--can be done over e-mail
Most dishes are under $20 - only items over $20 are the sashimi (3 Kind Assortment $22.00 & 5 Kind Assortment $35.00)
They offer their lunch menu on weekends
I love that on their website you can see an image of every dish

The Not So Good

Service was slow and staggered - I had to get my own water and had to refill it myself

The food - I ordered the Makuno-uchi bento box and I only liked 2 items out of 10. I don't even know what 75% of the items were. We asked our waitress for an explanation, and found her description of the items to be unclear. Also, although I knew that I would not be able to eat several of the items in the box (they had lots of onions), you are not allowed to substitute. Nevertheless, I was too curious about this box to go with something else.
Thoughts?

I don't get the hype. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and the menu is extensive with reasonable prices. The food and service however did not cut it for me. I was starving when we left the restaurant because I did not like or could not eat some of the items in the box. And because the portions were so tiny, the items I did like, I did not get much of.

The friends that got the bento box with me agreed with me--food was not great and no value for money. Those that ordered something else from the menu were satisfied with their food. Not blown away, but it was acceptable. We all agreed however that Kingyo is not worth a second visit.",2014-12-11 20:19:04

You can get freshly baked bread as they make their own on site -- bagels, buns, whatever your heart desires.

Their staff is very knowledgeable and can answer any questions you may have regarding how to prepare whatever it is your buying from them...and if the person you ask doesn't know, you can bet they'll find someone on staff who is more than willing and happy to help.

They have a very large selection of fresh fish and some fish dishes that are oven or grill ready...stuffed calimari or salmon, marinated fillets...it's all here. 

PLUS their frozen seafood selection is outta control.

Once she picked me up from the airport, off we went to start our weekend of eating and catching up. Our first stop was at The Arrogant Butcher to grab some lunch. Located in downtown Phoenix within walking distance to US Airways Center. We parked in a nearby parking garage for $12 -_- 

While you won't find an arrogant butcher at the restaurant, you will find:
1) a hip and stylish atmosphere
2) good food
3) attentive service

Whoever the interior designer is for this space should really receive recognition. I loved everything about it from the floor, to the walls, to the furniture, even the bathroom was awesome. The combination of modern with a slight touch of trendy, vintage, and shabby chic (I clearly can't pinpoint what type of style they were rocking) was very inviting and just plain cool. 

The food was good--it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Me and my friend shared THE MARKET SALAD: sweet corn, tomato, asparagus, & local ricotta. I ordered the TURKEY SLOPPY JOE: grilled poblano, pepper jack cheese & turkey with fries. My friend ordered the BEEF SHORT RIB STEW: green chiles, a fried egg on top, and a side of cornbread. 

Our salad was crisp and refreshing--easily filling if you order a salad as your entree. My sloppy joe came out alright, nothing to rave about, but the fries were delish and the mini jar of ketchup that came along with my fries was a very nice attention to detail and a nice way to keep the ketchup contained instead of having a glob of it all over my plate. My friend's short rib stew came served to her in a mini Dutch oven: super cute. The stew was really good with chunks of tender short rib mixed in with the runny yolk and fried egg whites. The only thing negative thing about the stew was it was a bit salty. The cornbred was moist and not as gritty as some other cornbreads tend to be. 

Our server was extremely attentive. When he found out I was visiting from CA he struck up a quick conversation since he grew up in San Diego.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. Next time I'd like to come back, sit at the bar, and try some of their enticing cocktails.",2012-10-31 05:00:41

I sat at the bar, and the bartender immediately greeted me. I ordered a glass of wine, roasted chicken, and mashed potatoes. I was trying to be relatively healthy (save the mashed potatoes), so I wasn't expecting to really like the chicken, but it was perfectly cooked. I'm also weary of roasted chicken at restaurants, but this was flavorful and juicy. The mashed potatoes were amazing. Creamy and free of lumps. If I wasn't in public, I probably would have licked the bowl.

Yes, Half Price west has bit the dust. I noticed it was closed about two weeks ago. While I haven't really shopped here much the last few years, it was a formative part of my record collecting hobby dating back some nearly twenty years now. When I lived on the east side and first starting exploring the west side at seventeen, this store just kind of appeared like a mirage to this weary wanderer. I had no idea what Center Ridge was(always ended up on that road by accident). This was some ten years before gps. When all I had at my disposal was the map I had torn out of the yellow pages. I would explore Lakewood, Oberlin, all the far reaches of the western civilization and somehow just always end up here. I couldn't find it if I tried, it just happened. Similar experience with Time Traveler records in Cuyahoga Falls(try finding that place without an Indian tracker). Once I moved out here and began working next door, the mystery kind of faded. But over all that time I did find some treasured vinyl pieces here. And lots of crap cd's I later sold to gypsies.

The vibe was always very laid back, jazzy, just other music archaeologists digging through mountains of Fleetwood Mac records to find that one rare gem. They used to be open till ten way before anyone else which endeared them to me. I could sometimes get to work early on the 25 bus and pop in real quick before my third shift job. Or if I was at the Halloween store that popped up next door every year, I could stop in for a music fix. Or on days off when I swung by to just pick up my check. It was always a second thought, not a primary destination. But it never bored me. I almost never left empty handed. The help was always super friendly. There was even a British bloke working there a while who really added to the quirkiness of the scene. Having shopped at all five Cleveland area branches, I'd have to say it was my favorite. Shaker was weak. Golden Gate was just not doable when they were rebuilding Mayfield Road from its prehistoric sub strata up for the better part of a decade. Mentor was weak and had annoying employees. North Olmsted is ok, but not great. Yes, this was the pick of the litter. You will be, sort of missed? 

The saddest thing is how empty most of Center Ridge is. Sure they rebuilt Westgate. But how about that empty Target? That whole stretch of concrete by the stand alone Panera that looks almost Mad Max in appearance? I'm not really a River fan, but it's a two minute drive from my house and it would be nice if more stuff was there. I'm going off topic now. Rest in audiophile peace, Half Price.

The Alley is definitely toe to toe against Chatime (Warden & Gibson specifically) in my books with regards to bubble tea. They're two completely different types of bubble tea joints, but each has their own specialty IMO. Whereas Chatime seems to be catered more to a North American crowd, The Alley seems to be moreso for people who really enjoy that real milk tea experience. Flavours are more on the tea side vs sugary for chatime, which is a nice change every now and then. 

This specific location I feel is probably the roomiest of the three locations I've been to (haven't been to the Downtown location yet - soon!) and the staff here seems to be doing pretty well with regards to keeping up with the crowds. This location also offers more seating and, despite being in a busier location - with loads of restaurants and other competing bubble tea joints in the area - it never feels too loud. The ""tree"" inside the cafe is a nice touch too! 

Personally I find that the service at the Alley has never been as fast as my home base chatime, but I can't really complain.

I'm not sure but it was really loud) really threw it off.

The garlic knots were good. We ordered the filet mignon meatballs to start, but they really weren't anything special. There was nothing interesting about their texture or the way they tasted.

My friends and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a few weeks now and finally made plans to go! I was really looking forward to it and went with an empty stomach and high expectations. 

The ambiance is very comfortable; dimly lit with a modern-hipster feel to it. The cooks prepare the food in the back (in an open area) so you can watch all of the the cooking action! 

The menu is small and they have a chalkboard wall with the daily specials. We didn't hold back and splurged on a variety of dishes to share:

Caviar & French Toast 
- A combination that you wouldn't think would work but was one of my favorite dishes. There is something strangely delicious about the sweetness of the French toast and the saltiness of the caviar. After one bite, you want 10 more

Amberjack (Yellowtail) Crudo topped with Ponzu Salsa
- My other favorite dish. Raw Yellowtail. Soft, fresh, and very refreshing - doused in something both sweet and sour

Oysters Foie Rockefeller
- Baked oysters topped with Foie Gras. Warm deliciousness that melts in your mouth. Rich in flavor and creamy... My third time trying Foie Gras and it keeps getting better 

Octopus Carpaccio
- My first time trying raw octopus and it was different! A little chewy but I can say I enjoyed it. Our server said it's alive until the chef prepares it. Now if this is true, that is some FRESH carpaccio... 

Duck Creek and Blue Point Raw Oysters
- Ordered the Wasabi Cocktail and Pickled Pepper and Habanero sauce which were unique and very tasty! As I'm a huge fan of oysters, these were a must. The Blue Point was better of the two IMO

Panko Fried Clams
- Juicy clams with just the right amount of fried batter on them. The tarter dipping sauce was on point too 

Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice
- The only menu item I didn't care for. It wasn't bad, but my expectations for Korean food are on another level. This dish just didn't quite meet them. I love ripe Kimchi, don't get me wrong, but the Kimchi in this fried rice was a wee bit too sour...

Jameson Ginger Sorbet and Viet Coffee Ice Cream
- Both were incredibly flavorful desserts and the perfect ending to a wonderful meal!

Beryl
- I couldn't indulge because I was headed to work after dinner but one of my friends ordered this apricot bourbon with orange bitters. I tried a sip and wish I could have enjoyed an entire glass. If you're a whiskey sour fan, you'd really enjoy a Beryl

The service was great (friendly server and busser who frequently checked up on us) and so was the food. The portions are very small compared to the prices. (I could have inhaled 3 orders of the Amberjack Crudo) but I get it. Other Mama is a place to come for small bites, cocktails, and a tasting experience.

It took a bit more than an hour though so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  And... since people are gonna be stuck back there waiting so long, they should have a vending machine of some kind!!!

The cons: where do I start? I asked for a simple polish change when I walked in. The guy pointed across the room to a table...didn't even say anything. I walked over to the lady he pointed at, asked her three times if I could see the polish choices before she understood what I wanted. They don't have the most extensive selection, but I found something that looked interesting so I went with it. The polish I chose was grey with a purple/green shift. More on that later. 
Her name was Vana, which I gathered because it was scribbled on a piece of tape on her table. She snuck in a manicure on me, even though I had asked for only a polish change. Since I'm looking for a new place, I figured I would just let her do the manicure so I could see what I thought of the service as a whole. 
That woman should be a butcher...that's all I have to say about her manicure skills. She chopped off chunks of skin. She cut my nails down so short, that she couldn't even shape them. So some ended up round, and others ended up square. It was a nightmare. I told her several times during the process that I wanted them square, and I don't know if she really didn't understand me or if she just decided she wanted to ruin someone's nails that day. 

When she started painting my nails, the polish was straight lavender. I hate lavender. When I told her it was the wrong color, all she said was ""yes, lavender."" By this time, I had already made my mind up to get my nails re-done somewhere else asap. So I didn't keep arguing. I'm just not the type of person to cause a scene, but I was so glad to get them re-done later and forget the whole thing. I'm just sad I had to wait a week so they could grow out enough to shape them.",2014-10-22 02:46:18

It all started off at Kierland Commons outdoor live music festival, then came the monsoon...What to do??  Still craving live music!  We asked around and Eddie V's was on the list.  We were all dressed in very casual summer clothes so it was a little awkward walking into such a nice restaurant looking like wet dogs, but the bartender made us feel right at home.  The band was on break and I have never been so happy I went on my 'Phoenix valley sucks for jazz' rant.  One of the band members was eves-dropping on our conversation LOL!  So, when the band started I was a little embarrassed...But, I think it amped them up a bit!  The band consisted of a drummer, pianist and an upright bassist.  After the set, my friend Jon thanked them and they chatted with us for a bit.  The pianist asked if it met my standard and said he had to keep it a bit more low key due to the fact it is fine dining, not a concert hall...which I recognize.  The bassist was a guest player from out of town (Austin) and you could tell they were having fun jamming.  The last set you could tell they took it up another notch, since the restaurant had cleared a bit.  It was so good 2 cute old couples started dancing and I think everybody was bopping to varying degrees in the room!  

Our bartender was also fabulous.  She made all 3 of us some outstanding cocktails and she knew the menu well.  I opted for the calamari, which is unique with almost an Asian inspired twist...And it is HUGE!  

Eddie V's started off as a last resort and ended up being a 3 hour adventure!  I will definitely be back here again.  They have jazz (not blues, Motown etc) every night!  You can't go wrong with great music, cocktails, service and atmosphere!",2013-07-25 14:55:10

I like that this Chipotle has a parking lot; it makes it much easier to satisfy our cravings for burrito deliciousness.  Every time I've been here, the staff has been very friendly.  It looked to me like their scoops of rice, meat, and salsa, were a bit meager, but I didn't say anything about it.  Largely because Chipotle can be pretty high calorie as it is - I don't usually count these things, but I did today for kicks and my burrito was 810 calories, and I didn't even get sour cream!  But on the bright side, they claim to use organic produce, cows without hormones, sustainably raised ingredients, and you don't hear that often from a fast-food joint.  The food always tastes fresh.

My burrito was a little colder than I'd like it - maybe they're all that way and I'm just picky - but I had to put it in the oven to bring it to a good temperature.

We tried them during Restaurant Week, and they are only a good value if you get the more expensive items on the menu.  We prefer going during non-Restaurant Week, honestly.  It's less crowded, too.

We've tried several of the appetizers, and like their kale salad, bacon wrapped tots, and their cheesy bacon hush puppies (huge portion, but worth it, when they offer as a special).  I only wish they had more options without goat cheese and sweet sauces, because I'm not a fan of either.  

Their meatballs are DIVINE.  We like them with the cheesy orzo (because, why not?).  You get two huge meatballs that taste like mine, so I'm betting they are made with beef, pork, and veal.  The orzo is cooked just right, and they are served with a tangy tomato sauce, melted mozzarella, and grated Parmesan.  

Their crabcakes are very good as well.  They have very little filler, and are very filling.  

Their burgers are also quite delicious.  They are served on a soft, extremely tasty pretzel roll, and you can choose your meat and style.  Recently, my husband ordered his burger medium-rare and it came out more medium, but it was still juicy and delicious.  You can choose fries, kale salad, or half of each as your side.  Whatever you choose, they aren't skimpy on the portions.

My nephews wanted to go to Amazing Jake's so my brother and their dad took them while my cousin and I decided to get our nails done. This place is literally across the street from Amazing Jake's so it was perfect.

We walked in and were greeted right away. We had a 15-30 minute wait, which was fine. The lady that did my cousin's nails was very helpful since my cousin was ready to pop (she had her baby two days later). She helped her get out of her seat, helped her walk  to the restroom and even got on her knees to do my cousin's toes!

I got the mani/pedi combo deal for i think $30 for 45 minutes. I got pink tips and white lines both my nails and toes. When the lady told me my total was $45, I was surprised, I thought it would be more. 

After our experience, this is our to go place (when I'm in town). My cousin told her sister in law about this place and I think it's their new spot. :)",2014-09-21 04:07:40

The food:

They have the best salsa I've had in a long time. Not too spicy and amazing flavor. I could eat it plain. I also ordered Cadillac Nachos which chicken. Amazing! Not a lot of chicken, but great flavor. Contender for the best nachos I've ever had.

The liquor:

I think I ordered a Daiquiri. I don't drink a lot. I will say that they aren't stingy with the alcohol. I could liquor overpowered the drink. My mom loved it. Me, not so much. If you like you drink, you'll be okay with it.

1.  Ambiance - Kinda of very casual and simple, plenty of tables.

2.  Service - Went there around 11:30 for lunch and only a few people, so very easy and casual to get service. I did not get a lot of suggestions on the menu even though I asked, however, the service was okay, no issues at all.  I would say just casual.  I liked the fact that they let us stay as long as we wanted without pushing the bill on us.

3.  Menu - Huge selection of rice dishes, meat dishes, Pho, table barbecue as well.  I want to come back for the table barbecue as it looks like a really good.

- Chicken and Meat dishes - My friend ordered the grilled chicken and it was quite large serving, so be hungry when ordering the meat dishes.

- Pho - No number system and let's face it, I cannot pronounce the language very well, so point and shoot was the best way to go.  I had Pho Beef Combo with all the beefy stuff , tendons and brisket in it. I ordered the large and wow was it very large.  The soup was okay, I put a lot of spice in it to get it some flavor.  They put a heck alot of noodles in it, however, mine was a bit clumpy and while the taste of the noodle was good, I found the fact that it was clumpy to be weird at best. Since texture is as important as taste, I would say that the Pho is not the greatest here, however, i will go again and try it to get a better idea.

- Table barbecue - I am going to go back to try this with friends as it seems a really nice way to hang out and be with friends.  Even though I haven't tried it yet, I am excited to do so!!!

4.  Price - No bad. Everything is just under 10.00 or slightly over. The table bbq meats and seafood is just under 20.00 for the plate of meat.

5.  Will keep you updated on the return visit. However, I am interested enough to try this place again. 

My suggestion also is to go to Bosa 1 on Jones and Spring Mountain when it is not busy time, you will see how the service is different, where they are explaining things, letting you try things and helping you with your culinary experience!

First of all the atmosphere reminded me of a Joe's Crab Shack just with Asian Influence with a open floor plan with a good size bar. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable with the items they offer. We end up getting an order of Spring Rolls, Shaken Beef Salad and Oxtail Fried Rice. All the dishes we had was great especially the Oxtail Fried Rice. Coming from Hawaii, Oxtail is a staple. This dish was seasoned well and cook to the way fried rice should be, not being too dry and bland. It was balanced and consistent especially with the easy over egg on top. 

A few things when going to District One:

-Not a traditional Vietnamese Restaurant but Asian American Fusion style in a modern setting with a Vietnamese twist.

-Menu is only a page long on a clip board but they have an extensive drink menu which was like a small booklet.

- Great place to hangout with a group of friends or family members with open floor plan and large size tables.

The food is probably the best food I've found in the area, but compared to all of the Thai places I would frequent in Chicago, Yupha's is rather sub-par. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the prices are pretty high. (Some prices are higher than Chicago prices). Another one of my biggest qualms with Yupha's is that the food is rather inconsistent.

I once ordered the Tom Yum which was great, but the second time was terrible. I also ordered the House Salad which is really good, but I was surprised at how small it was, a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was huge.

To put it bluntly, if you love carne asada burritos from chain Mexican fast food shops then come here and you will get a quarter pound more.  If you think that food is mediocre and only for very rare occasions then keep on truckin.

I have also tried the adovada burrito and it is around a 2 or 3 rating.  The burrito is massive but the meat was greasy.  I would have liked more seasoning and maybe some sweetness and spice to it.

QBkajIIsJHgbwRegtg_W4w,VzdF-Eqnp3FpKb8cYWeTSw,0ahghcpWQVkm4lEFwx-peA,4,0,1,0,"This is the best Persian food restaurant in Vegas. Of course it might also be - the only Persian food restaurant in town but that doesn't diminish its appeal in my eyes. 

Habib - I assume that's who it is, runs his restaurant with an iron fist and from the moment you enter and he greets you, it's apparent that he's in charge - right down to his letting you know that they will be closing at a certain hour  (implying of course that if you can't time yourself accordingly that he doesn't even want your business).  No matter - I've dined here many times over the years and Habib (or whatever his name is) is a sweetheart under that gruff exterior and goes to pains to serve his clients with gourmet food. 

At most Persian restaurants I recommend the chicken barg which is a flattened tenderized boneless chicken but Habib doesn't offer chicken barg, so we went for the chicken kabob, which is a similar boneless chicken dish on rice, and one lamb shank with dill rice dish.

We asked for and received as an appetizer, Tadig - the crispy rice from the bottom of the rice pot that isn't usually on the menu at a Persian restaurant and is served only when available and even then - only after the server has sized you up and deemed you ""worthy"" of the unknown-to-outsiders delicacy.  Habib brought us an eggplant side dish to scoop on the Tadig (Geymeh Bodamjon) which is odd actually, because it's usually the meat based Geymeh that goes on the Tadig and not the eggplant variety. 

We also had panir sabzi (cheese and dark greens) to substitute for salad. 

The corking charge for your own bottle of wine is $15.

Honestly, his Geymeh Bodamjon was lacking - in salt, and wasn't the greatest.  But the chicken kabobs and rice were all first rate, as was the house doogh (yoghurt and mint based drink, nice LARGE glass).  This is pretty much the way of all Persian restaurants, unfortunately - inconsistency, that one visit the chicken or rice will be off the chart good and then on another occasion something else will be perfect and the chicken or rice lacking.  But over all - Habib's is worth visiting and a splendid break from the casino restaurants. Would recommend. 

And at the end of the night - his gruff exterior faded as Habib presented our female guests each with a rose, and a smile.",2017-04-14 03:14:03

I was ecstatic to find a Vegetarian Combo plate, as this is hands down my favorite thing to order at a Mediterranean-esque place, and I have yet to find a reasonably priced, tasty option in Vegas. 

The place is very casual. You order at the counter, and I would say the service was very NY. They weren't overly friendly, but she did call me ""hun"" at some point. 

The plate came with a little green salad, some pickled cabbage, hummus, baba ganoush, pita, grape leaves and falafel. Looking around, it appeared that most people were ordering salads, and the lettuce was a fresh, green Romaine. Perfect for a lunch salad. The hummus was good, and I actually thought I had two helpings of hummus because the baba ganoush is blended to a hummus consistency! I prefer a chunkier baba, but the flavor was still good. The falafel flavor was ok, however, they were small, oblong and a little dense. My ideal falafel is round and a little fluffy. As for the pita, I am not sure if this is just on the vegetarian plate, but it was covered in a thick coating of spices and seeds. The predominant flavor was oregano. The pita was thin, so the spice to bread ratio was lopsided in favor of the spice. I definitely prefer a spice-free pita, so next time I would definitely request that. 

The do have shawarma on a spit twirling around in the kitchen, which is nice to see. They also have Gold Peak tea! I am a fan of the unsweetened black mixed with the sweetened green. Overall, a solid option for a quick, fresh lunch if you're in the area.",2010-12-15 16:56:30

There are other places I prefer to get Thai food at but this is my go-to for Thai food whenever I'm around this area. The one on Jones & Warm Springs or the Fort Apache location does not even compare to this one (since this one is the original location). 

I ALWAYS get the duck fried rice. It's my favorite dish here. I recommend ordering their chicken satay (sooo good with the peanut sauce and cucumbers , you can always ask for extra of those) , dumplings , and papaya salad for appetizers. Their Thai iced tea is pretty good , it's not too sweet and comes in a large mug just for 2$. I have to also mention that the prices here are very reasonable compared to the portion sizes. The entrees (7-9$) are shareable & enough for two. Probably the only thing I don't like is that food isn't spicy enough. Their spicy level is 1-10 , and whenever I come here I always order a 10 & it's not spicy enough :( You have to add side spices to make it actually spicy. Also , I'm not really a fan of their angel hair noodles they use in their Pad Thai. Pad Thai is usually bigger in size. Their pad see ew is really good though , they use big flat rice noodles and it's cooked to perfection with Chinese broccoli , egg and choice of meat. I like getting chicken and/or tofu with mine.

The place is interesting with 2 floors with patio space in both. We went upstairs and sat at the bar. I especially liked the retractable roof and the staff were friendly.

However, the food and drinks did not do it for me. We ordered a small paella and a pitcher of sangria. The paella was disappointing in terms of the size even though it was a small. I remember the taste from my Ibiza trip and wanted to see how their take was. There was lots of seafood like mussels, clams, calamari and shrimp that complemented the rice. I was hoping for a bigger size but the taste was just ok.

In terms of the sangria, it was created on the spot and poured in the pitcher.  The fruit and juice was at the bottom and then wine at the top. I asked if it should be mixed while the bartender poured it out. So you can see my glass be red with mostly wine while my friend had a very light orange colour with mostly juice. There was a lot of ice as well. I wished it was pre-mixed like in Ibiza where they let the fruit sit in the wine for at least a day.

My friend booked the hotel on priceline where we were able to get a good deal. We were also upgraded to an exquisite suite. It had a master bedroom and bathroom, a second full bathroom, as well as a full living room, and fully equipped kitchen (full-size fridge, range, and sink.) The view was spectacular! You get a full view of the Vegas lights.

This is located off the strip, across the street from Fashion Show Mall. It's a very short walk to the mall if you want to get shopping in. Walking to the strip might take a while and we usually took our car to any locations on the strip.

Some things to note: there is a resort fee of around $30 per night for wi-fi use and other amenities . Luckily, the wi-fi was fast for me.

There are free water bottles replenished daily.

There's no casino in the hotel, which was a plus for me, as I don't like walking through a smoky casino to get to my hotel room anyway.

Valet is required, so if you plan on taking your car, be sure to account for that.

I believe they were originally intended to be apartments, so that explains the full kitchens. Unfortunately there's no cutlery, pots/pans, or anything to actually make use of the kitchens. 

Room service was alright. The staff was great and the little tiny bottles of tabasco and ketchup were just too darn cute.

Also, the restaurant downstairs is overpriced and simply OK. I would not dine there again.

Overall, a very beautiful hotel to stay at and I definitely would stay here again. However, paying full price for the same suite might be a little too rich for my blood. (According to my friend, the actual cost would have been near $1200/night.)",2015-09-01 18:57:23

Since this location opened in 2014, I have caught Miller's Ale House act quite a few times. Never once did I encounter bad service or lousy food. 

    Miller's Ale House might as well be Miller's Versatile House. It really is the home of versatility. It serves as a diner, bar, and place to go to for dessert. There is not one but two bars that serve 32 beer and ale on tap, 33 bottled beer,  and an impressive selection of wine and liquor. The two bars provide a versatile setting to enjoy beer or wine. On a nice day, the patio is a nice spot to enjoy a drink. When there is a UFC event on TV it is enjoyable to hang out at the bar. My area of Miller's Ale House expertise is in the area of food in lieu of beer, wine, and alcohol. 

     Currently, Miller's Ale House is one of the best lunch options in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Everyday of the week there is a different $5.99 lunch special until 4 o' clock. Sounds like a good deal? It gets even better. As I pen this review, there is a $2 off Yelp check-in special. The inexpensive $5.99 lunch special turned into a $3.99 lunch special. Add in a refreshing bottomless cold beverage, tax, plus tip; a full-service lunch is less than $10. From Monday to Thursday they serve dinner specials. In addition to the specials, they serve a soup of the day. Following this review the pictures include their lunch and dinner specials. 

   In recent times, I have explored the lunch special menu. On a recent Thursday, I tried the meat loaf special. The plate included a long serving of meat loaf with mash potatoes that was agreeable to my tastebuds. The following day, I ordered the fish & chips. The fish and chips were delicious yet fell short of the dinner portion that included cole slaw that I enjoyed in 2014. Regardless the portion was generous. One of the pictures below shows three large fish patties, French fries, two bowls of tarter sauce, and a lemon. 

   The fact that I joined the Miller's Ale House club is evidence it is a good restaurant. The neat thing is that on my Birthday they treated me to complimentary chicken zingers (chicken tenders). Being that Miller's is the Versatile House the six chicken zingers with ranch dressing tasted just as good to the steak sandwich and fries I enjoyed here in 2014.

  Miller's Ale House has also satisfied my sweet tooth. I really enjoyed my tasting of their delicious Nutty Butter Ice Cream cake. I am a fan of Nutty Butter cookies, fudge, ice cream, and both peanut butter with chocolate sauces. This conglomeration of delectable ingredients produced a commendable dessert. 

  When it comes to service, the versatility no longer exists. The service has consistently been personable and fast. On the last visit, the waitress was telling me that this is one of the better restaurants that she worked for. The waitress from the day before recognized me and said hello. The waitresses never gave me a difficult time with the $2 off Yelp check-in offer. Furthermore, the Manager asked me how my meal was. I took that as a sign of management caring about the customer's experience. 

    The best thing about restaurants that provide a versatile menu of good food served by friendly people is that it makes return visits interesting. I would like to return on a Monday to try the Italian Philly lunch special or Tuesday for the lemon garlic shrimp zuccini special. If a seafood craving fails to lead me to Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack; I wouldn't mind chowing down a lobster. Or if my sweet tooth gets the best of me the Nutty Butter Ice Cream Cake would hit the spot. With all this variety it is uncertain what will bring me back. What is certain is that I would like to return to Miller's Ale House.",2016-06-07 06:42:59

I came here last Friday to celebrate a job achievement with my parents and lil one. The first thing that sold me was the fact that they offered escargot. It's weird and odd, but escargot brings back some happy childhood memories with the family and its only tied to celebrations so I thought it was very fitting for the occasion. Secondly, this place is less than 5 mins away from home so it was super convenient. It's secluded from the strip and from anyone who does't live in Desert Breeze. I only came upon it because I searched restaurants with escargot. This is one of the few who serve it in Vegas.

Reservations were not hard to make on such short notice and when we were seated the restaurant was pretty empty. Mind you it was only 6pm on a hot Vegas summer day. So, we arrive and the hostess/maybe bartender was not in rush to seat us but more keen on serving her bar guests first. She also used a measuring cup to measure out her wine? Uhm, in all the food establishments I've worked at and I've worked at a few fine dining places and a bunch of casual dining establishments, I've never seen anyone do this and in fact they would be scolded for doing this especially in plain sight of guests. So when she finally escorts us to our seats on the patio (always ask for the patio because the view is what sets the mood and the inside is just blah in my opinion) we get to enjoy the view of the little man made lake and enjoy the many misters they have going. It didn't feel hot at all.

Service. The server introduced himself and informed us that he is working with another team member which I always liked the idea of teams, that way nothing is missed. We get our drinks first then order 2 orders of their escargot. It was so delicious and worth the calories I gained. Being able to dip their warm, soft bread into their butter sauce...yum. Our server knew what she was doing when she left that last tray on our table and brought us more bread...sneaky server but I thank your for it. haha.

My dad got the Chilean Sea Bass - chef fish special, my mom ordered the Honey-spiced Duck, I got the Australian Wagyu (Hey, I'm a carnivore) and my daughter wanted the kids pasta in butter sauce. All the dishes were good and savory. Sea bass resembled a fried block of butter which was kind of intriguing. It was delicious but the presentation of it was just...different. The duck was very succulent and a bit tough so maybe next time my mom should order it med well rather than med. I had the wagyu and frites. Ok, the wagyu was juicy and yummy but THE FRITES is what I couldn't stop devouring. I was actually sad that some of them had been soaked by the steaks juices. For anyone who's grown up in Oahu, Hawaii and in the Kalihi district, they'll know why I have to make a big deal about these frites/french fries. Up until December 14, 2002 at 4 pm.this establishment served THE BEST teri burgers, ice cream slushies and FRENCH FRIES for 42 years!!!! So the fries/frites that were served with my steak were the exact same fries from my hometown. They're got that extra crispy texture to them that make them so good and crunchy that you cannot stop munching on them. In fact I forgot about my steak and demolished what little fries I had on my plate first. My poor steak was neglected till the next day when I had it as leftovers. The kids pasta was ok, nothing to spectacular but it is what it is.

Desserts...oh my god, I really don't know how we all managed to fit desserts into our bellies after all that food but we did. We order the trio of gelato, creme brulee and their chocolate lava cake. All were scrumptious and overly filling. 

Servers were very attentive except for the water? I had to ask to fill our water up and that's all we were drinking...but they were nice and like I said attentive. Dishes were brought out in a timely matter and the presented very well. Oh and they also had a lady singing on the patio that night so that made the experience more enjoyable.",2016-07-31 20:37:39

Maybe I just always hit at the busiest times, but this location is always p-a-c-k-e-d. For me, this review is not my usual 4/5 stars only because the produce seems to be hit-or-miss. Of course, whenever I need it, its just so-so. They also have a lot of old carts that make unbearable squeaking noises, so be sure to try several before you commit to one. I have embarrassingly learned this the hard way before. Sorry if you've had to listen to my crazy squeaky Transformer sounding cart come down the aisles.

Otherwise, this store is fine for everything else I need! They also have a huge bakery, and the gals are always helpful.

The entire hotel and casino  staff is totally friendly.....
they know everyone by name ....
I found in talking with people that this is their only choice for a hotel and casino in Vegas ..... over and over people would say -"" we have been coming here for the last 15 -20 years"" ... ""it  is the only place to stay"" ... 
"" you can't beat the gaming here""
I was amazed that the El Cortez inspired that type of loyalty - and then I got to know the staff of the hotel - they inspire the loyalty. 
They have a supurb resaurant - Roberta's Steak House.
It is a small (seating around 80 or 90) elegant room with two large screen monitors that show silent, but beautiful travelogs of the Italian countryside. 
They are somehow mesmorizing during dinner.
The staff is supurb  ........ just hope you get Linda Hunt as a server - she makes the entire evening worthwhile.
Roberta's offers an excellent selection of seafood and steaks along with a great and inexpensive wine list. 
I enjoyed a super German Reisling for the price of $18.00 ..... when was the last time you got anything better than Boone's Farm for $18.00  

They have remodeled their ""tower"" rooms and I was amazed at how nice and large they are. There is a small section of what are called ""vintage"" rooms available as well.
The hospitality staff provided me a bowl of fruuit in the room - how classic is that ??
The El Cortez  has $3.00 blackjack tables, it has a $5.00 Baccarat table and slot machines that dispense coins.
I would give the hotel and casino a five star except for the total smokieness of the casino.
In a sense - I quess that is also ""old School"" Vegas.
It is the one ""old school"" element they could improve - otherwise - keep it going just like it is .......

Firstly, the service is great. We were seated quickly to our reserved table and greeted with water.

To start, we order the kalbi ribs and shrimp tostada. Three pieces of kalbi came out on a sizziling plate and I was consumed by the smoke. The ribs ended up a little dry since I couldn't see my plate and all I could taste was burned/burnt soy sauce. Not a great marinade for the ribs. 

The shrimp tosada was a bit better. Refreshing shrimp and avocado topped on a fried...thing, I guess. It was difficult to share and eat, but it was good. 

For the mains, I got the halibut tacos and my fiance ordered the ribs. I enjoyed the tacos but I found them a bit small. I was quite hungry afterwards, but I think if the tacos came with a side, say fries, I would be fine. I'm not much a rib person, but my fiance liked them. He got 6 ribs where the table near us only got 4 ribs. The cheddar biscuit and coleslaw were really good. 

What disappointed me the most was the dessert. I was so looking forward to my New Yorker Chipwich and the Brownie Sundae but none of them really delivered. I assumed the cookie part of my chipwich would be warm, but both cookies were cold, hard and the ice cream just made them colder and harder. 

The brownie sundae consisted of a two bite brownie at the bottom, ice cream and whipped cream. A good combination but one you can make at home.

Once for some convention my friend was participating in (Anime..? lol) but most recently this past weekend for the Crossroads of the West gun show. There used to be the Rocky Mountains gun show at the South Point Casino but they no longer come to vegas so this was the next biggest one. We had arrived fairly early in the day around maybe 1000A. The main lot in front of the building was mostly full but still a decent amount of spaces left. There was a small double line waiting to buy their ticket. Parking was $5 per car. Admission was $14 - $1 coupon you can find online on their site. 

Prior to entering the venue, I had expected the entire place be used but it was maybe half used. Nothing close to how the Rocky Mountain gun show was back then with tons of gun vendors. I had maybe hoped to buy the newly released Smith & Wesson M&P 2.0 9mm at a cheaper price than local shops but they were on average maybe $80 more than the lowest price at a near home local gun store. Ammo prices were fairly decent but my friend said he had found cheaper at another local store. For me personally, if you were to buy in larger amounts, and don't mind reloads, for 9mm 500 rounds, it was about $90. Pretty good if you are just a range shooter and not need anything specific. There was 1 main magazine seller, 1 main ammunition seller (there were smaller ones), and maybe 2 or 3 larger gun sellers. 

Worth it? It wasn't for us. We do see people having some successful purchases but not as much as I remembered from another gun show.

Set up - 3 stars
Beautiful clean decor, very confusing line.  Two registers and it's hard to tell who's in line and who's waiting for pick up. (A rope guidance my help?)

Staff - 3 stars
Friendly staff, but I ordered 12 red velvet buntini and was charged 12 red velvet (some bakeries red velvet is more expensive, I'm not sure in this case) when I got to work it was 12 assorted buntini (3 red velvet and 9 of other kind). 
It was packaged and taped when I picked up. So I would recommend either showing customers their order then tape, or customers to check before they leave.

One person was literally asked to leave the bar because she did not bring her ID. Needless to say this didn't really set the mood for a great evening.

Crave is tucked away in the ASU Mercado plaza so it's not visible from the street. If I hadn't consulted the map on Yelp, I may have missed it completely. The menu is mostly sandwiches, but there are some salad options, and you can always turn your sandwich into a wrap. They've got specials that change occasionally so be sure to check out what's available that day. The sandwiches are classic, nothing too fancy but delicious nonetheless. Very affordable, too... only about $7 or $8 for a good sandwich. Basic potato chips are included.

The only downside is there's no indoor seating. In the winter, you can comfortably sit outside in the Mercado plaza, but during the summer... no way!! When it's hot out, I grab a sandwich and head back to my office to eat.

I had yet to stay and try any of their deli or food that they prepare on site. Don't ask me why it's taken so long but I finally decided to stay for a bite to eat. 
Again in one of my indecisive moods, I scanned over the chalkboards to see if anything jumped out. OooooH.....the Market Sampler $9, soup, sandwich, snacks, cheeses, salads. When I asked it was described as a nice variety of many of the items they offer in smaller portions. Sweet! The lady behind the counter let me know that this option would take a little more time to prepare, but I was not in a hurry. Also had her serve me up a glass of a Lemongrass [Agua] Fresca. I took a seat with my Fresca and watch them go to work. 

Sipping my lemongrass fresca I wasn't sure what to expect as I read the ingredient list while waiting....lemongrass, celery, lime juice, sparking water and simple syrup. I was skeptical about the celery flavor in particular. WOW! This was super. Not to sweet and the celery was not over powering and just added to its bright, fresh and invigorating flavor. 

The Sampler was huge. Easily shared , this is a BIG meal for 1, a light meal or nice appetizer for 2. I could see this being kind of like chef ""surprise"" as you really don't which of the sandwiches, soups or cheeses they may put on the board. [I guess you could have more say but I liked letting them just do their thing.] The soup on the board was a chilled spinach cucumber. 
My board had 3 varieties of cheese, a espresso lavender cheddar, a sheep's milk parmigiana type, and some cheese curds with a light dressing. 
There were also 3 salads on the board a cabbage based ""slaw"" with toasted almonds n stuff in a light vinaigrette type dressing (on the spicy side), a roasted potato and veggie salad and a brown rice salad (a little salty). 
There were 4 sandwich portions, 2 were a roasted veggie with a balsamic dressing on rustic Italian type bread and the other 2 were a peanut butter banana with a mango pepper jelly on multigrain. The final treat on the plate was a some corn chips and tomato based/salsa like dip.

My friend and I wondered here this past weekend in the hopes of getting some decent margaritas. we were so wrong. we were seated by a girl who didn't seem to like her job. pretty bland. it was whatever. we looked over our menus and the margaritas looked pretty good so we ordered one each at $7 dollars a glass. I asked for a not so sweet and sour one, but a stronger one with more flavor so the waitress recommended one to me. While she put that order in my friend and I decided to share some basic beef taquitos for 8 dollars. She dropped off some free chips and salsa which were nothing too impressive. the 3 choices of salsa all tasted the same pretty much and were bland. so sad. Our drinks came over and I took one sip and already felt sick from all the sweet and sour. It tasted like a virgin drink. I'm sorry...I'm 27...don't you remember checking my ID while I asked for something of the opposite? I did not say bring me a virgin margarita. open your ears. My friend was not impressed either with his frozen margarita which tasted like frozen lemon water. UGH what is this place?! our taquitos came over and they looked like they were from the freezer isle at target. believe me when I say there was no beef whatsoever in this little things. there were 3 of them and they were the size of my boney little pinky finger. $8 dollars for what?! OMG. unimpressed. When the waitress came over to ask how our drinks were I told her mine was too sweet and I didn't like it as I moved it to the side for her to take away after one sip. obviously she didn't get the hint as she watched me and walked away. umm alright. she brought our check over and I noticed our drinks were $8 dollars while on the menu they were $7 dollars so I decided to ask her about this. She said they charge an extra dollar for the alcohol. nowhere on that menu did it say they were going to charge more money for a drink that already has alcohol in it. WTF! yes...I understand it is only an extra dollar per drink but it is the point of telling your customers about this before they order. I didn't even drink my margarita because it was disgusting and wanted you to take it away but instead you decide you want to charge me more for it?! not to mention your food sucked and was such a disappointment. I left this place so angry and upset over this. The waitress offered no help and it was obvious she wanted us out of there.

Service was good and very attentive. Having never been to SoHo, I was intrigued when they brought out homemade biscuits with some awesome homemade butter and jelly...nice touch. 

My order consisted of 2 drumsticks- 1 regular 1 spicy, Mac and Cheese, and mash with gravy. Heard good things about the eggs so we got a snack portion. 

Deviled eggs were on point. Great flavor. If I decide to come back, might try the fancier ones.

As far as the chicken goes the meat was cooked and good. Skin was nice and crispy. But, the spicy chicken doesn't fuck around AT ALL. It was a bit ridiculous after one bite and I kind of regretted getting it. Once I got that shit settled I moved on to the rest of the plate and wasn't really blown away.

While the outside skin was for the most part crispy, it seemed as if the chicken could be cooked longer to penetrate whatever they use to coat it with. Both pieces had that kind of raw batter layer underneath still that made the skin seem clumpy.

Mac and cheese was ok. Could have used some salt and pepper. Really did not care for the sweet gravy used on the mashed potatoes either. No beuno for me.

We also tried the chongqing grilled fish because we saw so many other tables ordering it. If you're into spicy, this will be one of the spiciest things you'll ever have in your life. This dish was flavourful once you were able to feel your mouth again. You've been warned!! We also ordered the braised beef ribs and lamb kebabs. Both very good.

Despite the raving food review, I have to say that the service deserves 2 stars (I still gave this place 4 stars overall bc the food was that good). The service was very slow and they were also short of dish ware that when we finally got our bowls after asking numerous times it had literally just come out of the wash and was dripping in water. Sometimes the food came out lukewarm because it had probably been sitting in the back for so long before it was delivered to our table. During our first visit, they ran out of pork/chive dumplings and substituted it with shrimp dumplings without telling us. They apologized after and gave us free red bean cake. I'm attributing the mediocre service to it being a new restaurant that is still trying to get into the groove of things. Will still be back for the food.",2015-01-03 19:49:34

The good:
- The sound in here was good - really good actually - not too loud but still loud enough for a concert, crisply mixed and each mic was clearly articulated
- The ambient temperature was nice
- Good size room - a couple hundred people

The bad:
- The inappropriately advertised start time (-1 star)
- Lady in the bathroom that gives you soap and expects you to give her money.  This is a particularly sore point for me, because you have NO option except to take her soap - she holds the ONLY soap.  And I refuse to pay her for that. (-1 star)

I saw my landlord here at a Brandi Carlile show.

He squeezed us in a small table for 2 and we have to be very careful not to make the plates fall of our table since we ordered too much food. 
However, they wanted to make up for their mistake and inconvenience and offered us free desserts on the house. Now that's what I call attentive service. 

As the for the food, it's awesome. No other words needed. The black truffle spaghetti is so flavorful. It's prob my fave dish so far. The other dishes such as the bone marrow, escargot, salmon rillettes were also pretty good. 

The second time we went was for brunch. The benedict egg with salmon was pretty decent, but the sauce was a bit too sweet.

Just an FYI, this is a ""no frills"" hotel, so there's no spa or bellhop service, but they do have an adjoining restaurant as well as room service. This is the type of hotel you would just sleep, shower, and change your clothes.  There's also a gym if you would like to get a quick workout in during your stay.

The outside of the hotel and the hallways are outdated, but the rooms were modern (for the most part) and clean.  The rooms reminded me of NYC - - they were small but the space was utilized well.  WiFi isn't included with the room and costs $10/day. (I have an international data plan so I didn't need it)  As other reviewers mentioned, the bathrooms have sliding doors, but it wasn't a huge problem for me.  Check-in was swift and friendly, (they allowed us to check in 2 hours early) and they also provided us with a map of downtown Toronto.  Housekeeping was also very courteous and always asked us if we needed anything for our room whenever we ran into them in the hallways.

The location itself is 5 stars.  It's located literally 100 feet away from Dundas-Yonge Square, which is basically the Times Square of Toronto.  There's a variety of different restaurants to dine at, shopping (you're about 200 feet away from Eaton Center Mall), and tons of street entertainment.

Second it had a horrible smell like old garbage, but since I just spent about 34$ on a meal the size of an appetizer I figured I might as well try it.

Third the duck was barely even warm, more like room temperature and it wouldn't chew, it was so chewy had to be spit out and was about impossible to eat.  Tasted like unseasoned pig feet.

Forth It had some sort of peach medly under the duck that was cold like it just came out the refrigerator.  The peaches and what ever else that mess was looked cooked but were very cold with no flavor to them.

a little surprised by the bar area - kinda small felt a little claustrophobic . Asked for a michelob ultra - sorry , we ran out ...on a tuesday ?!?!? 

the restaurant is cool looking but i don't need our waiter to babble on about who designed it, how much was spent, blah blah blah 

Let's focus on the food. 

Started with the seafood tower - solid . Of course, the pretzel bread - still my fav pretzel bread though CUT gives Mastro's a run for the $$$. 

I went for the meat - Bone in rib eye, some creamed spinach and asparagus. Of course, my fav, the blue cheese/oil oil and garlic sauce for the steak ( pic ) ...decent but not to the level of the mastro's in B. Hills and Costa Mesa . The rib eye was also average - the talk about the plate being 400 degrees when it's brought to you - i think they needed to add the 400 degrees to the broiler - i ordered medium but it was rare. more bothersome, it didn't have that nice outer sear bordering on crunch - it was too soft ! flavor was decent. 

Some nice pinot noir wines - even though the host gave me the wine list to order, i showed restraint - a Laetitia from Paso Robles and a forgotten Oregon - both under $90 each",2010-02-21 04:34:35

I had the corned beef hash, which tasted like it was from a can, potatoes which were good, and sausage patties which were excellent.  They easily and happily made my meal sans butter/dairy as requested.

It's not to say that there aren't other restaurants just as good in Toronto, because there are. But I felt like every course hit the right note for me. I can imagine the taste of each one as I think about them again. And that's why I really liked this restaurant.

I came here on a Thursday night this week. There were five of us, so they placed us in a private room on the side upstairs. It was nice, but I think one of us had read that the larger room upstairs was nice and was hoping that's where we would've gotten to sit. I didn't mind though. I suspect we could've gotten moved if we had asked (not sure).

The menu is a nice one. Not overly large, but had a nice selection. I won't mention what everyone else at my table had, mainly because they got stuff that I couldn't eat (shellfish). But for appetizer, I had the sardines and we had some shishito peppers to share. Two sardines came on the plate, each was a nice sized (it is intended to be shared), served with arguula, potatoe and a sundried tomato salsa. It was a very nice flavour combination. None of the elements was dominant, and worked well together. The shishito peppers were nice too. I think I just really like shishito peppers, so they could've just put a basket of it in front of me and I would've been a pretty happy customer!  For entree, I got the sable fish. All I really need to say about this dish is: ""try it!"" The fish is filleted and cooked perfectly. It was so soft and tender. I don't know how else to describe it other than that maybe: it's the best dish I've tasted at any of the restaurants I've visited  this year. I'd come back to this restaurant just for this dish. I then had the passionfruit cheesecake. 

I'd have to say that service here was very good. I dont know if it's improved since May or if it's always been like this. But I think my experience was a pleasant one. The staff was patient not to interrupt conversation (even standing there waiting for our attention). I was explained what I could and couldn't get (because of my shellfish allergy) or if something could be removed from my plate if I wanted. When asked between different plates what they'd recommend, they explained what was unique about the different dishes, but also gave a response about which they liked. The owner (Cristina) also visited the table twice first to introduce herself. Second to follow up and see if there was anything we'd want. We had a friendly conversation with her. I can see that she has a lot of passion for her restaurant.

We ordered and our pitcher of sangria came relatively quickly. An hour and a half later, our appetizers arrived. I was starving and the chicken tikka masala was cold. 45 minutes later, our plates still hadn't been cleared and we asked if our mains were coming. The server mumbled something about how he would check. Then he came back and said that the kitchen was ""chopping fresh vegetables for the meals"" and that was why it had taken almost two hours to come. Then our food finally came and my paneer was beyond bland. After 2 and a half hours, our server asked us for the first time how our food was, and I can't say that I gave a glowing review.

Overall, the food wasn't tasty, dinner (appetizer and main) took three hours, my appetizer was cold, our server didn't try to make things better after they had clearly forgotten about our order (even though it wasn't that busy) and the bathrooms were kinda gross. If I could have given this no stars, I would have.",2011-06-19 22:33:17
O0s_R8xNyG4cdgUelvQFsQ,Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,3,9,5,6,"It's kind of a dilemma for me when I want to give a restaurant a five-star rating based on the food alone but then the service fell flat on its nose after starting out remarkably well.  I'd like to write about all the food we intended to order but unfortunately, three dishes did not even make it to our table!  

Joined by my co-workers for dinner, we started off with an order of the raw oysters (6 different selections on the board) along with oyster rockefeller with foie gras as well as an order of amberjack crudo.

The raw oysters were some of the best quality in Vegas at an amazing $2 each on average.  Very clean, delicious flavor.  The Beau Soleil oysters were my favorite, more sweet, less briny taste (my preference).  The oysters came with choices of dipping sauces of which we tried Wasabi Cocktail and Rosemary Mignonette.  Our servers were very knowledgable and helped us decide on what oysters to try.

The oyster rockefeller with foie gras was already a must order as soon I laid my eyes on the menu.  This is a cooked version of oyster topped with a spinach mix and some foie gras on top.  I was disappointed when our 2nd order of these never came to our table.  The dish came with 4 good-sized oysters and it was delicious.  The amberjack crudo was equally tasty.  So much in fact that we ordered another.

My co-worker ordered the assorted sashimi platter which they said had very fresh selections of fish and octopus.  

Our final dish we were able to try was the caviar and french toast with the crème fraiche.  Seriously amazing.  Perfectly cooked, warm, french toast with a helpful scoop of caviar on top.  This combination was new to me but most certainly welcome again and again.  

It was at this time that we decided to order some main entrees (1/2 organic chicken on shishito peppers and yukon potatoes,  also a hanger steak medium-rare) and another oyster rockefeller.  

We waited over 30 minutes and attributed the delay (in comparison to how fast the rest of the prior food came) to the influx of people that came after us.  Another 10 minutes passed without servers coming to our table and we finally flagged our original server down (asian guy, top knot, whose name I can't recall).

When we asked about our food, the server apologized saying he lost our ticket and the order was never placed.  40 minutes wasted.  We decided to just end the night here and took the check.   Unaware of the mishap, the manager said ""Thank you!"" as we stood to leave.  I made sure to inform her of the problem before we left.  Besides an apology and a promise to comp a few rounds (of what?) next visit, we left the restaurant still hungry and unsatisfied.   

I'd like to give this place another shot but it's no longer near the top of my must-try list.   With that said, delicious food and worth a try if you have not gone before.  Just make sure they don't lose your order.",2015-09-22 09:31:45

Look, it's an airport. It has a function - that being to get a lot of people through it in an efficient and timely manner. At this, it's up there with the best. I've NEVER waited longer than 25 min in the security line. Of course I've been delayed, but mostly for weather which really can't be blamed on the airport. It is the Midwest, after all. Check in lines can be long but this is rare and if you're a seasoned traveler, you know how to get around this (don't check a bag, curbside check it, etc).

Food and shop options are getting better all the time. If not for that new Dunkin' Donuts in the check-in area, I might have to give a 3-star. Thank GOD for that DD. I have nearly died of caffeine/donut withdrawal while waiting to check in back in the days before that blessing arrived. Just in the past year two new sit-downs added - the Pub (English theme bar/restaurant just past the main checkpoint), and Quaker Steak and Lube in Concourse B I think.
  
As Cara said, you don't go to the airport looking for a great gourmet dinner at a value price. Yes, the food is overpriced - show me an airport where it isn't. Also, you know you're not going to get a steak knife so here's an idea - don't order a steak!

It's just disappointing when you compare it to similar places in the US like Off 5th (Saks), Nordstrom Rack, Barney's outlet, etc. It's funny, because if you come to Vaughan Mills on a busy weekend, there are huge crowds in ALL the stores, but this one (at least on my last visit) had relatively few shoppers. Perhaps it's because, even at ""up to 60% off"", a lot of the stuff here is still really expensive for most people. 

The store is huge and warehouse like. Things are nice and spaced out (which is good because everyone at Vaughan Mills seems to have a really big stroller). The selection was not great. I think I've had better luck with ""The Runway"" section at most Winners. The accessories section in particular is kind of lame. Just a few bags and sunglasses and jewelery behind this counter, so you can't even check stuff out up close without asking the salesperson (who will then watch you like a hawk). They had a few Burberry bags, Kate Spade small leather goods, and some not very exciting costume jewelery. The shoes at the back were also a disappointment. Not very many styles. For clothes, it's a bit better. They have some ""additional 80%"" off racks, but most of the clothes there were showing signs of wear -- pilling, etc. Turn off! And some of the styles... lets just say it's easy to understand why nobody wanted them (e.g. really weird/unflattering fits that few can pull off). They weren't kidding when they said LAST call... 

The lingerie section is actually half decent though. Some cute things by D&G, Princess Tam Tam, Cosabella, La Perla, Elle Macphearson, etc. I ended up spending some time sifting through the denim. They had a fairly large section devoted to jeans, however, it was mostly 4 or 5 styles and just several racks of the same thing. I did find a nice pair of indigo wash skinny bootcut jeans by 7 for All Mankind for $79 (about half off the regular price). 

The change rooms have all these intense signs about how it is a CRIME to try and switch the pricetags and that they will punish anyone who breaks the law...

Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). 

My boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). 

Next, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entrée, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being sautéed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! 

Service was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about.

I was browsing Yelp one morning, checking my bookmarks, and reading reviews just to find someplace new that caught my eye, and Rania's certainly did that.  What a fantastic first impression!

We were greeted right away and guided to a booth, and our server, Margaret, took our drink order and said she'd give us time to look at the menu.  I had already been scoping it out on the internet and drooling over the choices, so we started with 2 of the Beef Mantu and 2 of the Ashak on the small plate menu.  I love that they have different amounts for these so you can get as many as you want.  With a salad and some bread you could make a meal out of the small plates alone.

I wish I could describe the flavors in a way that would really do both of these dishes justice, but they were amazing and a blend that I had never tasted before.  The mantu in particular had a little heat to the seasoning blend, but nothing overwhelming at all.  It was very pleasant and I want to go back and eat those again for sure.  

Then for our entrees I ordered the chicken breast and beef sirloin kabob platter with brown rice and the naan bread.  Mr. M ordered the pan fried fish with spinach rice and the salad bar.  

The salad bar choices are really varied and nice and fresh.  Mr. M came back with some greens, chickpeas, olives, and I think some raisins were in there, but it was a nice way to start the meal.  The bread is great too, and I agree with other reviewers who say it's a little different from what you might expect.  A few charred edges and a thinly fluffy interior make this bread different and very tasty.  I loved scooping some rice and grilled meat from my plate onto some bread and tasting that group of flavors.  Wow.  Just wow.

Mr. M's fish was fried perfectly as well.  Nice light breading and nice light texture all around.  Again, a blend of seasonings that I'm too inexperienced to describe, but it was delicious.  And he said he usually does not like rice, but he ate every bit of that spinach rice.  Our total for those 4 items plus an iced tea was $34.70 before tip.  

They have a Yelp check-in offer too that is something like a free small plate with the purchase of an entrée, and there is also a groupon out there for them.  Now is the time to give Rania's a try if you've been thinking about it.  I look forward to a return visit.",2014-06-05 16:55:48

I've driven past this restaurant many of times thinking to myself, I have to try this out, especially becaust it is only $3.99 for their lunch buffet Monday - Friday.  Without the ordering a fountain soda, total is $4.32.

So what to expect at school cafeteria prices? School cafeteria food of course. If you went to a good school, then this means it is okay compared to other places.

As soon as you walk into the restaurant is the cash register, you have to pay before you eat. Which is fine by me.  

The buffet starts off with the salad. So although I really wanted salad on this particular day, the salad may have been from the day before because it was looking wilted.

The chicken noodle soup I thought was really good. So at least I know where to go for the cold days when I'm experiencing a sore throat.

Of all the pizzas they had, I only tried four. The pepperoni and the spinach I thought was ok. However, I think they do really good job on the chicken alfredo and the chicken honey bbq.

For dessert, they had the fudge brownie and the cinnamon bites available which I thought was ok. The fudge brownie was rich and the cinnamon bites weren't overly sweet.

While there, I only saw two employees working in the restaurant area, the cashier and one person busing tables. Unfortunately, the one busing tables wasn't around very often, so while I was there, none of my plates were picked up. Because it was still early, about 11:30 am, the restaurant was nice and clean.

I thought it was interesting to see that they do have a little arcade area in the back of the restaurant. So its nice for larger families treating the kids and the family a night out where the smallest of pickiest eaters will be satisfied and the kids can play making it easier for parents to put their kids to bed.

Natas - Not too egg-y for those of you who don't like that taste in custard.  Pastry was nice and crispy!  I believe they were $1.10ec

Strawberry Shortcake/Chocolate Cake - Despite what one lady behind the counter said, Strawberry Shortcake wasn't the best and neither was the Chocolate Cake.  More cocoa taste as opposed to rich chocolate

Strawberry/Lemon Cheesecake - Pretty good and surprisingly light and not too sweet.  Apparently the Blueberry Cheesecake is the sweetest

Eclair - SKIP THIS!  Choux pastry was pretty dry which was a shame 'cause the custard - similar to what's inside a Boston Cream doughnut - was pretty fresh tasting.

Best Homemade Burger in Town?

Maybe not the best of the best but it is up there if you want freshly grounded in house burger and cooks on a grill instead of flat top, looks no further!

Chef Burger ($7.99) in a whole wheat bun topped with a Special garlicky sauce was A-OK.

I could suggest less toppings and sauces because one can barely taste the meat itself.

Clean and quaint. The lady behind the counter, who I think was the owner, greeted me immediately and asked me how my day was going. She was so kind and didn't seemed bothered that I only wanted to buy one cupcake. I chose a red velvet (my fave). It was SO good! The cake was moist and had good flavor. The top was a little more solid, which I like. The frosting was soooo yummy. You could definitely taste the cream cheese in it. There was also some filling, which I am assuming was more icing, which made the cupcake even better! The only downfall was price. $3 is a little pricey and I have found similar shops around that sell for $2.60-$2.75 a piece. Even though that doesn't sound like a big difference, it does when you are buying by the dozen. This place does deserve five stars though because overall it was great for a first experience and I will definitely be back.",2014-04-12 04:50:31

The flavors are fresh, unique constantly rotating.

The prices are fair for a small mom/pop type place, and given the quality, you'll be happy you paid a little more.

My favorite flavor is the toffee butter crunch, which the name pretty much speaks for itself. The mint chocolate chip is a close second. The mint tastes like real mint leaf, which is different at first, but then it's really refreshing.

Market square was full of people last night so it was great for people watching bad for parking.  Poros has a $10 valet service but do a drive by spin around the block and you might get lucky and find free street parking a block away like we did.  

The restaurant is sparkly & beautiful w/ giant fish tanks, a huge bar area & super fancy chandeliers plus the doors open to outdoor seating.  Since it was hot out we sat inside (didn't help I was still sweaty).  We were led to the way back to sit at a table that had a nice view of the fountain but I wish we were more up near the front or in one booths.  

For drinks I ordered the red sangria and hubby got the Lebanese rosè (who knew there was such a thing?) - he won on drinks - my sangria was too syrupy sweet - yuck.  Grilled octopus we got to start was good - not chewy & good flavor.  For dinner we got lamb chops and the grilled Chilean sea bass - get the fish-you order the kind and size you want and how to prepare it.  Sizes range from 5-8 oz and for my fish it was $5/oz.  It's a la carte for the fish so get a side or you'll just have a piece of fish on a plate (seriously).  They didn't have any rice/grain side dish (they should change that) but I saw they served farro with some entrees so I asked for a small bowl of that and the server made it happen. My fish was heavenly - so buttery and seasoned perfectly. That's why it sucked so bad that lovey's lamb chops, while cooked to the right temp, were bland. And the rest of what was plated-fancy string beans and some kind of purée wasn't worth it.  Once he got the salt and pepper it was a little better but honestly, he makes better lamb chops than these - so underwhelming.  

Service was weird- our waiter was a young kid who talked super fast, almost bordering on pompous.  He didn't seem like he had a lot of tables so he wasn't busy he was probably just a douche?  He made himself scarce for the rest of our meal which sucked because we needed water and maybe we would've ordered more drinks but he didn't check so we just ate quickly and skedaddled.  We should've left our water glass tipped over since it was empty most of the night. 

Won't be back - too pricey to be underwhelmed with the food and I can get Chilean sea bass just as good and cheaper and with a full plated dinner at Mitchell's.  Wish it was better because I love market square",2016-09-18 13:25:36

Both of my drinks were good for ""casino lobby bars"" but nothing utterly spectacular.

My husband, who can be admittedly dim and stubborn, insisted on trying to order a Gin gibson. Which was stupid, and he admits this. They did not have cocktail olives, and had to go get one from another bar, and made the drink with vodka. So he was crabby. I told him he should have ordered whiskey, and he retorted that the waitress should have told him that, instead of just saying ""sure, no problem."" since it clearly was.

Lobster Fried Rice - Huge chunks of lobster with claws and shell as decorative display. Flavor was ok and not the best fried rice or lobster I had especially for the price but the the presentation was done well.

The Big Bone Soup - Shit looks like something a caveman would eat. Not the most flavorful and some may find this shit intimidating with this pre-historic looking ass dish. We kept the bones for the lil homies back home.

Some little fuckworth terrier was running around in circles in the slow lane on the 101 and next thing ya know, SPLAT!!!

I walk in and meet my party of six already seated. Still in shock, I order a martini. It arrives. I think Morticia Adams was the mixologist, it's brimming with dry ice vapors, like I'm drinking eye of newt or some shit. It gets better.

The lady seated next to me was a size  minus 2. She made Karen Carpenter look like a pregnant Adele. She started talking to me but I was fixated on the tire bump sound when I wasted the dog. I tuned in. Of all the fucking luck, guess what she wanted to talk about - you ready for this - her two Irish Setters. 
Of all things in the universe to talk about, she decides to talk about her dogs. I order another Morticia special.

Four drinks in, the freeway dog kill now a distant memory, I ordered the biggest cut of beef they had - a twenty-four ounce cowboy something or other.
I ordered it rare.

For killing someone's poopsie, the night didn't turn out too bad. 
Mastro's helped me to wash the whole unpleasant event away, like it never happened.

The steak was amazing. So were the onion rings.

The second time I came here was intentional; I was nowhere in the neighborhood. So it was even more disappointing when I went out of my way to come here and had a less than smooth dining experience.

Recently they offered a Yelp deal, purchase it for $10 and get $15 off. Not a huge savings, but still $5 is $5! Once I went to pay, it was very clear they were not familiar with the Yelp deal they were advertising. Instead of taking off the $15 they only took off $7.50 and told me that I had to purchase over $30 to get the entire $15 off. The Yelp deal did not have any specifications indicated. I was just under the $30, but after explaining the situation a couple of times to the server and then the owner, they honored the deal. 

Also, they didn't have falafel ready during dinner. How does that happen when it's a staple item for this type of restaurant?! We substituted for their special pasta side and it was good. They should really stop advertising a free smoothie with your meal (as seen in the front window) because it wasn't offered and I ordered a meal that should have gotten one (according to the ad).

We had 9 in our party so we got our own table. About half of us started off with cocktails, I personally got their signature punch which was so delicious & very reasonable during hh for $5 (only at the bar though, not at the table). I don't know why they did, but my bro & mom ordered some apps for everyone, an assortment of tempura (shrimp, scallops & veggies) & edamame. Both were ok but cold, blech. Shortly after we received our soups & salads. The soup was pretty tasty but the salad was drenched in dressing. Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu, except my sis who opted for sashimi & a couple sushi rolls, which she enjoyed. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but my hubby got rocky's choice (steak & chicken) & I got samurai treat (steak & shrimp). 

Our chef Julio was nice enough but messed up on the tricks quite a few times, isn't that what we're paying for here? Regardless, we all had some laughs & it was fun. The food was ok. I ordered my steak med-rare & some parts were rare while others were pretty well done, not very consistent. They use so much oil & butter yet the food was flavorless, we had to use a lot of extra soy sauce & salt. I'd say the best food item was probably the fried rice, but again it needed extra soy sauce added. A couple of us ordered dessert after dinner, green tea & chocolate ice cream & banana tempura. The ice creams were ok, definitely store bought & seemed a lil old. I didn't try the banana tempura but those who had it said it was ok also. I almost forgot to mention, since it was my dad's birthday they sang to him (which he hated) & took a pic for him to take home (nice touch).

I didn't foot the bill but was informed that it was over $500 with tip! There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it, but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up. Yes you get a show, but I care more about my food tasting good than some tricks. I would maybe come back for some of their punch during hh & fried rice, but that's about it.",2011-07-21 01:00:21

I realize that may be highly contested but St. Viateur was edged out only slightly.  It's still tasty though. 

If you are seeking the best St Viateur go here... and don't be tricked by the other location down the street which is just a cafe with the same name.

This place is busy... cash only... and when you get to the front of the line you better know what you want and have cash in hand or the staff will be extremely rude.  My plans were foiled because they were out of a couple of my choices which resulted in last minute mental reorg and if looks could kill I probably wouldn't be writing this review. 

On a return trip I probably would just buy whatever is hot.  The colder bagels were good but honestly nothing worth a long wait for.  Maybe if my first choices were there I might think differently... but I only can only go on what I was given.",2016-03-02 05:57:25

The bartenders were super nice and waited on us like sitting at a table (not all places can provide same experience at the bar). We got the queso with chorizo which was great other than the chips tasted like they were out of a bag and not homemade. Unsure if they are but I've actually had better chips out of a bag. I got the chicken chimi and it was good but the sauces lacked flavor on the plate making it overall kinda bland. We did get their homemade hot sauce which helped boost the flavor. My husband got the chili enchiladas which he agreed were good but nothing exciting, just average. Homemade sangria was great and they had top shelf tequila. The one big thing especially with flu season is I watched one of the bar tenders cough several times directly into his hands then never wash. He is touching glasses, plates of food, etc. I'm sorry but teach your wait staff to protect their germs... cough in your arm and not on your hands. Or atleast wash them after!

Example #1:
I go in for my son's January 2013 well baby visit and am told that I need to pay a $25 copay.  No, I say.  The well baby visits have no copay.  Clueless front desk girl says oh, let me verify your insurance.  She hands me a piece of paper with the wrong insurance info on it.  I cross it all out and give her the correct information and she makes a copy of the insurance card.  Next well baby visit - same clueless front desk girl says the same thing, asks me to verify the insurance info, I correct it, she makes another copy of the insurance card.  Next well baby visit - EXACT SAME THING.  I gave them the insurance card four times.  You'd think they'd get it but, no.  See #3 below...

Example #2:
On my SECOND well baby visit, same winner at the front desk says oh, you have a balance on your account of $228, how would you like to take care of that today?  I said I don't want to take care of it today because that's the first I've heard of it.  She tells me that it's getting ready to go to collections so I should pay it today.  I queried how it could possibly go to collections when I have never seen a bill?  Clueless wonder offers to let me speak to the billing manager.  The billing manager then says it was all a mistake, it's not gone to collections, and in fact, THE BILL WAS JUST PROCESSED AND PRINTED THAT MORNING TO BE MAILED OUT THAT AFTERNOON!

Example #3:
I moved to Colorado and started getting phone calls from Merrill (sp?) in the billing office.  I called her back.  She tells me some of the well baby claims were denied.  I ask her for the dates, call the insurance company, verify my son's coverage and benefits to be 100% for well baby visits, and call Merrill back to tell her that.  She says she will resubmit the claims and asks yet again to verify the insurance info.  What do you know?  They have the wrong insurance information AGAIN.  So I give it to her.  She asks for a copy of the insurance card.  I tell her to reference the other 4 copies of the insurance card that they should have on file.  She does, reads it to me, I confirm it, and we go our merry way, right?  Wrong.  I get at least 3 more calls from Merrill where we have exactly the same conversation.  

My husband and I both called the insurance company to verify coverage again.  They tell us they have no claims on file at all from NSP.  We both called Merrill to let her know, she says great, should be taken care of... But no, then we receive a bill in June 2013 for $1200+ from NSP.  My husband calls the billing manager three times because we are sick of talking to Merrill.  Billing manager never calls him back so he calls the insurance company.  They say there are still ZERO claims on file from NSP and offer to call their billing department.  That's right - the insurance company offered to call the doctor's office.  Lo and behold, we get a call back from Cigna letting us know that N. Scottsdale Pediatric never ever filed one single claim correctly for my son.  They continued to file against the incorrect insurance information that I corrected THREE times previously.  Cigna advised them on how to file the claims.  Unbelievable.  I am so glad I don't have to deal with these clowns ever again.  Even if the doctors are ok, the hassle isn't worth it.  It's the most poorly run medical office I've encountered.",2013-07-08 19:48:01

Service: Not the greatest. Had we not asked for a shady seat, they would have seated us in a sunny spot. Also, the waiter took a very long time and no bread was served immediately. We had to wave him down to get our order taken. Get your shizz together please.

So far I've tried their chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, malai kafta, aloo matar, naan, and veggie samosas. I've been quite pleased with the food. Their sauces are really flavorful and creamy without being too rich or heavy. The chicken has always been perfectly tender in the meat dishes. And their veggie samosas may be the best I've ever had. Their naan is the one item that I think could use some improvement. I've always ordered the garlic naan, and some of the time it's tasted a little tough without much garlic flavor, almost like it wasn't fresh. Other times, the naan has been chewy, soft, fluffy, and packed with garlic flavor like good garlic naan should be. 

True to their name, they certainly include lots of flavor and spice in their dishes, although I have found their heat scale to be a little inconsistent (you can choose your desired spice level from 1-10).  I tend to like things on the spicier side (not burn-your-tongue-off spicy, but enough to break me into a minor league sweat). Depending on the day, the heat levels seem to differ. I've had everything from a level 7 that barely tickled my tongue to a level 5 that had me reaching for the water several times during my meal. So until they get a little more consistent with their heat, I'd recommend going conservative on your spice level selection.

Every time we've ordered takeout, our food has been ready within 20 minutes and the workers were very friendly when we came to pick it up. The food is also always packaged very thoughtfully, which is a nice touch (e.g., plastic wrap around the take out containers to avoid the dreaded soggy-bottom-of-the-bag-due-to-sauce-spillage).

Most new restaurants have growing pains and need to work out the kinks at the beginning, so it bodes well that my experiences here have been positive right out of the gate. I must admit that this is still not my favorite Indian food in the 'Burgh (at least not yet), but it definitely holds its own.

When I first noticed this location on Bell Road, I must admit having no interest in visiting. After all,  I remember going to the original ""Crazy Ed's Place"" up on Deer Valley road, back in the day.  They had a band with a bubble machine and everything!  I also went to the old Satisfied Frog in Cave Creek on several occasions.  So this location, 3rd removed just didn't excite me.  

THAT MADE THIS location a perfect one for me to try.  Armed with a restaurant.com certificate, we ventured forward.

I visited with my husband and daughter for the first time last month.  You park behind the building, and walk in the back.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess/server, our name taken.  We waited about 20 minutes.  During that time, darts were played, and the time went quickly.  We sat in a big bench style booth. 

Our server was friendly, and immediately informed us they were out of brisket- bummer!  But we quickly recovered, and  ordered a combination of  items- ribs, burger, and fried chicken, with salad, cole slaw, fries, and mashed potatoes.  Everything was excellent.  

    --They grind their own meat for the burgers and cooked it accurately to order.
    --The ribs had a nice balance of smoky flavor, and were seasoned well.  
    --They prepare their chicken in-house and it tasted home made
    --The cole slaw was really good, and the salads fresh.
    --The fries were addictive

They have a good selection of beers, and they are priced lower than I expected.

Our second visit included my other kids, and because we went on a Monday evening, there was no wait.  Service that night was very friendly and orders included:
Reuben sandwich (tasty!)
Brisket platter (yum!  good, smoky, tender-chewy balance just right)
Chicken Fried Steak special (gravy kinda crazy looking but still good)
Burgers (delish)
Once again, everything was great.

This is a solid 4 star restaurant, for its type of venue. While it may have many of the old Frog features and menu items, it felt like its own place, not a copy of someone else's.  I actually enjoyed my visits here more than I did my last visit to the old Frog in Cave Creek!

 If you haven't been, it's worth a visit.  WE WILL BE BACK, and will use my 15% Yelp discount when I go!

The Grandview Saloon offers several floors of dining and drinking.  The food, if I remember was probably two-three stars, but to be honest, I haven't been there since it got cold.  I think there was a new manager starting who was interested in introducing better wine and food so things may have changed since I was last there in the fall, but either way the service was always friendly and again, the views great.  

It's also been surprisingly easy to get a table outside the times I have gone there--I would have thought this place would be packed all the time. 

Another nice bonus is that it is located next to the Duquesne Incline.  I enjoyed giving out-of-town guests a chance to catch the incline and then have a drink there at the top before heading back down.

This place is definitely catering to the Willo/Roosevelt upscale crowd, and honestly it's a little too nice for me to want to hang out there on a regular basis. It just doesn't feel like someplace I can completely relax.

The espresso was ok- not the best i've ever had, but definitely not the worst. The lemon cake was tasty, but I get the impression that the desserts are not made on site.

It has all kinds of cute character stuff and tchotchkes of the Japanese variety. I've known about the others around town and was curious to see one here in North Vegas by the Costco. I happened to be there on the first day of business since I was next door at Pink Spot Vapors getting my MIL some e-liquid and noticed that the space finally looked open.

If you love Hello Kitty, that's a majority of the cute they have here. From stuffies to purses to lunch boxes to jewelry they probably have it. They also have other characters like other Sanrio characters, cute sushi stuffies, Domo, Totoro and a few cosplay items. They have an area of various bento type boxes, bento accessories and decoration, kitchen accessories, pretty tea and plate sets. They have a small amount of Japanese snacks and a small fridge of cold beverages. 

I zeroed in on the fact they have green tea kitkats so I grabbed a bag of that and they had a small bag of green tea latte kitkats with plain chocolate on the bottom. I was pleased to see a Totoro section as that is one of the few characters that I really have a attachment to. I actually own nothing that is Totoro so the BF decided to buy me one of the stuffed toy/pillows. It's now happily living it's life as my typing elbow rest and scaring the beejesus out of the cat. 

The people working here seem like it's a family and were very sweet. Upon checking out they also gave us a bonus gift of a sandwich box bento. On our way out, each one took the time to stop and thank us for coming in and greeted us goodbye at the door and the last guy to greet us double checked if we got a sandwich bento. Everything you expect out of a Japanese run business - sincere, humble and almost painfully too good to you. 

Super happy there's a place with some kit kats convenient to home. I don't buy a lot of cutesy things, but I can see myself coming here often for the snacks and also I do love bento boxes.

We were very excited to come!

When we arrived, we were not disappointed. The restaurant is pretty casual - a diner atmosphere with food and cocktails that were way better than any diner I've ever been to! The servers were nice, courteous, helpful, and very fast.

So what about the food? It's a tapas-style restaurant with smaller dishes perfect for sharing. We tried the tuna tartare, salmon sashimi, beef carpaccio, and squid - all of them were absolutely outstanding. We finished off with the lemon meringue pie - wow!

It had all of the potential to be a decent spot - there are comfy couches, mellow black lighting, and Middle Eastern music videos on big screens.  However, we will not ever be going back because of the terrible service we received.  We felt like we were intruding and unwelcome.  We were the only ones in the place at about 6p, and when we asked if we could pull up a chair next to a couch, we were told it would be a problem because it would be 'getting busy' (no one else came the entire time we were there).

Upon arriving the place very nice and intimate, the decor was nice and the set as well, the vents did their job, we didn't leave smelling like the restaurant and the good thing is they had some mints on your way out- so your able to tame your breathe lol.  
As soon as we were seated we were promoted by our host/waiter he explained the menu thoroughly and even offer suggestions and explained the 8ounce reference.  You can pretty much order your portion size, 4 ounce, 8ounce, Small and large combo. The best thing is that no matter what size you order they alway give you 8oz of Brisket, which was good with me. That is my favorite cut and it alway runs out fast.  
They have some yummy sides besides kimchi and soybeans.  I absolutely loved their cold soup it had a light nice tart cucumber flavor, and the deep fried zucchini was off the hook (we ordered several extras of that since it only had two) I love the flavor of the soybeans, it wasn't too spicy and it had a nice savory/spicy balance. The salad was a lovely touch, it wasn't too heavy and quite tasty. The potato salad was alway a favorite side dish of mine and I am glad they have it here, a lot of other places we go to don't serve it anymore (not like LA KBBQ)
Onto to our combo, we order a small beef combo, the portion wasn't enough for 3 adults and one child.  My husband and his brother could probably eat that small combo by themselves, so we did have to order some additional dishes.  No problem!  My favorite was the Brisket- and I used this Sauce they had that came with the seafood pizza- which made my meat taste even more amazing! I will definitely order the sauce again. 
The pizza was good but my husband and brother have seafood allergies. So they left it all to me, naturally I wasn't able to eat it all by myself. It was just too much, it would make a perfect appetizer to share with a group of people. My husband favorite side dish was the kimchi potato pancake, he absolutely loved it and order 2 extras!  Gotta love that all you can eat side! 
Overall my experience at this location was good, my favorite place is still Hobak,m. I think l8 ounce can definitely hold its own. A lot of of their stuff did taste different, in the flavor department. I personally enjoyed 8 ounce's soybean paste soup it was less spicy and more savory (good when your starving)
I did love 8 ounces dessert, Snow ice with chocolate shavings was amazing and very delicious, we had to order more because my son didn't get much since he's a slow eater and he couldn't keep up with the adults.

This is great, until a big magnet, or radio or act of jebus decides to tell your car that the chip is not the chip and your car will no longer turn on. Basically, I emailed them to see if they could fix it. I immediately got an email from Abigail Riley saying something generic

Then, I get another generic ""I hope this solved your problem""

""Wait a second, you did NOTHING, how did you solve my problem?!?"" So I email again and am like ""WTH are you talking about NO ONE ever contacted me except for robot you!!""

The custard is pretty good although I prefer the ones at Cantanhede O Bairradino more.  The cheese cake is pretty good as well, and doesn't tastes super sweet.  In fact most of their baked goods don't have too much sugar in them, which fits my taste buds well.

The prices are also super cheap here, and you can get a half a dozen baked goods for under $10.  If you're on the go this place is an decent option when Cantanhede O Bairradino is super packed!",2015-01-14 17:36:02

However the main problem of this place is the food. 
The pizza was garbage. It was tastless, and the flavours didn't really go well together. Also a couple of the olives had seeds in them (really? it takes one second to take the seed out when putting it on the pizza). 
Pasta dish was alright as well. Came out nice and hot, but still lacking in body (no flavour).

I noticed too allot of the veg items seem to be from cans and have a sort of off sour taste to them. wtf?

Also to the management, get your cooks some whites. The least you can do is make them look professional especially when they are in a some what open kitchen.

For my friends Duff's was a legend, ""The best wings ever"" they used to drool -- and then slowly they began to appear in the GTA and somewhere along the line this anomaly just became part of the everyday Toronto landscape.

Now, I still do like the wings -- the sauce is not especially special, but it IS classic and after a number of disappointing experiences with weird flavours elsewhere I'll stick with classic any day.  

The quality and freshness is right up there and I was surprised to read in The Toronto Star's occasional column ""The Dish"" that 10 wings from Duff's only accounts for 539 calories (versus 10 wings from Kelsey's which pack a whopping 1,110 calories) That almost seems reasonable doesn't it?

The restaurant is almost a palace compared to the original Buffalo, NY location -- though the atmosphere has a very pedestrian sports bar feel that kind of makes me wish I was sitting in the original grubby dive... At least that place had some street cred.",2011-02-06 19:28:49

No lie, they were generous with the catfish and the jambalaya had some awesome sausage too. It came with a side of this amazing creole sauce and I needed more, it was so good. The staff was super friendly and asked for our feedback (which of course we told them it was delicious)!!

So it's been a few years and the name has changed, but everything else looked pretty much as I remember it. Literally the booths, the wall art, and the beer options, all seem very reminiscent of what I remember it to be under its previous name.

Beer selection is a bit laclustre (big brands and European heavy choices, save for a few Mill St choices and Junction Brewings Conductors Ale) but averagely priced in the expected $7-$8 realm. Comparatively, $9.50 for a glass of wine seems extreme, but it is a 6.5oz glass so at least its a bit larger than the usual 5-6 oz. 
Food wise, everything is under $20 unless you upsize the steak size of the steak frites. I had a pulled pork sandwich that I did enjoy thoroughly. I'd say its snuck its way into my 10 Pulled Pork Sandwiches in the city.

I've been longing to see them at Severance Hall since a field trip in fourth grade.  So we decided to go to Momocho and then see the amazing Cleveland Orchestra in the astoundingly beautiful, Severance Hall.

My wife made the Momocho reservations two weeks in advance and they were booked solid, except for one spot - the chef's spot.  I didn't know what she meant by that, but when we arrived, we were seated upstairs at a two-seat bar facing directly into the kitchen.  Basically, we got to be close-up spectators of the Momocho cooking show.  It turns out that the chef would talk to us, SERVE us, and entertain us.  It was really quite the experience!  

Make your reservations early.  The website says they're optional, but in reality, they're required if you want to get in.  Momocho does not serve lunch and the lot is always full before dinner, so expect to park down the street somewhere.

The local, tattooed, bandana-wearing chef was very friendly to us and gave us a few free samples.  This included a taste of his very own delicious recipe - bread pudding, and two different margaritas.  He asked us if we had been to Momocho before, and since we hadn't, we asked him to make recommendations.  So, he whipped up some special guacamole for us that he said, 'wasn't on the menu'.  It had onions, garlic, sour cream, bacon, and it was really delicious.  Then he handed us an overflowing basket of fresh tortilla chips, which were tastefully seasoned, and a side of Salsa Verde.  Yum!  The green salsa had great flavor and texture, with a little spicy kick.  The bacon guac was just awesome and they really give you a lot, so one serving is more than enough for two people, if you get a side of salsa too.

For drinks, we were promptly served water and then we ordered some margaritas.  My wife ordered the Mango Margarita and I ordered the Blood Orange variety.  It turns out that the Mango was too 'citrusy,' but the Blood Orange was really delicious!  So on our second round, we both ordered a Blood Orange.

Since we were being served by the comical chef, we asked him some questions about the dishes he was preparing for other guests.  He obliged and made some dinner recommendations for us.  My wife ordered the Carnitas and based on the chef's recommendation, I ordered Chancho, which includes wild boar.  This was my first time trying this meat and I have to say, it was quite good.  I was a little surprised how small the Taquitos were, but whatever, they were good.  The Taquito meat is served over a bed of sauteed onions and a few other veggies, and the soft tortillas are served on the side, which completes the package.

We ordered Flan for dessert, which was creamy and delicious.

The chef told us that Momocho uses approximately 65 cases of avacados per week, so I'm wondering why this restaurant isn't called El Aguacate, or The Avacado, seriously.  Momocho is all about Guacamole.

Our meals were delicious and we vowed to return for another go.  With drinks and tip, our total came to $122.",2011-02-13 13:53:30

Iced Latte - came with foamed milk on top.  Tasted very watered down from the start so I didn't like it.  Not sure how many shots are in it as a standard but maybe an extra one would have done the trick.  I was disappointed with this one. 

Toast Champignon ($9) - it's a puff pastry basket with bacon, mushrooms, poached egg on top with a side of apple slaw.  It all worked and was delicious. You really can't go wrong with bacon. 

Breakfast Crepe ($8) - a crepe stuffed with eggs potatoes, 3 cheeses & peameal bacon.  My sister thought this dish was okay.  The peameal bacon was overly salty for her so she ended up picking some of it out.  I tried it and thought it was too salty as well. Oh well,  I guess you can go wrong when it's peameal bacon. 

So the food itself was good but the overall experience was just okay.",2011-06-16 03:59:37

They seemed to have the same menu items at the same price.  You just order at the counter, and they prepare your dish right in front of you from the assembly line of items.  To us (and other customers in line), it seemed like all of the 6-7 employees behind the counter were new.  Nobody, or very few of them, seemed to know what they were doing.  It took longer than it should have to get through the line, and then there was confusion behind the counter about what containers to use, sauces to add, etc.  The woman ahead of us had a to-go order and she was getting frustrated that they were taking so long to bag and ring up her order.  I know they haven't been open that long, but I think it's been at least a few weeks, and it felt like opening day.  

The portions of food were generous, and everything tasted almost as good as when the server delivers the fresh food to you at Midwood Smokehouse.  My only disappointment with the food itself was that the bacon wrapped jalapenos were a little too crispy, like they had been sitting out under the heat lamp for too long.  But the mac & cheese was fresh and creamy out of the oven, and the smoked meat (despite sitting on a plate for awhile while everyone tried to figure out what they were doing) stayed warm and tasted delicious.  

I was surprised that they didn't have BBQ sauces out at the condiment bar.  Even the Midwood Smokehouse on Central Ave has started offering squeeze bottles of their sauces at the tables.  We each got a tiny half-filled ramekin of a sauce of their choosing with our dinners.  Like I said before, they give you a large portion of meat and, unfortunately, just a tiny bit of sauce.  I had to go up to the counter to ask for more.  Again, it seemed like there was confusion behind the counter.

We tried two of their nigiri - halibut  and garlic tuna nigiri at around $4.25 each for two pieces. Fresh fish, but too much ponzu.

We ordered two cut rolls. The spicy tuna roll was quite spicy but delicious. So was the eel roll. 

Tried the lunch special. You can choose two entrees and it comes with salad, miso soup, inari, tamago, chicken gyoza and steamed rice. We ordered the chicken katsu (cut into six pieces and breaded just right) and salmon teriyaki ($1 extra).

We also ordered three specialty rolls: screaming orgasm, something gone wrong #7, and taste like my x-girlfriend. The screaming orgasm had no sushi rice at all but was very good. Halfway through though, the sauce became too much, especially if you eat the shredded radish under the fish---it sucked up all the sauce. The taste like my x-girlfriend was delicious but also too much sauce. The best was something gone wrong #7. So so good. It also comes in a dipping sauce, but is perfectly yummy without it.

We shared the wonton soup, yang chow fried rice and crispy garlic chicken. The fried rice was really bland and the crispy garlic chicken had an overly sweet sauce that could easily have been orange chicken, general tso's chicken or any other goopy sugar sauce covered chicken. The wonton soup was the best dish of the night with lots of meat, veggies and huge meatball sized wontons.

-Ease. This ain't no Laguardia, and for that I'm thankful.
-Proximity. At least for me. It only takes 10 minutes or so to get here.
-Cleanliness. That's right, something in Cleveland is clean. (I kid...) No, but really, I've never thought it was gross in Hopkins at all.
-Food. Depending on which terminal you're in, there are a whole bunch of different restaurants. In the past year, I have tried at least three new places with semi-healthy cuisine. That's HUGE in an airport. I figure, if I have to pay way too much to eat, I might as well be getting something good for me. There's Currito, this place with make-your-own salads, a fro-yo place, Subway, and more. Also, there's a new Great Lakes in there. The Phoenix Coffee is like an oasis when you're bleary-eyed at 6 am waiting for a plane. And  there's my good pal Dunkin' Donuts, although the service there is scary (see previous review).
-Efficiency. Although I've gotten my gate changed a couple of times, I don't think I've ever had a delay in CLE.
-Parking. It's cheap, at least relatively so. $10/day is pretty good in my book.

The only thing I dislike about this airport is the confusion of the bridge level with the gates. There's a different system in the parking structure and I used to always get lost trying to remember which level I parked in because it's not the same as in the airport. I don't know how to explain it better. Now, I just park on the third level of the parking lot, which is the bridge level to the terminal, so that I can avoid the elevators altogether.",2011-02-09 14:00:53

Was a bit strange but I wanted to try their pizza. I was looking for a big pizza to feed a family of 6. I was told that the large pizza has 10 slices, so I ordered one of those and a medium-size pizza. They were wrong, the large pizza came with eight slices. At least I have a medium size pizza left. The medium size and the large pizza are very similar in size TBH. The pizza was good, a little dry though. The pepperoni with olives was kind of rubbery, but I enjoyed the crust. 

What was really disappointing were the wings. I ordered hot and they are very mild and bland. This is AZ people! We like our food spicy. 

The salad was nothing to chirp about. Shredded lettuce and your typical sandwich toppings made into a salad. 

All in all I paid $50 for delivery and food and feel like I didn't get my money's worth. Also something I feel I need to add, is that the man who delivered the pizza must be a smoker because I could still smell the smoke on the plastic bags that contained our food. Yuck",2017-11-02 00:19:55

I've been coming here for at least 10 years now and we recently came back now that they have finished the renovation. Honestly, it's not all that different, cleaner walls and new video menu boards but the food is still excellent.

The best thing about Ted's is that they grill the hotdogs. This gives them a better flavor than your typical boiled dog. And they have lots of toppings, including mac and cheese, which turns out to be delicious. They also have excellent onion rings and fries, and you can get an order of ""frings"" which is a combination of both and more than enough for two people.

Here's the tip for customers, start looking at the menu when you get in line because the workers won't wait for you to get to the counter, they're looking for you to yell your order while in line so they can get it started. However, a tip for the restaurant is; once you get an order figure out a way to pass it down the line so that people don't have to repeat themselves. This last time that we were there my wife ordered chili cheese fries and no less than four people on the line asked her if she wanted the chili on top or on the side. Figure it out people! Maybe drive over to The Chuckbox and see how they use toothpicks in a code to let the other employees know what customers have ordered.

Knowing nothing about Lawry's, but hungry for steak, I decided to give this place a try.  I didn't know it is a chain and not only that, and it was only until I sat at the table I figured that it is the same Lawry's as the bottles of meat seasoning at any supermarket.

The restaurant is very nice and is a throwback to Hollywood of the 1950's.  The staff and service are excellent and exudes gracious and grand service of the past.  I especially like the waitresses with their retro outfits and the nametags that addresses them as Miss something.

I love a good piece of cow, but I am not a huge eater, so I was a bit horrified to see cooks and waitors moving giant slabs of beef across the room.

I shared a shrimp cocktail (which was good but not great as I thought it a tad over cooked) and a calamari plate (good, but also a bit overcooked) as an appetizer.  When the restaurant has Prime Rib in it's name, you got to order it and I am glad I did, though next time I would probably try the rib-eye steak as it also looked good.

The spinning salad was a bit gimmicky, but it made for a great chilled salad with the dressing perfectly coated lightly in every bite.  The shredded beets was much appreciated in the salad. 

Not prepared to eat an obscene amount of beef I ordered the English cut which is three large slices cut extra thin, it was one of the smaller portions on the menu.  I had it rare and it was soooo good, it almost melted in my mouth.  It would be crime to order your prime rib any more than medium, the rarer the better.
The two types of horseraddish sauce served at the table were a nice touch.  The regular horseraddish sauce was wasabi-like strong and the creamed horseraddish sauce was very mild, almost buttery. 

The potatoes and gravy on the side were perfect, however the Yorkshire pudding was a bit disappointing.  I am a lover of Yorkshire pudding and only had it in the U.K. so I was expecting a light flaky individual portion of pastry bowl filled with gravy, but this was more bread-like and doughy in the middle and the portion was cut from a large bowl piece.  This must me the American version of it.

The final tab was very reasonable considering the amount of food and the quality of service provided.  My share of the tab was about $75 and that included two killer martinis which I requested with their excellent hand stuffed blue cheese olives.

z_fkK2RE12Wg1ooadTEwJA,QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,4,6,3,5,"Went to Lawry's recently for restaurant week and boy was it an experience! This was my first time there and the entire dinner was pleasant from start to finish. 

SERVICE
- Complimentary valet parking (they force you to valet), the guys are quick and courteous
- Reservations desk and hosts were very quick, friendly, and accommodating. We made reservations via OpenTable and had no trouble getting seated right on time.
- Our waitress was friendly, almost jovial, and thoroughly explained everything that arrived at our table. I just find it odd that the server uniforms look very similar to housekeeping, which I'm sure is to maintain the classic vibe. However, the hosts wore crisp black suits and looked much more modern. The clash of styles was interesting to see.

FOOD
- For restaurant week, we got the set dinner for $50.15. It came with the spinning salad, 6 oz. California cut prime rib with broiled lobster, mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding; creme brulee, and choice of coffee or tea. We ordered a side of creamed corn as well. 
- The spinning salad had a creamy sauce that had a strong kick of mustard. The beets and extra crispy croutons made it for me. Otherwise, it's a pretty simple and gimmicky starter salad.
- The prime rib was carved right in front of us. I got a rare and it seemed a little more medium rare. I also ran out of au jus before the meat was done.
- The broiled lobster tail came with half a lemon and melted butter. It was a tad dry but well-seasoned.
- The mash with gravy was standard. The Yorkshire pudding was fairly plain but added a nice change of texture to the dish.
- There were two choices of horseradish included with the prime rib. There is straight horseradish, which is incredibly strong and heads straight for your nasal passage. Then there is a horseradish cream mixture that was too mild. I mixed the two and found it to be the perfect balance.
- The creamed corn was sweet and delicious.
- The creme brulee was pretty basic, as was the included coffee. To be honest, the meal was so heavy that I couldn't even get through half of the creme brulee.
- I just love Lawry's seasoning salt (for the prime rib) and pepper (for the salad). They really enhanced both respective dishes!

AMBIENCE
Entering Lawry's transported me to another time and place, where people swing-danced instead of twerk and cell phones were an afterthought of science fiction novels. It has a very classy feel. Everything is plush and comfortable and makes you feel high-class despite the ""resort casual"" dress code. I am under the impression that many customers come here for special occasions (we were asked if our dinner was a special occasion just about 6 times). I would say this makes a classy and lowkey romantic date spot. Who doesn't like delicious prime rib? 

I would not go here often as the price is a bit steep. But if I'm ever ballin' and craving prime rib, Lawry's is where you'll find me!",2015-06-30 05:00:50

Rolled in dinner time about 6-7pm and it wasnt terribly busy, the patio was open and the weather was hard to beat so sat outside.

The assortment of sweet, spicy, tangy, etc sauces was a good variety as there is something for everybody. My sandwich was tasty as the meat was cooked well and the coleslaw actually was a nice extra to have on this particular concoction. And the mac n cheese with bits of corn in it was on point but $10 for a sandwich was kinda enn.. although good i would like liked to have either fries or a second side for $10. Everybody else seemed to enjoy their food also at my table which isnt easy to do with a decent mixed bunch as we were. Will i come back? Sure maybe to try out this happy hour that i just read up on Arron M.'s review as i like the food but for the regular price i think id rather eat something more filling so if there are specials then count me in that day.

I used to be a regular at this location back when it was Noodle Palace and was so disappointed when they closed.

My Groupon was just about to expire, so I decided to pick up a meal for my fella and I for carryout. I ordered over the phone and the service was so friendly and informative when I had questions about the menu. I came in after work and my food was ready to go. The ladies who worked here were really nice and I was really impressed with the pleasant service. 

I got our meal home and I actually had to wait a bit before my fella got home. I couldn't resist and snuck a bite from each of the dishes before he arrived. Everything was oh so good. I couldn't believe how much the General Tso's ""Chicken"" tasted and felt just like actual chicken. My fella was especially reluctant, but I made him give it a chance. He was absolutely blown away how good it all was. My favorite was the spicy crispy eggplant and the green beans. The eggplant was spicy and delicious. Even better, they offer brown rice instead of white for no extra fee.

And guess what?

There are vegetarian dumplings too! Unfortunately, they're not vegan, and have small pieces of egg in them. It's a steal, at $5 for 15 pieces!

As Tony C. and many others have said, the deep-fried green onion pastry is a great treat to have. Personally though, I like the saltier version at Asian Legend.

The dog park itself consists of three areas and my two huge Golden Retrievers happily make use of both the Swim area and the larger dog run. 

We've been bringing them here for several years (the dog park was often a highlight of our visits from Vegas when we still lived out of state) and while I still love the park, there was definitely a time when it was in better shape. 

Currently, the larger dog run areas are not grassy at all - they are gravel/dirt and this means that when you decide to go to the dog park, you're committing to a dusty, messy experience. My pups don't mind, but my clothes and car usually do :) 

That said, the dock on the lake is a source of endless amusement for my swimmers, and the sheer size of the dry area means that they can run and run to their hearts' content, burning off all of that excess energy and buying me a few hours of rest before they are bugging me for yet another walk :) 

They love to socialize with the other dogs at the park and enjoy chasing balls (even the ones that aren't thrown for their benefit) 

There is one small pavilion area in the main section, and sometimes it is a bit frustrating that owners let their dogs loose and then hang out in the pavilion instead of supervising their pooches. That said, I have yet to experience any truly bad doggy behavior at this park, so it is really just a matter of preference and I'm aware that not everyone's going to do what I think is best! 

We appreciate having such a wonderful park nearby to enjoy.",2013-02-18 06:08:06

Quality of room #1? 2/5 stars and that's only because they included a tiny kitchen. Quality of room #2? 5/5 but that's only because it was a comp upgrade.

Wack, wack, wack! This hotel a.k.a.timeshare is ridiculous for the pricing. I've stayed at station casinos that were more appealinig... even the smoked out south point casino had more appealing rooms than this place.

First, I have never heard of a hotel that charge guests $15 a day for valet. Their response ""we're a timeshare not a hotel so that's how we run things!"" Well excuse me for spending my money to have a Vegas getaway. Anyway, we finally make it to one of our two rooms booked and doing some inspecting we've noticed there's severe water damage to the roof above the shower due to a leaking pipe or something so we decide to report the problem to front desk and the lady I've spoken with said ""ok, so you want me to send an engineer up?"" Wtf is he suppose to do? Wave a magic wand and it all will get better? Lol. As I was on the phone we've noticed that one of the ""kitchen"" cabinet doors was loose of the hinges as well as the swivel make-up mirror in the bathroom so I informed her and she replied ""well... Ok, so what do you expect us to do?"" I kept my calm after that and just ended the call.

Called back in 20 minutes and spoke with the front desk manager Greg who was nice and advised us that our room shouldn't have even been given to us in that condition and he will upgrade our room at no charge form a jr. suite ($99 per night) to a 1bdr suite ($169 per night) with free WiFi for the inconvenience. I appreciated that help after speaking with the rude front desk girl. We had our friends staying in the second rooms we booked and decided to add their names to the reservation so they can check-in and we can go out and enjoy the city since they were arriving later than us... About an hour later we get a call from our friends stating they can't check-in because their names aren't on the reservations. We;re already on the opposite side of town at Aliante Casino trying to eat and was forced to leave dinner to get them checked in. Weird part is, the front desk lady offered to us to add our friends names to the reservations so they can check in without us but it was never done. We arrive in the parking garage 45 min. later and Roy from front desks called to inform us he found our friends names on the reservations and provided them a key so they're settled... 10 minutes later our friends called and stated that front desk gave them a key to our room instead of theirs so now our keys will no longer work so we still must return to the hotel to have it corrected and reactivated. We arrive to the lobby to give them a piece of our minds and have all the keys issued to the correct people and a guy, i forgot his name, advised me ""we could always provide you guys with complimentary bottled water""; what the hell? Bottled water doesn't pay for the gas wasted, headaches, hassle and stress. 

We packed our bags and was bumped to the 32nd floor (3217 to be exact) in a 1 bdr Marilyn Monroe themed suite. Full kitchen w/ dishes and small appliances; jacuzzi tub in the bedroom with electronic shades. Projector in the living room area with a red, cheap leather wrap-around couch. A dirty, obviously over-sexed zebra striped lounge chair but the unit had an all-in-one washer & dryer. Overall the room was good and spacious but the shower head had no pressure and stayed luke-warm. The toilet and sinks had more water pressure smh. The remotes to the 4 tv's in the unit had near dead batteries so there was alot of remote smacking going on lol.

We had this unit for 3 days and housekeeping stopped by to clean at 4pm of our last night so we went without restocking of shampoos and conditioners but no worries since we've learned to pack our own essentials. We were accommodated a late checkout for 5p from Greg but decided to hang it all up at 2p. Checkout was the smoothest part of this whole experience. My good freinds recommended staying here but i can tell the whole experience was a bit emabarrassing. As we drove away from this timeshare/hotel it was the first bit of relief we've felt since we started this vacation.

I'm only giving the place 2/5 stars because Greg was helpful w/ the free upgrade, wi-fi and he bought the 1st round of drinks for my fiance and I. I also was impressed with having security checking key cards at the elevator. Other than that, the pool sucks and they're highly overpriced for drinks when 1/2 their bartenders don't know how to make most of the drinks we asked for which are pretty common. The whole check in hassle was a disaster from the two rooms we booked.

With entry made, we stood a the counter and reflected on the menu.  I knew a sandwich was all I could stomach.  The GF ordered some strips and the Boy ordered up a Spicy version of the legendary sandwich.

The lady behind the counter seemed indifferent as we ordered.  Neither impressed this was our first time ordering or our 10th time.  The GF asked for a sampling of sauces and I am happy that she did....more on that later.

We stood by and the meal was on a tray inshore order.  We made our way to table and I observed a clean and tidy restaurant.

I unwrapped and bite into the illustrious chicken wedged between the bun and....was not immediately inspired by the taste. I tore open the bun to inspect it's geography and was not impressed even though I observed to pickle slices I had missed in the first bite.  After adding a contains of a container of Chick-fil-A sauce did I begin to enjoy my sandwich.

The GF fingers were a great combination of crunchy and moistness. 

The Boys sandwich was as uneventful as mine sans a little spice added to equation. 

It was an A-OK experience and with that we we were on the road.",2015-04-12 21:49:48
pe6zWXcMHKn1cOR_VL7W3w,R4J6GaAsIR6PakJOnHNZVg,x0Ec6gz07SBnWrBOQLisiA,5,0,0,0,I love Chopt I really like the way the salad just seem to taste better with all the ingredients chopped up into smaller pieces. The price can get a little up there for a salad I will admit when you start adding things extra to it. Its super healthily and the staff is really friendly when its your time at the chopping block lol. Lunch time at this particular location can get a little packed but its worth the wait. The have a lot of options and I think they change there menu every 60 to 90 days. Of course they keep their basic salad option but you get to try salads and dressings from different locations around the world.,2017-04-07 16:04:43

the veggie sandwich i first receive was the topping for a burger: lettuce, tomato and onion on bread. that was it. i realized this before paying and asked for some extra veggies, a slice of cheese and some mustard. talk about not delish. but it filled the hole.

they also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill. grilled sandwiches, smaller portions and cheaper prices. i got the caprese: mozzerella, pesto and tomato on baguette, grilled. usually simple and good. this time? not so much. meh.",2010-10-29 18:56:21

The first time we went, I had the Vegetable Soup with Tofu (can't remember exactly what it was called) and my boyfriend had the Lemongrass Soup. When he asked about the Lemongrass Soup, the waiter warned us that it was very ""unique"" but it ended up being EXACTLY what my boyfriend was looking for. 

The second time we went in, my boyfriend again got the Lemongrass Soup (which has beef in it) and I asked if it was possible to make a vegetable/tofu or fish version because I don't eat meat but loved the flavor of the broth so much. They said they could make either one for me and I decided on the vegetable and tofu version. It was SO DELICIOUS! So fresh, so flavorful, mmmm! I was really appreciative that they were able to make that for me!

The waiter is always very polite and attentive which is great.

The only difference between our first and second visit was that within a week of our first visit, the prices were raised. The first time we went, we were quite pleased with the prices. I think my Vegetable Soup was $5.50 or $6, and my boyfriend's Lemongrass Soup was $10. Our second visit, the Vegetable Soup was $7 and the Lemongrass Soup was $12. Since we both got the Lemongrass Soup, it was much more pricey than the time before. It just means that we won't be able to come as often as we'd like! I totally understand a business needing to raise their prices based on the economy and being able to maintain their business. Once I am again employed and have the money to support a business with great food like this more often, I will!! Otherwise, when my boyfriend gets his cravings again, maybe he will take me here! ;)",2012-10-05 19:07:50

While I accepted the odd flavours and choices (lamb brains, truffle pizza, etc), as well as the complete lack of more traditional Italian choices, I felt that...

1. The vibe was cool. You feel like you are going to have a good meal here, even if you don 't.
2. The portions are small. I had a scallop pasta that was puny and lacking in flavour.
3. The service is average. While we were served in a timely manner, our wine bottle and cocktails were removed from the table before we were finished with them.
4. The prices are high. This is fine, but it did not stand out as one of the better 100$ meals I have had in Toronto. Expect to pay 100$ per person with an appetizer, entree, and wine. Maybe more.",2013-10-21 22:01:19

I'm not really a big country music fan.  Yea, I grew up watching Hee Haw, Grand Ole Oprey and listening to tons of KNIX with my Grandma.  And I'll admit to dating a cowboy during the Garth Brooks era.  But country western bars usually push it a bit too far for me.  It just feels like most folks are pushing way too hard to be something they want to be, but aren't.  

The one thing I'll give this place is that I'm guessing a lot of these folks still work the land.  It's up near South Mountain, in Phoenix but just down the road from Laveen where farming is still a big part of life.  Some of these folks wouldn't know a hoe from a ho, but they just like the music.  Or the tight jeans.  Or both.  

It's a neighborhood bar for sure, but it's pretty good sized.  Really large bar, 2 pool tables, a stage area for live music and a dance floor surrounded by high top tables that seat about 5.  No sawdust on the floor or anything like that.  Pretty good mix of folks - aged 25-70, white and Hispanic folks mostly - but what else do you expect at a Cowboy bar?

Read on at your own risk!

My fiance and I went on a double date to BLT on Friday night, 2/13 with my parents.  We were celebrating Valentines day a night early, and celebrating the fact that our wedding plans are coming together little by little... this is the perfect place for a celebration!

The service was over the top attentive beginning with the valet and hostesses to our server, Matt, and everyone in between.  When I asked where the ladies room was, he escorted me there.  Nice touch.  He also acknowledged our engagement as I told them we were celebrating when I made the reservation.  When we were deciding upon which wine to order, Matt offered to send over the sommelier.  While we didn't take him up on his offer, I was still quite impressed!

Since we arrived right on time for our 6:45 reservation, we didn't get to try the ""complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with wizardy spices sprinkled on top"" that Jenn H mentioned in her review.  Bummer, cause I love that stuff, but probably good because I had room more for everything else we ordered.

I skipped the first bread course but I ate an entire popover - the second bread course.  Divine.  Really.  I didn't realize what a huge popover fan I was until I polished that off!

Oh - and I can't go on without mentioning the fact that we had a really tasty smooth and savory bottle of Cabernet that went well with everything we ordered.  OK - on to the apps...

I had the raw oysters, my dad had the fried oyster special, and Jared had a spinach salad.  Of course, we shared with my mom as well.  Actually, come to think of it, I think they shared theirs but I'm not so sure I shared mine!

We did share our sides, and each one was better than the next... creamed spinach, glazed carrots, and stuffed mushrooms.  To go with those, my parents shared a T-bone steak (cowboy dusted I think), and Jared and I shared a Kobe Ribeye.  It was ahhhhhmazing!

We were way full after all of that food, but we were celebrating after all, so we decided to share a dessert which my family allowed me to choose.  I went with the blueberry-lemon merengue.  My dad didn't like my choice, so he requested a chocolate peanut butter mousse as well.  On top of that, they brought us some complimentary espresso chocolate petits fours.

Can you say food coma?!

BLT was an experience... and I enjoyed every second of it.  I highly recommend BLT for a celebratory meal or dinner/drinks if someone else is footing the bill!

Lastly, in case you didn't know ('cause I didn't before I took a BLT business card), BLT stands for Bistro Laurent Tourondel, named after Superstar Chef Laurent Tourondel... and there are several other BLT concepts across the US.",2009-02-17 22:50:09

I perused the display and marveled at all the really exotic concoctions including 2 of my favorite flavors in the world: pandan and kaffir lime.

We ended up getting a box of 9 truffles (totaling $27). I've eaten the pandan and the kaffir lime. Hmmm.... I don't know. The kaffir lime was pretty good with a hint of the lime aroma. However, the pandan didn't quite work with the chocolate for me.

I'm waiting to try the one with balsamic vinegar, another with chili, and yet another with fennel and anise.

Right now I think what I've eaten is good. Definitely above average as far as chocolates go, but, they were not mindblowingly good. I still love the taste of Valhrona. Will report back regarding how the others turn out.

UPDATE: Here's the run down:

Buddha's Leaf (pandan): didn't do anything for me. I keep expecting a hint of salty taste to it.

Kaffir Lime: was quite pleasant with a hint of lime

Balsamico (balsamic vinegar + hazelnuts): was so-so, couldn't really taste the balsamic

Budapest (Hungarian paprika): this was okay. Hubby said he tasted the paprika, but it was like as if I was about to taste it and then it disappeared. Disappointing.

Red Fire (ancho chile+ cinnamon): This was awesome. I totally tasted the chile peppers and there was no heat to it, just the great aroma of chile. So far, my favorite. 

Black Pearl (wasabi, ginger, black sesame seeds): couldn't really taste any of the ingredients. Tasted just like regular chocolate to me with sesame seeds on top.

Greenhouse is widely known for its emphasis on local foods and being a green restaurant. Since they've gotten a lot of attention over this, I was excited to try out this gastropub... finally!

They're located in a trendy part of town and the decor is amazing -- lots of reclaimed wood, repurposed bikes, etc. They also have rooftop seating, though when we went on a Sunday for dinner, they were only serving cocktails there. (We also missed the happy hour b/c it was patio week.)

We sat outside on a breezy fall Sunday and ordered lots of food! The 3 of us shared the chicken wings confit, clams, the summer cioppino (pasta) and the animal style frites. 

The chicken wings were a nice twist on barfood. Pretty flavorful, but beware -- it's pretty fried/crunchy. The clams were ok -- the sauce was a little too buttery/starchy for my taste, but we tried to do a good job cleaning it up with the bread. I think my favorite was the summer cioppino -- little round pasta with heirloom tomatoes and a creamy base. Finally, I'm a little weakling for fries, so I had no complaints for fries w/ cheese, legit bacon, eggs, etc.

Bartender Billy works graveyard so you can only catch him working Monday-Thursday midnight until 8am. Billy Rocks I can guarantee there is no other bartender in this city that is as cool as he is or has the personality that he does!

He is friendly with a great personality and provides great service, I don't recall being without a drink at anytime during our visit which is the best!

So the dinner consisted of several pieces of beef, rice, salad and Afghan bread.  It was so tasty.  The beef was tender and flavourful.  The rice is basmati rice, but the grains are much longer than I've ever seen in my life.  The rice is also seasoned nicely.  The salad is actually 2 types of ""salad"" a diced tomato salad and an iceberg lettuce salad.  Not all that tasty but a nice accompaniment to the meal.  The Afghan bread (called naan, but very different from Indian naan) is a teardrop shaped flat bread that it not oily or buttery.

- The owners are friendly and accommodating (e.g., they agreed to my request of half-rice, half-salad in my poke bowl)
- They offer BOGO (buy 1 get 1 free) poke bowl every 21st of every month 
- They are really generous with their servings, with my poke bowl packed with not just a generous helping of sides but even the main protein (I got unagi and was expecting just a small piece but it almost covered the whole bowl)
- They have a greater variety of stuff versus other poke places I've been to, trying not only for ""more"" but also for ""more creative"" (especially with the toppings). For example, for protein they offer lobster, king crab and unagi besides the typical stuff. For sides and toppings, they have things like inari tofu, Japan style cream cheese, ube rice,  meat floss, spicy Cheetos flakes. And for sauce, they have lobster bisque, black truffle mayo and apple jelly.

This all sounds awesome, so why was I left wanting? Well, to put it bluntly, the taste was average at best. For example:
- I got the unagi poke bowl, which was overly doused in unagi sauce so that I really couldn't taste the unagi itself 
- My wife got the tempura shrimp poke bowl and she said her tempura was blandly flavoured and ratio of shrimp-to-coating wasn't good
- Cool sides/toppings I talked about earlier didn't live up to expectations, for example: ube rice didn't taste any different, black truffle mayo sauce had no truffle taste, the overly generous helping of rice drowned out the taste of the rest of the sides

So all in all, given the taste was average and on the more expensive side relative to other poke places, I'd give it another shot only during their BOGO promo on the 21st of the month. Otherwise, I'd go to Poke Eats just around the corner for a better poke bowl.",2018-03-23 11:02:36

- The VIEWS ARE AMAZING. Absolutely breathtaking. The coolest part was laying on the balcony overlooking Scottsdale. Also, taking a shower with a wide open look of the Valley. 

The negatives: 
- I wish there was a private Spa entrance. I dislike casinos and walking through a cigarette cloud to a Spa day is yucky. 
- There is not a private Spa pool. 
- It is not easy to get ready after services - there are no places to sit in front of mirrors and there are no Q-tips, etc. In fact, I finished getting ready in my car, where I dropped my eyeliner, it smudged all over my pants and I was looking silly at the birthday party I went to after. 
- The mani/pedi didn't have a massage component. 

To recap, beautiful views are unparalleled. I can't wait to try Orange Sky at Sunset. If I was staying in the hotel, I would be lucky to visit the Spa. Since I didn't really like the whole casino thing, I probably will stick to Camelback Inn (surprise, surprise).",2011-04-18 16:00:24

A fan of Shawn McClain dating to his Chicago days and a truly impressive experience at Sage it was with high hopes that our party of four paid a visit to upscale pizza parlor Five50 after the disaster that was Yellowtail and while I personally enjoyed the experience more than my companions it would be exceedingly difficult for me to recommend a $30/pp pizzeria with awkward service as a place to visit in a city where far better pie can be found off-strip at a fraction of the price.  Featuring a slice counter plus a handful of primi, pasta, salads, and desserts alongside 16"" pizzas cooked in a 550 degree oven the ""style"" of McClain's signature pies falls somewhere between traditional New York slices and a Roman lightly-leavened 'crunchy' crust but with ingredient quality meeting the standards set by Sage the results were largely impressive save for the excessive use of oil and salt marring the Truffle and an unannounced red sauce lending a peculiar barbecue note to the North Beach.  Faring better, a simple Margherita assuredly displayed the restaurant's sourcing with tangy tomatoes and fresh basil while the Blanca shined largely to a thick dollop of house-made ricotta on each slice.  Moving past pizza, a sampling of the cannelloni proved to be my favorite savory of the day, albeit slightly overpriced at $18 for two pasta tubes stuffed with tender pork and topped with creamy Bechamel plus meager truffle shavings while a trio of arancini presented a unique riff on a classic by substituting house cured pepperoni for traditional sausage and pairing it with thick, aromatic aioli.  Never happy to leave a restaurant without dessert, a final pairing arrived at the table in the form of a small apple pie with accoutrements both sweet and savory alongside fried brioche cubes paired with sour cranberry sauce; both sweets trumping any of the savories and a saving grace at the end of a meal that fell short of high expectations.",2013-12-24 19:35:38

I'm glad we did because we ended up next door at the sister site, Tapas 24 Snack Bar, and had a great time - but we almost walked away from Tapas 24 all together. We work in the area and are regular patrons who tip well - target market I would think - but no one cared when we walked out. When we arrived at tapas 24 restaurant, we were seated promptly by the hostess but none of the staff could tell us what the difference was between Tapas 24 restaurant and Tapas 24 snack bar (which are beside each other). The atmosphere was very uncomfortable. We had the impression that we were imposing, like they didn't want us there. There are no 5@7 specials to attract customers - the place was empty. Next door, at the snack bar, we discovered that there are 5@7 specials and a way more welcoming atmosphere. I will still patron Tapas 24 snack bar but I'll never give the restaurant another go. I don't want to sit through an extremely uncomfortable dinner, thanks. Plus, if the waiters can't explain what the difference is between the two restaurants who are clearly affiliated then they lose credibility. The hostess was outright rude - but then again I'd probably be cranky too if I had to wear a dress that tight and constricting.

First impressions... I am a big fan of Park Rd Shopping center and it's recent face lift of all the storefronts.  There's a lot going on in that shopping center as far as construction and changes - still is a little hard to maneuver due to the 'choice' folks that decide its a great idea to create their own traffic flow.  But I digress.

Chopt is ""sandwiched"" (see what I did there... okay... not that funny) between the big players Rite Aid and Harris Teeter.  It's got some outdoor tables and fairly large indoor dining space.  Tables can be pushed together for large groups.  There are booths too.  The interior is very modern and I'm a fan of the large spice art on the wall.  I don't know if the spices & sauces on the wall are linked to geographic locations where they first originated, but I'll keep staring at it until I figure it out.

Navigate your way through the dining space toward the back where the line starts... AND THERE WILL BE A LINE (just to forewarn you).  I may start coming at an off peak meal time.  Don't get me wrong, the line does move, but I would rather be eating my salad than listening to the person behind me complain about how too many boys are liking her at the moment.

There are a couple of pre-set salads you can choose from, but the ability to customize your salad is probably the way to go here.  I was a noob, so I tried the Mexican Caesar Salad (appears on their ""first time favorites"" section of the menu).  Seems like one person starts your ""base"" as far as the greens and major salad components... then you are shuffled over to a chopping station (1-4) where you wait in line again to talk to your salad finisher.  This is where you add the dressing - ""say when"" and the chopper uses what I would call a sling blade (but it's not really) to chop your salad to whatever consistency you would like.  Once your salad is ready, they scrape it all back into the container and you go wait in the register line to pay for your salad and any other drinks you would like... you can get bread at this step too, but I declined.

I don't even want to see this place during peak lunch/dinner time... it must be crazy... I definitely like this place a lot better than the salad place (similar concept) in Chicago I recently tried since there is WAY LESS yelling... could be the reason why the line doesn't move as fast, but I'd rather keep my nerves and eardrums in check and have a small wait versus the alternative.",2016-06-08 13:02:24

Different types of fish sashimis rolled in soy paper and wrapped with a slice of cucumber. Soy paper was a substitution. I recommend this option because the soy paper is light in flavor, unlike the regular seaweed wrap which might take away from the freshness of the fish inside. This dish comes with five thinly sliced lemon slices. The lemon is for garnish but I definitely recommend eating it with your sushi. The acidity of the lemon paired up very nicely with the fish and leaves a refreshing palate craving for more. This dish only comes with 6 pieces! I wish I had ordered more.
*Screaming Orgasm-comes in small and large options, sliced tuna atop of a huge bed of radish drowned in sauce. Tuna was drowning in the sauce; took away from the simplicity of the fish. This is a signature dish of the restaurant. Maybe I came on a bad day? Probably won't order the next time I come here.
*Deep Fried Gyoza-I usually like my gyoza steamed then caramelized for some color and texture. But this one was too fried for my taste. Came with a side of gyoza dipping sauce.
*Kiss of Fire-This dish was drenched in spicy sauce. I couldn't taste much of the contents within because the sauce was overpowering. Reminded us of a Mexican enchilada dish almost. If you do want to try this dish, ask for easy sauce.
*Dancing Eel- We asked for easy sauce for this sushi roll since the Kiss of Fire roll was disappointing. The eel tasted fresh. Simple roll, nothing too special. 

The decor and uniforms that the waitresses wore were very cultural. I loved every bit of it. The waitresses were super sweet and greeted everyone with a smile. They wear kimonos head to toe and have their hair in a traditional Japanese up-do.

WRONG! 

Do you have any idea how hard it is to cook eggs that are THIS BAD? Perk in Scottsdale makes it simple. First they take old eggs that were fried up yesterday and reheat them in the microwave, then, sparingly dump a few old and gross vegetable pieces inside and slather the eggs in dirty grease. Make sure to leave out any salt or spices and flavor to ensure a disgusting experience. 

disgusting, greasy, flavorless, microwaved. I'm almost positive my health has been temporarily compromised by a simple omelette. I would be very embarrassed if this was my restaurant. Very, very sad, and I am entirely disgusted.

Seriously. How do you f*ck up an omelette!? A Blind monkey could cook a better omelette while doing cartwheels on a space ship. Also, their plastic fork cut me. Everything just seems to be the poorest quality possible. I seriously couldn't make this stuff up.

Overall a great night and I'd go back again, but would probably just choose 2 or 3 dishes for myself to keep the price down, rather than sharing so many dishes. Portions were all over the place so I'd suggest asking the servers for recommendations about the size of the plates and how many dishes to order!",2018-05-28 00:06:23
S73UdWcDrAGNXyBppYsTRA,LTnCcTKbS-SBQlFGJ5Jm7g,qGC_GE-1fnjVvfzpu_Lbkw,4,1,0,0,"My family and friends LOVE this place and come quite often.  I can comfortably say I have been to Yang's at least twenty times.  That said, the experience is generally a hit or miss depending on the time/day you go.

Food Quality & Price: Family and friends find the quality of this AYCE restaurant great.  Personally, I find the quality of the fish it slightly better than average but nothing award-winning or anything that stands up above the rest.  The price is also very average for your typical AYCE LUNCH sushi buffet. The menu is sizable... but I really can't say anything more than it is just average to me. I never got food poisoning if that helps. DINNER on the other hand was a disaster.  NONE of the dinner items were worth the price.  Hokkaido scallops were full of mayo, beef sashimi was just ... sliced frozen beef (the sause had WAYYY too much ginger)... at $22 a pop, please avoid dinner here at all costs. 

Facility: Located off HWY 7, it is pretty easy to find (intersection has traffic light) but parking can be very annoying.  It is in a plaza and parking is often full. Inside, the decor is ... okay, but I find washrooms to be dirty... and it doesn't help that the TILE  IS LIKE A MIRROR.  So if you are in one stall, you might as well wave to the person next to you with their pants down. Decor is mediocre...

Service: A few years ago, service was TERRIBLE, easily a 1.5/5. As others have mentioned, some servers avoid you like the plague, the run off as soon as they bring food, and it takes forever for them to notice you (even to give the check).  However, as of late, it seems that the service has stepped up a bit.  There are a few waiters that still do that, so it really depends on which waiter you get. Out of the 20+ times I've gone, I believe only 1 time was a blown away by service with speed and smiles. Food always arrives rather quickly, but table clearing not so much. But service at dinner is laughable. The waitress got our order wrong and forgot to replace it... we waited almost half an hour for our sashimi and only after we prompted them did they go and check. The only saving grace was a woman named Carmen. She took the reins and showed how important competence is in the restaurant business. Servers need to be trained better, perhaps Carmen can whip them all into shape? 

Overall: I know it will not be the last time I eat at Yang's (I have no idea why my family and friends love it so much), but for the price, it seems like the ""default"" place to go. TVs are permanently on CHINESE television (Fairchild), so it really does NOT give even the remote image of being authentic Japanese. I am not sure how much more specific I can be in this review to describe Yang's lunch service other than... ""average"". Avoid dinner like the plague, so many other places to go to for Sushi dinner.

EDITED: We returned at a later date for lunch and was served by Carmen.  She was incredible.  If the rest of the staff were just like her, my rating for Yang's Kitchen would be an easy 3.5/5. She carries the entire floor and picks up everyone's slack.  It really seems like she's the only one working... if anything she really seems like the only person concerned with quality control at all.

Later Edit: I have come back to revise my review and bump my rating up to a 3/5. Since my last edit, I have gradually returned (at least 5 more times). The restaurant has been renovated and the menu updated.  I think that the someone from the staff does read the reviews here on Yelp since improvements have been made to some of the troubling parts of the establishment.  I cannot comment on dinner (since I have decided never to go back for dinner) but the new updated menu is great, sushi is fresh and appropriately sized, service is fast, plates are cleared and any concerns are taken care of immediately.  I continue to sing Carmen's praises, she works the floor SO efficiently it's like magic. The ONLY problem now is the mandatory 10% tipping on all bills. I understand including tip for large groups, but if you're going to include tip on the final bill, I probably won't leave you anything. It's a TIP for a reason and I probably would have left more if they hadn't taken the liberty to decide for me.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Definitely have the Salmon Rose/Sushi/Sashimi. Other great dishes ""Mango Roll (new!), ""Enoki Mushroom Beef Roll"" and ""Beef Tenderloin"".",2012-09-28 16:27:45

No need to drive far for dinner entertainment with the family. It's located next to Kung Fu Tea, intersection of Rainbow and Warm Spring. It was behind the Metro Diner so don't miss it. Plenty of parking spaces around. 

Heath was our server and two thumbs up for him for his great service. He was very thorough taking our drinks order (8 of us, 8 different drinks!). The lemon for the water had a weird taste, so he changed it right away for us. He provided us with a tentative, friendly, quick and an effective service. 

It's a pretty big restaurant where they can accomodate up to 135 people inside. They three sections: hibachi sections, sushi bar or regular dining tables. The place is clean and well maintained. 

No sushi tonight, we had Hibachi instead. Love the creativity the hibachi Chef. He made dinner so fun for the kids and our whole crew. Who would not love to eat  Erupted Volcanoes Onion, Dissapeared Jumping Eggs or Choo choo train made of Onion? 
 
Here is the recap of our dinner tonight:
- Appetizer: Yellowtail Hamachi with special yuzu sauce, a hint of sriracha and topped with jalapeno. Fresh and spicy! Yumm. A must try. 

- Entrees: Hibachi
It comes with soup (clean broth miso with seaweed) and salad (iceberg with ginger sauce) 
For the meat we chose: Lobster tail, Salmon, Chicken and Fillet Mignon. Love the lobster tail, salmon and fillet mignon, they were fresh and cooked perfectly. The chicken was overcooked. Dry and hard to chew. 
Hibachi also comes with mixed veggies: mushroom, onion, broccoli and zucchini. 
Additionally, hibachi comes with fried rice (cooked at the hibachi table according to your taste). As option, you may also add shrimp or other meat to the rice. The fried rice was tasty. 

- Desert: vanilla mochi and green tea ice cream. Perfect. 

Would have give this place a 5 stars if the chicken was cooked perfectly. But overall, we had a great dinner entertainment and I prefer their food than Benihana, especially when their price is better. Would come back again, possibly for Happy Hour (I saw they have great variety of Happy Hour Menu).",2017-09-29 05:21:49

The menu feeds into my new obsession with chopped salads - they have 3 different kinds:

Smoked Cobb Chop  - house smoked turkey, roasted corn, chopped red pepper, bacon, avocado and blue-brie cheese on romaine with ranch and a fried egg

The Not-So-Original Chop - arugula, cous cous, marinated roma tomatoes, crunchy corn, currants and papitas. comes with choice of house smoked turkey or chopped avocado with creamy basil dressing.

Quinoa Chop  - arugula, quinoa, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, papitas, currants, and parmesan cheese tossed with truffle oil dressing

I went with the Not-So-Original and was impressed with the portion to price ratio. The dressing was really good, I need to recreate that recipe at home.  I sat outside on the patio and sipped the wonderful iced tea and enjoyed our gorgeous February weather. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the Chops.",2015-02-12 18:54:24

Why go to this place when there are at least a half dozen restaurants in the area that offer similar quality food at less price? -- where else can you have the unique experience of having Chinese dim sum in a (non-Chinese) mansion? 

Dim Sum Style -- order from a dim sum menu, no push carts. Because the food is prepared fresh after you've placed the order, it's the way to go. 

Quality and Selection -- ""standard"" selections plus a few speciality creations like Sticky Rice Dumpling with whole conpoy (dried scallops), chicken fillet with lemon grass, etc. I really like steamed rice noodle roll with dough fritter and dried scallops inside (the menu says ""deep fried dough w/ conpoy), the fritter is perfectly crispy and the rice rolls moist and silky smooth. 

Service -- attentive enough. The noisy level seems to be lower in this restaurant compared to other Chinese restaurants, so if you want to have a quiet conversation, it's possible.

Otherwise, the Sheraton does not have much to offer. The rooms are quite small, though well-appointed.

The toiletries provided include mandarin and mint shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, mouthwash, soap, and even eucalyptus shave cream. 

The rooms do not have refrigerators or microwaves, which is a huge inconvenience. Additionally, the air conditioner is unable to keep the room cool. Every time it turned off during the night we would wake up sweltering, and then fall back asleep when it came on.

As for the customer service, David A. at the front desk took several steps to meet a special request I had. He and the manager Amit were patient and very helpful.

Atmosphere, service, location 3.5/5
The place is big and generally has seats to relax. The only annoying thing is when people talk loudly on their phones or webcams. The service is alright, I usually clean up my own plates after eating. There is ample parking in the plaza. The one thing that really annoys me is I've experienced three times where the utensils they give me are really dirty and they dont seem to clean the spoons and forks properly. Really disgusting but it hasn't happened the last few times I've been to Panera Bread.

Food 4/5
You get what you paid for at a decent price. This is comfort food, not restaurant food. They've recently changed the menu since it's switch from the summer to fall season. 

I always enjoyed their summer corn chowder soup. The mac and cheese is usually sufficient cheesy. Sometimes though the cheese is all liquid, which is disappointing. I always order their hazelnut coffee (weird how they got rid of small size cups). Their bear claws are alright. For sides I order their chips, which are sufficiently salty.

Their bbq chicken flatbread is decent. It reminds me of eating a taco. Their bbq chicken mac and cheese is no good though in my opinion. The sweet of the bbq sauce mixed with the cheese is upsetting to the stomach and a weird combination.

I treat Panera Bread as an upgraded fast food restaurant with good seating and cozy atmosphere. Overall this location isn't as bad as the one at Shops of Don Mills since that location has pastries that are half the size of this location.",2018-09-03 00:35:01

Anyway, I went with a fellow Yelper to Honey Pig for dinner.  He wasn't too hungry and settled for something from the soup menu, but what we were hoping to order was some good olf fashion traditional Bibimbap (which was not on their menu). After debating if I was hungry enough to order AYCE or try to find something that appeals to me from the rest of the menu, I went for the dinner AYCE.

There are 2 items that you can only order once (basically the short rib meat that has been filet, so no bones to deal with and some other cut of meat which I can't recall at the moment).  And they have everything you cam order from the lunch AYCE plus (....)

For one person, I think HP's AYCE setup is not really to my liking.  You basically order everything by the dish (same arrangement as Tofu House), and not like Wooche or Sura (you get a plate and load up on whatever suits your fancy). And it is hard to finish everything on a plate by plate basis as a lone AYCE diner, unless you have a voracious appetite like mine. Even then it was really pushing it to try and sample everything.

Hopefully next time I will be back with a group, so we can divide and conquer and try each and every item, including the 2 that were unavailable when I went.

Pluses:  
1) If you are lazy or prefer to have your food cooked for you, this is the place.  The waitresses can do all the cooking and you can concentrate on the eating.
2) Very good exhaust system. No worries about coming out smelling like BBQ. Very helpful if you are here for lunch and have to go back to work for a few more hours.
3) Reasonable price, food overall is good.
4) The special metal pan used for BBQ is pretty cool, and food does not really stick to it.

Undecided:
1) Their Teriyaki Chicken does not taste like what you would think a Teriyaki Chicken to taste like (after it is cooked).  It is basically a spicy Korean interpretation, which is okay. I might like it more if it is called something else.

Minuses:
1) They were out of some items on their AYCE menu.
2) 2 items are limited to 1 order.

Location: Very convenient for those that can get to the Chinatown area on Spring Mountain. In the same strip mall as Pho So 1, WooChe and Big Lot.  With plenty of parking, although the closest ones may not be readily available when you go during mainstream lunch and dinner times and also on weekends.

They are open 24 hours, but AYCE is only available during certain hours (for dinner it ends by 10pm).

Last up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.

A group of 4 of us came to 3030 on Friday night and the place was pretty full. For the atmosphere I give this place 4 stars. 3030 has a down to earth feel, the kind of place you can hang out with friends for hours drinking and chatting. The space is pretty large and doubles as a music venue with a small stage towards the back. On this night they had 2 guys doing their best to play some background music. I absolutely loved the pinball machines near the entrance; it gave the place a retro feel. There is also a shelf full of board games for those who want to have some group fun, yet another awesome feature of this place. The beer menu was pretty good and consisted of a variety of local craft beers; this is always a plus for me. 

Despite the good atmosphere the menu failed to impress, I give it a generous 2 stars. The group of us ordered 3 dishes off the $5 tapas menu. The veal sweetbreads were disappointing, they tasted of nothing but salt and the portion size was laughable, just 4 really small pieces of meat. The mushroom tart which should have been easy to execute was depressing, the mushrooms were dry and bland, the only taste I could pick up was a hint of thyme and the phyllo it was served on was clumpy, another miss. The butter chicken wings were the best of the 3 but that is not saying much, these were 3 drumsticks (why not serve the whole wing?) that were surprisingly bland for an Indian inspired dish. All in all the food was disappointing and IMO didn't match the atmosphere of the bar. I think a simple tapas menu more conducive to sharing would be much better.

The service was pretty good, our waitress checked up on us regularly but table service in the bar area stopped after 11pm which was fine except for the fact that one eager bus boy kept trying to clear our table. Overall I think 3030 is a nice neighbourhood bar to grab some drinks but I would recommend you skip the food.",2012-12-30 19:55:20

This was a late addition to my Restaurant Week lineup.  I'm so glad I made the change.  I was warmly greeted at reception and asked to wait until one of the people who seat you arrived.  A short time later, I was taken to my table through what appeared to be a maze of small hallways and dining spaces.  I was seated at a table in a section near the bar that was L shaped.

Soon, the server, Carmen, arrived and she asked me about drinks.  I ordered an iced tea and that was brought quickly with a small container of simple syrup.  I had studied the menu online and I knew what I wanted except for the main course.  I asked Carmen for her advice.

For the first course, I went with the stir fried spicy quail with fresh lily bulb.  The dish was prepared with Chinese 5 spice and chili sauce.  It had a really nice tang but it was not overpowering, just very good!  There were two legs and 2 wings--a very ample serving for a starter.

For the main course, I went with the stir fried venison with spicy yellow bean sauce.  There were three thin slices of venison in a great spicy sauce.  With the venison, I was served two sides--a small container of fried pak choi with garlic and a small bowl of vegetable fried rice.  Carmen brought me a knife and fork for this course knowing it would be easier to deal with the meat.  I had requested wooden chopsticks (they don't have them) because I am very poor at using plastic chopsticks.  Things slip off plastic chopsticks very easily even when I'm just looking at them.  I'll have to bring in my own wooden ones or my screw together metal chopsticks that were a gift.  Again, the dish was spicy but it was not overpowering spicy.  It was quite enjoyable.

There is no choice for dessert.  You get a passion fruit panna cotta with, as the menu says, citrus supremes, guava gelato, and blood orange sorbet.  Carmen had me listen to a crackling sound when she first brought the dessert.  She wouldn't tell me what it was but said I should try it and we'd talk about it when I was done.  I had two things in mind for what it was.  I was correct with the second idea.  They put some pop rocks on the panna cotta to make a bit of a texture play.  The panna cotta was very good.

To sum up, the food really is the ""dog's bollocks!"" (Thanks R).  Portion size was just right and they downsized the sides because I was dining alone.  The room is delightful--not one large room but made up of many smaller areas.  The restaurant really isn't all they big in the great scheme of things.  Service was excellent.

Before bringing the bill, Carmen brought me a coupon good for $50 on my next visit as long as it's used before April 10.  She said, ""It's like having your dinner tonight for $.14.""  I will be back and use the coupon.  I have to do the sea bass which she said was their most popular dish and is excellent.  

One short aside:  I can hike in the desert where there's no trail.  Leaving last night without an escort, I ended up almost in the kitchen.  Then I realized I had almost made a complete trek around the outside ring of the place.  I did make it to the door and was somewhat embarrassed getting lost in the small space.  It's a like a maze!

I'm glad that Restaurant Week gives me the chance to try some new places that I normally wouldn't.",2014-03-11 19:46:17

Lindo Michoacan, Faustos, and Agave can't compare because they don't have the Molcajete. From what I understand, Molcajete means volcano in Spanish. This restaurant's signature dish, ""the Molcajete,"" is served in a black, heavy volcanic rock that looks like the mortar, as in a mortar and pestle (that you pound herbs with). The rock keeps the meat moist and it's decorated with tasty fillings for a fajita. My favorite amongst the fillings is the roasted cactus which looks like a green pepper. They also serve this with big chunks of Mexican cheese--the white, crumbly stuff.

I always order the chicken molcajete without the red sauce because I'm prone to heartburn. One order provides two meals, easy. 

Molcajetes is kid friendly. There's a jukebox loaded with Spanish music that bumps pretty loudly at night. Do not buy the DVDs from the kids that offer them out of their book bags.",2010-04-26 02:09:57

For the first time, recently, I went here during the day and had lunch and it was just as good, if not better, then our night time drinky-snacky hangouts, which prompted this review.

I could nit-pick this place a bit (the live music at night is overbearing and not my thing, it's loud enough in there as is, and I'd much rather talk to friends than hear a live band) but the service, drink selection, atmosphere and food quality totally negates any issues one might have.

Highly recommend and will be back many many more times I'm sure.

We came for lunch in a group of 8.  We ordered a variety of food from both the lunch menu and the regular menu.  As I only ate mine, I solicited opinions from others about their food.

I ordered a sushi set with California rolls ($14) from the lunch menu.  The quality of the raw fish and rice was good, and was on par with MiNe from across the street.  The fish slice of the nigiri sushi was thinner than I like.  For the maki, the protein to rice ratio was good.  Both nigiri sushi and maki rolls were loosely put together.  For the nigiri sushi, the fish slice seemed to be simply snapped on top of the rice.  The maki rolls kind of fell apart when picked up.  I rated the sushi set 3.5 stars, mainly due to the freshness.

A few friends also ordered some of maki combo lunches.  One said his rolls also came apart when picked up.  He said he would rate it 3 stars.  

A friend ordered a sashimi set ($16) from the lunch menu.  The sashimi was thick, and the colour looked good.  She said the freshness was average.  She rated it 3.5 stars.

A friend ordered a don with beef short ribs.  She *loved* her don.  She said it was tasty, moist, had lot of meat and other ingredients.  She rated it 4 stars for quality and taste, plus 0.5 stars for the large portion.  And indeed, the don was big enough to feed a man of big appetite.

A friend ordered an inexpensive Osaka Okonomiyaki (pancake) from the dinner menu ($7).  It was big enough to serve as a lunch for a person of small appetite.  She rated it 3 stars.

The average score of the orders above is 3.5 stars.",2016-03-26 08:10:55

The owner truly does seem like you are bothering her by entering the restaurant. That has no bearing on my rating though, as I am purely reviewing the food/value. 

I was very disappointed in the entrees and the prices. $10+ for bland pad thai and curries? Really? Add three or four shrimp for $2 more. What a deal. 

The spice level was typical of Americanized asian restaurants. I was expecting more authentic heat based on previous reviewers but 4 stars was very mediocre. So if you like spicy, either go elsewhere or request additional heat to the four stars. 

Pad thai noodles were mainly starch. Little meat or vegetables. Pad lao was akin to the pad thai-- and the squash/coconut curries lacked flavor and protein. I should have expected such based on previous reviews, but I had to try it for myself. Won't be back.",2014-04-11 11:47:04

For the most part, it didn't disappoint! You don't realize how pervasive cigarette smoke is here until you get to spend time in a smoke-free hotel. The whole place smells wonderful! 
Check-in was a breeze. The agent was hell-bent on finding us a better room than the one we originally had. We went from a mountain-view room to a strip-view, considerably higher up in the building. Since Trump offers free late check out (4 pm!), there may be a small wait until your room is ready. 
After rocketing up to the 47th floor (holy moly, those elevators are speedy!), we headed to the room. A tip: there will be one set of double doors with two room numbers on it. They lead to a foyer, with separate doors for each room. We were thrown for a minute, not wanting to walk into someone else's room, but no worries. 
The room (a one bed studio) was very nice. Comparable to Caesars or the Venetian. As with a lot of these places, you find chips and scratches in most of the furniture (I ended up with a splinter because of that, so watch it!). Maybe I have a weird obsession, but the bathroom was definitely the best part! Gorgeous and very well-appointed. The tub...oh goodness. Enough room for you and 3 of your friends, with jets! FYI, it takes forever to fill. There is a separate, glass enclosed shower, which will also accommodate the friends ;) The TV in the mirror is a nice touch!
Each room has a kitchenette, complete with pots, pans, utensils, a blender, glasses, etc. 
Two downsides during our stay: First, they provide down pillows, which, as far as I'm concerned, come straight from Satan. Miserable. Second, there is no self-park, which is fine. In its place, the hotel provides valet, again fine. Except the whole situation is so poorly organized. There's no order, so cars are sitting around willy nilly. Because of this, it takes quite a while for your car to get to you. It would make much more sense to have designated lanes for taxis, incoming cars, outgoing cars and a through lane. Instead, there are no lanes, so it can be a mess. A 20 minute wait for your car is not abnormal.",2013-04-01 02:40:44

The BBQ  is the same concept as Shabu Shabu. It's a la carte which I like because I like tasting a little bit of everything. I'm also trying to watch my diet so I take a little bit of meat at a time and make sure I don't overdo it.

We got the pork belly, beef and kalbi ribs. They provide a bunch of different types of sauces to dip your meat in but I didn't need it. The meat was really marinated. So much so that it was too salty for my taste. I had a side of fried rice which was good. 

I ordered boba again and the pearls were undercooked. 

The service is attentive and friendly. I love the prices. For everything we ordered, and I was full, it came out to $28 for dinner and that included two drinks.

Places that you, your parents, your grandparents... heck even maybe your great grandparents know about and respect for what they do. Moishes is one such a place. A place that evokes a certain timelessness and yet still works to this day. Up until last week, I had never been to Moishes. Yes... I know. A combination of factors really. Chief among them is that I am not really a steakhouse guy. I love meat but I can't tell you the last time I actually ordered a steak in a restaurant. If given the choice, I will always select something else off the menu. Steak is one of those things where I don't really see the point of paying a high premium. Just my perception but one that makes me choose to spend that money at a different restaurant than a steakhouse. 

Moishes has a late night menu where for 25$, you get a entree, a main and coffee/tea. A steal of a deal... and a great way for me to finally try them. So away we go. The late night option includes the normal complimentary pickles, coleslaw and bread which at the time of our reservation was a welcomed sight. Add my usual old Fashioned cocktail and I was ready for a good late night meal on the Main.

As appetizers, we selected the salmon tartar and the caesar salad. Both were competent solid dishes. The salmon was not over-seasoned with just the right hint of dill. I would have liked it to be a bit bigger though. The salad portion was good and the dressing was the right combination of flavour without being too rich and creamy.

As mains, we went with the steak frites and the filet mignon poutine. The steak was perfectly cooked to order. The cut was leaner and thicker than the typical steak frites you get at the many restaurants in and around Montreal which was a slight surprise but good regardless. The fries were nice, golden and plentiful. Good crisp and seasoning as well.

The filet mignon poutine was something I had been curious to try and came away quite satisfied. Same golden fries as above topped with pieces of filet mignon and melted cheese. A very rich and filling dish. The real key here was the perfectly melted cheese that binds everything together into a delicious mess. Definitely a dish I will be having again.

My first experience at Moishes was a good one. A place where you see the attention to detail that 75 years in business provides. Great service from beginning to end, a nice dining room space and great food. I admit to be a little surprised to see how casual of dress some of the patrons were... especially when compared to the tables where people were in suits and dresses. Moishes is a place where I feel like a dress shirt is a requirement at minimum but regardless.... I waited a long time before finding coming to Moishes. The wait won't be that long next time.

Nothing worse than your air conditioner giving up in the middle of a very hot summer...oh wait!..yes there is..having to wait five days to have it fixed!

"" mr M. The compressor is out and the unit is old, we recommend a new unit and we have them on sale."" But instead he gave me the very good news. It was some very small part that had burned out. He told me he was going to the shop to pick up the part and that the ac should be fixed in about two hours, that turned into days of me calling them and them giving me all kind of excuses like we'll be there tomorrow, the part is hard to find and it was finally ordered from out of town.

We wanted to go when the sun was not shining because my husband is a redhead and we wanted it to be cooler.  But we got stuck during the rush.  And while we did get some good food while we were there, it wasn't worth the ticket price (but if the beer we drank was free, then it could have worked).  Some trucks were prepared, others weren't.  I'm not really surprised the the trucks that have been around longest were the ones that lasted at the festival (short leash comes to mind).

I was kind of disappointed that some of the trucks were handing out samples that aren't even variations of what they regularly serve.  That bugged me. 

The fry bread truck right near the entrance was fantastic and had a long line to prove it.  They totally could have used an extra hand and maybe not have given people so many options.  Just hand them the food and make them move on.  That being said, the pork and green chile was soo good.

My mother in law has us over for dinner last night, but didn't want to cook, so she placed an order with Zoe's and dinner was made! 

We had a Greek salad which was HUGE! Fresh and tasty! One drawback however, they forgot to give us the salad dressing, no worries though, we whipped up our own. 

Next up the rice pilaf, it was pretty good. Maybe a tad over cooked, but the flavor was good. 

Lastly, the chicken kabobs! HOLY YUM! They were cooked perfectly. I don't like tomato's in the slightest, but I went ahead and tried one from the kabob and proceeded to eat 4 more tomato's, these things were insanely amazing! 

Good job Zoe's, thanks for making dinner a snap! :)",2010-12-29 17:36:15

Matcha latte (hot): it's in a good size mug. I thought this was good, not great. I wished it was a tad bit less sweet, a bit more hot temperature wise, and more of that matcha taste. 

Ginger raspberry dan tea (iced): this was refreshing! It's great for a hot day for sure. It was nice that there were actual bits of ginger in the drink 

Rainbow roll: this was my least favorite of the desserts we got. It was plain. Not much taste to it and it was on the dry side. I will not get again. 

Lychee cake: this was my favorite! It is a tad bit sweet but I like that you can taste the lychee. I wouldn't mind getting this again. 

Matcha strawberry cake: this was eh also. The cake itself didn't have much flavor. Honestly, the only flavor I was able to pick up was the fresh strawberries that was used as garnish.

I have never had an issue with the service here and the food has always been amazing.  I was just there last night to take advantage of the cantina happy hour special on tacos.  I got one of each.  One BBQ beef brisket, one Southwest chicken and one carne asada.  Each was excellent.  The carne asada was the slightest bit pink which is just the way I like it.  It was so tender.  I had juices running down my arm.  The closer it gets to the elbow the better.  This made it about 1/3 of the way there. The margarita I ordered, though served in a beer mug (shrug), was good.  It was refreshing.  The chips are thin and crisp.  The salsa is blended and a little bit soupy but with a mouthful of flavor, it matters very little.  I have had a few different enchiladas here.  I have seen some unique chili relleno's that you don't see anywhere else.  It is not just the standard cheese stuffed fried pepper.  The same can be said for the enchiladas.

They gave a reasonable portion of shrimp and they were the nice large ones which accurately reflected it's price.

-comfortable yet classy atmosphere
-very friendly and attentive service
-menu: surprisingly none of the pizza combinations sounded especially appetizing although I'm sure they're all delicious. She went with the roasted veg and I chose the margarita.
I must say, I have had better thin crust, authentic Italian pizza in the city. The centre to crust ratio was off. (Lots of crust and not enough dough in the centre so it was soft and floppy in the middle.) As well, there were only two small basil leaves on my entire pizza. I guess basil leaves are hard to come by these days. My friend have her pizza the stamp of approval.
-HUGE disappointment: I asked for extra sauce for my crust, NOT because there wasn't enough on the pizza for the average person but because since I was old enough to eat sauce I have loved it and like to douse everything, especially a pizza crust in it. However, when I requested a little bit extra I was refused. I even explained that it was prepared fine I just personally like extra on the side and they wouldn't budge. I do respect the chefs, their vision, and that they wish to execute their work in a specific way but it also must be understood that they are serving patrons and if we leave dissatisfied or worse, unhappy, it's their reputation on the line.

I wouldn't give them 5 stars because I think their portions could be a little bigger for the prices. However, it's a consistently good place to go for Happy Hour or a late night snack. I usually get the Fish Tacos or Charcuturie Board and a Moscow Mule which does come in a copper mug.

The Vig in Arcadia is probably my favorite because the patio is really intimate and Holly Pyle and House of Stairs play there sometimes. That really makes a boring Wednesday night fun! 

This Vig location also has a really nice patio but a totally different relaxed vibe. 

One of the reasons I'm writing this review is because I saw this Vig location being criticized as ""not family friendly"" on another online forum. There seemed to be some fundamental misunderstanding that because there are a lot of families in the McDowell Mountain area that it ""should"" be a family restaurant. That is completely ridiculous! 

This Vig location is just like the others, mostly a bar. And it was set up to accommodate adult guests that might be biking or hiking in the area as a place to relax and chill. I don't know why someone would think the fundamental nature of the restaurant would change because of the location. So just in case you're wondering...this is an upscale adult drinking and dining environment.

There is really no bad seat in the house.  We've sat in every level and corner of this place and not once did we complain about our seats.  That doesn't mean this place is perfect though.....here are a few things that prevent this from being a 5 Star experience:

- Parking.  I hate that most of the parking is located 100 ft above the ground level in an elevated parking lot.  Yes, there are some lower level spots, but 1/2 of those are reserved and the other 1/2 get taken very quickly.....so it's not worth driving all the way down there.

- Food quality.  The food options here are great....Nachos, Philly Cheesesteak Sandwiches, Bratwurst, Polish Dogs...etc.  However, half of the time they're not cooked properly (too cold), or the Bread/Chips taste stale.  I wish they could get this together, because when it is on....it tastes great.  It's failing in the execution somehow.

- Post game traffic management.  There is none.....which means the parking lot is a free for all.  At least the Thomas & Mack have people directing the traffic post-game....here, everyone just makes a mad dash for the exit and of course everyone turns into a road rager because there's no respect for each other.  A few off duty cops working the exit would help this out tremendously.

Overall, we enjoy the games here and will come back again.

After hearing lot's of good things from people who live in nearby condo's, we ordered some take-out for a group at the office. Good quality sushi / sashimi at a low price... but with limited selection.  

Take-out is the only real option as there is no real seating. Some small tables outside in the summer but thats it. Not very practical if you want to eat out but probably a good idea for the condo crowd. Food was ready quickly and the call ahead order process worked well. 

We ordered multiple combos to share and many of the stand alone rolls. I found pricing to be on the lower end - especially for the downtown core. 

The sushi was pretty good and given the lower price level, it makes for a great value proposition.  I was a little disappointed with the variety, but what they do have, they do well. It doesn't make my top sushi list but that's OK since it also costs much less.  

The sushi & sashimi was very fresh and the portions were generous. I think the sushi actually had too much rice but that's a minor complaint. The spicy tuna rolls were excellent and I really liked the spicy sauce. Those in the know ordered extra spicy sauce to use on other rolls. 

The base combos only include the basics -  Salmon, Ebi, White & Red Tuna and either california rolls or spicy tuna rolls. You get more salmon than anything else.

A good option if you live downtown and want takeout but just not practical if you want the total dining experience.

I got my hair done in so many places before and never have I had my hair treated so well. I had my hair done by Todd the legend but seriously and honestly - every person there who touched my hair is absolutely a professional! These people are no joke.

Maybe my expectations were too high waiting for so long to check this place out, maybe my mood wasn't conducive for installation art, maybe the fact that I got lost and frustrated not being able to find this place that easily turned me off...maybe, maybe, maybe - there are countless maybe's but at the end of the day I'm just not into it.  

It's a lot smaller than I expected and while some of the installations were cool that's about all they were .  I think I like the type of art that makes me think, and while I can appreciate things that are cool, they don't leave a lasting impression on me.  

Some installations that I enjoyed included the one in a dark room that had the projection on the 2 windows that morphed into these interesting shapes and perspectives.  And, I also enjoyed the hands with breads and the polka dot room was fun.  

Maybe the fact that it's in a very residential area and the museum itself is in converted houses, made me feel creeped out a bit.  Like I was in a scary movie that takes place in a carnival or house of mirrors with some very weird stuff going on in it.",2012-04-16 17:03:22

I only saw her sprinkle The m&ms on top, but they must have been mixed in too because I never ran out. Had the perfect ice cream to chocolate ratio! 
They also had 1 dairy-free option if anyone is looking. If was a lemony type sorbet icee. 
Main downsides were they only take cash (though they do have an ATM), the lack of lighting in the parking lot where the picnic tables are, the pot-holed parking lot and the looooong lineups. Not a single one of those would ever stop me from coming back though - loved it!! 
The line moves super fast anyways ;)

There was a drum set, I assume there's live performance at night?!

  For an additional $7, you can upgrade your pasta to a set with Soup of teh day, Salad , garlic toast and a slice of cake.

 Since we were only there for Lunch, we skipped the combo but our pasta still came with a salad

  Nori Fries $6
~ fresh cut fries tossed with homemade Wafu dressing & Japanese Seaweeds
~ This tasted amazing, definitely a lot better than I expected with the flavorful. The nori was very crispy and fresh which is you would think it's among the definition of nori but you would be surprise at how many places have them soggy which makes it incredibly difficult to tear through when it's in bigger sheets. Love how they left the fries skin on and was very crispy and was perfect with the touch of Wafu dressing

  Shiso Clam Vingole $15
~ White Wine, Olive Oil, garlic, bacon, tomato, fresh Manila calms & shiso
~ I really love their presentation but thought it look a tad try but once we dig in, we realize that it was perfect. Light and refreshing with the prefect amount of flavor and need I mention that the garlic toast was perfect (^_^). But I have to say the clams weren't the freshest.

  Shrimp Okonomiyaki $14
~ Spaghetti sauteed w/ bacon, onions, garlic dressed shrimp, homemade steak sauce, Japanese mayo & bonito fish flakes
~ Don't you just love bonito flakes, it'll move when sprinkle on top of hot dishes.... unlike the clams, the shrimp here was a lot better and the flavor here is a touch more intense than the previous one with a slight tang to it probably from the Japanese mayo.


  Black Sesame Creme Brulee $6
~This was from the Special on the black board and this was just so good that I would come back in a heartbeat just for this. I have gotten over creme brulee and tend not to order it, but I'm always attracted to special flavor like this one (remember the Jackfruit one I had here)
~The sugar crust was just perfect although the black sesame doesn't make it the best looking but it tasted define. The custard itself wasn't overly sweet and packed a ton of black sesame flavor

Although I love their pasta, I find it a tad overprice and for a guy, it wouldn't be enough for dinner.

Not too much of a selection. Menu consist of appetizer, rice, noodle soup and seafood.

Along with that, she also suggested Rice Combo Platter (choice of short ribs or pork chop but you can get both for $4 extra) and Oxtail Fried Rice. 

Oxtail loco moco was good! Not like the Hawaiian loco moco that I imagined it to be with the buttery gravery. Gravy itself had a vietnamese twist with pieces of cilantro. There were plenty of oxtail inside which was super tender. All of this deliciousness with sunny side up egg....perfection.

The pork belly arrived secondly and it was tasty over the steam rice. Lastly the garlic noodles were totally a miss - horribly greasy and overpriced at $13.95! The waiter apologized for the poor service and offered me complimentary coconut ice cream dessert which took some time to receive since he never advised the waitress who only showed up once after bringing the wrong soup so she had to confirm the complimentary ice cream with the mangager!

Bo3DMZ_ou-TTg2TyYWLHgg,alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,QgdO29fGB-eBNe1BzHR7YQ,4,12,5,6,"Review for Afternoon Tea

I came here in a party of five for a pre-wedding celebration. They do afternoon tea sets from 2-4pm on weekends only -- reserve in advance because it can get busy. When we were there there were lots of birthdays, family gatherings, and other groups.

There are a variety of choices from the ""classic tea"" to sets that have cocktails or champagne. We just went with the classic tea ($38 per person). Our server brought out a nice box of teas - 12 kinds. She clearly specified which were caffeine-free, low caffeine, and regular. There were some herbal teas, oolong, green tea, and black teas. She left the box with us for a few minutes so we could smell the different teas. I went with the vanilla rooibos which was perfectly sweet and didn't need any added sugar. 

Then the savoury bites came out, beautifully presented. My favourites were the smoked salmon croissant and mushroom quiche (there were also meat quiches, I think with bacon). The raisin scones were quite good too, although I'm not a fan of raisins. The portions are mostly bite size and look small, but it's deceiving... It actually adds up to a lot of food! I was glad I skipped lunch so I had room to eat everything. 

Next were the sweets. There were so many things we couldn't finish... There were a variety of flavours, definitely something for everyone. The winners for me were the opera cake and lemon meringue tart. 

Everything was very well done and fresh. I had a much better experience compared to the last time I had afternoon tea which was at the King Edward Hotel. Service was good. We sat inside and when I asked if we could sit on the patio, the server was very serious and apologetic, stating that they do not serve afternoon tea on the patio (something about the wind blowing things away, or the clotted cream melting in the sun... apparently the chef was quite adamant that it's an indoors only affair...). Overall, a lovely place to spend an afternoon. It's not cheap but for a special occasion it's worth the splurge.",2013-07-29 03:59:45

I ordered  the meat skillet which includes 4 pieces of either bacon or sausage I asked for half and half which the server happily agreed to, it also includes deep fried potato chunks, cheese , peppers, onions, choice of toast and of course 2 eggs cooked to order. 
Food came out rather quick as there really wasn't that many customers inside , I was 1 of 3 tables, the food although plain looking tasted great , the eggs were cooked a perfect over medium , the potatoes crisp and piping hot , the bacon a perfect crispness ( and tasty ) , the sausage equally as good , my only beef with the meal was the peppers and onions were a little over done and limp ( maybe pre cooked ?) and the cheese was sparse and barely melted, which I don't know how because food was hot , ( obviously bagged and maybe not natural ) I see that in a lot of casino type cafe places as a way to keep costs down , but when you are serving a good product the ingredients should be up to par as well ( that's my opinion) but all in all I definitely would be back maybe to try one of their burgers next time and all in all for 8.99$ it is a great deal and I left full !!",2017-11-15 09:20:31

On Saturdays the restaurant closes at 12 midnight, but then it turns into a nightclub with a dj or band. Last night they had a dj. The cover is $10. My gripe was that I stood on line for over 30 minutes and when I got inside... sure the bar and dance floor areas were crowded, but the back was pretty much open. 

I don't know how much the drinks were because I'm not much of a drinker and I drove.. like to be responsible and not get myself into questionable situations. I met friends there, which was also frustrating since they got there early for dinner and stayed.. I couldn't find them for the longest and then they pretty much wanted to leave since they were smashed. We stayed about an hour or less after my friend found me. Lol I'm not sure how late the club is open or even if it's every Saturday or sporadic Saturdays. Just used my name!! :-)

What was absolutely amazing was the price. I have recently been trying to transition from AYCE to higher quality a la carte restaurants. I tend to overeat at AYCE and create crazy unwanted stomach problems for myself (TMI?). Anyway, we ordered a Combo C, which comes with brisket, bulgogi, skirt steak, pork belly, and lobster or short rib (we opted for the short rib after hearing from friends that it was the better deal). This also included the usual banchan (kimchee, fish cakes, salad, potato salad, etc), kimchi pancake, cheese fondue with veggies, and choice of soup. I had a long a week, so I added a bottle of rice wine to my order. My husband and I also ordered our usual diet sodas.

We used a Groupon as well, GREAT deal for what you got, and what a gorgeous day to sit outside. Agree, the staff tries to be absolutely the best (familiar with other Dressler's restaurants, Jon does a great job of hiring the right people. . server wise). We were there for an early dinner & it was not crowded whatsoever. Our server, Richard was clearly proud to be working there and offered many excellent selections. However, there was what appeared to be a *manager* who wanted to make darn sure that nobody received any special treatment. We enjoyed chatting with our server, Richard, who was an absolute sweetheart.  As I said, the place wasn't crowded (most people sat outside, the inside was about empty). You'd think they were packed to the gills considering how that *manager* (cranky and rude) kept stopping by our table & others to bark orders at the servers. What a creep - despite the great food (calamari, crab cake, lamb chops, Cesar salad, lamb (a bit fatty - REALLY) and a delicious halibut dish, that *manager* was a crank, had the staff unsettled and actually dropped a bill in front of me after we'd already paid ours and included a generous cash tip. Our server quickly said he'd already taken care of the bill, so the creep who dropped HIS bill right in front of ME (not my husband) just said ""oh"" and picked it back up. . .I wonder what it would have had written in it!

Hope this guy isn't a relative of Jon D.'s. . .who is renown for putting his family to work (his mom makes the BEST DESSERTS!!!).

I've now visited Didar five times. I really love this place because it never fails to impress newcomers. During my last visit,  I ordered an assortment of delicious Indian food for the table: lentil soup, chana samosa, vegetable pakoras, chicken pakoras, four types of naan (plain, garlic, stuffed with chicken, stuffed with potato). The chicken pakoras and the garlic naan were our favourites.

For our mains, we ordered a sizzling platter of chicken tikka, spinach stew, manchurian chicken, chicken tikka masala, mango chicken and jalfrezi chicken. Our favourite curries were the manchurian chicken (first time trying it and we were all impressed) as well as the chicken tikka masala (my go-to order), and the mango chicken (deliciously sweet and savoury).

It was dry and could have been cooked with more water. The meat jun and kalbi were my favorite. The mandoo was very crisp and the filling was predominately meat. It was not just a bunch of veggies and noodles like other places. The spices inside was spot on. I might just order a plate of this the next time I go.

The staff is knowledgeable and they help you out. I've bought several corsets from this store (corsets with plastic boning to leather with metal boning). I bought one corset (leather) for a concert and I stood out in the crowd *(woohoo!)*(which was a great thing to me at least)*lol

 I do have to agree with the previous review, Do not unlace your corset or else you'll have a grand ol time gettin into it again. Also, don't try to push the corset to the limit ,ie... squeezing into them (how small of a waist can I get?). A friend of mine did that and her corset didnt last that long (even though I told her not to do that).  These corsets will last you a while if you take excellent care of them. Granted, the leather ones will last a bit longer than the fabric ones.

Boas! they have colorful boas! Heck I got boa to match my corset! What more can I ask for? Well, Technically I couldve bought a whole concert outfit at this store!

Park Central Deli seems to be one of the major draws for nearby execs on a tight schedule, but I personally don't see the draw.

The interior is enormous. There is enough seating for a massive amount of patrons. A metal guide rail is in place directly in front of the order counter. Now, I'm not the smallest guy around but I'm definitely not the biggest either. Making my way down the counter along the guide rails left me feeling a little claustrophobic. After placing your order, you can see the crew directly behind the counter as they slice fresh cuts of pastrami, corned beef and barbecue beef. Watch them prepare your sandwich before your eyes, pile on the french fries (and a pickle). 

The cooks move fast. I've dined here during the week and I felt like a mouse being guided through a maze. If time is of the essence during your work week then this may be a good option. The price for a sandwich and fries was a little steep, however. It tasted alright, but even as I write this I can still feel it sitting like a brick in my stomach. If you have a sensitive digestive tract, this may not be the place for you. Pastrami and corned beef are fairly fatty and you'll pay the price... all day. Come prepared with some Tums.

As with other Firehouse Subs this one has that (obvious) this place is made by firefighters feel. From the dalmatian spot tables to the firefighter jackets hanging behind the place where the employees are working.

I did wait about 10 minutes for my sandwich to be made. That IS a little long considering this is a sandwich place competing with other places like Subway that make sandwiches pretty darn fast. It's kind of weird to me that sandwiches come out that slow considering how many employees there are working behind the counter. However - all sandwiches are warmed up so maybe that is where the extra bit of time comes into play - I'm not sure. Even though the wait was a bit long I LOVED my favorite Hook & Ladder.

While I waited I got a few hot sauces, and there are plenty of them. Do not miss getting some sauces to put on your sandwich. I personally like the Firehouse Subs signature sauce, it reminds be of Batch 88 from Quiznos.

As most Torontonians know, the city is mostly deadsville anytime before lunch so seeing a light on and a friendly face at 8 am on a Saturday was like seeing a mirage on the desert. Bonus!
The patio out front has a sign warning, 'No Laptops on the Patio' which we later asked about. Apparently there is a problem with space out there in the summer so laptops are banned which makes more room for people watchers I suppose. No need to look at your screen in Kensington. Inside, there is a front space for sitting just before the bar area.
The bar is great! I love when surprises happen, and the fact that Cafe Parmenar is licensed and sells cocktails is a fantastic bonus.
There was some funky instrumental 70's music from Japan playing on the speakers which the barista talked about as she poured my latte. Very inspiring.

Came in for Ocean Prime's $40 Restaurant Week deal.  I've never been to OP, but I went in thinking I'd try the seafood.  However, after looking over my very limited choices (two seafood choices, $24 to $27, and steak), and at the suggestion of the server, I ordered the filet mignon ($32) , w/ the first course of side salad.  I arrived at around 15 minutes to 7p, but by the time I was seated by a host, served water, offered food and wine menus, greeted by the bartender, and then met my server, it was just past 7p, and I'd missed happy hour, which ended at 7p.  I was told that I could order happy hour apps at the discounted rate, but not the drinks.  I decided to forgo apps and alcohol and ordered my meal.

I really liked the atmosphere at the lounge area (dinner seating next to the bar), even though it was a little too dark for my liking.  I felt that the room should've been a little smaller to match the intimate setting, but whatever.  Besides two couples, a lone diner, and me, the room was empty.  Outdoor seating looked inviting.  

As I started to relax in this dark space, I decided to try the Strawberry Smash, realizing just minutes before receiving my table check that the drink would not be offered at the happy hour price of $7!  At $12, it was just a tad pricey, but considering the atmosphere, it was not bad.  (Honestly, I was expecting a lot worse!)  I'd definitely come back for happy hour!

I was getting hungry, and it was almost 7:30p, so I asked if complimentary bread was offered (yes!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=7_-HKOKCU89N1xGIymWorg.  The sourdough roll that appeared seemed a bit too small, but again, whatever.  It had a nice bite, and it came w/ whipped butter.  My cocktail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=ZJNXrNmhMWUDKJU5PJzC2A was simply delicious!  Just sweet and tart enough for me not to notice the potency of the alcohol within- perfect!  Side salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=c0OWt3dKEA311b6sPgy-DA was nicely portioned, and tasted great.  Loved the combo of goat cheese, tiny bits of walnuts, and tart Granny Smith apples.  Had to forgo the mustard vinaigrette due to an allergy, but the sweet house dressing (wine-based w/ ""lots of sugar"") was good, if not a bit too sweet.  A taste of this dressing was enough.  The filet mignon (medium temp.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=_zUDU5iVZaQWfXp_Im1s5w was tiny, but cooked to perfection!  The roasted garlic was buttery and potent and complemented the potatoes.  However, I would never pay $32 for a 5 oz. steak, with only the roasted garlic on the side!  Never!  Last, I had the creme bruleehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=WucqsiKbTkzmz7X2huxBxg w/ berries.  I really enjoyed this dessert!  Very creamy and perfect in its texture, and the berries meshed nicely against the vanilla custard.  I'd have liked a bit more berries, so I stole the drunken strawberry from my cocktail and had it with a scoop of the brulee... ahh!!  My one complaint w/ the sweet dish?  The sugar coating was VERY thick!  It had to be about a quarter of an inch thick!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=CMfhGJdpG66djDTo35SNiw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=Oct9Oo6WCdzZg3hzYHGnGw Most of the brulees I've had had crusts just thick enough to muster a cracking noise when you lightly tap it w/ a spoon.

But you know what's good, so you'll order it with the french toast, which is made of brioche, and breaded with panko. I rolled my eyes forever at the reviews here, but I must admit they are well-deserved: that must have been one of the best slices of french toast I've eaten. I recommend eating it with the cranberry sauce.

We chose Samba because most of the other participating restaurants weren't offering very appealing menu options or a particularly good deal (a lot of restaurants upped their menu to $30 or even $35!!).

The salad bar had many delicious options as usual. The pineapple was great, and probably my favorite part of the meal. Though I don't usually enjoy a meal of just meat, I have liked my meals at Samba the past 2 times I have been there. Last night, however, was pretty disappointing for several reasons.

1) The meats seemed a little more underdone than usual. The LAMB was bloody! I can understand serving beef rare or medium-rare, but LAMB? Especially if the meat is not made to order, I feel that erring on the side of medium is far better than assuming everyone will be happy with bloody meat.

2) No real variety in the marinades/seasoning. The lamb, flank steak, and chicken all had sweet marinades. I really dislike my meat to taste sweet, and was really upset that 3 of the 6 meat options had sweeter marinades.

3) The other 3 meats were so-so. The sirloin was cooked beautifully, but tasted like plain beef. No salt, no pepper, nothing. The parmesan pork tasted yummy, but was really dry and hard to chew. I did not care for the pork sausage, but I didn't like it the last 2 times I came here either.

4) The gauchos cut really bad cuts of meat. The piece of lamb I got was 90% fat. The 10% that was meat was inedible as it was so bloody.

This place has so many options: sandwiches, soups, crepes (both savory and sweet), smoothie. Where to begin? Since I was looking for a late lunch/afternoon snack, I opted for the Veggie Crepe, which is a savor crepe with sundried tomato hummus, lettuce, red peppers, cucumbers.  

Unlike some of the other reviews, I found the service to be great. The ladies behind the counter were really nice and they answered my questions about the food. My food was then served to me very quickly after ordering. Granted, it seemed like a slow afternoon so maybe it's different when it's busy. 

The food was tasty. It wasn't anything spectacular but the hummus was good and the veggies were fresh. My only critique of the crepe would be that it was served with what appeared to be a ranch dressing on the sides as well as on the crepe itself. I'm not particular found of whatever the sauce was and would have preferred it wasn't on the crepe at all. I would have asked for my crepe to be served without it had I had known there was going to be sauce on it. The hummus adds a decent amount of flavour to the veggies so an additional sauce is not necessary. 

The crepe was about $7, so it was decently priced for lunch. 

The food was good and fresh and the atmosphere was great. I'll definitely return in the future. It's nice to have an independent café in a sea of Timmy's and Starbucks. 

I'm rating it 3 stars only because it was decent but nothing really outstanding. I look forward to trying more items here.",2013-08-26 21:41:39
mVNZ5QbmRbG_B3yMmpq4TA,ljdo6-BZlywsF5RiGd5e5A,CmGiqR21BH7d6rsoBd-XSw,3,1,0,0,"I love me a greasy spoon meal every once in a while.

Today was one of those days.

Chiara and I were strolling along Dundas West in Toronto's Junction neighbourhood this morning and popped into The Purple Onion.

I'd heard about this popular greasy hotspot from another friend of mine, who claims to be a regular.  She's gone a number of times with her husband, her kids, with girlfriends.....to me, it sounded like a versatile place that everyone would like.

And so this rainy Sunday morning, Chiara and I walked in and were directed by the busy yet pleasant hostess/server to ""take a seat wherever we wanted."" All the booths were taken, so we opted for a table near the window. As we sat at the table that looked like it belonged in an office cafeteria, we noticed that there were about a dozen more people who came in just after we did. All tables seemed to fill up within 5 minutes of us arriving. Popular spot for 9:40am on a Sunday morning.

It was just what we wanted at that moment. The busy waitress with an ever-present coffee pot, the menu listing All-Day breakfast options and other diner comfort foods, ketchup, HP Sauce and salt and pepper shakers right on the table. What a perfect place for a morning girlish gab session.

The tables were full. The coffee was hot. The French toast was tasty. Families were there with their babies in high chairs, elderly locals were reading their newspapers, young couples were nursing their hangovers from last night's partying. What a strange yet familiar mix of people who all seemed to love this greasy spoon that, once upon a time, may have been an office. (One can tell if you look carefully at the decor, structure and lay out of the place)

The place isn't fancy, but the food was tasty and cheap. If you crave bacon, eggs, pancakes, French toast, home fries, sausage and all of the other breakfast delights that you can find in a traditional greasy spoon, this is your place.

Apparently there are options for lunch and dinner that are just as tasty. I plan to back for more. I mean, I just have to try the steak now, right?",2014-11-23 21:15:00

The decor was surprisingly not as tacky as I imagined it would be and the service at the bar was very good. We did have to wait longer for our reservation. It was a laid back atmosphere with excellent service. 

As far as food goes, I would lean toward the seafood dishes and getting a number of small plates. They are also excellent about splitting entrees for you. Of the small plates, I particularly like the tuna poke. The enchiladas are just okay, but their dipping sauce is very good. The lamb and cockles were very good. Eastern Shore Sea Scallops, Mussels and Littleneck clams was excellent. Crispy duck breast, creamy cornmeal grits, charred mustard greens, chili gastrique was good, but I found the sauce a bit on the salty side. Portions are quite generous. 

As far as desserts, the creme brulee was the best. The bread pudding okay, but a bit too egg-y. The chocolate cake was meh. The texture was too dense and dry. I think they need to soak the cake in rum. 

Wine selection was a bit disappointing. I would have like to see some South African wines considering that this is a African / Carribean fusion theme restaurant. Though I had a glass of the Carmenere and it was quite good. 

Overall, I was quite pleased with the place. It would be nice for a date. It is a bit spendy on a grad student salary. It came to approximately $200 for the 4 of us with a couple drinks each, tax + tip.",2008-02-17 23:26:33

i came in here with the bf looking to try something new. i noticed right away that this place definitely had the mark of inexperienced or first time owners. plenty of tvs but very light on the actual beer on tap. i did like the layout: high tops for just meeting with friends, the bar where you can stop in for a beer and a slice, and the nice seating area for when you want to sit down and enjoy a long evening with friends. staff was extremely friendly and they were very happy to have anyone walk through the door. all around a really nice atmosphere.

now for the food. as i mentioned above, the pizza was just alright. we got a simple pepperoni pizza (medium i think). it came out fresh and hot from the oven however after biting into it, i think it could have stayed in the oven for another 3 or 4 minutes. the crust was a little soggy but the sauce definitely packed a nice powerful flavor. i dug the sauce. as the pizza sat a bit more and cooked a little in its own heat, the crust got better. so yeah, a couple more minutes basking in the glow of the hot oven and it would have been better. still its not a pizza that id write home about. 

this place definitely has potential. if it could get its act together with the bar (ie get a couple of more beers on tap other than hefeweizen and miller lite) i really think this could be the spot that my friends and i flock to when old chicago is taken over by douchers who want to watch the UFC fight. that outdoor patio is really calling my name, but i'm going to be patient with this place and see if it really does turn into a neighborhood joint i'd be proud to frequent.",2010-06-30 01:09:57

It's roomy and airy with friendly staff to greet you. The tables are small and all sort of centered in one area, a little squished but making you feel like you're in a busy French café.

When we arrived, it was very busy with almost every table filled up. It was also really loud in there, and I had to almost yell to talk to the person next to me. We tried a few of the cocktails, and the Spring Mountain Sour and Jump the Shark were pretty good. The Sour had beet foam in it which was unusual but worked well with the drink. We also got the Where There's Smoke, and while I usually like a little smokiness flavor, this was like drinking actual smoke. A little much. 
The food was phenomenal! We got a few things to share. The grilled Spanish octopus was very tender, and the beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling was tasty as well. I love scallops and these were amazing with corn and miso butter, SO flavorful. We also loved the udon and the ""big ass pork shank"". The crispy skin itself was delicious. I didn't expect to like the beef skewer but the vadouvan crepe that came with it worked so well with the beef, and the whole dish exuded so much flavor. For dessert, we had the calamansi tart and honey toast. They do a different take on honey toast, but it was fantastic. I wanted another.

Some of the cushions had bird shit on em & the taller tables were a bit wobbly, but no biggie, we sat at a shorter table & avoided the dirty chair cushions. 

I felt like having a beer so I ordered the Sun Up Armadillo & opted for a pitcher. I should have just stuck to a small glass since I had never tried it before, we did not care for it. For an app we ordered the jumbo pretzel off of the bar menu. For $8 I thought they could have included 1 or 2 more, but they were yummy & the queso it came with was delish. For our entrees my hubby ordered the Rico's dip & I ordered their signature steak (med-rare) & fries. He loved his sandwich (enough for 2) & the house-made kettle chips were amazing. My new york strip with chimichurri sauce was excellent & the fries were tasty as well. I have to add that they also make their own ketchup (that has a bit of a kick to it) & is great with the fries & even the chips. 

Total (not including tip) was about $62, a lil pricey but the food was great so we'd definitely return. They have happy hour everyday from 3-7 with some awesome deals, so I'd like to return during hh & also sit at the patio up front which had a lot more shade & tables.",2011-04-05 21:20:56

But the last few times I have been there, going back to the holiday season, the service has left little to be desired.  I worked for about 3 years in retail at this very same mall and I was told when I first started to never judge a book by its cover in Scottsdale because the people you perceive as not having money probably have more money than god.  When I go into a department store I want to be treated nicely, to ask if I need anything but I have received none of that when I come into this store.

This time I was in the shoe department wanting to buy a pair of shoes.  There were several people around trying on shoes and whatnot.  It seemed like there were a lot of workers there too so I was wondering around looking and never once did anyone ask if I was ok or needed anything.  I found what I wanted, picked up the shoe and stood there for a bit waiting to see if anyone would come and help me.  Nothing!  So I walked to the middle of the floor and stood some more and tried to get someone's attention.  I knew what I wanted, knew the size so it would take any more than someone to run back to get the shoes.  I finally caught someone's attention and asked if he could help me...he looked at me said ""Um, I guess there is no one else around"" grabbed the shoe from me and said ""what size?""  I told  him what size I needed and as he walked away he motioned to his other customer that he had to go get my shoe and kind of shrugged.  I sat there for 30 seconds, got up and left.  I felt so annoyed and disrespected as a customer that no matter how much I wanted those shoes I would rather buy online if I have too.  Nordstrom this has been a trend for you.  I often shop at The Rail in your store and the people there are snobby and rude.

I frequently go out in Montreal, so I was down to party. My cousin told us we have to get there early to get guestlist, otherwise after midnight, there's a $20 cover charge. Fair, but back in Montreal, we almost never pay for cover. 

Good: The location is a bit out of the way, but once you arrive, you have a gorgeous view of the city's skyline. The venue itself is very spacious and clean. The interior is over the top, high ceiling and all, a grand scene as you would expect from a Vegas night club. Overall, very impressive interior design for a night club. It was a cool visual experience with dancers and performers. 

Bad: I wasn't a big fan of the music, it was a mix of hip hop and EDM. This wasn't a deal breaker as I would still dance to any music. It's not on a major street so you have to pay $20 to park your car. It started going downhill when I walked my sister out the club to her friend's car. When I exited, there was no bouncers by the doors (I would ask to get stamped before exiting as this is almost standard, but when I got outside, I thought there would be someone, but no one was there. I had to walk to another door and I told the bouncer that I was just inside and no one was by the doors to stamp me, and I just wanted to go back inside. He asked why I didn't go see him first prior I exit, and I explained that I exit from the doors on the right side (with no bouncers) and that he was at the left side, so there was no way for me to see him until I got outside. He told me that I needed a ticket ($20 cover charge?!) to get back inside, so I explained that I don't have my jacket and I don't have my wallet either because it's with my friends inside, so how can I get another ticket?! Annoyed at his incompetence, I had asked the four female staffs chatting amongst themselves at the entrance and explained my situation. They told me that they had no tickets and I should try talking to the bouncer (yeah, because that went well). I explained that they wouldn't let me back, and the girls told me they can't do anything. I just stood there annoyed, and I can tell they wanted to continue chatting but my presence was making them uncomfortable and probably ruining their vibe. Finally one girl offered to walk me back inside, but by the time I got back in, my mood was pretty much ruined, so my group decided to leave too.

(1) there are really no provisions for Anglophones, though this wasn't a problem for me
(2) a couple of stations are a little worn
(3) the ""per trip"" price is a little high

Let's move on to the good stuff.  The Metro plan is awesome.  Four lines connect all the important places in Montreal and have even been extended off the island to Laval (to the north), in addition to already hooking up to the South Shore at Longueuil.  The service is frequent, the cars are fairly clean, and it feels safe, at any hour.

Some interesting things:
(1) if you are staying for a while, get a visitors pass.  The 3-day pass is a bargain and is usable on the metro as well as the buses.  You will notice that NO locals pay ""per trip"" -- they've all got some kind of a monthly pass they use
(2) get used to the words ""prochaine station"" because that means ""next station,"" followed by the station name announced in a ""foreign"" accent
(3) Berri-UQAM is the main system station in the heart of the city and where THREE lines intersect
(4) Lucien L'Allier, in my opinion, is the craziest station - I think it takes 4 escalators to get from the street level to the train platform

First, the $3 wash is just a water spray with the spinning brushes.  For $5 they'll actually spray on soap of some sort (I forget how they described it...special whiz-bang soap...you know what I mean?).  We did the $5.

The car went through their machine and came out clean.  It does use the spinning brushes, so obviously is not ""brushless"" or ""touchless"".  After we went through we pulled into their vacuuming area.  Kinda cool that they have free vacuums for customers to use.  So we vacuumed out the interior and the trunk, and went on our way.

I found it to be rather bland and even with gravy...none satisfying.  Lunch is far superior.  I slowly consumed a breakfast burrito with sausage, and a side order of biscuits and gravy. 

The one thing which stood out was the quality of service from the employees.  All were for the most part friendly, but all were attentive in filling up coffee cups as you hung out in the morning hour.

The first time was right after they opened, service was horrible, we waited 45 minutes after we ordered our food for the waitress to come back, but we got no food and no waitress, so we just left.  The second time was a couple of months ago, we were a table of 2 and there were maybe 8 people in the whole place.  That time the appetizer and service was ok.  The last time was on April 30th (a Thursday) at 5pm.  We had a group of 14 people. I won't speak of the other people's experience, mine alone is enough for you to get the idea. My husband ordered a Blue Moon with a slice of orange.  When the bartender brought it out she set it in front of him and said ""We don't have any oranges"" and left.  I would think she would offer him something else maybe? but no.  The second issue was the food.  We ordered the sampler appetizer platter and my husband ordered the chicken wings.  The chicken wings in our platter and his were cold.  I'm not talking room temp, they were just taken out of the fridge and thrown on the plate, not even a bit of warmth.  The ""beer"" cheese dip for the pretzels was nacho cheese sauce. After having waited for 30 minutes to get this ""food"" it was hard to stop my 11 and 15 year old from just eating it.  I wanted to wait for the waitress to come back (since my ice tea and their sodas were long gone) so we could tell her to take it back, but I waited at least 10 minutes and no waitress, so they ate them anyways.  The third issue was my husbands second beer.  He asked for one, I reminded the waitress he asked for one, and I told another waitress walking by he needed another beer.  His wings were there but he had nothing to drink during his entire meal.  He finished my son's soda and went to the restroom.  We were now waiting for the check.  Finally, at least 30 minutes later, a bartender brings the beer.  I told her forget it, take it back, we're getting ready to leave now.  Her response was our tap ran out.  Why didn't one of the 3 waitresses we ask tell us this?  Maybe offer him a different brand? Or a glass of water?  The waitress we had was very condescending, acting the entire time like she was so much better than we were (I was watching the way she treated my parents and my Uncle).  Just very rude.  I left a $3 tip with the 3 issues I just posted on the back of the receipt. The response from the management on all these complaints are the same, let us know, blah blah blah.

Hubby ordered the sampler (a small glass of each of their brews) and I didn't like any of them, even the peach ale. He liked most of them thought, so I guess the brews are pretty good.

The food was good, but a bit bland. Again, hubby had the best meal of the night with their fish and chips and fries. The fish and chips was some of the best I've ever had- fresh, crispy, and perfectly cooked. I had the Mediterranean pizza and it was good, but needed salt. The chicken was a bit overcooked, but that's hard to avoid when you cut it so small and thin. The pizza's crust had a great flavor and was crispy without being dry. Our friend ordered the shrimp carbonara and it was seriously under-salted and under-seasoned. I don't think she was impressed with the parmesan bread that came with it either.

Main complaint of the night (other than some of the food being bland) was that the service was a bit slow and inattentive. My food (the pizza) came out first even though on the menu it said to expect to wait longer for a pizza. The waitress went back several times before she came out with hubby's fish and chips. It also took a while for the waitress to check on us, bring the check, etc. Granted, it was a Friday night but it wasn't like the place was packed out the door.

Through the years, the couple retired and Jeff lovingly took the helm. The addition of the huge patio complete with misters, waterfall and fireplace only improved on ambience. Saturday free wine tastings, Jazz music, and the brilliant ""choose your bottle & pay minimum corkage""  (waived Mondays) is a deal in a town that marks up wine shamelessly. Get on the email list for a heads up on special dinners/pairings, etc. 

Chef Stratta had those resistant to change up in arms, but the rotating menu & lunch specials are favorite ""forget you are in Vegas"" steals, with daily specials a bonus. It can get crowded as this is a power lunch spot. 

I'm a big fan of fish, simply prepared and they are always willing to adjust to requests. Mom loved a perfectly prepared roast chicken with frites and Dad is a steak man. All appetites are sated with flair. Another nice option is to choose a bottle of wine and catch up over a delightful charcuterie, beet salad or other small plates.

I had my first appointment at Ivy yesterday, and I was extremely impressed. While not the least expensive place in town, they offer lots of specials on Instagram, and take $10 off your first appointment. You can also purchase a package, or pay as you go.

The establishment is beautifully decorated and absolutely spotless. I was greeted nicely when I walked in, and had only a few minutes of wait time after I completed my paperwork. My technician (I believe her name was Sammi) was personable, warm, and reviewed my chart completely and thoroughly explained the procedure and what to expect.

The laser treatment itself was quick and painless. It literally felt like warm puffs of air. I had no pain afterward either. I'm eager to see what type of result I get, but so far, I am very pleased with Ivy!",2015-06-18 17:05:57

They were kinda rude to us as well... although I will say they were attentive and informative. I guess it's just that they had us feeling like we weren't good enough to eat there. They were pretty strict about substitutions too - as in, they were against them. They don't seem to want to let you have flour tortillas instead of corn. Personally, I find corn tortillas to be quite vile.

Another staple they offer that wasn't very impressive was the margarita. It tasted like just a grocery store-bought mix that they stuck expensive tequilla in (if you pay extra - the standard issue is Cuervo). I had some tacos and they were good, but they didn't blow me away. They did end up agreeing to make them with flour tortillas, but as the dish was handed to me I was informed that they would never do it that way for me again. Huh? Wow, so I had a one of a kind meal.

My rating may be a little misleading because I think other people would like it more than I did. I think it's a nice environment - cute little restaurant inside, and great patio outside (that would be better when it's not so hot). I want to give this a 2.5, but can't and I don't consider this to be a 3... however, as you can see from the other reviews, I'm in the minority here. 

I think I may be a little too fussy and cheap to eat here - I like my food simple and they over-complicate the dishes and over-charge for them. They won't let me substitute things (which is something you can't do to a fussy person) or even leave something off the dish. This indicates to me either a level of pretentiousness or some degree of incompetence... I think it's the former rather than the latter. The prices for the entrees are way too high for what you're getting. The value just isn't there for me. My friend says this is his favorite Mexican restaurant, so maybe this might be your kinda place.",2008-06-29 06:25:00

I enjoyed the Parman Patty Melt which has beef patty, braunschweiger, sauerkraut, grilled onion, swiss cheese, mustard and special sauce. It was good, the bread could have had a little less butter on it. However they are making improvements as they go. My fiancee had the breaded chicken which happened to be the special that night, she liked it. 

The drinks were ok at best. I ordered a orange juice based drink that consists of vodka, creamer and orange juice. The name escapes my mind right now....

The exception to the ground beef rule - the veal cheek slider !

hit Brand last night - part of the Light group restaurant chain ( fix. stack, etc ) similar to those places - they put twists on old favs, but the bottom line, this place is a steakhouse.  my focus the sliders, but real quick - the other dishes ( brought the gf on this trip  and we ordered WAY TOO MUCH )  - the veal porterhouse - not good - very little quality meat on the bone !!  the mushrooms, mac and cheese and lobster mashed - the mushrooms ( 3 sides cost $24 )  get the nod ! the lobster bisque with what i believe was a bacon/goat cheese grilled sammie ( $11) - 2 lil chunks of lobster and a whole-lotta cream in that bisque.  the sammie was tasty !! and what appear to be a trend - the drinks - some pineapple thingy with bitters - there can't be more than 4 ounces of liquid - $11 - yeah, whatever !

now the sliders - it came with a generous portion of tasty fries.  2 veal cheek sliders with a bbq style sauce - a little too much sauce - but the veal cheek ?  i liked it.  very tender, nice flavor - i believe it cost $17 .  the total bill $130.

also a side note - decor - not as ""creative"" as their other restaurants - the gf liked the flower arrangement , whatever !  no dessert - hit the craps table afterward - everyone at the table wanted the leftovers - hit the hard 10 3 times  made over $300 - got the hell out of Dodge !",2008-08-06 20:20:27

The Snow Pea Leaves in Garlic Sauce dish was well made and tasty but at $12.50 was over price from what we are use to.

The Sizzling Beef in Satay sauce was a major disappointment. It lacked flavour and it had a chunk of Satay not mixed into the dish.

Decor is nice and modern but they are missing many of the details. Experience was pretty much the same as in any Chinese restaurant but with nicer decor and cleaner restaurant.

For appetizers we had stuffed peppers, calamari, and zucchini.  The zucchini was probably my favorite, however none of the appetizers were very impressive.  For my meal I went with the Strip steak.  I also tried some of my wife's Margarita pizza, which I wish I would have went with.  The pizza had a great texture and flavor.  My steak unfortunately was pretty bad.  When it was brought out I was not asked to cut into it.  If I had been I probably would have sent it back.  However I was starving by the time it got to me so I didn't want to wait.  The meat really lacked any flavor.  Also, the presentation of it was pretty pathetic.  It was just the hunk of meat on a large white plate with nothing else on or around it which did not make it look very appetizing from the start.

1) They lied about the price. We called and asked for the price multiple times and were told $17 per person ""all day."" When we arrived ... the price had magically jumped to $28 PER PERSON.

2) The servers are racist. They will not give you good service UNLESS YOU ARE KOREAN. This applies to other Asians as well that they look down upon (Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, etc.) and if you're African American or Hispanic? Forget about it. They will pretend not to see you when you try to call them multiple times and walk right past you. This leads into #3 ...

3) The servers will do their best to deny you meat refills. They will take as long as possible to bring your order to save money. Slow service means they lose less meat and less money so they'll snail it as much as possible. Expect 30-45 minute waits per plate.

The restaurant is usually quite busy but for a Monday night it was okay. Our waitress was quite friendly and asked us how we were doing throughout the night. No flaws in my perspective.

Restaurant
I just really don't like high chairs. I'm already short so I do not appreciate having my legs dangling in the air lols. Anyhow, the major issue is that I cannot adjust my chair as easily - they do however kind of swivel. The place is dimly lighted but certain areas are brighter which makes food selfies a little easier. They have plenty of plates in the middle because it's a restaurant where large groups can come to share appetizers. For those who don't know, the restaurant is a bit hidden - right beside Reds Tavern. If you have problems finding it, don't hesitate to give them a call. On a busy night, you can expect to wait at least 1 hour (but there is a Starbucks right across). The only thing I really disliked was the bathroom's location. Why is it upstairs? Anyhow it's a minor issue.

Food 
HOW CAN I BE PAYING THIS PRICE FOR SUCH GOOD FOOD? Hands down, this is not what you expect. First of all, the prices are quite fair based on their quality and portions. We ordered 2 appetizers and a main - fully stuffed, and my boyfriend had to do take-out bag lols. The pizza is super big and everyone becomes wow'ed by their special scissors. The crust is not thin but the content is fabulous! Anyhow you cannot go wrong and trust me, two cannot finish this monster. We move on to the charity bread which is at an all low of $3-4. Basically if you have heard of blooming bread - this is the baby version. Filled with scrumptious amounts of garlic and probably butter, you are eating a very tasty piece of bread lols. We move on to the second appetizer which is the spinach and artichoke dip priced at $12 ish. I effing love crostini so when they paired this with the dip - heaven help me lols. The dip is given in a generous amount and yum, warm! Needless to say, we were impressed! As for the drinks we ordered, beer is beer lol but my caesar tasted a bit different. First of all they give you a surprise snack at the top but this drink is mixed with horse radish - neat? It actually tasted more like oyster than a classic caesar drink but still not bad. I think the best caesar I had was in a Yelp tasting event and at a wedding.",2015-01-14 03:35:25

The noodles were a bit undercooked.  Al dente is great with pasta but when it comes to Pho, I prefer my noodles to be softer.  Hu Tieu house special (#5) was decent.  Instead of the clear noodles, they used the same pho noodles.  Regardless, the Hu Tieu broth was pretty tasty.  If only the Pho broth was at the same level as the Hu Tieu's.  I also tried the Nem Nuong Cuon (#1).  It was okay.  Very basic.  A couple of thin slices of nem nuong (grilled ground pork) rolled with some lettuce and fried egg roll wrappers. The hoisin dipping sauce was a bit too salty.  I prefer the Nha Trang style sauce with Nem Nuong Cuon or even a hoisin peanut sauce.  The house dipping sauce didn't cut it for me.  

The place is pretty clean and they use disposable chopsticks...a big plus!  The staff is pretty friendly and helpful.

Food is nicely presented and served however, I think its high in MSG ... I can feel it right after. They're tea is nice though, better quality than most.

Some bussers are kind of emotionless and not too responsive. Some servers are great some were also emotionless. 

They're seafood selection is great, sometimes though they'll only carry heavy bigger items so you will have to add to the cost of your combos to make up the difference.

Like, this place is about a mile from my house, and a block from where I went to high school and we'd walk here after school and get takeout (we were spoiled ok?!). We knew the sushi chefs by name, and when we got a little older (not old enough), we'd sneak sake bombs before going out to the coolest party ever. The inappropriate names for the rolls were the funniest thing we'd ever seen- it was the bees knees and the best sushi I'd ever had. 

Fast forward 10 years, and sadly times have changed. The quality of the fish seems to have gone downhill and the cold fresh rolls just don't taste as fresh and the hot crunchy rolls are drenched in indistinguishable sauces. I really hate to say this, but last time I was here a few weeks ago, two of us got sick from eating the same roll.

Another time we ordered a burger and onion rings. The burger was well done , like WELL DONE, when I ordered it medium well. The tomatoes and onions were old and stale. And the onions rings tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. It wasn't even worth a picture it was so bad. 

This last time we ordered chicken wings. Good sized wings, but could have used more sauce. Their celery sticks and ranch were good. 

All kitchen staff need to be retrained so consistency can be met. But to the person who is in the kitchen during our good visits, props to you sir! They have decent bar food and it's close to home, so I'll be back, hopefully on one of their better days.",2016-03-15 04:12:04

Bucket-O-Shrimp - Shrimp were perfectly cooked with also the right amount of butter.  The pretzels it came with was a nice touch.

I was quite underwhelmed. 

The location is beautiful and conveniently located across from Charlotte Premium Outlets. The bar is well stocked with a great variety of tequilas (afterall is a tequila bar). This where my excitement ends. 

Service
Our waiter seemed quite rushed...almost unpleasant. We arrived around 8:45 pm and the restaurant closes at 11 pm. So, I could not understand the rush. Within a period of 10 minutes, the waiter asked us 4 times if we needed more time. I was greatly annoyed. When asked for a recommendation, he proceeded to inform me that he had not tried many options on the menu...which should have been a red flag. 

Food & Drinks
I ordered a strawberry margarita which looked really pretty but was almost too sweet to consume. It tasted like a combination of strawberry syrup and lime juice. Yet, my date's tequila sunrise was heavy on the tequila and quite light on everything else. 

I ordered the margarita shrimp tacos with a side of roasted veggies. The veggies were great but the tacos left much to be desired. The corn tortilla was raw and cold. The shrimp had portions of shell still attached and the version of crema tasted like regular sour cream. It also included cut iceberg lettuce which is just a personal food pet peeve of mine. I prefer shredded... so no points deducted there. I was very underwhelmed.

The flavor was really good for both items and I appreciated that I was able to sub red onions for tomatoes with out a fuss or charge. The roasted potatoes have a good lemon flavor and the pesto was a good consistency. And pesto lovers will really appreciate the taste consistency.

My first time having Shake Shack was in DC and I remember liking it but thinking it didn't exceed Five Guys. With that said, it was good so we were looking forward to it coming to CLT. We went a few months after it opened, hoping to have avoided the crowds. We were wrong. It was super crowded and busy. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my husband ordered a burger. We both enjoyed our sandwiches. We shared the fries (which, honestly, I thought weren't too great).

My main issue here is how crazy it was. For as packed as it gets, I wish they arranged tables in a communal way where there weren't so many half tables being used while other people stood around searching for a seat. Additionally, the place was a mess, which is more of a reflection of the people dining there than the staff (come on people, we can clean up after ourselves).

Overall I'm very much a fan, enough to round up to 5 stars.  The service (especially love Ashley) and quality of food is consistently solid, though we've had some hits and misses with entrees and desserts.  My go-to dishes are the hummus sampler appetizer (great portion and value for $8) and the roasted beet salad (nice white balsamic dressing and so many beets).

A little bit of constructive criticism.  Though I do very much enjoy a meal here, I tend to find myself wishing that the plating/presentation be done with a little more care--it's gotten better though, I think--and that there weren't quite so many knickknacks everywhere gathering dust.

Mediterrano is worth the likely wait if you stop by on a Friday or Saturday evening without dinner reservations.  The current set-up doesn't exactly maximize the minimal space, but I appreciate that the current arrangement involves no tables near the door or restroom.

Sure it seems like a glorified McDonald's play area at first glance but when you enter the wonderful world of Kangamoo you'll soon realize it's way more than that! It's 9,500 SF of pure madness! hahaha. It's an indoor playground that not only offers fun and excitement for the little ones but also for the parents as their facility caters to the grown ups needs as well. 

They have slides, a mini zipline, trampolines, tunnels and plenty more. Suitable for children ages 1 thru 10 but can also withstand the adults if only for the purpose of saving your kid in distress lol. There's also a separate area for the younger kids so as not to be trampled by the bigger ones. $10 per child for 3 hours of play is well worth it, there are so many different activities your child can participate in.

Now let's talk about the parents lounge! To tell you frankly, I'd gladly pay $10 just for the massage chairs alone! Lol and I know other parents would agree with me in this sentiment. It's like having your own personal masseuse, close your eyes for 20 minutes and escape to a land where unicorns and rainbows abound away from screaming children ;) Besides the heavenly chairs, they have stations where you can paint your nails and also a track where you can either walk or jog with the option of using dumbbells as well. You just have to be mindful of the little ones running around. There's free wifi and charging stations. Coffee, tea and water are offered free of charge and there are snacks available for purchase.  

The customer service is impeccable. The employees are friendly and great with the kids. Dax is my absolute fave, he's the cutest thing ever lol always keen to help and very well mannered. He's an asset to this place for sure! They're still trying to find their niche as they just barely opened. They're planning to do more open play time and schedule the parties at a later time. Hopefully in the next couple of months they'll have a set schedule. For now, Monday thru Friday's 9-6 and the weekends vary so make sure you check their website for hours.",2016-03-03 00:35:41

Coming from a person who was just reintroduced to sushi, having written it off long ago, take my word with a grain of salt. Pisces is awesome for lunch or dinner. I always order the Bobcat, now the Knights roll. The seafood is always fresh. After trying several others rolls, it remains my favorite. The battered and cooked rolls are too large and difficult to eat in one bite as sushi should be, so I don't recommend them. However, the taste is still spot on.

Service here is always nice and the waitresses work as a team to ensure that everything is taken care of. Pisces recently changed its daily specials, so most sushi is half off from 4-6 (?) and they have drink specials that will save you some cash.

w60NBl3Ieow9e64SVs2nXw,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,-fiUXzkxRfbHY9TKWwuptw,5,1,0,0,"This is become one of my favorite places to dine in Champaign. Good prices, consistent cooking, good service, and not too busy on Sunday mornings. I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.

I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. 

The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.

Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.

Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.

The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.

I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.

I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.

The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers.  The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.",2012-02-26 07:48:24

It was fully tenanted, and it was a fun, if quirky, working-class discount mall with diverse customers and the convenience of having both a Walmart and a Target AND being on the light rail line.

It has now become a cesspit.

Vacancies are up, and stores are being replaced by more obscure stores. It's now considered okay for the teenage shop clerks to heckle passing grown-up shoppers, and mall security thinks this is funny. Adding to the ambiance of decay, the air conditioning wasn't keeping up with the traffic, so it was at least 85 degrees in the mall interior.

If you're west of Central and want a mall, Metro Center is cleaner, neater, and politer, while Desert Sky has a far better selection of Hispanic-themed stores (and is also cleaner, neater, and politer). Either also has a parking lot with a less kill-or-be-killed layout.",2013-08-17 22:15:37

I was a little nervous since I had the oldest woman in the salon assigned to me (see someone else's review), but I thought she did just fine. I'll admit I'm not the world's pickiest customer, but the massage chair was awesome, water temperature was perfect, and probably my favorite part - they didn't keep obnoxiously trying to upsell me! If you've every gotten a normal regular non-gel non-acrylic manicure, you probably know what it's like to be asked every few minutes, by a few different people, if you want gel. And it gets annoying quickly having to keep saying what you want and feel like they're not listening and/or disappointed by the answer. The color selection met my needs. She did some callous removal/exfoliation without charging me extra. 5 or 6 days later, the pedicure still looks perfect. The manicure looks predictably beat up since I didn't get gel and I use my hands a lot. 

I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't look fancy or nice from the outside. And the inside ambiance is definitely not north Scottsdale - it could use a little work.

Kickstand has a neat name and a really cool atmosphere. The music also rocks - they were playing classic rock the night we were there. The service is also very attentive. But the big downer for me was that the food was just ok.  

I'm disappointed that I cannot get a medium rare burger in NC. So, I cannot really hold that against Kickstand.

Nice beef burrito, good tasting tomale, English/Spanish barrier (a good thing in my book), the smell of the place, the decor, and how busy it was.

Staff was completely flummoxed. Though we arrived half an hour early, they kept us waiting so long I was afraid we might miss the opening. Luckily ours were the tickets they honored but I felt so bad for the other couple. We got to know them while we were waiting for someone to straighten things out. They flew in from Dallas, their flight was delayed 8 hours last night - they only just arrived this morning! They'd bought their tickets a month ago and for some reason Ticketmaster didn't relay the purchase to the theater, so we were able to book the same seats yesterday. It was a relief that our tickets were the valid ones but I felt guilty since they had bought their tickets first. I wonder whatever happened with them; I hope they got upgraded to a lounge table. Our seats were some of the only cheap seats left yesterday. If they had to pay extra for better seats because no cheap seats were left, I would've been willing to trade places with them and pay extra for upgraded seats. For us coming to Vegas is no big thing since we live in Victorville and drive up all the time, but to fly all the way out here from Texas and then have to pay even more for tickets you bought a month ago...

But I digress; you don't care about 4 people's seating snafu. You wanna know how the show was.

Well, it was weird and wonderful like the films. The DH and I are big fans so this show felt like it was made for us. We're also big Cirque fans but after seeing Kurios, Mystere, Zarkana, O, etc., we were let down by Paramour, Beatles Love, and Zumanity. We've been looking for another show to take the bad taste out of our mouths. When we found out about Baz we immediately booked it. I know it isn't a Cirque but I can't help but compare it to the dancier Cirques, particularly Paramour since that's also a musical.

They mixed the music of all 3 films together - and threw in a little Strictly Ballroom for good measure (see what I did there?) - having characters from one movie sing songs from other movies. They told the bare bones version of just the love story parts of each film, weaving back and forth between plotlines, so I can see how it might be confusing for someone who hasn't seen (or isn't at least familiar with the originals the films are based on) the films, especially with the mix-and-matching of the songs and stories.

As a former singer/musician, I'm very picky. I thought they were all better than the cast of Paramour (Broadway) and ShowStoppers (Wynn). Especially Satine, Juliet, Christian, Daisy, and Romeo's amazing voices! Satine was my favorite: great range; high notes in a haunting, ethereal tone reminiscent of Rebecca Luker in Secret Garden. Gave me chills.

I loved that they cast an African-American as Juliet, and that they cast her opposite a white dude. I actually thought her voice was a little strong for Juliet, though. She's a young, naive, and sheltered character, so it was strange imho for such a booming voice to come out of Juliet.

I loved that the violinist was also the Green Fairy, but I wish they'd done something to combine the Green Fairy and the Gatsby green light. Since they were mixing it up so much it seemed a shame there was this missed opportunity for additional crossover. In this day and age we can have an interracial Romeo and Juliet but the Asian chick is still a violinist (stereotype) but whatever, she was still awesome.

I loved the 3-person tango, I felt it was a much more dynamic push-pull dance than the love triangle dance of Paramour. There was tension and suspense in the choreography and the dancers all had a lot of chemistry.

Costumes and sets were maybe not ""Vegas-y"" enough for some, but just right for the Broadway-esque vibe of the show imho. I could've done without the t-shirt under Romeo's armor, but now I'm just nitpicking. It's just that the other costumes were all so great that it felt incomplete to half-ass just one costume.

Like a Virgin fell flat. I think it's supposed to be comic relief (though in the movie it was creepy/cringeworthy), but it just wasn't amusing. Ooh, a dude grabbing another dude's crotch - is that still funny to anyone over the age of 12? Yawn.

Also some of the acting wasn't great, particularly the Shakespeare lines.

The theater itself has a beautiful blend of modern and classic architecture. I saw Panda! here, which was kind of boring compared to Cirque and had a terrible excuse for a plot [and was also accidentally gay (the ""bride"" was a peaCOCK, not a peaHEN, with MALE plumage) - not that there's anything wrong with that!] but I was excited to see another show here.

Last night my friends and I realized how lame the bar scene has become. Or how lame we have become and decided it would be best to eat breakfast food instead of try to hit on any women. I have reached the point of my life where I prefer an omelet I guess. Less drama and this morning was the furthest thing from being awkward. I guess there was drama for the chicken who laid the eggs. My friend never ate at My Friends before last evening. I just got off the phone with him and he exclaimed ""That food last night was good"". Everything on the menu here is pretty decent.

I have been here twice, once dining in and once for take-out and am always tempted to order everything. Their chow mein is at the perfect level of crispiness, not drowned out by the sauce and hits the spot. Also have had their eggplant and pork on rice and their sauce goes well with the rice and they are not skimpy on garlic! WOOHOO! Their daily soups remind me of home and are delicious. My friends got the steamed oysters ($4.50/ea) and they looked amazing with sauce and garlic. I am not a big fan of oysters but after seeing theirs, I debated getting one. At the end of our meal, we got a dessert soup of taro and tapioca which was sooo good.

But the food took forever. And the service was nonexistent. The waiter was sitting in the corner booth most of the time. The salads took an absurd amount of time. When the appetizers finally came they were gross. Especially the dish with the french fries and the marinara sauce. Cheese was nonexistent. Pepperoni should be diced into tiny pieces and they could save money on food cost by putting about half as much on there. Or charge the same price and put some cheese on it. Pretzels were good but beer cheese dip was cold, like refrigerator cold. Short ribs were OK, some had no bone and some were all bone. Only thing that arrived quickly ( prematurely) was the check.

I decided on a Beef Kabob bowl, Hummus, and Baklava. At this time I was also warned that the kabob would be a 10 minute wait. It wasn't a big deal since I was told ahead of time. Next visit I'll probably call in my order now that I know the lead time. 

The Beef Kabob plate was really good. The beef kabob was tender and full of delicious seasoning. There was also a lot of meat included. The salad was fresh and had a really refreshing, light dressing on it. The rice was simple, but delicious. It worked really well mixed in with the salad. The tzatziki dressing on top was tasty and didn't drown the other flavors. The bowl came together like a Mediterranean version of a Chipotle bowl.

QDoba wins the battle in terms of queso,  but Moe's might win in terms of toppings, by virtue of having more of them-- fresh jalapeños are definitely a nice touch if you want to add a little bit of a kick.  The salsa bar is nice, especially the green mango salsa, but I do wish they had an option that was hotter than medium but milder than habanero.

There are quite few within 2km range maybe or less, but Yummy Market stands out by far!

It focuses on a lot of items from eastern Europe, things you won't find anywhere else, with brands that you do not necessarily recognize.
Everything is ALWAYS neat, fresh and clean.

Their protein section is always fresh, produce always look good and displayed nicely.
The cheese and deli section is probably one of the biggest ones in the area. They also accommodate orders for platters, so you can call ahead of time or go in there and make an order.

The hot food section has a really wide and 'unique' variety, many unique items which is a great option compared to the norm you always get elsewhere!

The bakery/pastry station is mu favourite, we have ordered or bought quite few cakes here, and all seem to be just perfect, every time!

The layout seemed odd and not logical. The shelf for the sale item my mom was looking for was empty. So we asked an employee if they could check to see if there was any in the back. It looked like they were restocking at the time so the chances seemed good that there might be. We asked the first employee we saw and he pushed us off to another employee. She seemed annoyed by our presense but asked what we were looking for and said she would go look. She must have then pushed us off to someone else because about 5 minutes later some guy we hadn't seen before walked up and asked if we were looking for something as the girl we had previously talked to walked by. So we told him what we were looking for. He disappeared for quite a while. When we finally did see him again he seemed to be chatting and socializing with another worker. After watching that for a few minutes it was clear he was just hanging out and not looking for our item so we decided to buy the couple things we had and leave. Mom decided she would stop at another Fry's since getting help at this one was going nowhere. On our way out the last guy that helped us (I use that term very loosely) saw us and said they didn't have what we were looking for and that he tried to find us.

But, this last time I went was a few weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon for an Ohio State game and I just had the most delicious appetizer I had to start my review right now! 

Just now when I went back to the menu to find the name of the appetizer to share with all of you, I CANNOT FIND IT! It was served with pita and was a mix of goat cheese, pesto, and a few other things and it literally was to die for.  I really hope this wasn't a seasonal app because it was so good.  So even though I cannot give you the exact name, check out the menu for it, it was a hot cheese dip that changed lives.  We were so full after we were done with it that we only each had like 2 bites of our meals, I promise it's that good! 

In addition to this secret menu item the Asian nachos are on point! If you can't find the above I highly suggest these as a back up.  Also, if you like soft pretzels, they're pretty darn good! 

As far as meals I am telling you I have never been disappointed, good pizzas, great salads, and love their wraps.  It's definitely not as greasy as the dive bar scene, but there are a lot of fried foods, but I consider most of the food fresh.

I also was able to get a $25 off certificate from restaurant.com for $2 so that also helped convince me it was a good idea.

Our reservation was for 6:30 but we got there at 6 to an almost empty dining room, so we decided to have a drink at the bar first.  The bar staff was great, they introduced themselves, informed us of the martini of the day and helpfully answered any questions we might have.  I tried the special cocktail, it was Grey Goose Pear, amaretto and champage I think, it was yummy!

Right at 6:30 I settled up w/the bartender and headed back to the hostess stand to be seated, I had checked in w/her when we arrived so she remembered me and got us seated immediately.  At this point it had filled up a bit more in the dining room.  Once seated our server came over right away and welcomed us, but it was odd he didn't really offer us a cocktail just kept telling us how wonderful the wine carafe deal was.  Then he left.  Came back and dropped off bread then left.  Came back and wanted to take our order but we wanted a drink first.  
I also felt sort of ignored, he'd come to the table and talk directly at my friend and would avoid eye contact w/me but sort of invade my friends personal space (he is not a fan of that at all!!)  I don't know if it was because I was obviously one of the youngest people in there, regardless I was still a paying customer, it was just odd.

After receiving our drinks we put in our appetizer order. I had the goat cheese and onion tart and my friend the crab cake.  I really enjoyed this, the only complaint is I felt it could have been warmer, but it was tasty and quite a large portion.  Also, the food came out super fast.

My friend heard our server giving the list of specials to the table next to us and mentioned we'd be hearing it again soon, but I said I bet we won't.  Sure enough, we were never made aware of any specials.  I already knew what I wanted so it was fine, but again I wonder if this was something to do with our age??

For entrees I had the veal chop and my friend the halibut.  Again, really tasty but could have been warmer.  At this point I was getting annoyed because our server had not been by in a while and I was ready to order a glass of wine for my meal.  I finally caught his eye and he came by to see how everything was but was ready to run off again.  I let him know I'd like a glass of cabernet, I didn't have the wine list so I couldn't state a specific glass but he assured me he'd get me a glass of something good.  I guess good always means most expensive because it was the $15 glass.  Whatever it was good, but I felt that was sort of a sneaky move.

We were too full for dessert, but we were told to take our times finishing out wine.  We got the check and I let him know about my $25 off, it automatically adds 20% to the pre-discount total, so he definitely got a fair tip.  

After dinner we decided to have another drink at the bar, and the same great bartender from earlier was there.  She asked about our meal and seemed really pleased we enjoyed everything.  She recommended a good red and my friend and I each got a glass.  She kept making small talk with us when she was on that end of the bar and she was nice enough to top off our glasses free of charge.

For food, bar staff and overall ambience/decor I give it 4 stars.  However, I would not be pleased to have the same server again on a future visit (of which there most definitely will be)!!",2010-08-02 17:24:52

I asked if they had the capacity for a rush order print service of about 25 booklets, bound, which I know takes some effort. They assured me they had the staff to complete the project by the time I needed to leave to be at the luncheon with required said booklets. The time arrives, not a moment sooner, and they hand me my booklets, $600+ later. I get to my location when my phone rings. The lady explains I left with less than half the booklets. I didn't check before leaving, definitely my fault, but frustrating nonetheless. Upon getting all the way back to the store, they weren't even rushing with an ""all hands on deck"" approach; more like ""oh, that's right, she's back, we should finish hers.""

We had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I'm glad about that because I didn't care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I'm not fond of sitting on a stranger's lap generally.  

We started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment ""you finished that already?""  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, ""wow, nice job fat-ass.""

Next up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn't.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it's still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can't wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!

Suffice it to say...Yum.",2011-03-02 15:35:46

Brother from Another mother roll- presentation of the roll was so nice and mix of flavours was good
Unagi roll and toro tuna roll were okay

My fiancé and I came on a Thursday evening around 6PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. A lot of large parties were there that night so the waiting area was really crowded and there was very limited seating to wait. We got our text saying a table was ready and were seated in a 4 top with a booth. 

Here are the things I really liked: The service was excellent- drinks were always refilled, we were asked several times how food was tasting and ended up staying a couple hours. Bartenders were great and the bar area is nice (and has all the TV's unless you sit outside on the patio). The food was really good- zucchini fries were hot and not overly battered. I got the breakfast burger and it was a party in my mouth! It came with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, lettuce and mayo- mmm good! The ice cream is also really good- we ended with a small vanilla shake. Oh and like other reviews have mentioned, the décor is modern and very nice! 

Things I wasn't too impressed with: The prices were steep- my burger was great but $12.50 is about $3 over priced in my opinion. The bathrooms are also outside- yes you have to walk outside just to use the restroom. And, they are tiny so if there's any kind of line, you're probably going to have to wait outside or just hold it. I also didn't like the limited beer menu- they do have some locals and domestics but not very many choices. Many of the beers are also served in cans- which is kind weird for this style of restaurant. 

At the end of the day, I will totally come back. But, only if I REALLY want a burger and fries (because that's really all they have other than some salads).",2014-12-12 17:22:54

I had a killer mezcal cocktail. I wasn't surprised that I loved it, as the cocktail program here is run by cocktail guru Maggie Meskey (formerly at Butcher & The Rye).

I really enjoyed the ambience, everything from music to the bustling crowd (which is usually not a plus - but somehow here it is) to the aesthetic. The vibe is also quite different indoors vs. out. Sitting indoors feels more hip and vibrant - like a real mexican taqueria meets club. Outdoors is more relaxed, and if you manage to snag a bar seat, watching the cooking unfold is a real pleasure.

We had two taco orders, the chorizo and the al pastor.  The tacos are high-quality, but I am not sure those specific ones we had lived up to the general hype of the restaurant.  Though I appreciated the fresh-made quality of the flour tortillas, the texture had a grittiness that I didn't prefer (for reference, I think the best homemade tortillas are at SMOKE Taqueria).  The al pastor tacos were pretty good, with inventive flavors that really worked well together.  I'd love to come back and try the carnitas -- my usual go-to taco.

But the real highlight of our meal were the patatas bravas.  If you like patatas bravas (or potatos and spicy food), GET THIS DISH.  They were the best I've ever had, ever.  Including patatas bravas I had in Madrid and Barcelona.  The spicy tomato sauce is absolutely to DIE for, and the aioli is a perfect complement.

I will be back for cocktails and more patatas bravas.  I'd love to try some of their other tacos next time.",2015-08-05 02:50:22

I consider myself a discerning authority on BBQ and soul food and they have some of the best smoked ribs, pulled pork and hands down the best corn bread I've ever had in my life.  The corn bread is so sweet and flaky it melts on your tongue, and it has sweet corn in it that explodes on your tongue like flavor crystals.

Conveniently located near Murrysville and Downtown Pittsburgh this is a great place to pick up food before a game or for takeout for a party.  They have picnic tables available if you want to eat there, but they are primarily geared for takeout.

Upgrade things for the price of $17.50 plus tip.  Because Golden Corral has a chocolate fountain and ice cream varities for less than $10 for brunch.  

Of course some of the resorts do the chocolate fountain also. I called and found one resort that offered Sunday Champagne Brunch with fresh pastries also but the price was $70 per adult. A bit out of my range.

The food & wine are great! Everything I've eaten here has been amazing from their brunch to their cheese platters and dinner! 

The worst thing about this place is the customer service! The waiters are great, but the hostesses are so rude and disrespectful! Which is shocking because aren't you supposed to have extremely nice and welcoming people to greet and seat you?  Well they don't! They make you wait 20 minutes after your reservation time and make you seem like they're doing you a favor by seating you! This definitely needs to change!

So 3 stars because of the crappy customer service, if they could hire some better people up front then I would definitely give this place 5 stars!",2016-03-30 19:30:11

That other pretzel place does not even come close to Wetzel's delicious buttery nuggets of happiness. I am sad that I can only indulge in these sparingly, they could easily turn a calorie counting active person into a couch potato carb queen.
I secretly bought  a bag while my man was in the Adidas store picking out trail running shoes for us. I ate nugget after nugget at a bench by the food court, trying to stuff them in my cheeks before he comes and finds me and wants to share! Feeling full of shame, I walked into the store and surrendered my bag to my beloved. He enjoyed them while I tried on my shoes. The bag seemed so full of nuggets! 
They were yummy without any dipping sauce. Just eat them quickly, before they cool down or in case someone wants to share.

After dipping into the free salsa (read - v8 with some cilantro floaters) I asked for something spicier - and was brought huy fong cock sauce. I'm sitting there, staring at it, saying to myself, there's no way they're trying to pass this Pho condiment off as a housemade spicy salsa, but there it was, and that was the gist.

Aiight. Perhaps a beer will shroud my anger in a warm blankie of malt and hops and we can move along. Except they don't have most of the list - so I end up with a Dos Equis Lager, aka Mexican Bud. Sigh.

Fajitas were sub par and eerily sweet. Guac was olive-fading-to-bark brown, and dispensed very stingily. What did I attempt to eat? Their tortafication of a veggie burger, which despite muchos toppings, was mushy boredom. Served on waaaay too much Teleras bread.

I ordered the Pad Thai with beef and while it did come out piping hot (a good sign), the portion size was a little lacking. My dish had more veggies than actual noodles...

I ordered the lamb curry and went with a 5.  My entree was so delicious and the spice was a little higher than medium, but it was so well balanced.

My wife went with a variation on tandoori chicken (sorry, I can't remember the name of the dish).  It came with a yogurt cream sauce, nuts and raisins.  It was also a delicious dish.

We also ordered a bread basket (an assortment of naan) and samosas for the kids.  The naan was a hit, the samosas, not so much. My wife and I thought the samosas were great, but it was not a kid pleaser.

So the food was delicious, why the 3 stars and not a 5?  It all came down to service.  We came in on a Sunday afternoon and we were the only customers in the restaurant for a while.  The food came out very quickly.  When we tried to tab out, the wheels came off of what started as a smooth ride.

I'd hate to be in here when it was busy.  We asked for our check and for a to go box.  Well, that took a while.  When the check arrived, it was completely wrong.  The check needed to be re-run and then we had to wait to process the credit card.  Well, you know the rest...

We were so very pleased until it was time to leave.  If the service were a bit more polished, this would certainly get a 5 star review from me.  We might give it another try but it's tough when dining with a family where time is a pretty valuable commodity.",2011-10-24 00:15:17

They so graciously hosted our Redskins fan group every Sunday during the season and as the it turned out, finding this place was the best part of the football season.  

There's more tv's in this place than one can imagine including booth tv's near the bar.  The bar is awesome too.  For a trendy restaurant in Plaza Midwood, the beer is cold and cheap - a huge plus and a rare find.  

For a burger place, you might not expect the wings to be a main attraction however the Spicy Tiger wings are clearly off the hook and fried pickle fans: by far the best in town.  Most places fried pickles are the dill chips while these guys fry up the spears for more pickle-y goodness.  

The burger menu is something put together by a mad-burger-scientist.  The Hangover is two grilled cheese sandwiches with a tomato and a burger in between.  Not just a cheese burger with toast but 2 grilled cheese sandwiches!  That's insanity...and so good.  They have everything you can imagine and you can tell it's all fresh.  

Salads are pretty good too.  They use real lettuce (not the iceberg junk) and fresh vegetables - not something else you'd find at a burger joint.  Usually the salad is a complete after thought and the last thing you'd order.

Service was excellent, our waiter was very informed regarding the menu - my friend is gluten-free and he was accommodating, suggesting some substitutions on various dishes that can be made by the kitchen. We each had a glass of wine, 9oz and an entree. 

I was torn between the chicken pot pie and the piri piri chicken and I'm so glad I went with the latter! I am always very impressed when restaurants are able to cook chicken breasts so juicy while ensuring the skin is crisp. The piri piri sauce had just enough heat and the wheatberry salad on the side was excellent - it was filled with roasted carrot and eggplant (I think) and as a non-eggplant fan that was one of my favourite parts of the dish! 

My friend had the braised lamb dish and the aroma was enough to make me want it next time I go to Bannock. It was an Indian inspired dish, served usually with garlic roti but for her GF substitution she had taro root chips - yum!

Fact of the matter is that's not fair, this unlike a quick in and out concept like Sauce, its a sit down restaurant that turns out to be excellent.   I've read reviews where people were disappointed with the quality, I think those people just drove out of there way maybe living in the west valley or something and amp'ed it up too highly, kinda like when you see a movie and it sucks then its better the next time.  Either way I've been here 3 times and every time had a delicious meal every time.  One thing that's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an ""antipasto"" menu that looks like a sushi bar menu (single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil) full of various cheeses, meats and extras (grilled asparagus, olives, elephant garlic, $1 mussels, etc.) this allows you to get your appetizers going right away.  Whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that's honestly to die for, so delicious!  I could go for the antipasto menu alone.  To eat I've tried the turkey sloppy joe, which sounds dumb, in defense of the sandwich first off it was lunch and it came with a grilled poblano chili on top, it was amazing.  I've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini (excellent) and my favorite thing so far which I will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg, cornbread.  The flavor with the egg is mindbogglingly awesome and the cornbread is fresh, moist and delicious.

A must try is the house green sauce that tastes great with pretty much every bite of the meal.

The sushi itself was bad, even for AYCE standards. The rice was dry, the fish, particularly the mackerel, was too rubbery. Most items were lacking in freshness.  Even the wasabi had a dry cracked surface. For all these reasons, I think $18 per person is hardly worth it.

One very much off the beaten path if not familiar with the area. Thankfully after solid OWS training day with a friend he recommended hitting the Lake Lounge for some recovery meal. Am always down for trying new places more so ones that friends recommend! 

Talk about never judge book by its cover. Cause literally on the outside you have no idea what your walking into just outside of building not windows or anything tell the inside of it. They do have two doors clearly marked one for the bar and one for the restaurant. We came for the food so never walked into the bar. Talk about going from day light to darkness. Dam. The place is dark but not in bad way. It definitely gives the place personality, the art work on the walls all are different, lot of booths, kind of gives feel of old school vegas non strip restaurant, and reminded me of places like Golden Steer or even Hugo Cellars dark in general. If the place is dark the workers are complete opposite. Everyone was friendly, positive, all smiles, got feeling they all worked there for long time, attentive, and next thing know was talking with our waiter about random stuff. Cool.

The prices. Really for the most part everything on the menu is under ten dollars. Couple things that are over but they are few and far between. Not only are the prices great but the food is GOOD. The thing is look at the menu it basic bar food (they also serve breakfast items ; outside of the steak and eggs they do stop serving breakfast at one point) but done right. The portion size are HUGE! I know thinking cheap and huge portion might not be good combination. I had the fish and chips. The pieces of cod they use are nice nice cut not small scrap pieces of fish more batter then fish. The batter don't get me wrong is full one but not super dense or fell eating more batter then fish. It nice crispy even by the time finally got around to my third piece. Light batter. Golden brown. The cod on the inside cooked perfect, moist, seasoned, and hot. Really one of the best fish and chips in Vegas. You see them in just about every menu especially in bar food but more times then not nothing rave about. The fish and chips are up there for me. The french fries nothing really special. They were well seasoned and hot. 

My friends both had steak and eggs. I can not attest to the taste. Just living in Vegas for over twenty years. The first couple years did the whole graveyard specials and looking for cheap steak and eggs. Honest tell you this steak and eggs are BY FAR............steal of deal. The steak is totally legit not look like cheap meat. They put perfect grill mark on it. It nice and juicy. No doubt will be the next thing try.

First time I went with my boyfriend and another female, we sat on the patio. We had a hell of a time finding chairs, seeing as it was happy hour. We finally found a spot, and ordered our drinks from the bar and brought them back to the table. I did a little people watching... it was too early for some people to be drunk, in my opinion, but, then again, it's Vegas... what can you expect? 

Second time I went was with a few lady friends and a couple guys. This time we went inside. We, once again, struggled to find empty seats and when we finally did, we were starving! We desperately looked through the menu, and honestly, none of the food sounded appealing to me, and on top of that, it seemed a bit pricey. I know it's called Blue Martini, and they specialize in those sorts of mixed drinks, but even most other bars have decently priced, simple, ""bar food."" Anyway, by the time the waitress came around to take our order, which was 30 minutes after we were seated, we had already decided to ditch! 
My review may be impaired due to the lack of alcohol in my system, but, I still have to say that IMO this is not a kick-it spot to me.

Anyway, my friends and I ended up having a far better time at Stoney's that night, even though we were overdressed!",2010-08-02 10:07:10

I came here for breakfast. The place definitely does look very 60s with all the yellow and orange decor. You're allowed to sit wherever you want when you come in, which is always nice. There was about 7 groups of people already in the restaurant, which was kind of surprising because it doesn't look like a place that'd be that popular. I heard one of the waitresses say to another waitress, ""wow, we have a lot of new comers today."" So I'm guessing it's slowly getting more business

We seated ourselves and ordered coffee and orange juice; it came out immediately. The coffee was pretty good, I had about 3 cups! The orange juice wasn't fresh squeezed, but still refreshing. 

After looking over the decently sized breakfast menu I decided to order the Waffle Breakfast. Normally I'd get the pancake breakfast, but I wanted to try something a little different. It was only $5.95 and came with one waffle, eggs, and your choice of bacon/ham/sausage. I chose sausage of course! My boyfriend ordered the Country Breakfast for $6.25 which included 2 sausage patties, 2 eggs, home fries, and a biscuit with gravy. 

While waiting for the food to come, we noticed they had Trivial Pursuit cards stacked on the table, so we got to play that to pass the time, it was very fun! 

Our food came and we dug in. My waffle was Very dry, even after filling all the little squares with butter, jam, AND syrup (I know, that sounds a little overdone). It was pretty disappointing. I was hoping to have a good waffle experience, but it wasn't. I also got a sausage PATTY, which I'm not normally fond of. I mean, it obviously tastes the same, but I prefer links. My boyfriend ate all his food, but said it was mediocre. 

I'm sure if we ordered other dishes, like the Hash and eggs or chicken fried steak, it would've been pretty good, but we just wanted to order something different and it wasn't satisfying. However, what was satisfying was the bill.  $16.97 for 2 cups of OJ, 3 cups of joe, and 2 breakfasts is more than enough reason to get me coming back!",2011-01-28 08:46:58

We sat down for dinner here this past weekend and I am so happy we did. Sue was our server and she was SO friendly. Like scary friendly, in a good way. Just so sweet. 

DRINKS:
I don't like carbonated water, because what's the point of carbonated water? Seriously, why is carbonated water such a thing?! But, Sue thought I said yes, so she brought it to us. My hubs drank it while the other server brought me regular water. But... we also ordered some sake. Bonsai Bunny sake. Mmmmmm It was sweet but good!

FOOD:
Spicy Tuna Tacos:
Delicious. The tuna quality was so good. I know people are thinking, Oh I've had tuna tacos, they are all the same. NO. NO. They are not. These tacos were amazing. The tuna was so clean and just melted in my mouth. It was so good. It didn't fall apart too like you'd expect from a regular place. This here isn't a regular place... this is Morimoto!!!

Pork congee:
This was the BEST dish ever. The pork was perfectly cooked where it melted in your mouth. The congee was so flavored. I could have this EVERY SINGLE DAY. It was so good. 

Yellowtail bibap:
A little too salty for my taste. I was kinda depressed at how salty it was. Everything was so perfect and then this was kinda a disappointment. I ate the whole thing because it was still expensive but still... salty.

Pork chop:
OMG. This was another amazing meal. Each pork chop is cut perfectly to still be savory. The quality was impeccable. It was so good. The sauce and the extra stuff around it was so good. 

Dessert:
Japanese cheesecake - so I thought this would be like Uncle Tetsu which is nearby my place, but it wasn't. The cheesecake was like cheesecake but softer and delicious!!! The dessert sides complimented the cheesecake, including the sorbet with graham cracker shredding. Mmmm... It was so good.

AMBIANCE:
Very posh. Very Hollywood or Vegas. The decor is nice. It wasn't jaw dropping, but it was still nice. What can you do? It's Vegas. They can't be too foo-foo-y.

BATHROOMS:
Only one women's stall. Meh... it smelled like cigarette.

SERVICE:
Great service. Sue was great. 

OVERALL: 
It was great, but avoid the bibap if you don't like salty.",2017-11-27 19:31:59

But, well as suggested my brother found a place where he went and it wasn't bad at all. Was it the best? In my opinion, not really, but it certainly beats out a lot of places where I live currently so I'm not going to complain. So lets break down the pros and cons of this place...

Pros: Good food. Neat Experience. Can take out if you wanted to.
Cons: No large seating and a bit of a drive.

I came from West Charlotte, and well this place is a bit of a drive as it was in Matthews, but I guess if there's good food the drive isn't that bad. The Hawaiian Ahi Poke was pretty good, albeit it was a little spicy and salty. It would definitely do good with something to along with it, but it's definitely something that should be ordered if you like tuna tartare. That was something that was unique and where you can't really get at another take out spot. The Ramen was also something that was interesting. It definitely beat any type of Ramen I could get in Tennessee, especially the horrible one I got when I went to Nashville, so this was pretty welcoming. 

For a takeout spot, this place is actually worth going to and trying out. The only down part was, well if you live across town it's a bit of a drive. Otherwise, this is definitely a place to check out if you're nearby and you want to try something unique.",2017-04-16 21:35:46
vICB7uZO7pCvP2rv1CKjBQ,IJkRnIzsdzuPXK2Ej7frag,YgHp9MdZ1vVdYyMEro4TtQ,3,2,0,0,"I love coming to Gordon Square, and I previously considered this to be a pretty good option for cheaper eats in the area. We've gobbled up some pretty decent food here before - one of the first times I had chicken and waffles was at XYZ, and I still remember arguing with my husband because he was the one that ordered it and I was eating too much of his meal. Good food is worth arguing about, right? 

After our last visit, I don't know what to think! Their prices have gone up (the chicken and waffles was definitely not $10.75 last time we had it) and I guess they just decided they were too cool for salt and pepper. I had butternut squash gnocchi which was supposed to be in a brown butter sauce topped with parmesan. The dumplings were chewy and flavorless, and appeared to have just been rolled in some olive oil. No cheese...no nothing. I wanted to ask our waiter if I could get some cheese but he never stopped long enough at our table for me to mention it. My husband also got grits as a side and again, completely bland. Cheese is one of the things I wake up for every day, so the lack of it on my pasta and in the grits seriously bummed me out. My sister ordered their fried broccoli appetizer, which was pretty tasty, although they don't cut up the broccoli stalks at all beforehand so some of the batter between florets doesn't end up getting cooked. 

They offer a lot of drink specials depending on the day. Before 7 on weekdays they have a few draft beers for $3 (when we went it was Rebel IPA, LH Milk Stout and Brooklyn Lager). A pretty good deal for decent beers, but our Brooklyn Lagers tasted a bit off. Like not clean tap lines. Sadness.

My last few experiences in this restaurant have been less than spectacular, to the point I'm starting to frequent New City a lot more now (and I've noticed the breakfast lineups in this place have also shrunk). The braised beef noodle soup has gotten way too oily and MSGy for my liking, and that was my original highlight if I wanted something with soup. I still somewhat enjoy their cuttlefish ball noodle soup, and honestly that's all I order from there these days.

Service has also gotten a lot slower. In particular, do not eat here between 11 and 11:30am on a weekend, because that's when their breakfast-lunch turnover takes place, and almost no lunch food comes out of the kitchen. Also, their wifi has been very unstable, with the internet working only about 30% of the time.

Since this was a solo visit I opted to sit at the Sushi Bar. As soon as I took my seat I was warmly greeted by my server, Keiko.

I took a minute to peruse the menu and decided to begin my evening with their Sake Flight. It consisted of four different selections that ranged from light and floral to dark and smokey. My favorite was aged like a whiskey and was a fantastic sipper.

I chose the $50.00 Sushi Sampler, which includes a Spicy Tuna Roll and ten different pieces of Sushi. Everything was impeccably fresh and beautifully presented. The only piece I didn't like was the Mackerel. It was just too fishy for me. In the future, I would probably skip the sampler and just order the Sushi individually. I might spend a little more, but I'd get exactly what I like.

I had originally planned to try something off the Dinner Menu, but since it was my last night in Vegas and assurances from my server that it wasn't ""too heavy"", I decided to try the Fiery, Salty Caramel Chocolate Tart. It was definitely worth the splurge. The combination of flavors and textures matched the flamboyant presentation.

Terrible amateur service.  Foreign objects in food. Crazy prices for specials. No apologies.
We had to wait in the very crowded bar area for over half an hour for our reservation.  Wine glasses were brought to the table still wet with water drops all over the glasses (not dried).  The waiter never re-poured and never brought a chiller as asked (we were outside on the patio, as it was the only table available, and the wine just got too hot). FYI, wine prices at 3 to 4 times retail doesn't help either.   As we were eating the appetizers they tried to serve salad (I had to shoo them away).  Then after salads were cleared, it took 45 minutes to get entrees.  ?? My daughter's paella had a large piece of plastic in it.  The waiter said ""it was just a piece of sausage casing"".

In Pittsburgh...really??  My wife ordered the stuffed twin lobsters and each lobster came with only one claw.  When asked, the waiter said that is how they balance the weight, by removing one claw.  What??  Who cannot order 1 ¼ or 1  1/2 pound lobsters from their purveyor?  Total BS.

Outside they do a good job decorating for the seasons.  Pumpkins, reindeer, etc.

It has the unfortunate disadvantage in being in a really bad loacation, the Esplanade is really only commercial offices now, and is not really a great place for foot traffic and parking.  Nevertheless, this restaurant is worth parking in the garage and trying out.  

The decor is a great place to stop and get a drink.  There are several tvs and always has some decent music playing in the background.  I must say that if I did not have a groupon here, I would probably give this place 3 stars, as it is a little overpriced for tacos.

I have eaten several items here  the pernil asado tacos, short rib barbacoa, and the nachos.  Personally, my favorite item is the short rib barbacoa.  The spices are a great mixture and the meat is very moist and tender.   The pernil asado is good, but not my favorite.  The nachos are a good choice for a lot of food.  But they are really known for the tacos.

The chips and salsa are also really good.

Overall, I will return to this place, but definitely not the best tacos in the country.  Good but not the best.",2011-09-08 21:33:23

The ground beef kabob is sensational.   I believe it is made with a mix of basil, mint and paprika and cooked to perfection.   The tandoori bread an accompanying yogurt cucumber sauce finish off the entrée nicely.

I would recommend trying out the daily special - offered six days a week.  My favorite luncheon daily special is the Barberry rice and chicken.  This meal consists of chicken, barberries (not quite sure what a barberry is?) and plenty of basmati rice.  The chicken is cooked to perfection and is added to a saffron tomato sauce.  The flavor is delicious and not too strong.  

The staff is helpful when making a selection and takes quite a bit of pride in their food.  Zaytoon is a great place for a quick lunch time meal that will set you back by about $10.00.  The food is not too filling, but the portions are just right for lunch time.

Ever since I had heard of this place, I wanted to go! I am very glad I did. You really should go to any place that calls itself Thor.  I think of a couple things: comic book store or some sort of man bar.  

The place is modern but not as modern as I had envisioned if you can believe that. At the time I walked in, it seemed cluttered.  In a modern space, anything that is strewn about can make a place look messy than a normal cafe.   

They use Origins coffee.  One of my faves! Another espresso bar uses it as well and I have to say, in drinking the same brew, they do it better!!!  Thor makes an okay cup but it does fall short of the other espresso bar using the same beans.

Some of their high-end items like coats and blazers that they just re-fit to sell are pretty, and their latest stuff from Fashion Week was pretty decent. But the majority of the stuff they carry in the store looks like what I used to make in high school, except all my weird off-the-shoulder sweaters were done with old band t-shirts and actual band logo patches. And I'm no seamstress, but I have basic sewing skills and usually if I buy vintage clothes that don't fit properly, I just fit them myself. So I feel like I could make half the crap here that they charge a fortune for.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're so unique and innovative, it's so great that they're putting Toronto on the map in the fashion world, blah blah blah. Personally, I'd rather shop elsewhere and not look like I went to Value Village and sewed a bunch of grandma sweaters together.",2008-11-24 19:12:15

- Fresh ingredients
- Good location...easy 'in' and 'out'... good parking... Pecos and Paseo
- More than just a sandwich shop.... they have breakfast items, soup, salads and pizza on the menu

Cons: 
- Sandwiches are 'bready'....meaning mostly bread
- Meat is about 1/2 of what is shown in the examples
- The Garlic Pesto... was not really all that ""Garlic Pesto-y""... I was hard pressed to taste the Garlic or the Pesto seasoning in the turkey meat

When I first came to Vegas 30 years ago, El Cortez was the first casino I walked in to, everything was new to me so it was like the greatest place on earth. All the neon lights, the slot machines, Fancy restaurants, beautiful cocktail waitresses ( I fell in love with one)  and money everywhere. It was also the first time I got kicked out of a casino. I was 15.
  Las Vegas is not what it used to be. Like anything else it has gone through many changes in order to stay competitive and Modern. Gone are the good old days of las Vegas casinos, all we have now is the biggest circus in the world we now compete with Disneyland, six flags, and sunset boulevard.
 El Cortez takes you back in time  and gives you a glance to what casinos used to be when gaming was the main attraction and not the roller coasters or people hanging on wires. As soon as you walk into the casino you can hear the machines and the sound of the coins dropping from the machines just like old times. 
 I enjoyed being here at El Cortez remembering old times, I still can't believe I haven't been back since then, maybe I changed like everything else. but now that I'm also becoming part of what Vegas used to be, I may become a regular here. You should stop by and take a look at a real gambling establishment even if just to take a peek at the past.

Falling in line with the likes of other chain, counter order, fast and casual spots is Shake Shack. Many people are familiar with Shake Shack and if you're not, then you should know it's the East coast version of In-and-Out and If you don't know what In-and-Out is, then you need to get out more.

The shortcomings. This location is shiny, new, and apparently pretty hard to keep clean. After being open for a couple of months, I expected things to have settled down and working like a well-oiled machine. Even when it's not too crowded, you will wait a fair amount of time for your order. 

If you've been to one Shake Shack, you've (pretty much) been to them all. If you only get one thing off the menu, make it the blueberry concrete that mixes their custard with locally sourced blueberry pie from Suarez bakery. It is worth every single damn calorie. 

Prices are Shake Shack prices, so don't expect a super great deal. Burgers are fairly small and honestly the fries taste like fried, frozen French fries, but that shouldn't stop you from demolishing a tray of them.

It was like a dream come true, especially after a long work week filled with boring salads and snacks.

On a Friday night, the place was pretty packed. A party of 3 had to wait around for 40 minutes before we were seated. It wasn't too bad since there were blackjack tables nearby to kill time (which is probably exactly what they'd want me to do).

We did our time in the casino, then got seated to our tables . Right away, we got started on the menu and placed our orders. They allow two orders, per person, per round. That pretty much made 6 different plates per round for us. In most cases, each serving usually came with enough for all of us to share evenly,. 

Another offer to note is a pitcher of sangria for an extra $19.99, but is restricted to that one person who ordered it. Stuff was pretty strong there for my pal, so I snuck in a few gulps to help out with the pitcher. Strong stuff, indeed. I got a pretty good buzz going after having my share of ""samples"" from his pitcher.

The food itself wasn't that impressive. The menu definitely sounded more interesting than what you actually got. None of the flavored wowed me, though there were some ok stuff. Things were fickle - some stuff overly salty, some meats flavorless, other things just right. 

The good:
Lobster Taquitos
Lettuce Cups
Meaty Balls
So Beefy
Octapussy

The okay:
Surf & Turf
Sea Bass Skewers
Tuna Sashimi
Cow Pie
Street Stand Fish Tacos
BBQ Oysters 

The bad:
Poona Tuna
Jack & Coke
Grilled PB & J

Nothing was really spectacular. Honestly, it left me wanting more and at $120 for two.. 50% of the bill was alcohol. I say that because it was 2 imported beers and a $29 sake. Not terrible but the $8.50 cans I of beer are what elevated the bill. All of that I can deal with.. 

The good: decent service considering our initial server had very little information when we asked questions about items on the menu. That was disappointing but we just winged it. We are foodies after all. also they are open until very late, 4am I believe .. So it adds to late night options available. 

The not so good: the quality of everything was a 3 out of 5 on every dish. Nothing really stood out. Nothing came out very hot if it was meant to be, and nothing was really presented really well otherwise.

This place is in the lower level of a building, and it is a really inviting place with a diverse clientele. 

People come here to eat alone, with their families, with their date, with their friends. A huge range of age groups as well.

The food is very comforting, and they have a good menu with something for everyone. Ox tail and jerk chicken stood out to me, as I do not really see these items at a nice sit-down neighbourhood resto. Oxtail was $14 and came with a fresh romaine salad and really clean-tasting creamy coleslaw. I think they used some form of apple in their coleslaw, as it tasted light and had a nice, almost fruity scent. I could be wrong of course, it might have just been really good coleslaw. Ox tail was flavourful, and not spicy. Rice and beans was good. 

I can tell they make their food with care. Everything was arranged nicely on the plate, and tasted fresh, and healthier than other places.

They had three specials the night I went, and they will explain each one to you when they sit you down.

Service was very, very nice. Very home-ly and genuine. Felt like a warm neighbourhood restaurant, which it is essentially.

My only complaint is that the place is too small for its popularity. It filled up quick, and some tables are way too close to the front door. It would not be nice to have one of these tables during the winter.",2014-10-06 03:23:36

Food came super quick and super tasty. There so many different options but a few of my favs are the seaweed salad and the shrimp with octopus balls. Can't go wrong with those 3. Great thing about this place is that it's small tapas style plates so you aren't stuck with a huge plate if you don't like it. The price is right.

They do know how to make them as cocktails. Mind you, if you want an absinthe stand alone, and you want it done right, this is not the bar for you. Not saying this as a huge negative, but if you're going to serve the spirit, know how to serve it right.

Now for the negative. The crowd here is distinctively douche-tastic. Seems more and more that the BMW renters from Scottsdale have been coming to down town PHX to go ""slumming."" I guess when you've burnt the clubs a few too many times by having your card bounce you gotta change zip codes.

Most of the time the crowd here is alright. A lot of meat marketing and guys trying to flash what they can only have on credit, but not too bad. But the last couple of times I have been in there somehow there is always a gaggle of overserved whores going at it like the world is coming to an end unless they suck down all the mid-shelf booze in the 85007! This is cool for a moment, but when it devolves into a bunch of 3's and 4's screaming so loud as to think they're 8's and 9's, someone like a bar tender or a ""bouncer"" needs to step in and escort them from the establishment.

Last time I was in there it was clear that the group sitting across from my girlfriend and I were friends of the bar tender. This did not stop me from explaining to their dates that unless they hurried along and got out of the bar, and stopped doing lines of blow in the bathroom while others were waiting to take a much needed piss that this was going to be the last bar any of them would ever see. I don't like having to do that, its not my job when I am just there on a week night to have a drink or two. I can hold my booze, and I know when to stop before someone has to stop me. 

Maybe Sidebar needs to start with a manners exam before passing out drinks. Or at a minimum maybe a BAC check to see if they're over serving the already drunk.",2011-04-03 09:14:36

The servers push carts around loaded with little side dishes and giant plates of raw meat.  Everyone who works here is really nice and sweet.  The tables are set far apart enough that you're not on top of other tables.  The lighting is extra bright - a bit too bright for my taste.  I call it cafeteria lighting.

The grills are a bit small.  Even for just the two of us, I found it annoyingly small.  We both did the AYCE dinner, which was $24.95 per person.  We ordered the bulgogi, spicy pork, beef ribs, rib eye and pork belly.  The server did all the work for us.  I half-heartedly flipped the meat here and there when she wasn't around, but she cut everything up for us and let us know when it was ready to chow down.   I wish we had grilled the pork belly first, rather than last because by the time we got to the pork belly, I could not eat one more bite of anything.  All of the meats were good except the rib eye.  It was completely tasteless and a waste of stomach space.

They give you a ton of little side dishes, of which we only ate about 3 things.  I loved the kim chi, the potatoes, the cucumbers, and the salad.  Everything else remained untouched.

All of this with 2 large Sapporos and we were happy little piggies.  I was so full and happy I could've crawled under the table and fell asleep like they do in those old western movies where the drunks just fall asleep at the table all sloppy.  I wanted to be that person.",2013-02-14 23:19:26

It is located above Kinton Ramen, just east of Christie Station on Bloor. It's got lots of seating in booths or at the bar that overlooks the kitchen. The bathroom is kind of hidden, you just push on the wall until you find the door. Heehee. Luckily, if you have any accessibility issues, you can order Kintori Yakitori food from the ramen place on the main floor! And if you get a ramen craving while upstairs enjoying yakitori, you can order there as well. Win! 
 
The skewers and charcoal are imported from Japan and you can absolutely taste the difference. It has a menu with lots of variety, for those adventurous or not. There were some foods at this tasting I had never had, but I tried everything! 
We started with Chicken Original Soup and Oshinko Moriawase. A delightful chicken broth soup with scallions. It was perfect for a cold day. The spoons they gave us were so cool, I wish I'd got a photo. The second appetizer were assorted homemade Japanese pickles. There were 2 varieties and they were crisp and delicious. The cucumber pickles were sweet and the other were more...ummm...for the lack of a better word...branch-y. I'm not sure what veg they were, but I ate them all! 
 
Next up was our first foods on a stick. Negima(chicken thigh & tokyo scallions) and Zuri(chicken gizzard). The chicken thigh was tender, juicy and let the charcoal flavours shine. I will order this when I come back. Yum! Ok, so now for the chicken gizzard. It was a little chewier than I'd like, similar to steak grizzle, but not quite that tough. Other people there loved it though. They made me feel like a newbie! 
 
The Nikumiso Kyabetsu(cabbage salad) and Tebasaki(chicken wing) arrived. The salad came as cabbage leaves with housemade chicken miso dip, it was a nice light course. We needed one like this, there's a lot to go! Then it came...the best chicken wing I have EVER eaten. If you order anything when you're here you ABSOLUTELY MUST order this. It's crisp, juicy, flavourful and the charcoal strikes again. I cannot say enough good things about this chicken wing. All you could here was Mmmmmmmm collectively over the whole crowd. 
 
Back to food on a stick with Uzura Kuchi Age(panko breaded quail eggs) and Premium Gyu-Tongue(beef tongue). Some more new things for me to try. The deep fried eggs were really good! A little greasy and not too eggy. The panko breading was perfect. The beef tongue tasted beefy and was slightly chewy, just chewy enough to let you know it's not regular beef. It was quite tasty. 
 
Still more to come, we were given Tsukune(chicken meatballs) and Hatsu(chicken hearts). The meatballs were great, nice seasoning and that charcoal flavouring just makes everything even better. Chicken hearts were not what I expected. They were meatier than I thought they would be. Had the chicken texture, but didn't taste fully chickeny. It's hard to describe. Again, everyone loved them! 
 
Time for Reba(chicken liver) and Asparagus(deep fried, panko breaded wrapped in bacon on a stick). I've had beef liver before, so that's what I expected it to be like. The flavour was quite similar to beef liver, but the texture threw me. It wasn't as firm, not mushy though. The asparagus was a little greasy and I didn't really notice the bacon. The panko gave good flavour and the asparagus was cut in perfect, bite-size pieces. You really CAN put anything on a stick! 
 
From here, we received Negi Shio Gyu(beef with scallion sauce) and Dashi Maki(Japanese omelette). The beef was tender and juicy. The scallions gave it a great flavour and they did not hold back on them. The egg was ok. Not special after all of the other dishes we tried. At this point we were so full and we still had dessert coming. Oh my stretchy pants! 
 
For dessert, we had Yaki Onigiri(rice ball with plum) and Houki Cha Brulee(green tea crème brulee). The rice ball was too heavy a dessert after that tasting. I could only eat a few bites. The plum was sour and the rice was crunchy. Never had a dessert like this before. The crème brulee was perfect. Usually, the custard only has a hint of its flavouring, but this tasted just like green tea. The great finish. 
 
The staff here, and all Kinka Family locations, are friendly, welcoming and provide great service. They're happy to answer any questions about the food. I will be back to this location to get more chicken wings and taste more of their menu.",2016-02-06 19:42:13

The food is good and the place has a lot to offer, but somehow it always just seems a little off - hence the middle of the road review.  

The biggest problem is that the pace of service is consistently a little awkward.  You order all at once on a paper card and then food just starts coming.   There appears to be no rhyme or reason to which dishes come out when - it's just whenever each dish is ready.   So you end up with a random collection of plates and not a lot of room to arrange them on the table - and the order never really makes sense.  You almost have to family style it - otherwise, you might be done before your companions get any of their selections.  

The house made noodles are good and it is fun to watch them pull the dough, but you can't actually see it from most of the seats in the house.  I like the BYOB and typically choose dim sum over noodle bowls just to get a little variety.  Their dumplings are fresh and flavorful.

Our top three favorite items in order were the 
1. The horchata drink - tiny but so good that I had two 
2. the delicious veggie burger - one of the best veggie burgers I've had in a while. The buns were thick and tasty and the burger itself had so much flavor (esp with the garlic aioli we got with the fired)
3. The pea crostini - definitely on the small side though with only three little pieces of crostini

The brussel sprouts were pretty average. 
We Didn't love the vegan BBQ. It was a hodgepodge of random items that didn't really fit together. It had pickles, onion rings, smoky shallots (delish), green bean casserole, white bread, and BBQ mushrooms.

There was one other party in the room with the hibachi grills and their table was full so we got seated at an empty table wondering if it would be just us.  Shortly thereafter we were joined by a couple and then another couple making it six total.  Because of the timing of when the other couples joined us we were wondering how it was going to all shake out.  We had already placed our order and received our sushi before the first of the two couples arrived.  The waiter apologized to us since we were now waiting on the other two couples to first choose a drink then an entree.  We certainly didn't mind.  Unlike a post work weekday eat-out we weren't in a hurry to get in and out.  However we felt the waiter did push the other two couples to quickly choose their meals likely because of wanting to make sure we were happy.  They still opted to take their time which was certainly fine with us.

I chose the dragon roll for my sushi entree because unlike most of the rolls it didn't contain mayo.  Since when is mayo a staple of sushi?  Anyway, the sushi roll was good, but not great.  Not very impressive looking and it wasn't a party in my mouth or anything.

We got the standard mushroom broth soup and small salad prior to the hibachi chef arriving and both were very good, likely in part because we were both starving.

For dinner I ordered the hibachi vegetables and hubby got the filet.  People commented here that the vegetable entree was small, but it was the right size for me.  I included a picture of the portion because of previous reviews.  Hubby was pleased with his quantity of steak but would have liked more vegetables for himself.  My vegetables were cooked well and very flavorful.  The vegetable hibachi meal wasn't supposed to include the two shrimp appetizer that all hibachi meals receive, but it was offered to me and I took it.

Like other hibachi restaurants, this would not be the place to go if you have food allergy concerns or you are a strict vegetarian.  The fried rice, which was delicious, was full of eggs and the steak and vegetables were cooked in close proximity to each other.  However, different serving utensils were used for first, the raw meats, and then once they were fully cooked.

No bean sprouts, like Ginza does, were served at the end of the meal which was just fine with us.  We'll be back and next time I'll choose a different sushi roll or skip it all together.  Probably didn't need the additional calories anyway.",2016-08-01 00:16:41

Our party of 2 enjoyed the Tuna Tartare with Taro Chips, the Chicken & Quinoa, and the Salmon with Brussel Sprouts and Asparagus.  Each of the dishes was very enjoyable and just about perfectly prepared.  My only feedback would be that it would be nice to have slightly more seasoning on the Tuna Tartare (perhaps garnish with Maldon Salt) and I would use slightly less butter with the quinoa.  Our bill for three fantastic dishes was only $49 plus tip.

Our server was super friendly, agreed right off the bat with our choices, and even helped us relocate outside in mid-meal when some patio tables opened up because the weather was perfect outside on a Saturday evening around 9pm and inside was a little too chilly for our liking.  Avalon Landing was playing right outside on the Container Park main stage, and everything about our experience was top notch.  I'm sorry I didn't come check this place out months ago, but I will definitely be back often.

I did not like the taste of their filtered tap water though, so I might consider ordering one of their many choices of artisanal bottled waters next time.",2015-09-20 08:50:09

Unbelievably cool atmosphere that creates the appearance of high class but with family style Italian comfortability. The wooden tables have neat stone centerpieces built in. The lighting is a bit darker and adds a romantic feel which I didn't mind being that I was on a date. 

Vapiano has adopted a different style of service with bar stations depending upon the type of food you want: pizza, pasta, salad, etc. We decided on the pizza station, and the specialty pizza which featured capers, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian sausage, and black and green olives. Pizza only comes in one size but it was still plenty of food. 

The service here was great although it is basically self serve at the bar stations. You order, then take a pager and sit down; once your food is ready they place it on top of the bar and you place the beeper inside the basket. It was quite a seamless process and the food was ready in no time. The food was excellent, but I was even more impressed by the layout and design of the restaurant.

The setting here is lovely and very spacious compared to regular Starbuck locations. However, the cashier was insanely slow and a line was building up. It seriously wouldn't be an issue but there were at least 6 other people working, one on drive thru and the others talking to each other, making jokes, doing their own business besides working. Several times during my wait, baristas walked up to the second empty cash, looked up, saw the line and walked away. The worse was, I ordered a Toffee Almondmilk Hot Cocoa and they got my order wrong.

I'm not a huge Warhol enthusiast, but I really enjoy several artists that were inspired by his work.  So we figured we would come and check out the original.  

Let me first say that the Bellagio cannot really control what the Warhol people choose to display.  So I won't hold this against them.  But I will say that the pieces chosen were odd.  None of them said a whole lot about the artist.  And that gets me to the other failing, there wasn't much to look at.  There were three small rooms with relatively bare walls.

At first I thought the ticket prices were decent, two of us got in for 24 dollars.  However, after getting through the exhibit in just over fifteen minutes, I couldn't help but feel let down.  More than ten dollars for a few minutes of glances, and nothing jumped out as inspiring or monumental.  

The audio tour included was dull, and rambled on a lot about things that weren't too important.  And there were also an absorbant amount of security in the place, lingering over our shoulders the whole time wondering if we were taking pictures or not.  I get that important art must be protected, but so many guards ruined the immersive experience one is supposed to have while at a gallery.

With such an alluring figure as Warhol, I went in expecting to be entertained.  I wasn't concerned about the ticket price.  But after leaving feeling more than unfulfilled, I had to wonder if maybe it all should have been a bit cheaper.

All this said, I'm glad the Bellagio is displaying art.  And I welcome other exhibits, hopefully on the more interesting side.",2013-02-20 00:40:03

I made myself a couple of tacos with the chicken and just ate the steak with the beans and veggies.  The combo was just perfect for us.  We ate all the meat and left a little bit of guac and salsa.

So we ordered the same things except the dessert. The lentil soup (shorba) was freaking delicious!! The ingredients and condiments used almost had me licking my bowl lol For my entree it was a vegetable plate that had cabbage, carrots and potatoes. It sounds very simple, but let me tell you it was delicious and it comes with their (tortilla/bread) sorry not to sure what it was called. It has a very unique taste but I liked it and it pairs really well with the lentil soup and the cabbage plate. They also have a gluten free option. We also shared their tilapia stew which to be honest I was scared to try because of the way it looked, but let me tell you my taste buds went crazy. Then we also had dessert she had the tres leches cake which tasted better than any other one I have had lately. I ordered the coffee Italian dessert (Again I can't remember the name I apologize), but wow that it was so good that I even said where have you been my whole life lol Oh I also noticed they carried Ethiopian beers and wines which I did not get to considering all the food we ate, but next time I will make room. 

The only reason they got 4 stars and not 5 was the customer service. It's a small restaurant and they did not really check on us, and my friend had to get up to order our drinks.

So my coworkers and I came down here for our lunch break, walk in, it's a little busy was a nice clean restaurant. While we were standing waiting for someone to seat us, servers just pass us by not saying a word to us. We waited for about 10 minutes and still no one approached us so my coworker goes to the bar and tells them. Then a guy grabs the menus and just starts walking (keep in mind he doesn't even say a damn word to us) so we followed because he must be seating us. 10 minutes pass by and still no one to take our orders (I would of walked right out but we were on lunch and very hungry). So in order for us to order we had to get up and give them our order while not once did they come to get our order or even check up on us. So we asked the person at the bar who is our server and it was a young lady! We were so pissed off because here she goes to the table next to us who just got seated and she already gets their orders, then she looks at us and walks away doesn't even say hi or have you been helped. Anyway, with that being said it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out....our lunch was ruined had to go back to work by the time we got our food. 

The food is good and not bad for $4.99 lunch special and $1.00 Thai tea! 

Very very bad service and I am probably not the only one that experienced it because there were a bunch of angry people that just walked out. For example: there were two guys having lunch and oh my were they mad because apparently they forgot the other guys order and only brought one order out. They just walked out without paying!

I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!

For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED! 

Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places!

I ordered the four course meal- offered Mon-Thurs, I think. You get salad, soup, entree with side, and dessert. I chose caesar salad, baked potato soup, steak with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes, and brownie sundae. My dad got shrimp scampi. My mom got Walt's favorite shrimp. My brother got Admiral's Feast. Everyone, of course, indulges in the cheddar bay biscuits.

I was surprised with how much food I got with the four course meal. I couldn't eat it all. My dad ate some of the soup (he loves baked potato soup and I knew he would want some). My brother also assisted with the soup, steak, and sundae. Salad was meh. But that's ok. The soup was enjoyable. Steak was pretty nice for a seafood restaurant. Brussel sprouts were a bit overcooked, but quite good once I added a bit of salt. Mashed potatoes were fine. The brownie sundae was amazing. I was a bit nervous about it as I am not a huge brownie fan. However, I didn't want to pay the upcharge for a different dessert (it was $3 or $4) and my brother said he would help eat it. I really didn't want to share it once I had tried it, but I handed it over anyway. Everyone else liked their food, as well.

Now to the best part. We (my 5 year old daughter and I ) walked in and the smell was delicious. My daughter goes ""ahhhhh that smell is amazing "" we were caught by surprise when we saw all the cute cupcakes. We ordered a dozen to bring into my mother-in-laws office. We also ordered a piece of chocolate and tried it while we were there !!! My daughter ordered one of the more simpler cupcakes to have for after dinner and the buttercream frosting was delicious. Loved it soo much !!!! 
Definitely going back and recommending  to other people.  We can't wait to order a cake from here and try all the delicious flavor !

That being said- haircutting not so much :( I took my daughter there for her first hair cut which she did with my daughter standing due to the length of her hair and then blow dried it under with a round brush and afterwards decided to stay to get mine done since she said she was super experienced with a-lines. I expressed that I rarely get my hair cut because it's hard to find someone who is experienced and if she wasn't comfortable with it then that was totally okay. She assured me she was and I stayed. She did my hair and told me- ""don't be surprised if you have a few strands that seem long but trust me just pull it and you'll see it's not attached"". I've never heard that but okay. 

She finished and we left. We get home and I brush my daughters hair after her shower and it's crazy crooked. Not a little but all over the place. The under layers were a good 2"" shorter than the top layers. To clarify - this was to be a trim strait across with zero layers. I immediately phoned and left a message saying I needed to return. Later my husband came home and when I told him I needed to return he told me that mine looked really ""off"" too. 

We returned the next day for her to fix  after speaking with her that morning. She ""fixed"" my daughters hair and then after my showing her where it was still crooked a couple times -it was corrected. 

Next- my turn. I showed her how I had tons of uneven spots on the bottom. When explaining on day one what I needed - ""I need my a-line that I got in mid April trimmed about an inch with a little bit of an undercut at my nape. No layers."" 

She ""fixed"" my hair but cutting the stragglers off the bottom. 

My hair is DESTROYED. 

I have been told ""omg it looks like one of your kids did it"", I have had a stranger approach me offering me her hair dresser's business card. My best friend says it looks worse than a beauty school mistake. It is embarrassing to say the least and the worst part is that because it was cut shorter than I indicated and she put layers in it that are uneven- it is literally impossible to fix. I went back to California in April to get my hair done and although I believe you get what you pay for- I fully trusted her when she said she was experienced and it couldn't be further from the truth. 

The pictures are hard to see but the left side is longer than the right. There are layers through out with the back left having huge chunks and inches off. The shortest part should be at the nap with the longest in the front. It is more of an an inverted V and then a bob to say loosely.",2018-07-25 02:21:25

Now, I'm from Los Angeles and I have had my fair share of delicious Korean BBQ from local restaurants there. When my boyfriend and I first entered Honey Pig, we felt a bit awkward since we were the only ones there. They quickly sat us down and handed us a menu which had some outrageously expensive prices much different from the $19.99 AYCE that they mentioned on the phone. After asking a few questions about it they finally gave us the AYCE menu. We did not have a choice on what we wanted to choose first , which was very different from the other places I've been to. They brought out small portions of Pork Belly (which was probably the best thing I ate there I might add) and brisket. 

-The unique thing about this place is that they actually cook the meat for you, which would be cool if they actually payed attention to the customers and how hot the grill actually is. Often times, the tongs were too far for us to reach so we had no way of actually flipping the meat ourselves and had to wait until one of the waitresses walked by. Lets just say I got used to eating overcooked meat that night.

 -Every time my boyfriend and I wanted to order more meat, we felt really uncomfortable because the waitresses made it very obvious that they were unhappy about it.

To start we got a bottle of white wine, calamari, the Mediterranean dip trio (baba, hummus, Tzatziki)  which came with pita/2 pieces of bread, and the fried eggplant & zucchini. The dip trio was GREAT! IT was a beet hummus which was slightly sweet but decent. The calamari needed something, salt? Pepper? something! There was not nearly enough aoli served with it for the 6 of us. The fried eggplant and zucchini was good very light not greasy at all and very chip like which proved to be enjoyable. They have a very extensive wine selection which is awesome.

It definitely needed about 30 seconds more on each side. Second scallop, looked way more seared, was still freezing cold in the middle. I'm beginning to be disappointed. My fiance ordered the crispy skin dorade fillet. I tried it and it was very good. I can say that the fish and seafood is great quality and very fresh there. I couldn't finish my scallops so i passed them off to my fiance and his mom wanted a bite. She leaned over and says ""these really could have used a little more time on the grill"".

We were seated right at the edge of the lake, with a beautiful view of a full moon and Jupiter (thanks, Android app!).  We shared a bottle of the best Riesling ever, and also a warm spinach salad, with pancetta and a bread crisp spread with goat cheese - yum!

Alas, the restaurant was out of the hanger steak that we - and every table around us - wanted to order.  The waiter said they hadn't gotten their meat delivery today as planned.  Instead, I had the Trout, which was served with a topping of crabmeat, haricots verts, and balsamic-soaked shallots.  It had way too much salt for my taste, but I was going to keep it anyway.  Instead, the waiter whisked it away, the owner, Jeff, came over and said that the kitchen would whip up a fresh one, with no salt at all added.  And they did, quickly!  Yes, the fish could have used a touch of salt, but not after I spread out that balsamic drizzle.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the salmon, and it was also terrific.

We had ordered - 30 minutes ahead, as required - the house special bread pudding with cinnamon sauce.  Two other tables had birthday celebrants, and they had the usual candle and Happy Birthday jingle sung.  My bread pudding was served sans candle, and no Happy Birthday song.  Instead, the waiter got down on one knee, took my hand, and serenaded me with a very professional rendition of ""La Vie en Rose!""  Edith Piaf herself couldn't have done it better.  The icing on the cake, so to speak, was that the house comped my birthday dessert, even after we presented our restaurant.com certificate.  A far cry from last birthday's mess, when all the hassles and waiting produced nothing at all.

Honestly I had little expectations for this place because it looks like a whole lot of hype. Came in on a Saturday night and the line was pretty long but moved decently fast. Not a fan of the store layout, hard to get in and out and not very comfortable to sit so I took my ice cream to go. 

Here are my thoughts on the two things I tried: 

1. Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream 

Presentation wise, this is a 5 star dessert. My one scoop came with a chocolate syrup syringe, one bite brownie and toasted marshmallows. I felt like it was worth the price, and the marshmallows was a really really nice touch. The ice cream itself doesn't taste over-the-top amazing or anything but it wasn't bad either so no complaints! I probably wouldn't order this again because I want to try something else but I did really enjoy it. 


2. Chocolate Pop Ice 

SO GOOD. This gives me slight nostalgia, it reminds me of Dippin' Dots (which I love). Like the ice cream, it came with a bunch of extra stuff (syringe, ton of whip cream and bananas). There is a layer of pudding at the very bottom which I thought was interesting. 

If it's your first time, I recommend trying the pop ice instead of ice cream. I would 100% come back for the pop ice!!",2017-09-18 20:25:41

I know this place has been open for a while, but never really went to this location since there's like a zillon around town.  I came here very early this morning after doing a 3 mile walk for MS with some of my new co-workers.  Fortunately, they open early, and I was hungry!

I cruised in here and was pretty much the only person here.  Same full menu that you would get at all the other locations, but this place actually has tables and a salsa bar.  They even have an outdoor patio!  *gasp*

I like that they have this sit down location.  It's a nice change for them, and makes me feel more comfortable instead of having to carry everything out.

The service was good at first, but that didn't last too long. Regardless, we got our drinks and meals in a timely manner, but no follow up once anything came out. 

The food:
They bring you out garlic knots, which were pretty delicious. We ordered the Spaghetti & Meatballs and Linguine Carbonara. The meatballs and sauce were tasty. The Carbonara was a little too oily and didn't actually feel or taste like a true Carbonara.

It has a couple of trees and, when I was there, they had some large windows open to let the summer air in.  There's also a very large painting of a pig which is something I think we can all appreciate.

About the bratwurst dish: it's the cheap option among the entrees ($16 versus $21-$39) and so I wasn't really sure what I was going to get, but what I got was high quality sausage, mashed potatoes better than your mom makes (and your mom's mashed potatoes are pretty special), braised red cabbage, a couple other vegetables, all in a rich gravy with some mustard on the side for good measure.  A ton of different tastes and textures in that meal.

I only went downstairs briefly so am not including it in my rating, but will tell you about it anyway.  It's a German-style beer hall with many long wooden tables set in rows.  It seems like a great environment to have some beer, at least if you don't mind loud places and expensive beer (currently about $10/11 for 500 mL of German beer on tap, $8 for 500 mL of Budweiser on tap, and $11 for 500 mL of German beer in a bottle).

My main problem with the beer hall is that they made a nice place to drink and then went and themeparkerized it with girls in tight costumes and beer served out of 2 litre boot-shaped containers.  Maybe I just hate fun, but this kind of stuff bugs me unless I'm at Disneyland.",2011-06-27 03:06:55

The atmosphere is typical of any Red Lobster and though appropriately themed the place was also well-kept. I think the biggest mess was around my spot because when I eat... I EAT! (That sounded so sexual, oh gawd)

The food was great. But that is also typical of a Red Lobster. The one thing I noticed, however, is that Southern Ontario chain restaurants are generally better at what they do than in the North.

The service was great! One strange quirk is that I ordered a dessert to be brought to my ex after her meal since it was her birthday and when we got the bills they seperated them all and put the cake on her bill... I was picking up her bill anyways but how strange that they would have put it on her bill when someone else requested it for her. Sheesh!

I've been to Japanese gift stores across the country, and I'm convinced that Kawaii is the best. The prices are fair given important costs, and they always have REALLY hard to find goods. It's faster and safer than using eBay, where items are often fakes and shipping costs and arm and a leg. 

Kawaii is always a nice atmosphere. It's a wonderful store that fills me with so much happiness, and they are sure to get in the hottest toys and collectibles as soon as they can.

They have great quality products for face cleansing. As with any other brand the prices have increased over the last 20 years however not so much that it will keep me from buying their products.

I miss the old days with my Mom when she would stop by and pick up makeup. They really treated you like a Queen then and really were hands on with demonstrating and selling the products.

These days you walk in and pick up what you want and are on your way. The staff does not have the passion, knowledge or motivation to show me new products or demonstrate.

I know what I want when I go in as I have been using the same products for years however show me something new rather than point to a display and say that is what is new.

My last experience was poor, the employee had no clue about their makeup accessories such as a foundation brush. ""She thinks this is the one I want or should have"". Don't give me that, when I know more about the products then an employee does it does not make me feel like spending my money and shopping! The employees name is on my receipt however I will keep it to myself rather than name drop.

I am disappointed, I don't expect the Outstanding quality of service that was issued back in the 80's however at least fake it til you make it and help a customer.

If this type of service continues, then I see in the future Merle Norman being another statistic of going out of business and closing shop all together.

After seeing it on Man vs Food and hearing that it is one of Pittsburgh's best places for breakfast, how can I not be excited.  However, leaving the bustling breakfast place, I found myself very disappointed.

I did my research before I came here.  My mother and I only had one more day together before I went back to school, and I wanted the meal to be great.  I knew what I wanted to order before I even opened the front door to the place: the Seafood Omelette.

I made this decision based mostly off of my love for seafood and avocado.  However, when I got the dish, I was saddened

To start off with, there were only 3 little slivers of avocado spaced on top of the massive omelette.  You would think for the $13 I would get a little more, but I let it go.  I then started eating the omelette.  My first bite was shrimp; then, my next bite was shrimp; then, my next bite was once again, you guessed it, shrimp.  After I was done eating, I recalled only tasted one bite of crab.  Never did my taste buds or my eyes even see any lobster.  Very Very disappointing for the most expensive omelette on the menu.

Also, the restaurant messed up my order and gave me hash browns when I wanted the tomatoes.  The hash browns were not good at all either.  My mother and I didn't even eat either side order (which is really rare that we don't eat something).  Finally, when the waitress set down my plate she said, ""Oh, I will be right back with your toast.""  Well, she never came back.  When she did, she was apologetic, but my mother and I had already finished our meals.  


In the place's defense, the omelette was good, but it just was not what anyone should expect from one of the most expensive items on the menu; especially when there is suppose to be lobster and crab inside.  My mothers Eggs Benedict was also very good, so no complaints with her meal, except the bad hash browns.

Like I told my mom, the 3 star rating means that I would go back and eat, but I would defiantly try somewhere else in the area before I go back.",2011-08-23 00:17:13

Old-timey, old-timey, old-timey!

Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream!

I'm not sure you really need any more information than that, but I'll endeavor to perhaps fill in a few details.

So, this is indeed an adorable little ice cream parlor in Old Town Scottsdale. It's old school, and not retro. Sure, they're still printing up the elaborate napkins and working that old font pretty hard, but it's not some new place that opened up with a polished, old-time feel. No, it's an old place that's keeping the feeling alive.

That said, it probably could use some polishing. They have main parlor that's about as adorable as you could hope, but I did feel like the whole thing could have used a good scrubbing. There's also a back room for the kiddos with token-fed games like skee-ball and air hockey. They're not the newest, nor in the best condition, but the kids do love them. And they spit out tickets that you can trade in for trinkets.

The food is basic. I split a burger and they were so kind to actually split the burger and give us a generous portion of potato chips and two pickles. In fact, the staff was so very very sweet the entire time. Not ""slick and polished"" but ""sweet and really trying."" The burger? Well, also pretty basic. But don't come here for the food, I think. It's more about the ice cream.

We tried a few kinds, and it's also old school. Nothing organic, or locally sourced, or herb-infused. Nosireee, this is old school, hand-scooped, basic flavors with chocolate and caramel on top. There are lots of options, or you can build your own concoction. It's simple, basic, felt kind of expensive (but somebody's gotta pay that lease and print those napkins) and I can't complain.

Come by with the kids, or pop in for a treat. It's not novel, but these days something this genuinely old school is a novelty.",2015-01-29 04:38:16

The ambiance here is awesome. My daughter walks in and sees a huge fish tank. Then walks to the left where there is a room with two iPads and plastic wave model that you walk through to get to a video game. There is a projection TV that was playing Rapunzel. Tons of seating for the kids.

My daughters dentist and assistant was patient with her. My daughter was screaming bloody murder and they stayed calm and collective.

I was okay until a party of 7 was quoted 1.5 hours and sat in 10 minutes.  Oh heck now...I have been waiting longer than my 40 minutes and now I'm irritated.

Bambu Desserts & Drinks is a Vietnamese dessert shop that originated in San Jose and now has locations in nine states, including this spot in a tiny Spring Mountain strip mall. Featuring a wide variety of fresh ingredients (tropical fruits, jellies, coconut milk, and more) in dessert soups and puddings, their featured ""chè"" could still be the next big thing in desserts.

But I was in the mood for something else. It wasn't boba / milk tea either, since I have my local favorite for that already. Finally, after scrolling through umpteen descriptions of chè, I found Stefany V.'s review of the Vietnamese Coffee Blend ($4.25). It was a nice smoothie of the very potent coffee, it's sweet but not too sweet, and it will give you a huge kick of caffeine. I wasn't a fan of how the actual coffee started to drain out of the ice and settle at the bottom, but it's probably fully melted away in my fridge anyway. Yeah, I had to stop myself from drinking it all, lest I stay up wired all night.

I'll explore chè eventually, and I want to try Bambu's fresh passion fruit drink too. For this visit, however, a smooth and slurpable drink were good enough.",2015-11-03 20:16:06

If you've got a hankering for butter chicken poutine read this review and weigh the pros and cons should you find yourself at Yorkdale Mall and in desperate need of a poutine fix.

I've had their butter chicken and it's not bad.  It's good the first few bites and then it just turns into a chore to finish the rest.  

While the place is nestled into a little cafe-like area, the lack of customers should have told me to not order the poutine as the fries would not be fresh.  Unable to resist, I asked if the fries were fresh (since they didn't look it).  The woman there told me 'yes' and I should have gone with my instinct.  

At over $6 it's not bad but not a great deal by any means.  When I tried it I knew I had been had, the fries were definately not fresh.  They were warm but only because the butter chicken had sat on top of it for quite some time as I waited to pay.

Unlike their butter chicken with rice, the first few bites were not pleasant.  The warmness from the butter chicken could not mask the dry and unsavory fries.

Ironically they are right beside NY fries which also has butter chicken poutine available.

Should you find yourself with this dilemma you need to ask yourself what is more important:

Hot fries, or fresh hot butter chicken?

You get fresh fries at NY fries but the butter chicken most likely isn't fresh and hot but if you go with Amaya your fries are most likely going to be sitting there a while before it's served to you.

They get an extra star because I asked the lady if I could get more fries (before I knew they were cold) and she gave me more.",2012-06-15 03:57:10

5 The sins committed by the men of Tempe were so wicked as to deserve such punishment 6 that they were never to be spoken of. 7 A pile of horrible, tiny pieces of fish-meal 8 are the LORD's manna from hell, 9 a punishment unlike any other on the soul, mind, and stomach.

10 Requiring only the smallest number of shekels, 11 God sought to tempt even he without sin 12 into sampling its putrid fruit, 13 the punishment for partaking not unlike that of Adam and Eve, having partaken of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

14 As they bit into the crusty, bland fish, 15 they became aware of their horrible betrayal of God and their stomachs 16 and were banished to the restroom for the rest of the evening. 

17 ""Frozen chunks of pressed fish meal does not fried fish make"" sayeth the LORD, issuing several commandments. 18 Thou shall not try the Pete's Sauce for it is awful and I hath spewed it from my mouth as it was lukewarm and tasted horrible. 19 Thou shall not give in to temptation for cheap fish, when it is known that Pete's is neither cheap (for one's soul, if not the wallet) nor fish. 20 A curse upon the household of any man who tries the hamburgers. The cramping of 10,000 stomachs shall be felt upon your own gut, a horrible taste left in your mouth for eternity. 21 You will forever recall the intense disappointment I feel of you as you feel for the meal you consume at Pete's. 22 It shall cast your mouth and gut into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

23 The serpent may tempt with ""chips"". 24 ""Do not heed his words,"" sayeth the LORD. They are soggy, ill-prepared, and above all, flavorless. 25 The breading hath no flavor but sadness, the fish no flavor but bland meal, both betraying its true genesis: 26 A frozen, preformed patty of processed misery. 27 God condemned this abomination and called, ""you are not one of my creatures!""

28 ""They shall take only cash, as not even the credit card companies dare near their tainted field,"" God commanded.

29 The seventh angel will pour out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice will come out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, ""It is done!"" And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. 30 Now the city was condemned to only ever eat from Pete's forevermore, an eternal damnation, a hell on earth, the sins of man so great, the punishment fitting with God's will.",2010-04-30 09:08:58

Good thing the weather was nice and outdoor seating was available in 20 minutes when we got there. One word of advice, definitely go for outdoor seating if you can. The environment inside is just way too chaotic, dark and bar-like, that you can barely hold a decent conversation with the people you're with. I'm not too sure what vibe they are going for, but indoor seating is definitely not ideal. 

As for the tacos, they are hands down one of the best I've tasted albeit a little pricey. If you're planning on ordering 7 or more sets, get the combos which will save you a bit of money if you're going for the more expensive tacos. I tried the chorizo, Korean, Baja and pork shoulder one. Each of them had just the right amount of filling and flavor. I'd recommend the Korean most, because it's a nice twist to your regular taco. If you're a fan of egg, go for the chorizo one.

Two tacos in a set might seem like a little, but I was stuffed after my first 2 out of 4. Will definitely come back when I get the chance too! (And hopefully get outdoor seating...)",2015-11-12 04:19:34

Which technically was 7 hours since we were catching a connecting flight early the next morning. Staff at front desk was friendly. Our room was clean and average size. Nothing that makes you say ""wow"" As a Starwood member, I would expect an upgrade but since it was such a short stay, no big deal. Would have been nice, but hey it didn't happen.

I like the convenience of staying here, since it's located in the airport and no need to go outside. Grab your bags and go over the pedway/walkway to the hotel and vice versa back to the airport.

The problem I have with some hotels, is ones that charge for Internet/wifi. This isn't 2007 anymore Sheraton. Get with the times. When we finally arrived to our room, I was not able to get Internet on my laptop or IPad? After a call to the front desk, found out I could pay for it for $20? For a person who needs to access her emails and respond to somethings for maybe an hour max, this isn't something I was willing to pay for. Sadly, I had to go down to the lobby and work from there since Wifi is free in the lobby as well as the airport.Not ideal when you just travelled for 6+ hours and its almost midnight.Fail.

Checkout wasn't ideal. As I mentioned, we were at the hotel for less than 7 hours before catching our early morning flight. When arriving to check out, only two people were in line. Since its check out it should be a fairly quick and seamless process....right? Not so much! Only one person was working at the desk and it was obvious, she had no idea what she was doing. When we finally had our turn, she printed off our stay/bill. I noticed two charges on there,that shouldn't have been. Our bill should only be our 1 night hotel stay, nothing else. Which I told her. She advised me there was two charges from the restaurant for lunch and dinner? Advised her that was not possible since we arrived after 11:00pm and were not even in Toronto for lunch or dinner? She obviously didn't believe me and thought I was pulling a fast one on her? No idea, but I was not impressed. Told Her I would not be paying those and to only charge my credit card for our stay. After all it's 6:00am and I am in no mood to get into an argument this early before my next flight. That didn't sit well with her and after some debate, I told her to look at our file since she should know what time we checked in at? ""If we checked in that late, well it's well after lunch and dinner time"". Yes, stating the obvious and trying to be a problem solver. Someone needs to be.

Long story short, paid for our stay and she would investigate the other charges. No apology or friendliness on her part. It's obvious it's Sheraton's error. She stated she would charge the credit card for our stay and if the food charges were really not ours, it wouldn't be charged to the credit card. I was firm and told her, it better not be since we were not even at the hotel when these charges transpired or even in Toronto? We have been back home for two weeks and no other charges showed up on my credit card so I will assume they figured it all out? No idea. Was not overly impressed with this or the Internet situation. Next time we will stay at another hotel at YYZ airport.",2015-03-28 15:48:35

I can see where all the love comes from.  The food sold here tastes ""fresh and home-made"" for sure.

But not too much I have had here (and I have eaten there 4 times now) has really made me say, ""Wow, this is some of the best food around.""

The salsas and guacamole are very good.  

The carne asada does have a very nice taste - however, it's shown a tendency to be a little bit (just the tiny, TINIEST BIT) dry on occasion.

The chips (served room temperature and costing $1.50) are store-bought and not up to par with the rest of the food.

The charro beans are definitely among the top contenders in the Valley.

I'd up this to a 5-star if they'd fry their own chips, or change to a style they can serve warm, and maybe leave some of the juice in the carne asada.

A nice place to eat.  A smidge away from about as fresh as food can taste.",2011-07-22 19:46:29

This is more basic than Starbucks, and should be obvious to even the most amateur hipster watchers. But Sip is home to something so special and unique that it is drawing hipster watchers in from all around the Southwest: the elusive ""South Scottsdale Hipster Bro.""

While the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro hasn't been officially classified yet in the Before it Was Cool Hipster Almanac, rumors have it that peer review is pending and will likely be complete within the year. An official designation will probably be a boon for business, as it will likely draw even more hipster watchers from farther afield. Sip already has a reputation among Hipster watchers, with the largest documented population of this unique endemic varietal of hipster in the lower 48. At nearly any given moment at least one or two hipster bros will be present - a treat since most Hipster Bro sightings in the wild occur with only a single specimen. Visiting hipster watchers will find this group viewing a treat, as Hipster Bros only produce their unique vocalizations within close vicinity of another Hipster Bro.

What it is about Sip that acts as a draw for Hispter Bros is yet unknown. The decor may be a factor. It is hypothesized that the shabbychic furniture reminds the Hipster Bro of his old frat house, providing him with both comfort and a sense of home, while the vibrant colors and excellent spacing appeal to his sensitive, artistic soul. The mismatched plastic cups may remind him of the cheap plastic cups he still occasionally plays beer pong with, and they also help him hydrate so he can later hit the gym to work off those coffee calories. And while the decor may be partially responsible for the influx of Hipster Bros, Sip's draft selection is also a magnet for HBs looking to smash a few craft brewskies with his bros. Like sugar water to a hummingbird, Sip attracts Hipster Bros with the opportunity to swap beard grooming techniques, order mocchiatos the way their made in Italy, and hit on some fly-ass honies. Clearly they find the combination of all these elements irresistible, and the result is a stunning concentration of the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro.

Come enjoy this off-the-map Hipster watching mecca before the word gets out it gets ruined by the crowds. You'll be delighted to see bro hugs between men with beards and skinny jeans, and nothing beats the thrill of hearing a craft IPA-drinking Hipster Bro talk about taking his vintage 1978 Schwinn over to a girl's house and totally banging her even though she was a 6.

Marvel Superheroes decorate the restaurant here, and the workers are very personable. We ordered a cheesesteak to share. The question was-did we want it ""Wit' Cheese?(Provolone) or ""Wit' Whiz? (Cheese Whiz) I asked the lady if they could do half and half, and she said""no problem"".....NICE! Unfortunately Amoroso Rolls are no longer used because they would buy them frozen, and as soon as they got to Vegas, the quality wasn't the same, so they use a local bakery. The Lady assured me it was pretty damn close to the real deal, so I said to do it up like the locals do, with onions, peppers, and the two different cheeses. We also decided to order a cherry pie for dessert.

The Cheesesteak arrives and let me tell you, it is enough for two people! They serve it with skinny fries like Freddy's and very filling. although both of them were good, I prefer the provolone over the whiz. The pie was also good and different, being made from pizza dough, it was crisp, and chewy, and the filling wasn't overly sweet.

Too many 'me too' breweries, that think churning out a mediocre product is fine as long as you have some local branding.  The formula is simple: open a brewery in a gentrifying (cheap) area, name your brewery after said area, make/copy 1 lager, 1 ale, 1 IPA and 1 stout - all as equally bland and forgettable as the macro-brands.

It's really difficult to stand out from the cacophony of new breweries.  But I think I rank Blood Brothers close second after Bellwoods for my favourite Toronto brewery.  The key difference: it's actually possible to get a seat at Blood Brothers without waiting 1.5 hours.  Sure it's small, there's only snacks and it's purely self-serve - but the it's relatively remote so not a lot of people make it out here.  The plus side: it's pretty easy to find parking in a mostly industrial area.

The archaic religious branding is pretty good and is reflected in the decor and wall scroll menu.  What's available on tap is typically available in bottles ($5 - $8 for 500ml) as well.  The tap pricing is pretty odd though - for example: Shumei IPA - 4oz $2.75, 8 oz $3.50, 12 oz $5.  So in other words, $2.75 for the 1st four ounces, $0.75 for the next, $1.50 for the final four ounces.  The bigger size is still the best deal, but the progression is odd.

I like their Shumei IPA - it's balanced and not completely neutered of hoppiness like most east-coast IPAs.  Their Blank Hand Stout is reminiscent of DDC's Peche Mortel (huge compliment).  On my first visit, I was blown away from their 'Love Trip' DIPA which was fermented with mango and guava - it was insanely good.  On my second visit, this was replaced with their new 'Fall of Thebes' blueberry sour -- a bit disappointing, but this was a good sour.

Anyways, I have yet to have anything from Blood Brothers that I didn't like and they are making genuinely exciting and unique brews.  The fact that the taproom isn't overly crowded (yet) is another huge plus.  There's not a lot of food options but I did see a delivery pizza box at another table - didn't ask staff what the official policy was - but that's a pretty cool move.",2017-10-23 02:41:36

We stopped by rather late in the evening as our schedule just doesn't seem to completely accommodate the normal dinner hour. No matter, we were welcomed into the restaurant. 

We started with a fantastic appetizer. Here's your secret tip - this item isn't on the menu. Although they have removed it from the menu, they have the ingredients and don't mind pulling it together at all. ""IT"" is the Piquillos. These are sweet peppers from Spain stuffed with goat cheese covered with a terrific sauce! My favorite! 

I had grilled Mahi Mahi for the main course which was a special and not a regular menu item. But, the dish was delicious!! The fish was cooked perfectly.  My wife had Berejenas which is an eggplant dish with spinach and cheese. Both of us really enjoyed our main course items.

Menu pricing is moderate, but in my opinion very fair and reasonable for what you get. Our total bill with drinks, and appetizer, two main courses (and one of them a special item), and a desert was $66 dollars.

The service was outstanding. Our waiter checked on us often, explained everything (very patiently) and was ready with recommendations. I think that most of the wait staff at the restaurant have been with them for quite a while! 

And so, even though I am dieting... we shared a dessert - Tres Leche. Let me tell you, if you don't eat anything else in Charlotte, you need to head over to Miro and try their Tres Leche! Simply the best I've had. 
The restaurant is very clean and comfortable. I can tell you that they can accommodate a group as I have taken a group here recently. And, now that the weather is breaking, they also offer some outside seating.

However, the food still tasted great.  I love rice and I always get a burrito bowl with extra rice (they only charge you if you ask for extra meat).  So I used to get a burrito that they could not completely close because I asked for extra on too many things.  However that makes a mess on me so I get the bowl instead and this place is great for filling up on good tasting food on the cheap.

If I went there and there were happier people, I would boost the rating, I just felt like the cashier was peering through my soul... not what I want when I want food.  I prefer going to a place with a positive atmosphere.

We got two tacos - one angus with salsa and one chicken with sriracha lime cream. At $4 a piece I was hoping for a little more substance in my taco, but it wasn't too far off from my expectations. The ingredients all seemed fresh - I was particularly fond of the soft corn tortilla shell. It added a great flavor. The meats were not seasoned enough for my liking. Both the chicken and angus could have used a little more lovin', but the sriracha lime sauce was very good. The salsa on the angus taco was too runny causing the taco shell to disintegrate and juice to spill out all over me.

It felt like I was back in Los Angeles where the weather is shinny and it's 75 degrees. The designed of the place definitely makes you forget about the 100+ heat outdoors. Impressive layout and beautiful décor. What I like most was the fact that this entire restaurant layout was divided into sections. You get your dining room where you get a very large glass room display of their wine selections or you get the lounge where they offer live jazz music. To top it off, each table, no matter where you sit, feels like it's own private world. 

Let's talk about the food....
Appetizer - tartar of pacific ahi tuna - amazing. The sweetness from the mango, the citrus from the grape fruit with the cool fresh taste of the ahi tuna makes this the perfect choice for something light just to start your meal.

Entrée - 12oz filet mignon - perfectly season and cook the perfection. 
Roasted double breasted chicken, I can't say I really care for this one. The chicken was nicely moist but the sauce I felt was a bit on the salty side

side dishes - au gratin potate - omg, I've never tasted anything as amazing as this unless you also get the truffle mac & cheese. Both side dishes pared really well with both entrees.

dessert - crème brulee, amazing.

services = impeccable. My water cup was never lower than half, my waitress was always around when I needed her.

After going over the menu, everything looked good on paper. I went with the Oxtail Fried Rice and Edamame. Wifey went with the Grilled Squid. Our friends got the Fish Tacos and Bone Marrow soup.

For the appetizers the Edamame was lightly grilled and sprinkled with sea salt. Taste was just ordinary. As for the Fish Tacos they give 3 little taco shells that look and taste kind of like deep fried won tons. The actual fish (which was not much) was yellow tail.

The Oxtail Fried Rice was very salty. I think they put too much soy sauce. I could only eat about 3 spoonfuls. That's too bad because tastewise, I dont think it needed that much salt.

The Grilled Squid was on point. Nicely seasoned and grilled. The spicy garlic aioli sauce that it comes with complemented it very well.

The Bone Marrow soup comes with a huge bone. Literally. Im not into that so I cant really say if I liked it or not.

Service was great. We never had to ask for refills on our waters especially me because of the excess salt that I had eaten.

Overall, the total tab was around 70 bucks including tip. In my opinion, the food is great with the exception of the Oxtail Fried Rice. I think the pricing is bit much based on the portions you get. The Beef Carpaccio was recommended by my Yelp friends after seeing my check-in here. Im sure I will find myself in the area next time so a second visit will be pending.

Pancakes were ""eh"". The flavor was not enough for me to appreciate them being a ""lemon"" pancake. Blueberry compote, while rich and thick was disappointing because it offered no sugar/sweet flavor to the dish. So all in all these pancakes were bland with a tart sauce on top of them. Pass.

I was brought water and iced tea as I was looking over the menu.  I also showed my server, Jared, my Yelp check in offer of a free small guacamole.  He went off to the kitchen and returned with the guacamole shortly.  It is a bit different than the standard guacamole but it's really good.  

I ordered a cup of  chicken tortilla soup and the brick pressed chicken.  Here's where they break the mold again.  The chicken tortilla soup is a tomato based soup with thin strips of chicken breast and topped with tortilla strips.  It is very good.  The skin of the brick pressed chicken is crispy and the dish comes with a variety of vegetables--cauliflower, carrots,  and potatoes and there's a base of chicken thyme jus on which the chicken and vegetables rest.  It's a very light dish and the vegetables are crispy and not cooked to mush.

For dessert, I got the brownie which has a touch of serrano chili.  The round brownie sits atop a round of dulce de leche ice cream and it's topped with whipped cream with a tinge of lime.  This too is very good.

The restaurant is a really pleasant place.  There is patio dining facing Flamingo and now that temperatures are getting cooler, it would be a good place to sit out.

GX1hH2em-32xZ2f5uBSKCQ,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg,2,8,10,7,"I went to Metro last weekend with a friend after taking shots of a public art display along the canal, when we decided to check out some place new for dinner and Metro was the first thing that popped up. As we walked towards the old Foodbar, we saw a lone guy with his Casio keyboard and a $5 light machine standing in the middle of the courtyard, entertaining the outdoor diners of both Digestif and Metro. And when he broke into a hilariously bad soulman rendition of Michael Jackson's ""Rock With You"" (OFF THE WALL, PEOPLE!) while the light machine did its magic, we knew we had to sit on the patio.

Our hostess was friendly, told us about the recession-buster drink specials, and seated us outside. I glanced at the menus she gave us- seemed a bit familiar, like Balthazar's in New York, but everything looked great. They serve dinner on weeknights till midnight, and weekends till 2 am. However, things pretty much started going downhill from there. Our waiter came by and sternly told us, verbatim, ""You guys were seated at the same time as three other tables, so I can't help you right now."" Huh? Um, ok. Never before did I feel like I offended a server simply by sitting down.

And his attitude got worse as the evening progressed. While we were looking at our menus, I noticed that Metro served poutine in its late night menu (Poutine's a French-Canadian mound of french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds and a favorite of mine from childhood). I'd never seen this in Arizona, and so when the waiter came by, I smiled and remarked to him, ""That's pretty cool you guys serve poutine! I haven't seen that here."" His response? ""Well, you can't have any right now. We don't serve that until 10."" What the fuck? I can READ, asshole.  I was giving your restaurant a compliment and you returned it by being a condescending ass. My friend and I just looked at each other wondering if this was really happening. 

I eventually decided to go with the steak frites ($19) and my friend ordered the salmon with spinach and fingerling potatoes ($18). As we were waiting for quite a while, the outdoor temperature started dipping pretty quickly and my friend asked a server if he could turn on the adjacent heat lamp. One of the other servers attempted to turn it on, it didn't work, and just left it not working. Didn't bother asking us if we'd like to move to a table near a working heat lamp. Nothing. My friend was getting cold, and also confused. ""Did we seriously do anything to piss these people off?"" she asked. I shrugged my shoulders because I had no idea.

As our food arrived after 40 minutes or so, my friend's sister came to join us (we were assuming since we were at a 4-top it wouldn't be a problem). Apparently it was, though, because there was no, ""Hi! Would you like to see a menu? Anything to drink?"" It was all her asking, ""Excuse me? Um, hi. Can I see a menu? And your wine list? Thanks."" Seriously, what is going on with this place? All three of us are here to spend money and are pretty nice people, but they could really give a crap less.

I will say the saving grace of Metro WAS the food. My steak frites were great (seriously, some of the best fries I've had in a long time) and my friend seemed to like her salmon. We decided to go for the beignets for dessert, served with little dipping cups of nutella, vanilla cream, and raspberry coulis. When they came, we asked for forks since otherwise we'd all have sauces all over our fingers. Waiter? ""Well, you're SUPPOSED to eat them with your hands. Ok, I'll get you some forks."" My friend's sister turned to us and asked us, ""What the heck did you do to this guy?"" Answer: Nothing. That said, the beignets were great.

So, yeah, folks, I am pretty pissed. Not just because as a paying and usually appreciative customer I was treated like complete shit by the waitstaff. But because I really wanted to enjoy this place. There's a Canadian connection there. And the food is actually really good. Had the service been just as good, or even at least remotely friendly, this place would be at least 4 stars, easy. I really don't get why, in this economy when restaurants are hurting, a waiter will think it's a great idea to be so cold to his customers. Does he actually want Metro to get bad worth-of-mouth about its service? My two friends are Scottsdale natives who love to eat out and often reserve large group dinners for birthdays and other occasions and he pretty much lost their business that evening. I'm going to probably give these guys another chance, just to have their poutine, and hopefully have better service by someone else, and would gladly update my review if that happens. But if service is the same, then these guys are off my list permanently.

A really disappointing and bewildering experience more than anything. Poor soulman singing ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" on his Casio keyboard couldn't even make us feel better as we left. Alas.",2009-01-23 22:33:28

It was a lovely sunny Saturday and I longed to dine outdoors with a bit of shade perhaps.  I drove by Pittsburgh Thai by Boris in Verona and I thought, ""Great""!  There were just 2 tables outdoors on the sidewalk but one was still available so I was delighted.  

That is, until 1) the hostess/server inside didn't even give me eye contact (not a good start) but said to go ahead and seat myself outside.  Okay, I'm sure she'll be right behind me with a menu.  Maybe not.  Several minutes later, she does come out with ice water, silverware, napkins and the menu, still not making eye contact.  Strange, in her line of business, I thought.  Ok, fine. Let's see what's on the menu.  The menu looked heavenly.  I had trouble deciding between Chili Shrimp and Chicken with Mangoes in Yellow Curry.

I had plenty of time to decide, it appears even after setting down the menu and drinking half the ice cold water.  Mind you, there's a table next to mine and they're not getting service, either.  They may have been finished, but no one was checking on their needs.

Finally, I could have gone inside to track down my server but it just wasn't worth it.  Do you hear me, owners and would-be customers???  There are plenty of other restaurants in Pittsburgh that I shouldn't have to go out of my way to get decent service.

I had the Capitano ($5.50), which has cheese and house sauce in addition to lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. You can ask to exclude any of the toppings, if you wish. For 3.50, you can make it a combo; you get a drink (you just grab any can or water bottle from the freezer behind you), and a choice of onion rings, fries or gelato.

I think the size of their burger is similar to a Hero burger, maybe not as tall, but definitely the lack in height is made up in circumference. 

The buns are made in-house, so it has that home-baked taste. The bread doesn't stick to the roof of your mouth like the other franchise buns (McD, BK), and it's fluffy and moist. 

You get a lot more meat than the franchise burgers, but not as much as Hero? The meat is better than the standard patty you would get at McD or BK though...you can actually ""see"" the meat after you bite into the patty, as opposed to the super-finely ground-then-pressed-together-patty.
The cheese wasn't the nasty plastic Kraft Singles cheese, yay. I don't think the house sauce was anything special, to be honest...Overall, the burger was really good. 

Onion rings are so so crispy, I think they double fry?  Yummmmm.
The fries are simple; no extra batter or crisp added. Just some McCain style cut potatoes, paprika sprinkles, salted nicely, very good. Not crunchy or crispy, but very good.  

They have a lot of interesting signature burgers that I'd like to try next time. I'll definitely be back!

Unfortunately, Hokkaido Milk Tea (Hokkaido milk with a distinctive toffee caramel flavour) and Okinawa Milk Tea (roasted milk tea with a hint of coffee) are powder based.

The oysters were decently fresh and okay sized. Came with a variety of sauces to accompany including a ponzu, horseradish, Tabasco, and marinara. 

The saba was grilled well. It didn't come with sauce, I'm used to some tangy ponzu or teriyaki sauce on the side. When I asked for some sauce on the side, I was told it didn't come with sauce and if I wanted some teriyaki sauce they'd charge me for it... Really not impressed with that. It would've cost them 5cents and they wanna charge me for it? The saba was done well but really put off by them wanting to charge me for a little teriyaki sauce.

The sashimi plate was very pretty and the fish was decently fresh. Some of the sashimi was flavoured with spices or seared. The flavor combination was good. Wish they had mackeral though. They did have hamachi (I think...) And the tako was good. My favorite was the fatty Salmon belly.  Lots of choices.

Overall a decent meal, would've been two stars for wanting to charge me for a little teriyaki sauce but the food was actually good so it's a very begrudging 3. 

Oh and being seated in the back was hard to get service. To be fair they did come around a couple times but when I actually did want something they were not around lol. I didn't ding them tho because near the end my sister dropped a chopstick and almost immediately a server (one of the few male ones) popped up with a replacement which was very appreciated. But I asked for the bill from another server shortly after and had to wait a long time. Finally I just walked up to the cash and paid there myself. So overall a so-so rating for service.

Alas, it was not to be. The burger (again I got the single patty little burger) was dry. There were actually dry crunchy bits on the circumference of the patty. I'm all about the char, but this was beyond char. This was a dry, abused patty. 

I was bewildered given the lovely juiciness that I experienced the first time I came here. How could things have gone so wrong? Oh, ho! I winkled out the answer to that mystery as I was leaving. I witnessed the tall blond girl commit a crime against burgerkind that should not be borne by any burger-loving citizen. She had her spatula on top of a burger patty and she was leaning her weight into it. Squeezing out all the luscious beef juices with what appeared to be ferocious and great enthusiasm. 

What the devil, blond girl! What did that burger patty ever do to you? I  understand smashing the patty into the griddle to get a good char, but once you get that initial adherence, you ease off. There was no easing off here. I don't know whether to assign malicious intent or ignorance to her actions, but she was laying into the patty like it was a snitch and she was the mob enforcer. 

And the fries, those lovely perfectly seasoned fries of my last visit, were also subpar on this visit. They were slightly limp and lacked appropriate seasoning.

Dr. Tran is a funny yet no-nonsense doctor who I think I could come to like just as much as my regular MD. In fact, I like the idea of giving my money to a medical establishment that has evening hours. It's great being able to get thoughtful health care without taking time off work. 

Speaking of work, Procare is good about providing notes if necessary. It's very convenient when I've, say, had my annual mega-cold to drop by for a quick exam once I feel better and get a note to prove that, yes, I was sick. (I just don't understand going to the doctor for something you know will pass, nor do I understand hauling your gross body out of your sickbed just to be able to say you went to the doctor. It's a weird world.)

X-rays and bloodwork can be done on site, which is more convenient than my regular doctor's office.

The waiting room is comfortable, and Eddie D's and a bakery is but a few steps away should you need a little quick and easy comfort food before settling down at home to convalesce.

It was quite a drive for me, especially when my usual Hawaiian BBQ of choice is so much closer. But, I'd drive the distance to try a new place or to have some exceptional food, without a doubt!

There was a party of 4 and another party of 2 dining and a gentleman behind the counter/register, nobody else. Must of been the off peak hours.. Shortly after I entered the shop, I had a seat and the man greeted me with that typical island swag (real mellow and inviting). We had some small talk and I found out he was the owner. I told him that I really love Hawaiian food and that I drove across town, passed several other places alike, just to have a try. He became interestingly ecstatic and started suggesting what to order. Mann, the way he was talking about his wife's cooking (she's the chef/cook), I was convinced that he'd lead me the right direction! (he even showed me visuals too, actual photos of their food)

Starters that I did not ask for! All on the house!

Hot Tea: with the cool weather nowadays, this helped

Boiled Peanuts: just as the name says, simple pre-game snack 

Napa cabbage & Radish, both prepared korean style: I liked munchin' on these. They're actually Outstanding!

Fried Mandu: 5 pieces of fried mini empanada looking things and dipping sauce. Pretty Good 

Actual order:

Combo (Kalbi, Meat Jun & BBQ Chicken): nicely portioned for one hungry person. The included Macaroni salad was creamy, mildly flavored and a bit softer in texture than I'm used to. Kalbi was real tasty, cooked right (just enough, not over done) and ripped right off the bones. BBQ Chicken was better than any I've had (in regards to hawaiian bbq chicken)! And I purposely saved the Best for last, the Meat Jun! Its a thin cut of ribeye steak dipped in egg! The steak had a mild balanced sweet/salty flavor and was so tender (like ribeye should be) but I'm talking about as soft as the egg! I'm thinking that the butcher must of pounded the living @#$% out of it cause I could of sliced that thing with the handle of my knife! Not only that, it seemed the egg had a hint of some sorta cake/vanilla flavor in it that totally caught me off guard. Combine that with the steak and this soy based looking dipping sauce....I was SPEECHLESS! I Almost shed a tear, a tear of happiness of course! Do NOT Pass This Up!

Side of Gravy: just wanted to try it and I'm glad I did! Not as thick as I've had at other places and more dark brown in appearance.. Great, just like everything else!

After the meal, the owner brought me a little bowl (sample) of the their Saimin soup. Piping hot, a tad salty and Soooooothing!

Hawaiian BBQ & Korean Fusion at its Finest!!! Food was Very Impressive and absolutely made with True Passion, Love and Evident Skills!! The Owner's Service was Top Notch, More than Generous, Humble and Sincere! ROCK SOLID 5 STARS!!!!!",2010-12-11 10:19:57

Made a reservation on open table for a Thursday night (not sure if it was going to be busy), got seated right away. Was my first time there so was taking in all the details, blown away by the wine cellar that arches over the walkway into the restaurant! Love how dim, and romantic the whole place is right when you walk inside you notice. 

Ordered the pork chop, 16oz prime New York strip, truffle Mac and cheese, crab fried rice, a bottle of Byron Pinot Noir, and a Godiva chocolate cake to top it off.

The server was triple sat immediately right after we were seated, so he was a little slow with us but I work in the industry so I understand. We were out of water for a good 5 minutes and watched back servers walk pass a few times, but it wasn't too too big of a deal once we asked for water and our food to be boxed up it was jiffy fast.

The server Dan-O was very personable and funny, bartender kara, was speedy and great.

Will surely return for another romantic night out on the town. Can't wait to visit the Eddie V's in San Diego!

We decided to sit at the sushi bar because we both like interacting with our sushi chefs and as soon as we sat down neither chefs greeted us or even looked at us. We waited and waited but nothing. After the waitress took our drink order I decided to give it the college try and strike up a convo with one of them. He didn't seem very interested and when my husband asked if he could add sauce or spruce up the nigiri sushi the chef replied with "" no, not today. "" ummm excuse me me? You couldn't add some sauce to the fish? In our opinion they were both being jerks ( my husband used another word). I am not one to cuss on yelp but who does that? We ended up moving to a table because they were not nice at all. They didn't even ask if we wanted ginger and wasabi. Anyways, on to the food...
The sushi was not bad. My husband and I ordered the passion of fire roll and red devil roll( we added shrimp tempura to that one. )They came out fast and were both pretty good but nothing special. We also ordered the monkey balls appetizer and that was pretty good as well but still nothing about this restaurant was Amazing. I will be going back to Osaka as my go to Sushi restaurant. The waitress was sweet and awesome and so was the older lady that worked there I'm guessing she's an owner not sure though.

Let's start with the very few negatives, which didn't ruin my rating for this place. I basically left the restaurant with an empty wallet and in search for a cheap place to grab something else to eat, since this omakase experience did not completely fill me up.
But now to the actual omakase 'experience':
We entered in to find the cutest little japanese restaurant, which was both cozy but well laid out, making it look upscale but not too pretentious. 
We opted for the most expensive thing in the menu, which was the 5 course omakase dinner.
The server was a very friendly and well trained lady who kept refilling our glasses of water and smiling throughout. Since omakase involves Hiro (the chef) to personally make each sushi there and then, each course would arrive one by one, and therefore the dinner lasted a good 2 hours.
The first course was miso soup, and honestly, I have never tried miso soup that good my entire life! It was literally creamy. I could have drank a whole gallon of that stuff! 
I have posted pictures of most of the courses I got, which were all spectacular. I would like to specially highlight the butterfish sushi...it actually melted in my mouth!
Hiro was there quietly making sushi right in front of you with full concentration and passion, which definitely shows in his, what I would call, 'art'.
I'm not a sort of person that's willing to spend more than $100 on a meal, but ever since this experience, I have chosen to eat at Hiro sushi at least once a year. It was definitely worth it. But, like I said, I did have to go home and munch on some more food after.",2015-08-17 21:44:58

For my meal, I ordered the Seafood Al Ajillo which is shrimp and scallops sauteed in a roasted garlic olive oil sauce with red onions, tomatoes and fresh avocado served over Mexican rice. I was surprised at how fast the food came out so I assumed the quality wouldn't be very good. I was surprised that the quality of the food was actually quite nice!

After trying Comerica Theatre a couple of weeks ago and being disappointed we came to Ak Chin last night for the Blake Shelton concert. 

A little background about us:
Couple, Mid 30's, travelled across the US to different music venues. 

I had read all of the previous reviews about access to Ak Chin so we expected traffic. What we didn't realize was just how bad it would be. Coming from the north we picked up I-10 at the 51 interchange and we rode through bumper to bumper traffic from downtown Phoenix on. I was sure it had to be an accident causing it but nope, it was the concert. That's 10+ miles of traffic folks!

We finally got to the off ramp after the concert was 45 mins past it's start and the lines were still ridiculous. We were dropped off at the gate and made our way inside. 

Good
- Restrooms just inside the gates because you know you'll need to go after that drive!
- Plenty of alcohol choices.  Prices weren't outrageous either. $11 for a 25 oz beer. 
- Aisle space in the seating area. Didn't have to get up for people when they passed by us. 

Bad
- Traffic, hopefully you caught my drift on that one. 
- Seating setup, we were in section 203 which was dead center under the pavilion. I can't imagine paying for a 300 level seat and being exposed to the elements?
- Prices, yeah it's a concert venue but gouging people for bottled water when it's 100+ degrees outside is a bit much.  
- Temperatures, the sun was down and it was still hotter than you know what. Sweat pouring off your body hot!

Overall
Definitely won't be back. We've seen concerts at too many venues that were ten times better than here and I'll never fight with traffic like that again. Just not worth it. Also, early September is still too early for an outdoor concert. Their season should be Oct-Mar.",2014-09-06 18:26:06

I believe this experience changed his view on French food forever.

We decided to go all out. It was my birthday dinner too, so the boyfriend really wanted to treat me out.

Server was great. I loved that they came and explained all the different foods so thoroughly. It was an educating experience as well as a memorably delicious one as well.

We started off with various items:
- Bread: Of course, they have bread. I loved that it was in the shape of leaves.
- Wine: We had the sauvignon blanc from Sancerre... not too sweet, not too dry. Paired well with the various food we ordered.
- Salmon tartare served with these fluffy egg whites, shallots, chives, capers, and creme fraiche: It had so much flavor! It wasn't my favorite tartare, but it was definitely one of the best I've tried.
- 6 oysters and 12 mussels: The oysters came from different regions and they had different flavors. Actually, you can see all of the seafood when you come into the restaurant. The mussels were steamed, then served cold. They were absolutely delicious! They served the seafood with lemons, horseradish, and cocktail sauce. Honestly, I don't think the mussels needed any of that.
- Foie gras saute: It is a pan-seared Hudson Valley foie gras and that day it was served with an apple cider reduction sauce. This in itself is a reason why this Bouchon beats out the Bouchon in LA or Napa Valley. California sucks in the fact that foie gras is banned. But this foie gras saute MELTS in your mouth. The few minutes it takes to eat this up will be the best few minutes of your life. Its fatty consistency is like jello, but once it hits your lips, it just becomes pure joy. The apple cider reduction was sweet and filled with spiced flavors, and just went so well with the foie and the toast. I can eat this all day. Next time I want to try the Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard... Next time.

Entrees:
- Steak Bouchon: It's a 14 oz. New York strip, and it was grilled to a perfect medium rare. It was served with a bearnaise sauce. The sauce wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessary because the steak was aged so well and was flavorful by itself. And of course, it came withe frites. Anthony Bourdain claims that the Bouchon french fries are the best he's had in his life, including the ones served at his own restaurant. I see what he means. We upgraded to truffle fries and the frites themselves were so crispy and delicious. Somehow the entire fry itself seemed to be bursting with deliciousness. Absolute frites perfection.
- Braised pork belly: It was served on top a red wine braised cabbage with vegetables and sweet potatoes. Honestly, I have had better pork belly and the sweetness of the sides were a bit much. I feel like it would have been perfect with a bit of brightness.

I have visited multiple times since the relocation and haven't updated my review because I wanted to give them a chance but unfortunately I cannot say that it has.
This most recent visit prompted me to update my review. I arrived on a Wednesday evening with no wait, great. Chips and salsa were delivered and we ordered a few margarita's. I chose the house, the Casa Margarita, and was told it was premixed. Well, let me tell you, horrible! It is so sweet that I actually sent it back. Decided to go ahead and order a Corona, arrived with no lime, really???
As for the food, I ordered two tacos, chicken and pork, both great. But unfortunately I ordered rice and beans and the rice was so bad I cannot even explain it. And, the fact that they placed the beans in top of the rice, which should never be done, did they know the rice was bad...trying to cover it up?
Wrong!!!

Well, the person handling it holds the card (with all my keys attached) and asks me if I'm interested in this, or that (yesterday it was an assessment with a personal trainer). The time before yesterday, one of the guys got me to fill out information on my boyfriend to call him to let him know about the gym. I was under the impression I was going to be given a two week pass to bring home to him, but nope. 

Each time I come here, I've set aside half an hour to 45minutes to get in a work out. I'd rather be left alone then hassled (they don't like when you tell them ""no"" and keep pushing the issue).

My first experience was so-so but I came near closing and the pastor wasn't as good as it could be, but still decent. 

Came again in the middle of the day, and it was much, much better flavor and texture of the pastor. We also tried cabeza tacos which were pretty decent fine chop that wasnt too fatty.I also got a small ""plato de birria"" which isn't so much a plate as a bowl of a soup broth with birria in it, plate of onions, cilantro and lime and tortillas on the side. It would have been better if the broth wasn't close to room temperature and was actually hot. I think I'll stick to tacos. 

To sweeten the deal, Wednesday is 2 for 1 on pastor tacos - all day. It's not advertised anywhere I stumbled upon it. 

The thing that makes it a great spot to stop is the staff is really nice. They've been friendly even when it's near closing and they insist we stay and eat than do to-go. I also like the ordering and paying system way better. I am glad that despite their setup being for those ""express lines"" they nixed it so you can have all hot food, at once.

Their most popular sandwich (and my favourite) is the Cajun chicken. It's delicious, and just a little bit spicy. Their wicked Thai chicken soup is one of the best soups I've ever had, but unfortunately they don't make it very often and it varies every day so sometimes you'll need to check back frequently to see what their soup specials are. They also have sandwiches like jerked chicken, Montreal smoked meat, prosciutto, avocado, mushroom, three cheese, lox, etc., and a variety of pizzas, quesadillas, and wraps.

The sandwiches comes with a side (Caesar salad, garden salad, coleslaw, or fruit) and totals to about $13 after tax. The sides really aren't very good, so I'd recommend getting the fruit.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

It all starts with Ramiros Mexican Restaurant at this 83rd Avenue location offering a Restaurant.com deal as of a couple days ago. I called first to see if I can place an over the phone order. NOPE. No big deal! I fully understand! They stated that people order over the phone and never show up. I believe it, and I'm cool with their choice not to take over the phone orders.

So, I go through the drive thru. I place my order with my Restaurant.com deal in hand. I have never been there, or even noticed it before despite the fact that I am often in the area, in fact I drive by often!! I thought it would be awesome to try them out with my deal!! Well, I presented my deal and I was told my Restaurant.com deal was a ""FRAUD"" as if I'm trying to rip them off!! I was told the food was prepared and 'basically' I needed to pay up. I pulled out my phone and showed the gal that indeed Restaurant.com is a legit company and, YES, Ramiros obviously signed up! Someone FAILED to advise employees!

I decided to go inside to settle this dispute. It was busy (I did not realize it was 99 cent taco Tuesday at the time, which is likely why it was so busy). I had to wait and wait while orders were taken and processed. I explained that (out of guilt of wasting food) I would take the 3 meals that I ordered, but pass on the chips and the cheese crisp. I was given the meals, minus hot sauce and minus tortillas (I'm assuming the fajita meals should have included tortillas and hot sauce since I was asked if we wanted red or green hot sauce???). 

So, I brought home 2 fajita meals that were far from appealing to the eyeballs! Where is the char common to a fajita meal?? We used our grocery store tortillas and Taco Bell hot sauce on our cubed chicken since neither were provided. Fajitas?? NOT. They were kind of boiled, not charred like a typical fajita plate would be. Super disappointing!!!

I ordered chicken for our kid. NOPE. He tasted it and said, ""I don't like this chicken."" He did like the rice and luckily I got him a double portion of rice. He ate it up along with our store bought tortillas sitting in our fridge. Not exactly the healthy protein meal I had planned for him. I gave him strawberries and two vitamins to supplement. 

Bottom line is, I probably would have been 'okay' with the food at a discount that SHOULD have been given to me. At full price, I would not return!! 

I will say that the gal who took my order was pleasant despite the mix up / refusal to honor the Restaurant.com deal. They need to keep her happy (give her a raise) if they are going to offer deals that they DON'T HONOR!!!",2016-10-06 01:57:33

Waffle fries were of the chewy frozen section variety(which I like). Service was quick, price point was not outrageous for Crocker Park. Overall, way better than Roid Robin.",2012-03-23 05:29:30

A friend of mine told me that they had offered the rice paper thing with you're meat, and considering I just had the best Korean BBQ in Cali....this would satisfy the cravings.  But no, I was sort of disappointed. 

Our group of friends did the all you can eat menu, which was $19.99 for dinner.  We got a serving of:

- Beef Tongue - which was good.  The meat was nice and tender when grilled, and it didn't shrink which was a good thing considering I got a big size.

- Spicy bugolgi - Hmmm, this I wouldn't go with.  It tasted like they just made it, and the spices are a little weird.  I think it's a little to spicy for my taste.  There's a difference between good spicy, and spicy, spicy.  

- Kalbi (short ribs) - My gosh, this has been one of the best kalbi's I had out here for yakiniku in Vegas.  The marinade is quite delicious and it compliments the rice very well.

- Pork Neck - Hmmm, I thought ordering it would be interesting but the piece we got looked like a slice of pork chops. I was really disappointed with that.  

- Pork belly - Always my favorite.  The slices were nice and thick, but kind of thin.  I think it tastes the same regardless of where you go.  

- Sides - It came with some kind of anchovies and tofu, salad, spicy pickled cucumbers, and hot kimchi and bean sprouts.  I thought the idea of grilling the kimchi and bean sprouts were interesting, but unnecessary since I didn't even touch it.  Our group just kind of left it their to burn. 

I did like the type of cooking grill the used rather than using gas grill, they used a pot lid to grill our food.  We didn't even have to as for a grill change.  I didn't like the fact that they gave us tea without the ice, it was more like a cup of tea that was sitting in a bottle for a while.  It was warm and tasteless.  I considered this like every other Korean BBQ, nothing seemed different.  The service is the same, and so is their food.  Nothing out of the ordinary, just a good place to hit since their hours are from 5pm to 8:30 am.  

Check it out you might be surprised with their combo meals, I just thought the AYCE is the usual.  Maybe I might try the combo meals next time.  It might surprise me. But I still do like Tofu-hut better.",2011-02-13 02:07:11

I had originally tried Robuchon in December 2007, and while I liked it, to me, it didn't hold a candle to Alex.  Unfortunately, Steve Wynn make a huge mistake and closed Alex in January of this year.  Now I needed another ""wow"" restaurant.  Upon recommendation of a highly respected palate, I added Robuchon to my list of restaurants.  

From the limo ride to and from the restaurant, everything was splendid. The staff was friendly and attentive (not stuffy as some have mentioned).  The bread cart is phenomenal; I don't recall any other restaurant having so many varieties of bread.  All that I tasted were great:  saffron brioche, 2 different types of cheese rolls, milk roll, olive oil roll and bacon roll.

I ordered the 6 course tasting menu, and asked for certain changes to the menu, that were graciously accommodated.  My favorite dishes were:  the soft cooked egg with oscetra caviar in a potato nest; the lobster and sea urchin with saffron fried rice; duck breast and foie gras with plums; pommes puree--best anywhere; la sphere de sucre--favorite dessert of all time.

I frequent this location often, as it's 24 hours & is literally less than a mile away. Sometimes the experience is fantastic, sometimes it's abysmal... It's a gamble honestly. Welcome to Vegas!

I've had good experiences here, but also many bad -- where we came home finding missing ingredients from our salads or wraps, or where my smoothie tastes nothing like it should have. Once I came home to find no chicken in my thai chicken salad. What? Or sometimes half of my order just isn't in the bag at all! I know it's literally only 0.9 miles away, but having to go back can be tedious and extremely annoying when you've already made it back home and are ready to grub. Another time I went back because my bahama mama smoothie tasted odd... and when I went back & said this, the girl said, ""Oh, it's because we are out of white chocolate and there isn't any in there. It's one of the main ingredients."" Oh. Okay. That would have been great to know so I could have ordered something else rather than get stuck with something that caught me off guard. Not even an apology too? Simple customer service.

Ah, my favorite instance was when I went with my boyfriend's brother who was in full uniform as active military and we went through the drive thru one late night. The man at the window was not only rude from start to finish, but he refused to give us the 50% off that it said in plain sight ON the window. We even pointed to it posted right next to him. He said he could give us 15% off, take it or leave it. He was very agitated and hostile, I had never experienced anything like this in my life. We returned the next morning to speak with a manager, to get a refund for the other 35% off and complain about the encounter. The manager apologized and not only refunded our money entirely, but she gave us the same order from yesterday for free again right then and there. This was amazing and beyond what we had expected. Do you see what I mean about the variation of experiences? Extreme highs, extreme lows.

It's hard to say honestly... there are pros & cons. I think this place has a two star rating for a reason, so I'm probably being generous by giving an average of 3 really. 

FOR HER: 
- Bahama mama smoothie
- Ultimate club sandwich
FOR HIM: 
- Peanut Butter Cup smoothie
- Thai Chicken wrap (or salad)",2016-04-19 19:39:32

The issue was the 20-something man who appeared to be the shift manager. First, he was wearing Man-dex. Yes, that's what I said. Spandex. And they were cropped to boot. Somehow, I don't think they were a uniform option. Then, as he weirdly danced around the dining area, doing what, I don't know (certainly not wiping off the filthy tables), a vision came to me of Jame Gumb. I'll give you all a minute to shudder. Then there was also the patronizing and borderline racist interactions with his largely Hispanic staff. He loudly announced to us that he had just learned the Spanish word for ""turkey."" Then he turned to the man making our food, said the word, and then made a turkey sound. Yes, he gobble-gobbled at the poor man. He did this again and again. It was clear that the staff was embarrassed. 

My husband and I were flabbergasted. It was hard not to stare at him in awe of his assholery. Was he high? Could be. Was he a loser who had no business being in charge of a store? Most definitely.

The food! Ok, I love the veggie dogs on the bun just plain, but I've been rockin' some of the specialty ones lately. I highly recommend the Chihuahua with jalapenos and avocado, or the Mac n' cheese, with...well, mac and cheese. The housemade root beer is also divine. It's perfectly sweet and refreshing.

As a general rule, I try avoid AMC as I believe in supporting our local movie theater company.

The gelato is pricey but really amazing (salted caramel for the win) and they do rotate flavors (they had an interesting popcorn one a while back, and right now there's a red velvet chocolate chunk flavor).  I've heard the coffee is good too.  They used to sell La Grande Orange Grocery pastries (salted chocolate chip cookies, brownies) but those have gone away.  The lobby bar and lounge can get surprisingly busy!

I personally enjoy the outdoor terrace, and it can be very relaxing to wait out there and have a snack before or after your movie.  They have had heaters out there during the cold winter nights.

This location is not perfect.  Sometimes shows get sold down to the first row.  Sometimes people hog the ticket kiosks because a group is paying separately or because the person simply doesn't know what they're doing.  There can also be a bit of a line at the ticket counter or concession stand, mostly due to people taking forever to make decisions.  They also don't show as many art and independent films as ""the old Camelview"" but you can find those at (the less fancy) Harkins at Christown and the Shea location (which has the old theater setup where the floor slopes downward and you look up at the screen).",2018-03-03 18:12:22

But I was kind of disappointed with it this year mostly for the reasons Jeff S and Demetria stated. I think it should be more of a focus on locally owned restaurants as opposed to chain ones and it just seemed lame last year compared to last. Plus, you would think it would draw in more of a crowd but there wasn't alot of people there. If they wanna play with the big cities, they definitely need to expand it whether it be more entertainment, vendors and more space. One street isn't gonna cut it. You're crammed in with people near cookers and it feels like hell. I don't like sweating while eating but that's something you have to deal with Taste of Charlotte. They definitely need to open up another street and ban those damn strollers. The coins are a decent deal but if you're expecting to get full, eat ahead of time or after if you want to keep yourself somewhat on a budget. Thanks to fabulous Yelp, I got to try chicken satay, bbq slider, a mini cupcake and a water since i was ill prepared with my water situation. The coins are weird, some places give you a good apoint of grub for 3, not enough for 2 and sometimes a good portion for 1. However, it always leaves me in a slot machine situation where I have to buy more coins or give them away.

There's quite a large variety of different chicken items to order... I tried both the spicy and non spicy, and preferred the non spicy (even though the spicy was good as well). In particular, the sweet and sour was really tasty. I'd recommend trying a variety, as they are all quite different. Chicken is cooked well (moist). 

My only complaint is that some of the pieces have a fairly high bone & batter to meat ratio. I would've preferred if they used bigger (fatter) chickens. But this seems to be pretty common among most of the Korean chicken places. 

It's pretty good value. One portion of chicken ($17) should be enough for 2 people.

The ultimate test for me was the falafel. For $3.99 you get 4 pieces of falafel, hand-made in house, wrapped in a soft pita with lettuce, tomato, onion, and tahini. Like most places, this owner was a little put-off when I asked for tzatziki instead of tahini, but that's how I like my falafels man, make a lady happy! So he did: he put on the side a sample of all 3 sauces: tahini, tzatziki, and hummus... yay!

The power hour option is a good deal; I like that it's only 1 hour since it feels like a decent amount of gameplay. There used to be a 4 hour option at Playdium which was draining, and even 2 hours gets kind of boring tbh. With D&B's 1 hour card I can come here a bit more often for shorter visits, which is perfect when you're eternally tired during a 40 hr work week. The $10 price is fantastic too.

The redemption games are similar to the ones elsewhere but very up to date and really fun. There's a large variety and the play styles differ enough to keep things interesting. I personally like the video games more because I like holding the gun-type controller while shooting instead of just pressing a mouse/button.

I usually prefer coming on Wednesdays so I can do the power hour card and the half priced games at the same time. Compared to Playdium, the video games are very similar, but I feel like there are fewer redemption games and the ones they have are less enjoyable. Some of them rely purely on luck which is kind of boring to me, while others are of the cell phone game variety which I don't play because I can just play it on my phone. Personal fave is the clown game; I look at other games but keep coming back to that one.

There weren't too many people around on Wednesday night, so I didn't have to line up for any games I wanted to play. The games area is pretty clean and I haven't had any issues with any of the machines yet. I like that there's more teens/young adults/adults here compared to Playdium; the vibe is more chill/relaxed.

Also, this place was very overstaffed, like 15 employees and 3 customers. Maybe they were still training? Unsure, but the service was great. The girl that took our order was friendly and even offered some suggestions with making my order into a choose 2, which I thought was nice. Good customer service!

But the food? Meh. As other reviews have mentioned the servings were really skimpy. I opted for a side salad with my meatball sandwich and it came on a small plate with literally a handful of lettuce. Sure its a side salad, but still it was on one of those small plates used for your table bread. The meatball sandwich was hearty. I would order that again. The entree serving of the bacon mac and cheese arrived in a bowl was half filled, which was kind of sad. Also ordered a bowl of the baked potato soup. 

The best things about Corner Bakery that are in the drink department. It's all about the coffee and the lemonade. I totally dig the variety of flavors and the quality of their lemonades. Definitely a place where I would just stop by for a drink or something from the bakery. Yum!

The food was good-- but was it $40 dollars good? Not really. But the real problem is that within that total I didn't even get to order a chocolate baby bundt cake. Ha!

The interior is pretty basic but the patio (when it's cool enough) is roomy and it gives a little hint of Italy.  

Out of their entire menu, I can speak to the subs, pizzas, and appetizers.  Their subs are tasty and filling and the appetizers (especially the Bruschetta) are pretty good and have a homemade taste.

The pizzas, however, are not very good.  For instance, the 16'' is dry, ultra thin, and not very filling.  If you are a fan of Papa John's, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree.

There are plenty of discounts too.  I bought a certificate through my work where I pay $5 and get $15, but have to spend at least $22.  So, after the math, $12 for $22 worth of food (excluding the pizzas) isn't bad (except for the first time I tried to use the coupon and they wouldn't let me use it because it was a Football Sunday even though it stated nothing to that affect on the certificate).

The Chili Man hot dog stand is parked right in front of Chima's steakhouse Tuesday-Friday from 11a-2p. There will be a line, but don't let it deter you. Not only are the dogs delicious but Vic is friendly and funny. Despite the fact that you'll be waddling away after chowin down and may need a food coma nap afterwards, the Chili Man experience is worth it. JUST DO IT, as I will tell you in the next paragraph, even vegans don't have an excuse. 

What really had me sold was Vic now has vegetarian friendly tofu dogs! Seriously most thoughtful hot dog vendor EVER! I walked over with my bf just expecting him to fulfill his craving, I wasn't going to get anything since the last uploaded menu on yelp only consisted of red meat hot dogs. But to my surprise I was able to have one too, I was so happy! AND the Chili Man even offers VEGAN Chili Wednesdays complete with vegan hot dogs and TVP chili. So rad. 

Ok I'll stop raving now.. Lol so my boyfriend had the life changer and I had a vegetarian friendly life changer with a tofu dog and minus the chili. We didn't talk to each other while eating, hell, I don't even think we took a breath. That's how good the Chili Man dogs are. All in all, the Chili Man is THE man and his dogs are righteous. Goes without saying he will be seeing me every week..which brings me to my next quest...I need to find a good gym.

It's a gorgeous space with an industrial brick and beam look, impossibly high ceilings, and dim lighting from danging Edison bulbs. Walking in reservationless at dinner time is risky; this place was packed to the gills with stylish clientele, but we managed to secure a spot at the bar.

The menu is divided into molto Italian categories like salami, formaggi, pasta, pizze, pesce, and carne. It's quite overwhelming actually, and I'm surprised they are able to change up the options so often. I felt that pasta was a smart choice at Buca, so I opted for a veal stuffed tortelli. When the server reacted with surprise when I didn't order a starter, I should have clued in. The portion was VERY small, just five pockets of pasta on a plate. Soft and delicious though it was, it wasn't enough for me.

My friend Dan J ordered smart and got a pizza. It's an authentic thin-crust 'za the size of a placemat. They give you pair of scissors to cut it. It was covered with mouth-watering cured salami and buffalo mozzarella. It was tasty, and lucky for me he was willing to share. We ended the night with some dessert wines (they offer an impressive selection of wine) and a Buca Tiramsu served in a tall glass. (We each got one -- we didn't share y'all.)

A bit on the pricy side, so I won't come here hungry, but I would definitely come back when I'm looking to impress a date.

While the selection is great, it's really not a place to browse, per se, you really need to know what you want.  You browse by flipping through, like you used to do with Compact Discs.  So it helps to at least have an idea of the type of movie (eg., Horror, Tentacle Porn) you're interested in.  

My favourite thing to do is go on http://www.rottentomatoes.com and browse there, then check http://www.baystreetvideo.com to see if they have it.

While I think this place is on the high end price wise, it's worth it to me for the convenience. This is a shame because if/when Netflix actually makes it to Canada (actually mailing DVDs) it will kill their business. My old nabe video store in a high-rent area of Seattle charged $3.99 for Blu-ray and $1.99 for standard DVDs, plus you could keep them quite a bit longer. If you rent a new release here, they expect it back within about 24 hours and with tax the Blu-rays are around $5.50 or so.

We were a party of 12 and reserved the private dinning room on the upper floor overlooking the restaurant. This is one of the best private dinning rooms in the city.

We started with drinks and they brought some incredible hors d'oeuvres around -some of the best sliders I ever ate, amazing crab salad served on a spoon and various cheeses and fruits.

My starter was the ham and pickles (think charcuterie plate with pickled beets). Just a warning, this app is too big for one. I ordered the beef tenderloin for my main and it was fantastic. Cooked medium rare with a light sauce served on top. Only negative was the mashed potatoes were slightly cold. 

We ordered 6 sides for the table to share - most were excellent. The Mac and cheese is a must along with the onion rings (best onion rings IMO). The pickled carrots with peas were also a standout.

Desserts were simply delicious. We all shared a number of items. The two best dishes were the ""clusterphuk"" - picture a chocolate bar on a platter with guillotine device and the ""sticky Apple pudding"" - loved the bourbon pecan toffee sauce.

Drink menu emphasizes wine and cocktails. The beer menu is poor with just 4-5 beers in bottle. 

Service was spectacular, every time I needed something - it just appeared!

Highly recommended. America is great for a special treat as the prices are in the high end.

You place your order at the counter and your entrees are delivered to your table. The Crepe Club offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every craving. Theres Chicken,Turkey, Ham, Spinach, Cheese, Yogurt, and Fruit options.

On this visit I had the strawberries and cream and it was delicious. I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. I can't wait to visit again and try some of the other options.

So to clarify, it's a small restaurant with a few tables, a counter which, I'm assuming, primarily does takeout based on the area.  I don't think there's full-waiter service as it appears to be quite casual.

In addition to being a restaurant, they also sell things they make in-house like tortilla chips, oils, and various dips such as salsas & guacamole.

Menu is 1 page and there are also NO BURRITOS!!!  There are some apps (antojitos), tacos, soups (caldo), tortas y molletes.  Tacos are $3.50ea and the cashier told me that they are on the small side so usually people order more than 1.  

Since I was taking my order to go...in my car...tacos were out of the question, so I got a tortilla soup ($7).  Soup really packed a punch in the flavour department and I thought it was quite flavourful, definitely not watered down!

We sat and each put 20 in a machine. There was only 3 other guys and they already had drinks.

She may have been tied up in the basement and released as a party gift because I have no idea where she came from. She loved feeling my friends body and she kept reaching in my pocket while talking to me. I would say she was drunk but it was much more than that. The bartender did nothing. Not even offer another drink. For about 25 minutes, we were accosted by this woman and bombarded with incoherent but extremely invasive questioning without any water -ehem- beer.

We arrived to a pretty packed house without a reservation. The hostess told it would be about 15 minutes for a table. No problem. Right behind us was another patron that was also looking for a table for two and was told 10-15 minutes. We noticed that it was odd she was quoted a shorter wait than we were as we walked outside to wait. We also realized that the hostess hadn't taken our name so went back in to mention it. On arrival back inside, we saw the lady that had come in after us without a reservation seated at a two-top that was empty just moments before. We told the hostess that we hadn't given her our name and she said she knew and that we were the only ones waiting. I pointed out to her that the woman that had come in after us was seated immediately and that I didn't understand why we were not seated at that table. She said she was waiting for a table in the back to put us at! (PS. my friend is Jamaican) With wide eyes and a dropped jaw, I stood there for a moment unsure of how to react. My friend said, ""let's just go"" but I wasn't okay with that. Just then the hostess said she could seat us and took us to a four-top on the side of the restaurant. We sat down, both incredibly uncomfortable and unsure if we should stay or not but decided to give the place a chance despite our unfortunate first impression.

They have a good-sized menu with a lot of options. Our waiter was friendly and even brought out a slice of chocolate mouse cake (on the house) with a lit candle at the end of the meal.

I ordered the Rainbow Trout with Capers and Lemon Butter and my friend had the Halibut and Chips. We were both satisfied with the taste and presentation of our entrees.

Towards the end of our meal, the band began playing in the bar area. It was really too loud to enjoy a conversation over. Though I should mention that the band was very good. I was impressed and had I gone out to hear a band (rather than to celebrate my friend's birthday and catch up over dinner) I would have been thrilled.

That fucking sucks in my opinion and I would never ever return here simply because of that. And that is also why I give it only 2 stars. 

There were several other things that contribute to my low rating. Belgo is so bloody loud, I could hardly hear the people sitting across from me at our table. We had come here for a going away lunch for a co-worker. I was unable to chat with anyone other than the guy right beside me. The table we were sitting at was right by a heater and I was baking. I felt like I was in a basement. Not a great atmosphere. Again, I would not come back here.

Service was ok but I don't recall our waitress coming back to check on how our lunch was. I had the $15 beef dip which was very tasty. First time I've tried a pretzel bun and it was really good. The ceaser salad was tasteless. Where were the bacon bits? Disappointment here. One of my coworkers had a hamburger with a gluten free bun that looked all crumbly. She said it was dry and tasted like it was a week old. The manager came by to discuss the crappy bun and comped her meal. She didn't want to wait for them to make another hamburger. I don't blame her. It really looked brutal. Another coworker ordered the beet salad and when it didn't have the goat cheese it said on the menu, our waitress said a lot of people don't want it. But she did bring it out after. However, it was already after my coworker had almost finished her salad and if you can believe this, all the cheese she got was a tiny blob in a shot glass. You gotta be kidding me. What a joke. I don't think my expectations were that high. Bottom line, if the menu says the salad comes with goat cheese, then include it.

Granted this is coming from someone whose never spent more than about 40 bucks on an article of clothing (besides shoes). Barney's consists of overpriced  yet cheaply made clothing for elitist assholes.  

Let me summarize Barney's in one quick story. 

We walk in...I meander over to a rack of women's shirts that are apparently 'on sale'. I find one that looks particulary average. I check the price tag. On sale for 450 bucks. As I'm checking the tag, the shirt starts to rip at the seam even though I'm only gently twisting the tag. Also...notice...""Made in China"" on the back. Quality clothing MY ASS. 

There's nothing special going on here. If you were to take these clothes and hide them with other 'regular' clothes in a shitty thrift store like Savers, 99% of people wouldn't know which clothes are from actually from Barneys. Conversely...you could take a shirt from Savers...put it in Barneys with a 300 dollar price tag...and some douche bag who drives a Ferrari will pounce on it because he thinks it's trendy.

I hope this place goes out of business. That would make me happy. We've gone in here a few times and the place was deserted each time, I hope that's a sign that people are learning to not get duped by the hype machine. If you shop here, I'm laughing at you.

The only thing I have to say is that everything here is twice the size of the ones served at Charles De Gaulle, and the customers are upsized to match!

Gus's is one of the best places to grab pizza after drinking it up on Mill Ave. Since it takes a little bit more energy to get to than Slices does, the crowd is usually a bit smaller (though not any less drunk). The pizza is just pizza, it's not gourmet, it's not organic and it's definitely not meant to blow people's socks off. It's gigantic, it's cheap and, when loaded up with garlic powder, it hits the spot after making poor decisions at the bar. The wings at Gus's are also good and are best with extra wing sauce.

It's not as busy as I remember it.  The restaurants had some people dining, but it wasn't as bustling as the boom years.  Despite all of that, we had a good time window shopping and had dinner at Settebello Pizza one night.

As it should, in my opinion, if they're going to name the entire place suggestive of our feathered friends.

Our delicious, juicy friends.  

I ordered a chicken leg on a side of chilli lime sweet potatoes.  The chicken, maybe on account of being free-range & antibiotic-free, is a tad on the smaller side.  Nonetheless, it does taste better and more ""chicken flavoured"" than the typical rotisserie chicken from a certain chicken chain's double-leg dinner combo. Ahem, you know...*that* one? 

If you're like me and actually still enjoy your chicken with sauce, fret not - Flock offers their own options.  Either a bright chimichurri or Carribean side sauce accompanies your chicken. Both are flavourful and compliment the chicken nicely, with the Caribbean sauce reminding me of a mild jerk sauce. 

The sweet potatoes delivered on the chilli lime flavour.  They're soft all the way through.

Some places feature the fact that the meats & produce are organic, locally-grown, etc. without a real consideration of how everything tastes together.  I appreciate that at Flock, the focus is on taste where the food also happens to be well-sourced.",2015-08-04 22:32:01

Pros:
-Cheap eats.  Food here is priced pretty good.  Example:  8 oz filet for $21.99.  Ton's of daily specials and lunch specials. 
-Wide selection for a bar, grill, and pub
-Taste:  I say you get what you pay for.  Nothing taste really bad, but not excellent.  Again, it's cheap.  
-Dining room seating or bar seating
-Video Poker if that's your cup of tea
-Plenty of parking. 

Cons:
-Smoking:  It's a bar and pub, should be expected.  
-Dark inside
-Service is not the best.  Took a while for our orders to be taken, even longer for the food to arrive.  
-Wide selection of food, but not the best place to if you're watching your cals.

I tried their 8 oz Filet and cup of chili.  The filet was little dry and tasted close to a NY Steak.  Still got my protein from it, so I was happy.  The chili here was my highlight. It's topped with onions and also has a little kick to it. I almost got seconds, but figured that it was best that I didn't since I was trying to keep the calories a little low for the day. 

Overall, the 3 stars means that the food here is just okay.  Don't let the 3 stars discourage you.  Winchell's is a good place to hang out with friends and even get a meal in. I'll probably be back again to meet the homegirl for lunch.  Otherwise, I just don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.",2013-06-15 05:55:09

1. AFFORDABLE! You can order a ton of food and still not go broke. Sushi as cheap as $1 and $2!

2. QUALITY!  I've been here countless times and  I've never ever had a bad meal. Everything is top notch and high quality. Sushi bar reinforces this: you see all the sushi chefs preparing rolls in plain sight.

3. VEGETARIAN SUSHI!!! Yep, that's right. Ru San's has a huge menu, but my favorite part is the big vegetarian section. Big list to choose from, anything from fried cream cheese maki rolls to tamago egg maki rolls to kimchi cabbage maki rolls. And basically most vegetables you can think of, all prepared in a perfect little roll... heaven! This is such a relief from most sushi restaurants who have ONE vegetarian sushi option (which is usually way overpriced). Most of the veg options are between $2 and $3... awesome! 

I really love the Eggplant Sesame Yaki. I usually order this as an appetizer and reserve the leftover sauce as a dip for some of my maki rolls. This dish has cubes of eggplant, seared perfectly, tender inside, light crisp outside. The wow factor here though is the sauce, it's a thick, peanut butter like sauce, tart and sweet and nutty, with sesame seeds.  You've gotta try this! 

If you have room for dessert, make sure you order some Tempura Ice Cream. This is basically a block of vanilla ice cream, covered in sweet tempura batter and deep fried. Then drizzled with a strawberry (and sometimes chocolate ) sauce. I'm not sure how they keep the ice cream from totally melting, but this dessert will make your day... heck, it'll make your week. Hands down my favorite dessert of all time.

Cocktails? Order the Lady Killer... kiwi juice and sake. mmm!

Specialty bread loaves of bread ranging from pumpkin chocolate chip to honey whole wheat are also available for purchase, priced at $5-8 each. Let's not forget the giant cookies and desserts either! I've ate here twice within a month and have not been disappointed thus far.

GRILLED CHEESE ($6.95): Comes with 3 types of cheese - you get to choose between cheddar, swiss, provolone, and pepper jack. Grilled on sourdough bread. Super cheesy and filling. 4/5

VEGAS VEGGIE ($6.95): Comes on honey wheat or cheddar bread, with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach leaves, purple onions, balsamic vinegar, and some kind of hummus spread. The only thing that's missing is cheese! Technically a vegan sandwich I guess but it was delightfully crisp, flavorful, and light. 4/5 

LITTLE ITALY: ($7.95?): My husband inhales this sandwich. As he's demolishing it, he gasps in between breaths, this is SO good!!

CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE: If you get a combo the meals comes with a drink and your choice of a cookie or chips. The cookie is huge but a little sweet for me. More cookie for the mister! 3/5
FUDGE BROWNIE?: This square chunk of fudge and caramel was an upgrade option to the combo for $1.50 more. It's a super heavy dessert item, but it was fun to try just once. 3/5

SERVICE: They greet every customer that walks in, and say bye as they exit. The staff are super nice. On our first visit, the manager gave us a complimentary coconut muffin because she said the wait was too long (it wasn't). There's a couple of loaves by the register - ask for a sample! They'll even add butter if you'd like. 5/5

VIBE: Small, quiet cafe seating inside and outdoor seating as well. 4/5 

VALUE: For two people and with the 10% military discount, it costs about $17.  

Worth a Return Visit?
I see many sandwiches from Great Harvest Cafe in my future.

There are a collection of tables with retro styled chairs and some fun death-star exploding like-lights throughout the place. The kitchen is located behind an ice cream counter featuring their daily flavours and a small collection of baked goods. I opted for their ice cream sandwich with chocolate ice cream, while my friend had a chocolate cone. The ice cream is delicious and the cookies yummy and sweet. We also tried samples of some of the other flavours which were also delicious (although I would love the strawberry to have a more strawberry flavour and maybe some pieces of strawberry in it.) 
Next time I want to try their banana split, can't remember the last time I had one of those. They also have a small collection of chocolates, which I would love to see expanded. Is it too much to ask that someone in Toronto would carry vegan dark chocolate peanut butter cups? Or for that matter, vegan chocolate eclairs? These are things I dream of.  

They also have a small selection of lunch options with a collection of sides (love the fact that a side option is gazpacho, this should be a more regular option in restaurants). The name and the selection of options positions the place as a modern take on a soda shop. I look forward to watching them as they grow and find their place in Kensington Market. I am sure we will become regular visitors.",2015-08-29 18:48:39

Surprise #1: The place was kicking - and packed (given, it was a Saturday night)
Surprise #2: The servers are younger and remind you of your best friend's older brother. Cute, friendly, wears a RVCA t-shirt, but totally not even in dateable realm.
Surprise #3: They sold out of their fish special before 8pm.
Surprise #4: The food was outstanding.
Surprise #5: The price is more than reasonable.

Not surprisingly, however, was the fact that there were two other birthday parties, other than the one I was attending, going on here. The place is lively, welcoming, and full of a mish mash of people gathered for a hearty meal. Entrees sit comfortably at about $15, and we're talking offerings like BBQ ribs, halibut, seafood stew, and risotto. I shared a seafood stew and veal special with a partner, and mmmmm, both were delicious, tender, and oh-so-filling. 

Appetizers were also tempting, and the blueberry cheesecake was light and blissful - a hit! With all the options to choose from in the Yonge/Eg area, dodge the confusion and head here!",2010-04-21 18:27:42

I remember driving past a threading spot close to Smashburger up in my hood, so we checked this place out.

Clean and inviting, the ladies greet you walking in, and there are comfy chairs to chillax until your turn is up. Other services performed here are Henna and Glitter Tattoos, Eyelash Extensions, and Brow and Lash Tinting. I had Sarah take care of me. At first, I was kinda iffy because the girl she did before me was in tears with a puffy red face!?!?

Why??? She was a first timer...couldn't be more than 13 years old, dragged mom with her, and she wanted to do it...Youngins these days, that's the price you pay for beauty, right? No fault on Sara's part, just a little girl tryin' to be all grown up.

My turn is up, and Sarah does her magic, first with the little brow comb and scissors, a snip here and there, then on to the threading. Assisting her a couple of times and after about 5 minutes, Voila!!! Sara has that ability to keep Men's brows neat and clean without looking feminine which is a big plus, then later finishes your brows with a little astringent and lotion to soothe your pain(if you have any) at $10, this is the cheapest in town, and the quality of work is better than those other threading joints. .

Yeah, you can save money like Geico, but you'll also look like the Geico Caveman, and no one wants to be rocking the unibrow or Velcro strip on their face. At least I wouldn't..

Then when I arrived I had to sign in, again giving the same info. Then when the time was overdue I sent an ""S"" to check the status, and the text message answered 46 minutes, and then within another 10 seconds my number was called. Not a very accurate prediction.

The staff had an obvious attitude problem, even though I was being polite. When I repeated things such as where to sign, that seemed to annoy her, like I was questioning her authority.

I had 3 meals out of this dish with all the leftovers. Bean and cheese burrito was pretty weak and small. Mom was not happy with her order.  My kids did not care for the menu choices but they are special and not very adventurous. 

I liked the salsa bar offerings and the staff was friendly. I wish they would have guided me differently in my menu choices but what ever. I enjoyed the food and would return when in the area but I am sure my family will unanimously oppose.  So if any one wants to meet for lunch one day...message me.",2017-11-25 07:59:30

The summation of her review was: she was treated poorly, and no compensation was made for the mistake that the salon made.  No proper apology, just the customer being punished for the salon's own bad business.

In my six years of being a Yelp elite, I have only given 16 establishments 1 star. That means that about 3% of my reviews get 1 star.  I always, always let the business correct their mistake before I write a review, because I believe mistakes can be corrected. Most businesses do value customer service, especially when they are in a competitive market at a high price point. 

The owner of Sash & Bustle, Vanessa, not only did nothing to correct the bad business decisions she made, but she actually treated us worse as time went on. 

First, I will briefly describe my actual experience trying on dresses (something Vanessa asked me to review when I let her know that I was going to be writing a review).  My consultant kept answering phones and greeting guests and disappearing from the consultation.  Charlie pulled a dress for me and asked if I liked it, I said yes.  When I came back to the change room, it was gone.  She said another bride had taken it and was trying it on.  Even though I ended the appointment with over 20 minutes left, I never got to try that dress on again.  There was no explanation, I even asked where it went, just that the other bride took it.  In general, this was already a subpar experience, especially compared to the high level of customer care we received at Kleinfeld's (which surprised me, a big box shop being better than a boutique).

At the very end of the consultation, my mom slipped in their store.  They have beige hardwood, and a beige carpet, and a small step, so if you miss it, you slid with your socks and can fall.  I know other people have fallen because all the sales women ran over and said, ""Oh, we've fallen there, we always knew someone would fall there!"" etc.  (They make you take off your shoes)  

After we left (when my mom could finally stand up, with ice), the salon never called up to check on us.  I called them, and they called me back, and then Vanessa said, ""Oh I was just calling to see how your mom is doing!"" as if she'd initiated the calls. She then said she'd ""never been through something like this"" in her personal or professional life - uhm, I've also never heard my mother scream like that before either?  She said, ""What do you want from me?"" and I said I had no idea, and she said she wanted a day to think about it.  It was always about the legality of this issue for her and never about us as customers. She made my mother take out time for her own personal life to meet with her insurance, to, ""cover my own bum"".  When I expressed my displeasure at how we were being treated, Vanessa just said we could always come back in as they are ""all things bridal"" - i.e. feel free to stop by anytime and drop $4000 and don't let the harrowing sound of your mother screaming at the top of her lungs deter you. 

I work at a place where customers have injured themselves and we go above and beyond to make them want to come back.  I am letting all the brides out there know that you should read through the reviews to this salon and realize you have tons of choices out there where you may want to spend your thousands of dollars...places that run like a proper business.  A good response would have been, ""Come back and we will have a do over and make your experience great!""  No cost to them, just common business sense. Good luck to you, S&B.",2017-04-27 20:45:12

While we were looking, an employee stopped by to ask if we had been there before and if we knew how it worked.  Appreciated that he made sure we knew what we were doing, instead of letting us fumble blindly through the experience.  I ordered the Jersey Joe - turkey, roast beef, Swiss and coleslaw on a marble rye with a Russian dressing/sauce on the side.  My partner got the Cuban.  Sandwiches come with chips and we ordered a side of fries to share.  The sandwiches were HUGE and great!  They were both piled high with meat, and the meat was tender and delicious!  The fries were not for me, they were the hand cut type, but I am more a fan of the McDonald's french fry...crisp and golden.  Just personal preference, and I always try to sample the fries where we eat.  They have a huge beer selection, and surprisingly, some of the best iced tea I have had in a long time!  We will definitely go back and try another sandwich, since there are many to choose from.  There are also salads and some appetizers.  The staff were all friendly and efficient, no complaints there.

To start out, we arrive on Monday, it was busy but not too busy. I wanted to see which flavors they had so I wasn't at the front standing there looking like a deer in headlights. 
The worker ""matter of factly"" asked if I had been here before, and told me I wasn't allowed to stand where I was. Bite me. I'm a paying customer and I'm not blocking anyone.

Selection is great, way better than Tutti Frutti, and they do have parking as you're not on 17th basically. So there is a plus. And you can sample flavors so you know what you're getting into before committing to a whole bowl. 

I wanted pineapple and they were out. So that disappointed me.

I have come across this place a few different times and was so excited to finally try it. The service was interesting as, when my fiancé and I both approached the register to put in our order, there was a girl who kept offering us samples of all of the nonalcoholic juices. As we were looking at the menu and she was describing each juice to us. It was awesome that we got to try everything, but it was really difficult to read the menu while she was talking. Finally I decided on the watermelon/mint juice with a little bit of vodka. I believe it was called something like ""Get the Eff Out."" I thought they were going to serve it in the glass bottle they serve their nonalcoholic drinks in, but instead they actually fixed a cocktail in a glass with mint leaves garnishing it on ice.

This restaurant is ran by only two Korean women who are nice but the service is very slow. I felt really bad for the table next to me because most of the group had finished their meals before the last person even got their food!

My boyfriend and I waited quite a bit for our food as well even though we were still early before the dinner rush. We ordered the Seafood pancake and Jun's combo. The texture of the pancake was too starchy and wet, the calamari was chewy and tough. Jun's combo came with rice, salad, meat jun, kalbi, and a fried dumpling. It was mediocre to us - nothing really stood out as being very tasty. I didn't like the texture of the meat jun much either. 

Each dish was about ~$10.95 so it wasn't a cheap price to pay for unsatisfying food. I won't be coming back unfortunately.",2015-02-10 05:39:39

I mean if I can spend $22 on an entree at a restaurant I can certainly spend it on food that will feed my dog for a month.

It's a mall with a bunch of popular stores in the heart of Toronto that is easily accessible via subway, streetcar, bus or walking.  If you dare to drive into this area there is parking in and around the mall.

The mall is pretty popular with anyone who is in this area which is usually people working, tourists and most likely kids and teens.

Contrary to some reviews mentioning young kids, the crowd while we were there (8pm-12 on a Wednesday) seemed to be just 21+.  We discovered an issue with the skee-ball games and alerted the gift shop attendant; he came over within 5 minutes and fixed the machines and gave each of us a free play.  I was impressed. D&B has a good mix of games-- FPS, trivia, wheel of fortune, sports, glorified iPad games, and arcade classics.  Sadly there is no ""whack a mole.""  We looked.

I was surprised by the value, albeit on a Wednesday when games are half off.  Two of us shared a card loaded with $12 (supercharged $10) and it lasted us almost 4 hours, playing games constantly.  We won something like 2000 tickets in that time, although we were going for entertainment value rather than tickets.

Drinks--we were there for happy hour (starts at 9 pm), and cocktails were half off (about $3-$4 after discount).  We tried the mojitos, white sangria, and green apple martini.  The first two were really sweet (although my friends like them), but the martini was a nice balance of sweet and sour.

I can see myself coming here to pick up produce and other misc. stuff because the 2nd closest place to my house is Rollins Market and the produce there is pretty gross.  I just hate going all the way to Fry's to pick up a tomato or a small amount of other produce.  I'd just assume come here because it is way closer than Fry's and presumably fresher/greener/local-er/organic-er/etc.  I know the prices are a bit more than other places but it is to be expected because they don't deal in huge volumes that the other stores do.

I especially liked it when I was about 7 years old and it looked like the airport in a Kubrick science fiction movie and they showed free little 20-minute films on subjects like ""how cheese is made"" and ""Beautiful Norway"" and the like, in the lobby for you to pass the time.  Obviously that was a Very Long Time Ago Cuz I'm Old OK.   

Fast forward to now...they are in the process of renovating part of the concourse and have closed a number of the food places, shops and the chapel (where I used to pop in to pray for guidance with my wack Cleveland family and friends and also ask nicely that my plane not crash thanks).   Regarding what's left in the concourse, the Ben and Jerry's is way overpriced, the Mexican restaurant has good drinks and OK food but service kinda blows, and I would like there to be a coffee option other than StarSucks.   The bookstore (if that's still open) features a number of books on Cleveland landmarks, Cleveland restaurants,  Cleveland food, Cleveland true crime, or by Cleveland authors.  I find these books  interesting to look at even if I don't buy any, although I think those have been moved from their previous spot in the front of the store to somewhere further back, so you might need to hunt for them. It's also a pain to have to take a long journey of escalators and moving sidewalks to and from the Continental terminal, but there are some very cool sculptures of travelers looking at watches on the walls, and some giant ""paper airplanes"" hanging over the escalators, that almost make it worth it.

I will be happier with this airport when it either adds a fast security lane (like RtGO) for frequent travelers, or figures out some way to route the security line by the Continental terminal so it does not literally block the doors to the airport, the access to the check-in counters, and everything else when it gets backed up. 

If you're going to be renting a car at this airport, it's worth figuring out how to drive back to the airport on Rocky River Drive especially if you're returning from West Side.  Rocky River Drive will run you right into the rental car center, which is kind of funky to find from the highway as it's not the same exit as the airport proper.",2009-02-09 04:04:26

We didn't know where or what we wanted to eat and down there, there are more than a few options to pick from.  Dizzy from all of the choices (and perhaps low blood sugar), we walked past Deluca's.  My PIC commented on the fact that he heard that place was ""good"" and it was featured on the Food Network.  He had me at ""good"" (granted, I don't watch Food Network).  Anywho, apparently we got there at just the right time between breakfast and lunch because we got seated immediately.  We were greeted by a detached if not surly waiter.  He was efficient in taking our orders and getting our food.  Unfortunately, we never saw him again after that (except to get our bill of course).  

Despite the mediocre service, the food iteself was excellent.  The true diner menu, with its seemingly hundreds of selections, had a breakfast highlight as all diners do.  My PIC and I happily obliged the menu and ordered two different breakfasts.  I got the biscuits and sausage gravy and he got a breakfast with gigantic pancakes.  The portions were huge and the food was tasty.  The people next to us had breakfast burritos that made our breakfasts look puny in comparison.  Or maybe it was me being star struck by the ""Tom Cruise's ass was here"" plaque.  We agreed that our next trip would include those (burritos, not Tom Cruise). 

Unfortunately, the last time my PIC and I tried to go to Deluca's, there was a line around the block.  We didn't feel like waiting, so we went elsewhere.  I do have to say though, that I wish we had waited in line for Deluca's instead of going ""elsewhere"".  That's a regret I will take to my grave.  Just wait in line at Deluca's.  It's worth it.",2012-08-09 23:39:13

The flavor starts off okay, like ginger milk. Then like a chai tea. And the aftertaste is like a Hong Kong fishball curry (wtf??). And don't even get me started on the dregs.

It's really clean looking and has a good feel to the space. 
All we ever really eat is beef brisket (Chadolbaegi) and the marinated beef ribs (Galbi..)
The meat quality was good and the banchan was yummy! I really liked how the galbi was the kind that came on the big bone which later you can eat all the yummy cartilage off of. AYCE also comes with steamed egg, soy bean soup (doenjang jjigae) and spicy rice cake (ddukbokki.) Diet coke & other sodas come in cans so no free refills! 
Service gets an A+ especially the young male server with the nice hair! haha They cut your meat for you and take care of everything which is how the service at Korean BBQ should be. Attentive but not suffocating!

Pastrami croque madame sounds amazing, right?  Not here it wasnt.  I only assume it was pastrami because they said it was pastrami. .  Did they hold this in water too long? It's so bland.  It really is the worst pastrami I've ever had. So, I didn't mind so much that the portion size was weak. The bechamel sauce was also lacking in basic seasoning. The sandwich had too many wet things on it, with the dijonaisse and the egg yolk......It turned into a gummy mess.
Next was the Cuban sandwich. Again, worst Cuban I have ever had.  It was dry, due to the weak portion of roasted pork and the way too thick heavy ciabatta bread gummed up again in dijonaisse.  Pork was ok, nothing special.  Where was the ham?!  Sweet pickle didn't do it for me either.  So extremely disappointed.
The banana pudding was pretty damn good.  I wish there was a little more banana and a little less wafer, but that would be me being picky about it.  I would gladly pay another 5 dollars for the pudding.
I really was shocked that these sandwiches were so terrible.  Based on the good reviews I thought I was finding my new sandwich place!  I feel like the reviews must be from family or something, because there's no way we just happened to order the two worst things on the menu.

I guess I am definitely in the minority here, but I thought the best thing about my visit was serendipitously meeting Eric and Lisa R and having them join us for dinner. Beyond that this place had mediocre food and terrible service. From the moment I walked through the door, it was nothing but waiting.

Waiting for a host/-ess or anyone to acknowledge us or tell us to put our name down, etc. After being seated and ordering, it was waiting for my ice tea which came after everyone else's drinks were served and only after prompting the waitress. Then waiting for everyone's entree. I ordered the bun bo hue and green papaya salad, which came out in that order.

The green papaya salad had large, steamed 20/25 shrimp, instead of the dehydrated small bay shrimp (which add additional saltiness to the dish). It was okay. The bun bo hue had a good, robust beef flavor and was not too spicy, but it was missing the pig hock and the pig's blood. When I asked if they forgot, the waitress replied they were out. Gee, you couldn't tell us that before we ordered?! You can't send someone across the street to 168 Market to  buy some? To add insult to injury, while waiting our waitress to refill my ice tea, I see a waiter carrying a pitcher of ice tea by, look at my empty glass, walk to his table to fill a glass of ice tea, and then walk away to set the pitcher down. Really dude?! I know we were not your table but I guess you would've died on the spot if you had filled, or even inquired about, another customer's ice tea.

This particular Makino is located in the Premium Outlet (Downtown area), close to where the I-15 meets the 95. With busloads of tourists and locals looking for bargains at the outlet shops and working up a good appetite, it is usually packed during lunch and dinner. The restaurant itself is fairly large, and can usually accommodate the crowd without long wait time, although this is partially due to the tight arrangement of the tables and chairs.
 
The waitresses are all Japanese from what I have observed, which is a good thing for authenticity, and are usually very friendly and do their best to look after the customers. The sushi bar of course is mostly staffed by non-Japanese chefs/cooks that prepare the sushi rolls and nigiri menu. As the sushi and the rolls are prepared and then presented for the customers to serve themselves buffet-style, there is pretty much no interaction with the sushi chefs.
 
Overall, the food is okay and the price is cheap. The menu features both cold and hot foods. For the sushi, the fish is not the highest sashimi quality, but still good enough to serve raw.  But avoid food that have been left out awhile, because fresher is always better, especially when it comes to sushi.  The menu offers most of the typical nigiri sushi items san the premium items (uni, toro, etc) and different variations of sushi rolls garnished with different sauces.   Their hot entrees feature the regular lineup of items at most Asian buffets, such as teriyaki beef/chicken, pot stickers, fried rice, baked clams plus scallops on shells, seafood dynamite, grill salmon and more. In terms of variety it offers way more than the average diner can sample on a single visit.

For what it is, Makino is highly recommended. Just be sure to arrive early and not close to the restaurant's closing time, because the crew starts cleaning up and will probably be out the door if you take your time trying to eat right up to closing time.

I have to say it was good...it was no Famous Dave's...although it was the same price so I think that without a groupon I wouldent choose it over Dave's but honestly it was good. If I was in the area, I'd go here rather then driving way out to Chandler for sure. 

Ok lets start at the beginning....upon walking in...you get the immediate feeling that this place is owned by a guy. There is eye candy everywhere...from the hostess to the servers to the bartenders...all hot. I think there was only 1 guy server...dont ask me how we happened to get put in his section..lol. 

We were there during happy hour (runs 7 days a week, thats awesome) and since I knew a 35$ groupon was gonna be harder to spend with 2 people we got some apps. The ""famous"" onions rings...were amazing...the portion was really small but we found out when we got the bill that the 6.99 onion rings were only $1 for happy hour..thats why the portion was smaller....when we tried to order a second batch they told us that we could only order 1 time for 1$...after that it was full price....that kinda sucks...I rather them be 3$ or whatever and I can order more..but whatever. We also got potato skins...which unlike the ones you think of when you go to applesbees or any other place like that...these are actually skins of the potatoes they peeled that they fry and then dust with seasoning....not bad for a buck. 

I ordered a lemon drop for my drink which was ok, could have been strong but whatever. 

We shared a rack of ribs with 2 sides ( I'm used to Dave's BBQ being ridiculous portions that you cant even finish with 2 people ) and it was just the right amount of food I think due to having the appetizers. The ribs had a choice of sauce being Mild, Sweet-Spicy, or Cajun. We ordered the ribs dry and sauce on the side but they came with Sweet-Spicy on them instead...a little disappointed in that but it was ok as the sauce was great.

Yes, folks, my neighborhood at long last has its own bona fide coffee shop and not just a dubious Circle K. 

Urban Beans, they call themselves. I believe when I told a friend the name, he called it ""jaunty"".  Take it for what you will.

Now obviously I haven't been sitting around caffeine deprived all this time as I've very much made myself at home at almost every coffeehouse in existence within a 10 mile radius (include the old CounterCulture Cafe on McDowell at 2 in the morning), but the fact that this one is 60 seconds away (instead of 240), is HUGE.

-----------
ATMOSPHERE: Fairly minimalist in setting. A bright open rectangular space with a lot of natural light; white walls adorned with modern art. All tables are two-tops and there are no couches. An outdoor patio overlooking 7th street that also has a few tables. Mellow downtempo music playing....

WI-FI?
--------
Yes. Outlets, also yes.

FOOD?
----------
No cooked food prepared in store. Just pastries and quiche. Always the quiche, it appears. Pastries included bear claws, sugar cookies, and some humongazoid apple crumble death star thing...

DRINKS
------------
An array of your regular coffee beverages, along with a good selection of iced teas and blended coffee drinks/smoothies. 

SERVICE
-------------
A toss-up. I couldn't quite read them. Now, I was beyond stoked these guys were open. However, they were pretty much less than thrilled about my stoked-ness. I was firing all sorts of questions which I think to them just sounded obvious and rudimentary. Maybe they were tired? Who knows. Not the most inviting vibe, but I'll have to come back on a subsequent visit to be sure.

Adam works in an office and he said it's the perfect place for a low-key business meeting.  

Portions are ok but some meals are pricier than others. For example, the chicken poutine is around 17$ with tax and it's not bigger than a combo meal thigh. 

The chicken is savoury and well seasoned. The fries are just ok but I like that they place the chicken on top of them so they get a bit of flavour.

Quite an improvement over the former Mackenzies (this should read ""pseudo-Mackenzies"" as the real owners of the Mackenzies brand moved west and opened a great bar next to the High Park subway station,, selling the original location to someone not quite up to their standards and who used their name in an unlicensed  manner). 

The Mugshot staff was attentive and turned out to be the owners. They remodelled the place with great mugshots of famous people like Bill Gates (arrested in 1975), Jimi Hendrix (arrested in Toronto in May 1969), and would you believe, Larry King (arrested in December 1971).

There is one main widescreen 42"" HDTV with an HD source behind the main bar, and a secondary screen with music videos from the pay-for-music juke-box on the back wall. One of the bar owners/bartenders, Scott, is in a band, and plays eclectic  mixes when people are not using the jukebox. They also have FREE WiFi. The remodelling included getting rid of the high-table and stools that were the main tables near the bar. Instead, they created intimate booths that are more appropriate, and likely seat more people, more comfortably. Scott also mentioned that they spent almost four-months fixing and cleaning up the place, and I can believe it. I think they did a great job. Good atmosphere, great roof-top patio -- when the temperature isn't 37 degrees Celsius like it was when I visited. 

The Bar specializes in independent micro-brew beers, so don't ask for a Labatts or Molsons product. Local brews like Steam Whistle and Mill Street dominate the selection. I personally prefer micro-brewed beer as it tastes more like the specific styles of beer that they claim to be: like a pilsner or stout for instance.

I recently came across this place yesterday as me, my girlfriend, and her daughter came out of the AMC theater at Westgate. This place must have just opened up this week as it was still closed last week when I was at Westgate. Now I want you to keep in mind that this place just opened when u go in. There isn't really anything about the look of the place that makes it stand out from any other place. The people genuinely seemed excited for us when we came in the place so that's good. Our waiter I didn't catch his name but he didn't seem to comfortable, he seemed kind of nervous. I had the Stromboli which I thought was pretty good. My girl had the greek salad, it was ok. The chicken that came on it seemed a bit dry. Her daughter had chicken tenders with french fries. She kept yelling saying how delicious it was so if u got a 4yr old go with the chicken tenders. I had a word with the person who brought our food because a couple of the chicken tenders look like as if they were bitten. They manager came out and offered to replace the meal but we didn't because she wasn't going to eat all of her meal anyways so what's one less chicken tender. We also ordered some garlic knots but we never got them. But I probably would have had I remembered then myself instead of hours later once I got home. But I guess that sums up r meal there at Mama Gina's. It was ok, but nothing really that makes it a ""must eat"" place. But I would recommend it if u happen to be at Westgate despite how my review comes across. Its just not a place that I would go out of my way to eat at.

Ordered the Jerk Grouper taco with a mango & misc salsa (there was other stuff in the salsa but mango was the king) which was freaking amazing. You get 2 huge soft tacos with a side which I got the avocado salad which is a pasta also freaking amazing . Cabo gives a very laid back vibe and the atmosphere has a Caribbean feel and tons of unique art which includes Bob Marley (4/20 ). The rice and beans as a side were also tasty so I recommend those as well.

Our waitress was very attentive and thank goodness cause that jerk snuck up on me and slapped me like 3 times lol but it was worth it. 

The only thing missing from Cabo is a live band, group of friends and some libations lol.",2016-05-02 22:28:28

I never leave there hungry or being disappointed with the meal. The free corn salsa they give you with chips is delicious and has a little zing to it because of the red onion they mix in imo. I've also had plenty of the cheese dip appetizer over the years and it has a kind of ""smokey"" taste to it that sets it apart from a regular white cheese you would get at a lot of mexican restaurants. 

The tacos are all well prepared and my personal favorite is the BBQ Mahi tacos. I probably get that at least 2 out of every 4 trips there. A lot of the other times I will try out whatever the special is they are having. I tried the scallop wrap yesterday and while the scallops themselves tasted a little overdone (I'm guessing its extremely difficult to cook a perfect scallop) it was still a great meal. 

The only thing I think they could work on, and this is something I have noticed over the years, is that it seems like a lot of the time they run out of the specials. May just be a testament to the restaurants popularity but if the special is no longer available please take the eraser to the chalkboard so my taste buds don't get all worked up for nothing,",2012-07-12 13:22:36

The last two times I have gone there (most recent, yesterday morning), I was told ""all we have is what you see... we are out of the rest"". This meant there were maybe 2 - 3 dozen donuts left on the shelf, and those were the ones that no one likes anyway. They did offer to ""heat up"" some more, but they didn't have a variety of the ones that could be ""heated up"", and they said it would take 30 - 45 minutes to ""heat up"" the other ones.

Besides the really bad selection during what should be their busiest times, the workers were dripping with apathy and seemed that they were bothered by having customers in the store.

Additionally, the entrance and line areas make it almost impossible for more than a few people at a time to be in the store; it's really cramped.

I shared the same exact comments with our server and then later when the manager came by to check on how we were enjoying the meal. I jokingly told him 'great, if I had some crab'. This guy recognized my sarcasm, embraced it & rolled with it. Most importantly, he was genuine when he said if I could get it for you, I would!!! That went a long way with us...

The size & layout of this location I like & the bonus here is that they serve bbq & make fresh pizzas. We ordered the ribs and brisket, with the beans & coleslaw. Also had the kids fried shrimp & fries, along with 2lbs of shrimp. Meal, service and atmosphere was good and I appreciated the way the manger talked with me when I shared my frustration of no Dungeness but yet it was on special (as a mixed bag, not whole crab)...

Either that, or this No Frills location is a TARDIS leading to Soviet Russia. The floor was sticky, the store was generally a mess, apparently eating locally and organically is considered a ""Frill,"" and at 4pm on a Sunday a large number of the produce and meat shelves were empty. Not picked over, mind you, they were completely bare, save for maybe an errant mushroom cap or broken piece of broccoli stem. 

I'm not sure if the place is always like this, or if I just happened to go on day where all of Toronto decided to buy up all the packages of chicken legs and pork chops.

He told me that they took over this franchise location about six years ago.  So I had not been back to this location for over six years -- how time flies!  The previous owners made crummy food, even though they are supposed to be cooking from tried and true, franchise recipes.  So after trying the old owners' food about three times we gave up on this location.  But this past weekend, my daughter wanted their garlic shrimp, so we order from them again.

I ordered three plates, but my order was misinterpreted and we got four plates instead.  I paid for all four since we wanted to try the food again and Will assured me that I would not be disappointed.  Their kalbi short ribs and bbq chicken was very good, and my daughter said that her garlic shrimp was also very good.  The macaroni salad was ""Hawaiian Style"" and good too.  We also had some beef teriyaki and that was mediocre at best -- the beef was too lean and tough, and the marinade was not very good.  If they soaked the beef in the kalbi sauce and made a bbq version of bulgogi, that would have been better.

Prices are on the high side; not extremely high, but high.  Plates are about $9 each and the short rib plate is like $10.

I love this place, but let me start with some of the negatives and then I'll get to the awesomeness that is James Cheese Back Ribs

1. It's pricey, especially if you're looking to get full here! The classic James Cheese back ribs is $37. This is probably enough to feed 1.5 persons. If you want an additional half order to feed 2-3 people, that's another $18.50.
2. The sauce is one flavour with varied spiciness. The mild is only okay, but the spicy gives it another kick but can sometimes be too spicy. Wish there was a middle between mild and spicy (maybe there is? You can ask?)
3. I don't think they take reservations, and it is a small establishment so you may end up waiting a bit for a table. 

The awesomeness
1. I love the concept, because who can go wrong with ribs and cheese. I don't think people order anything else. It's an unique concept, one that I don't know if I have found elsewhere in Toronto. It also comes with seasonal sides. The corn goes deliciously with the sauce. 
2. The service. They prepare your food in a relatively reasonable amount of time, but are always quick to refill and make sure you're taken care of. They cut the ribs and wrap the cheese around it. 
3. FREE FRIES ON FRIDAY W/ RIB ORDER",2018-03-15 17:47:52

My first visit was a few years ago when I hosted s large group business dinner that was great!  Since then each visit just gets worse. This time a 530 early bite before attending the Symphony. We arrived and the hostesses were great our reservation was ready as arranged. We opted to sit at the bar as spots were available. We ordered a cocktail from a particularly non communicative bartender and asked a few questions about the menu to which we got one line answers. I was having a bad feeling about this. Cocktails came and my partners drink was fabulous. A rum cocktail w muddled fruit that she said was great. We toasted the evening and I noticed that my vodka tonic was not quite right. The tonic mix had run out on the bartenders gun. Hey it happens. The resolution to this small issue ruined the evening. The staff were rude and not helpful They did comp the drink and I did tip appropriately but we left without having dinner and will not return.

I wanted to upgrade my phone and ask some questions about plans for smartphones because the Verizon wireless website wasn't very clear.

The store is very clean and laid out well with so many different phones on display that you can try out. There is an area to ""check-in"" when you enter the store. I didn't check in since when I got to the store, I was the only customer there; later when the store got busy, the check-in kiosk becomes important as it puts you in queue to be helped by a salesperson, customer service rep, or technician.

I was helped by Katie (I think that was her name) and she answered all of my and my husband's questions. She explained the plans very well and made it much easier to understand than how it was presented on the Verizon website. She was so polite and helpful and even set up my email on the Blackberry Curve so I wouldn't have to figure it out.

This is probably the best Verizon store I have been in, and I have been to 5 different stores in 3 states. By far this had the nicest layout, the most organized system to help customers, and the shortest wait time to process a transaction from sale to set up of device of any of the 4 previous Verizon stores I had visited.",2008-07-24 20:14:47

So yeah, I don't mind it. 

Their newly redone lounge is pretty cool, and I probably shouldn't even mention it because it's still pretty intimate (read: small), so I don't want all you Yelpers taking my seats. The drinks are good. They have some food, and the items we got were also good. 

They have a throwback ""vintage"" area where all the machines still use coins. Bleah. There's a reason why I like the newer machines...No wet wipes needed. They also seem to be pretty retro on the ticket machines...I always end up going to the cashier. The place isn't that big, so if you get lost, you can easily go back around (unlike the acres and acres of casino on the Strip). They have a decent cafe (decent food, spotty service), and two showrooms that I haven't been to, but I see lines, so it looks like people are still going to the shows. That's a good sign. 

I think I have a soft spot for Cortez because not only do they always find me a parking spot, but this is the only casino where the host has come up to me, instead of me having to go to sign up, and so now I make a point of playing there, even if it's just a couple of bucks.

If every other review talks about the booze, you know you are in trouble when it comes to the food. I went for the food and that was a mistake, I'm not a drinker. My friend Stanley mentioned this place to me and it sounded fun so I went and it was fun. I should have known better, Stanley and I rarely agree when it comes to food. I paid $15 for a sausage on a bun, no garnish, fries or drink, a bit over valued in in my opinion.  I guess if you have enough beer you won't realize you are paying $15 for a sausage on a bun. I guess you are also buying into the concept (make sure you like noisy) and not just the food. I just recently put similar lighting in my back garden so I can't help but think the décor is flawless :)  I was offered cheese on my sausage which I thought was a good idea seeing as I am cheat day anyway, turned out to be a mistake. I assumed it would be cheddar,  no one said it was going to be a stinky smelly cheese. I ordered the Mexican sausage, and with rhe exception of too much bun it was ""ok"".  Overall not too spicy, the right amount of condements and excelent service. The decor was festive, designed with a party in mind. I think the best part of this place was the Itialian bakery just below. Not a part of this place but wow, don't miss it. Wyrst is a bit loud but acceptable.

The food is awesome. I've been to this location several times and everything I have ever had has been amazing. Granted, you have to like chocolate, but if you do, heaven! This visit I Le Medley Fleur de Sel, that consisted of a scoop of vanilla ice cream atop an intense brownie, served with a little pot of caramel sauce to drizzle. So good! And the perfect portion too, not so large that I felt sick, but enough to feel satisfied.  My companions had a Grand crus hot chocolate, a fancy cocktail, and a crepe.  Everyone was quite happy with their choices.

The service though . . . terrible. Pleasant staff when you can catch them, but they always seemed to be busy doing something else. It didn't seem to be for lack of staff, there seemed to be many employees working. We came in and waited what felt like a really long time to be seated, while there were many empty tables. A quick ""hello, we'll be with you shortly"" would have gone a long way instead of feeling ignored. Same thing once we were seated, friendly when someone was with us, but we sat for long periods of time waiting, whether it be to give our orders, or to get our bills and pay.  It was such a strange feeling.

We had brought an out of town guest with us, to show her something uniquely Montreal, and it didn't disappoint.  I love the Laurier location, for the high ceiling and big windows, very pretty.  The price is right too, when you compare how expensive a fancy drink at a bar can get.  This is an occasional indulgence, so quite fine.

I usually have different moods whenever I get gelato. Sometimes I'm in a chocolate mood and sometimes I just want something fruity. I always get the 2 scoop cups- just depends on my hunger level if I get a small or a medium. I do have to say though, I've never spent over $4 on one visit to Dolce Gelato. The price is really good for what you get and the atmosphere they provide you with.

Here's the run-down on my favorite flavors:

Feeling sweet and milky? Try these:
-Tiramisu: so good. Doesn't taste like the real thing, but it's close enough for a froze dessert. You really get the hints of coffee in it
-Chocolate: it's chocolate. Need I say more?
-Nocciola: It's just a hazelnut flavor. I usually pair this with the chocolate to fuel my Nutella addiction.
-Bacio: Why mix chocolate and hazelnut together when you can just have this? It pretty much tastes the same and there's some chocolate ribbons floating around in there... pretty good. I usually pair this with the tiramisu.
Mocha: It's pretty good. I don't really like strong coffee bases so this is perfect. I usually pair this with the bacio or chocolate.

Feeling fruity? Try these:
-LEMON! This is a must-try in my books. Not too tart, not to sweet, and just an authentic lemon flavor. Sooo yummy and the most refreshing flavor I've tried. It cures the hot-humid day blues.
-Mango: I'm a mango addict so anything with mango is good in my books. It's pretty sweet.
-strawberry: a little tart
-Raspberry: this one is also a little tart
I usually pair any of the fruit ones with lemon because it's a good base and it washes all the other flavors off your tongue. It's just so good.

Check-ins can be achieved at the end (turnaround) of the hike. It's customary to have lunch, or a talk, or a libation there. Take your shit with you!

The Smiths. Morrissey solo is not the same as The Smiths. Everyone who has heard him perform knows this. And, the Liberty Bell Arch hike is not the same without Norm K.

I come here every so often for lunch, and that's the worst time. I have to say they have gotten better, but for the most part they are still hit & miss with taking order and preparing the sub the way it was ordered.

Case in point, I was distracted by 2 people smack next to me having a conversation. I ordered my normal #38 Turkey Cordon Bleu (half). Somehow I ended up being charged for a combo which I didn't say I wanted. And instead of taking that off the order, the guy behind the register just looked at me like ""well, go get yourself a bag of chips."" And when I got my sandwich, it didn't have anything on it that I asked for (all the way, no vinegar, with mushroom & honey mustard). 

Their system is so outdated, that after you pay, they gave you a real print out little ticket from the cash register, which you then have to give it to one of the 2 people behind the counter making the sandwich. This system would work if the 2 sandwich makers are spot-on, but they normally aren't.

Back to McFadden's.  They really do have almost every single thing you could think of and none of the junk you don't need, i.e. if you want BBQ sauce don't go to McFadden-Dales, go to Lowe's.  Need a 1"" jam nut and a size 235 oring?  Go to McFadden-Dales!

Went here tonight for the first time. Ironically, the tea was my least favorite part. Ordered off the soul food menu: fried chicken, potato salad, and cornbread.  My husband ordered the pot pie. While we waited for our food, Chris (the server) brought out some amazing focaccia with caramelized onions and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Delicious! The chicken was so juicy and flavorful, not at all greasy. The potato salad was yummy and not at all heavy. The cornbread was a huge portion, but it had caramelized onions throughout (I picked them out).  My husband's pot pie had the best flavor and an enormous puff pastry crust that was the flakiest we'd ever seen. We ordered desserts to go: a slice of lemon pound cake and a slice of Tiramisu. With two dinners, two desserts, one glass of wine and one order of tea the bill came to $56. Not too bad.  We will definitely return. I just think the tea I ordered was too strong/bitter.

You may appreciate this if you want a more secluded hotel to stay in. You may hate this if you're into the busy action on the strip and nightlife. Personally, I liked how it was sort of off the strip, and having the mall right across the street during Black Friday was super convenient.

Since the building was supposed to originally be a condo tower, there is no casino and public parking structure... which means it's super quiet at night and nightly valet parking. I don't like strangers driving my car 'cause they mess with the radio, rear view mirrors, etc. I don't care if I'm as wealthy as Paris Hilton, I'm pretty sure I'll always prefer to park my own car. Therefore, I didn't dig handing over the car whenever we wanted to go back and waiting at least 10 minutes for valet to retrieve our car.

Now onto the thing I REALLY enjoyed:

The room we were given was huge. There was mini kitchen (fridge, stove, etc), a dining table, a living room area with a sofa bed, a bedroom with one queen, and two full bathrooms.  Of course the one in the living room was smaller but completely usable with a sink, toilet, and decent-sized shower.  The ""master"" bath was insane. I think it was probably bigger than my own bedroom at home... the shower was AMAZING with dual shower heads and big enough to fit 4-5 people! There was also a TV in the mirror. Our room could easily accommodate 15-20 comfortably.

Speaking of rooms, if safety and security are big concerns, you'll love the Trump. In order to get to your room, you have to enter a card key into one door, which will take you into a little foyer with two doors (you and your neighbor). Then you'll have to enter your card key in your designated room. I felt super safe and I really appreciated it... though I'm pretty sure the only reason they did that was because this was supposed to be a condo.

Somehow I got missed and ending up waiting quite a while just for someone to give me a cup of salad dressing.

(Read more here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/mccarran-rent-a-car-center-las-vegas?hrid=TM3dwBx0CzEYgU_iH201bA.)

Advantage is not my go-to, and yes: avoiding this building entirely is probably best. However, sometimes one has to bite the proverbial bullet. Here is my experience ....

The CES dweebs invaded the valley with their overall awkwardness and terroristic driving. And in doing so, drove the rates for all car hire companies through the roof. Normally Fox is the cheapest, but this time Advantage apparently was the company with most cars remaining so they were the least expensive. 

They will try to up-sell. It is their job to do so, unfortunately. Insurance, the petro, the SUV; a surfboard rack, child seat, and GPS. They would up-sell a camper when you make it clear you are staying in a resort on the strip. They would try up-selling you a fucking space shuttle if they had one back there. They would up-sell you a ...

You get the fucking point. 

I did not fall for any of the nonsense. 

In a bizarre twist, they did accept with no problems my temporary driver's license -- which I gather they do not at every company -- although they insisted on me furnishing an insurance card for my privately owned motor vehicle. It took my fifteen minutes or so to do so on my handset (there was no one in queue that night; relax); and in doing so I learned that one of the dutiful employees at Advantage was previously fired from Fox for assaulting a customer. 

Pro Tip: Don't mess with the Advantage employee that could probably kick your ass. 

In my case, all of the employees were perfectly polite and overly nice. 

The rate was the following*:
4.73$ hour
23.64$ day**
47.28$ extra day

*Hyundai sedan
**Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

Note: Charges/Fees at 7135 Gillespie Street are outrageous. 35% on top of the rate. This should be illegal.  

Apparently there is no one grace hour period upon return unlike at Fox. (Read: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fox-rent-a-car-las-vegas-2?hrid=cnbKn7U4slbBTg60M8WLtA.)

In terms of fresh fish, I could only find one item on the menu so I ordered it.   It was a cod which turned out to be a mediocre dish that didn't even fill me up...especially for nearly $30.

When I took a closer look to see what was causing the pain, it became clear that the portion she trimmed at an angle was to blame.  That was where the pain was emanating for both feet.  It's been a few weeks later and it still causes me pain if I put pressure on it from certain angles.

I got the romaine lettuce with corn, grilled onions, bacon, monterrey and jack cheese and steak. I asked my steak to be cooked medium rare and it was more on the medium well side. The corn was very delicious and flavorful. The grilled onions were tender and sooooo good. The bacon was huge!! Huge chunks and crispy. The onion dressing was good. I usually like extra dressing but I really didn't need a lot of it because the steak was just packed with flavors. 

Another error they made was they switched me and my friend's meats. She got turkey and  I got the steak and mine was on hers and hers was on mine. Not a big deal for me but it was for my friend because she is not a fan of any red meat. 

The few errors can be forgiven. I would definitely go again. Some people complain about their salads being expensive but they are really worth it. I easily had two servings in my one salad and it was filled with all the yummy goodies I picked to go in it.",2016-02-19 00:53:09

Set in a former tepanyaki location in the fabulous MGM Grand.  Neighbor to that one chef that slaps a dash of seasoning on a dish and yells BAM!  You wouldn't be surprised to notice that there are still some tepanyaki grills in the back.  

Although you could not go wrong with the standard tables.  We opted to be entertained while we eat.  Best part of Morimotos tepanyak grills are, the women at the table are actually respected during this meal, rather than getting confronted with the usual harrasment at other Japanese grill spots in this town.  However hilarious they may be. 

The menu is surprisingly standard for semi Japanese fusion.  The sushi chefs all look legit.  There are traditional rolls and sashimi.  There are the obligatory poke ""tacos"" in fried eggroll shells.  There are the tuna tartare ""pizzas"" of course too.  Being completely honest, the first time we came those dishes were the bee's knees.  The second time they were a bit off.  

We slapped 2 (48oz?) tomahawk ribeyes on the grills both times we went.  Both times they were the highlights of the dinners.  The steaks come with 3 sauces.  Bernaise, chimichurri and Morimotos steak sauce.  We all know the first 2, but I'm pretty sure some of you have had the sweet and salty asian sauce at Korean bbg before.  Thats what Morimotos steak sauce tasted most similar to.

Getting down to desserts.  They get down on tha flo' wit those.  Deserts are not to be skipped at this spot.  The flaming rum chocolate smore ball plate!  The mango custardy bowl thingy!  The sorbet type whatever it was dish, and lest not forget, the super duper chocolate cakey cheesecake-ish desert were all Raku Sweets rivals in and of themselves.  Diabeetus.

We had our very own Morimoto impersonator with us.  My little brother.  It was fun seeing the servers double take as we were being seated, lol.  My 3 year old cried until he got the foot long bone of the tomahawk to knaw on.  We kept chewing on it until we got to the car.  My toddlers couldn't stop eating steak and the chef prepared some bits and pieces to well-done for them.  Very nice service all around.

It is nice to see a staff that takes pride in their establishment and quality of ingredients well worth the dollar value on the strip.  Sometimes the chef actually comes in to check on the progress too.  All aces.  I know I have given out too many 5 star reviews already, but Morimotos really does deserve it.

The curry veggies were super hot.  I was a bit disappointed in the wine list having asked for two of the wines on the menu only to find out that they were out of stock.

It's in the same plaza as Home Depot, and is easily accessed from Craig Road. I've stopped here often in the last four years. With the decline in donut demand evidenced by the closure of several Krispy Kreme and Dunking Donuts here,  they seem a lot less busy than years past and is looking a little shopworn.  They're like the long lost cousin that got a job in town, became a temporary house guest, then lost his job.  You're glad he's still here but just not as fun anymore. 

A few years back, you'd have lots of families stopping in on weekend mornings with kids thrilled to see donuts being made.  Their glass walls let kids put their faces near the conveyor where donuts pass.  Then when they'd make hot donuts, the red ""HOT donuts"" sign would light up, and people would abandon Craig Road and stop  inside.  Then, they'd give everyone walking in a warm super soft donut.  They stopped giving away donuts, and people don't spontaneously stop in anymore. Everything else is pretty much the same.  They still have free wi-fi, definitely a plus. They still have fundraising opportunities and wholesale sales. 

I usually get their special, like two donuts and coffee.  I generally think their regular glazed donuts are their best, most consistent item, but they have some featured donuts that are hit and miss. Service is generally decent, and they sometimes have a few different types of coffee - Light, medium, or dark as well as decaf.   Drive through is farily quick.

Small Plates:

Pepperoni Arancini- Rice Balls, Red Sauce and Roasted Garlic Aioli. $12. Three small arancinis, they were pretty good.

Pigs and Truffles- Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel and Summer Truffles. $18.  I'm a sucker for bechamel. That intrigued me more than the truffles. This was pretty outstanding.

Signature Pizzas are 16"". 

North Beach- Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions, Oregano. By far one of the weirdest tasting pizzas I've ever had. I think what threw me off the most was the sauce. I'm used to a clam pizza with a white sauce. The red sauce did not pair well, even worse was the smoked mozzarella. I felt like I was eating BBQ. It was terrible.

Blanca- Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Chedder, Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil. This was decent, the ricotta was the best part. 

Truffle- Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme, Shaved Truffles. Would you like a side of oil to go with that? Wow, only thing I saw on this pizza was oil. Someone call  the nearest Cath Lab and book a room for me? I couldn't finish my slice, it was terribly overwhelming. 

Margherita- Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella and Basil. This was pretty standard. Nothing to write home about.

new items, not previously tried:  chili fish. The sauce is great, it's very spicy, fish is tender. I thought the portion was a fraction too small for the price. You also need a big break before your next dish to give your taste buds a chance you recover. But delicious. It is an appetizer.

Lamb Rogan Josh. This is a dish that I order frequently at other restaurants. This was very good, I should order it again. Sauce is dark brown and thick. 

Dessert. We ordered the rasmalai as recommended. I thought it was great. My dining mates did not care for it. One said texture is weird, the other said too perfumey.

The potatoes weren't very good (a little meal-y/grainy) and the asparagus was just... well, asparagus. If you're going to get spendy on a cut of steak, you want it to be mind-blowing. This really wasn't, although the presentation was pretty. While properly cooked, I just didn't really like the preparation. I wish I would have asked for the ""toppings"" on the side. 

I think next time around I would stick to the snack-y side of their very large menu. There were a ton of pizza options, cheese plates and other delicious small plates. Pair those with some drinks on the patio and I don't think you could leave displeased. I just don't think this is the place to grab a big, fancy entree. But I'd love to come back and try something else! You know, I could be wrong.",2014-07-11 15:11:00

They have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.

Food is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.

They were out of a few of the drinks that I wanted to try so I had to ""settle"" for a bottle of soju.  The waiter, a little astonished by the severity of my alcohol tolerence, i guess, made hand gestures to demonstrate the size of the bottle.  Having played this game before, I quickly smiled and blushed like an anime character and threw up the thumbs up sign, with both hands. The waiter quickly understood and I thought that I heard him proudly tell another waiter as he walked away, "" Errr, ohh thats a Meesta Amerika, Meesta Uuu Ess Aye!"" But that might have been the soju talking or maybe racism.  
Anyway, the nigiri, which is always my favorite was acceptable.  It came out fast and I did not have to wait.  I had almost everything and all seemed reasonably fresh.  I had to order the AYCE dinner to get the uni, and as always in vegas it is never orange; it's always a little on the brown side, but it was delicious.
What really gives this place four stars, at least for me, was the amount of made up quasi japanese fusion shit that is on their menu.  I had a japanese burrito.  It is basically like a california roll wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried.  I also had a monkey ball, which was like pork and california roll ingredients, breaded, sauced and deep fried.  It was weirdly awesome.
Really, the little things on their menu, like crawfish, golden spoon, dynamite, the above and all the other things makes their AYCE well worth it.  I tried sooooo many things and was quite pleased by the end of the meal.


Oh Wait!!!
Tempura Oreo!!!!!! 
Yeah, I did it, the only down fall was the canned whip cream that accompanied it.  But still, I had a deep fried oreo.  Was it all that tasty?  Any tastier than a non deep fried oreo?  Not really.  But sometimes it's just about the absurdity of the decadence.

From 2014:
Went on the 7th for a Meet Up group.  Despite our host calling twice for reservations (and confirmation of numbers), there was no record of our event -- 9 people if I recall.  The on-site manager was quick to respond and moved everyone to the ""lounge"" upstairs.   

This was a fail on the management staff -- they assumed we knew what the differences between the restuarant and downstairs area was versus the upstairs ""lounge"" area.  Really he needed to ask what the host's expectations were and accomodate/explain the differences.

All this said, the upstairs lounge is a low-setee area around tables -- not a dinner venue at all.  The waitstaff responded after they figured out we were out of place and were not programmed to have a ""dinner"" venue.  Upstairs is an upscale, late night, Pittsburgh snak/music venue.  Since we didn't stay until 10 PM or so, we don't really know what happened/happens there.  

Lounge food was okay.  We were not allowed to order off the dowstairs menu despite the lost reservations and being sent upstairs.  Fail.  

I expect that the downstairs restaurant experience would have been much different and better.  And this is what the group had expected.  The on-site manager could have easily made a ""fix"" to their lost reservation.

We will go back.  But one needs to understand the differences between downstairs and upstairs.  The late evening music venue upstairs is surely wonderful.

Super cute location in a restaurant rich area. We were seated right away but service was spotty. It wasn't crazy busy but service was slow. From ordering, to having drinks arrive it was just dragging. 

The food is pretty good, but over priced for what you get. It seems as though you're mostly paying for the rent and location- as opposed to the food. 

Dessert was funny, and we wanted to go home so we ordered dessert to-go.  My sis got a shake and I asked if the banana cream pie would be okay to-go, which our server said no problem. When the pie finally came out I started laughing because it looked like a dumpster fire. It was smushed looking but I have a sense of humor and thought it might taste ok. After driving home 25 minutes I placed it in the fridge in the hopes of reviving it, but sadly the pie didn't believe in reincarnation.

Let's be honest, brunching is one of my favorite things to do...so of course I was eagerly anticipating the experience!

Coca Cafe is small, so be prepared to wait for your table. My friend and I came at around 1 PM on a Sunday and were told that our wait would be around 30 minutes for a table - honestly, not too bad at all. Coca is BYOB, so this gave us just enough time to hike up the hill to Arsenal Cider and grab a growler of pear cider before receiving the text that our table was ready.

My expectations were quite high coming into this brunch, as I had been told many times over that Coca has one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh. My overall experience was that I was impressed, but not as impressed as I had hoped I would be. The service was great; our waiter, Tristan, was attentive and friendly. We began with one of the starters: the buttermilk donut with lemon, blueberry, and blackberry icings and powdered sugar. Truthfully, this donut was the star of the show. The donut was crisp yet fluffy, and the icing combination was phenomenal. We gobbled it up immediately.

For the main course, I ordered the avocado omelette with applewood smoked bacon and house salsa. I was concerned about the jalapeño muenster as I don't love spicy things, so I subbed in the extra-aged beemster instead. My omelette was delicious. Was it the best omelette I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. However, it was quite tasty and quite large, so I was able to bring home leftovers. It also came with a side of grilled potatoes and a small fruit cup, which complimented it well.

I love that Coca changes their menu regularly, because this means that the next time I come I can be pleasantly surprised with something new. I'm not sure if it lived up to the hype for me on this first experience, but I can see myself coming back in the near future!",2016-03-13 19:54:06

I'm usually in Vegas for trade shows and don't spend much time in my room anyway. So, provided my hotel has easy access to whatever convention center, hot water and a comfortable bed, my complaints are typically minimal.

I stayed at the Flamingo for 2014 CES and don't really have anything bad to say. It's on the monorail loop (two stops to the LV convention center), there's some pretty decent, if not easy and convenient dining options, lots of bars and shops, and friendly staff. 

The Total Rewards program is worth it - my rate for 4 days at the Flamingo was less than one night a hotels that were a bit closer to the CES venue, but with a huge show like that you've got to expect jacked up prices.

The only really negative thing I'd say about this place is the hallway carpets have seen much better days - they need a steam clean, stat. Also, it didn't seem like the staff was too quick to grab room service trays and empty glasses out of the hallways. Not a deal breaker, but kind of off-putting.

I'd definitely stay at the Flamingo again - it's reasonably priced and pretty comfortable - and that typically fits my needs in sin city. If you're looking for value, it's a great spot. If you're looking for luxury, this probably isn't the place for you.",2014-01-10 19:10:57

Met a friend here for breakfast- the first for the both of us.  I've only been here once for lunch (4 stars).

After a few minutes of pouring over the menu, we decided on pancakes and meat (for me) and a three-egg scramble for him.  On my first visit I heard that JFG also sells fresh-squeezed lemonade, so I thought I'd try it, as well as order a side of apple fritters, which had sounded so good to me ever since I first read of it three years ago.

It was a beautfiul morning, so we elected to dine out in the patio.  I chose a corner table next to the trees, whereupon my companion noticed a sign that stated to the effect that scorpions are known to populate the area!  My friend then wondered why does JFG set up tables under trees if this is a hazard?  Good question, indeed.

Eventually, our buzzer signaled that our food was ready for pick-up.  I was so excited on finally having breakfast there that I went w/ my friend to retrieve the tray.  Upon gazing at my pancakes, my excitement somewhat deflated, as you can see, they looked a little burnt.  And plain.

Thankfully, the apple-cider smoked bacon helped to counter this effect, but not by much.  His scrambled eggs looked so much more appetizing, and I almost lost my resolve to avoid eggs and try a bite.   

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw?select=RzOiqjlXyzoTNX4dmrD3jg  

Very much enjoyed the apple fritters, even though bites revealed more dough than apples in the filling.  Lemonade was, without a doubt, very tart, but we both liked it.

$25 for pancakes and bacon, scrambled eggs (w/ country potatoes, apple-cider bacon, and flatbread), a bottle of water, a large tumbler of fresh lemonade, and apple fritters.  Not bad, I thought, especially when I pointed it out that the produce, eggs, and meat are locally-produced and may be organic, but my friend didn't think that the meals were any better than those one would find at The Good Egg.  Stealing another longing glance at his non-greasy egg platter, I begged to differ...  Allergy results be damned, I'm going to try JFG's ""Green eggs and ham"" on my next go!",2009-10-09 00:20:28

I have to admit I was  bit surprised at the style and vibe of the place. It has the feel of a swanky steak or chop house as you enter. 

We arrived just a shade after 11am for lunch and the place was near empty. We got a large table in the back to make room for the youngsters.

Kyle was on the ready with menus and water and we had the hummus appetizers with the pita points, wow what a great idea for several people to stare and a great healthy option.

I had the grilled salmon tacos which came with flour tortillas. What  a great meal it was, the salmon has pan seared and blackened and 3 tacos is more than enough for a meal.

James had the crab cakes, Ben had the Tavern Dip & Dora had the Club. Each entree came with a side and the sweet potato fries were very tasty.

I visited because my daughters received H & M gift cards for Christmas and there is an H & M here.  H & M is pretty much targeted at 20 somethings and wannabe 20 somethings.  Sort of Ikea meets The Gap.  Although in fairness I did spot a Sgt. Pepper looking jacket that I tried on...it just didn't work.  For me or anyone.

So Scottsdale Quarters also has some upscale stores and Brio restaurant which I have not tried but it has reviewed pretty well.  What they are lacking at this point is a good coffee house where dad's can chill while the kids are at H & M.

I like the upward rather than outward design of much of the shopping center.  It would be nice if they add apartments or condos rather than office space above,  Or at least a mix.  That would certainly lend itself toward an urbanism that the Valley is missing.",2009-12-28 16:36:53

The most recent time I went in (and probably the reason I won't go back) 2 different things happened 

First of all- my boyfriend got there before me and ordered a cesar and requested for it not to be too spicy how I like it. Well I got it and it was definitely spicy!! Too spicy in fact. When we tried to send it back (which is pretty fair and I've done it at tons of restaurants who took it back no problem) the server was extremely hesitant but said she'd try and ended up just bringing over a glass of clamato juice and saying to pour some in to even out the taste. CHEAP!!!!!!

Also, my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese and when she asked if he wanted bacon he said yes. Well there was no bacon and that didn't stop him from eating it :P but on the bill there was a charge for bacon! When we explained to the server how there was no bacon but we were charged for it again she was hesitant and told us to just take that dollar off her tip.

I'm not blaming the server by any means. I don't know who runs that place but it sucks!

It was definitely a so-so car wash. The interior wasn't wiped down well nor was it what I would expect of a full service car wash. 
What really pissed me off was the fact that somehow my wiper blade came off in the wash. Now, these hadn't been touched in forever since it's been awhile since it has rained so there's no way it was ""operator error"" in terms of replacing it. It definitely came off and instead of telling me when they were hand drying/wiping it, they just crudely set it on top of the metal wiper part. The next day when we used our wipers/wiper fluid, the wiper blade flew off b/cse it wasn't attached and the metal piece scratched our windshield. I would have much preferred them to just tell me that the blade came off and I would have attached it myself instead of them IGNORING it and hoping I wouldn't notice.

The Oxtail Fried Rice is one of their popular items for sure, at least to me because I always find myself ordering it everytime I'm there. The portion is huge so I can never finish it and very well flavored. The fried sunny side up egg on top is magical when you take your fork or spoon and split it down the middle. Let it slowly ooze down covering the mostly the entire rice dish, wowwww!  My mouth is salivating just writing about it. Anyways, please if it's the only menu item you can afford there, get that Oxtail Fried Rice! The only down side is I wish there was more meat. Lol 

Another highlight is their Vietnamese shredded chicken salad. It's very good. The dressing is not too sweet, but not too sour either. Reminds me of how my mom would make it at home. A lot of chicken, shredded cabbage, and topped with crushed peanuts alongside fried rice chips. You eat it by scooping some of the salad mix onto the chips and it's as easy as that. 

Additionally, the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio was great as well. If you can eat rare beef seasoned with citrus soy, truffle oil and sesame oil then order this! You won't regret it! 

One last recommendation was the Grilled Squid! Oh man! That was delicious! Perfectly grilled and flavored. Came out sliced in portions easy to eat with a spicy creamy sauce to dip it in. Frankly, I liked it by itself without the dipping sauce. 

Other than those three, I've tried their Oysters, Snails, Yellow-Tail Fish Tacos, and Green Papaya Salad and they were all mediocre. Nothing very special or memorable. The oysters were okay, I've had better and the Snails as well. One thing about it was the lemongrass they cooked the snails in because it made sipping the broth delicious - very flavorful! The Thai salad was too spicy and sour for my taste. The tacos were alright and I didn't feel like it was worth $11 for three. Too many veggies and salad, not enough of the yellow-tail. So overall, I would definitely recommend those above and hope to come back and try their pho next time!",2018-08-04 01:58:43

I came here on Friday night with my three dear friends for a much needed, relaxing dinner out.  We decided to use the 20% Yelp discount voucher I received the night before at the Summer Splash and Dash event, and as soon as we were seated I gave our waiter, Chris, my Yelp discount card.

We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.  Not overwhelmed in a bad way, but overwhelmed in a good way...it was enormous!  My friends all ordered their own drinks and we placed an appetizer orders: the ""endless"" caramel popcorn with Ancho chilies, and half orders each of the tater tots and the seasoned Kennebec French fries.  The tater tots and fries were both hot and delicious and came with tangy dipping sauce.  The caramel popcorn was intriguing with its slightly spicy end note.  We really enjoyed the popcorn, but sadly while the menu description implied it was a refillable menu item, it wasn't refilled when we depleted the bowl and so we only got a very small serving.

After finishing our first cocktails we all placed our dinner orders, I ordered the large order of the Kobe beef short ribs with the blue cheese grits, my girlfriends both ordered flatbread pizzas and a salad and our lone male companion ordered the lamb meatballs.  We also ordered additional cocktails to go with dinner and I took the chance to order a drink the waiter recommended called a Bermuda Triangle, which was cold, fruity, tangy and massively potent too.  (Wow!)

Our dinners all trickled out at different times and us three ladies at the table had all been served for a full 15 minutes before we eventually grabbed the closest waiter in the vicinity, Justin, and had him check on our companion's missing lamb meatballs.  Justin happily obliged our request and disappeared into the kitchen only to reappear with the lamb meatballs in less than 30 seconds.  How long they were sitting there waiting to be delivered to our table was anyone's guess.  Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.  I knew there was a problem though when the people who came in a full 30 minutes after we were seated had been served their food (including an order of lamb meatballs) and the three of us ladies had all been served and our friend was still waiting for his entree!

After everyone finally had their food we all started to eat and I wasn't at all disappointed with my Kobe beef ribs!  They were so generously sized I could only eat one, however the grits were utterly unremarkable and I basically ignored them in favor of that massive, meaty rib.  I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous, although the hot pink sour cream they were served with was a bit oddly colored.

Not long after we finished eating our waiter reappeared and he volunteered to clear our table and package the second, untouched Kobe beef rib for me.  We also placed dessert orders and chatted while we waited for dessert to appear.  Oddly our desserts, including my Panna Cotta and my friend's seasonable sorbets, were all served with forks.  I had to ask the waiter for spoon instead.  My Panna Cotta was a tad too soft for my liking, but the pool of foamy citrus sauce it was sitting in was very good and deliciously tangy, although to be quite honest I could have done without the flavorless, unidentifiable curls that topped the Panna Cotta.  Seriously, I couldn't even identify what they were, they were that tasteless.

We paid our tab and tipped our waiter on the pre-discount amount.  (It should be noted that we would have tipped him more, but leaving us to sit for 15 minutes as our dinners cooled and we politely waited for our companion's missing dinner entree was no bueno!)

So all in all this was a pleasant dining experience and I expect will venture back soon, but next time I'd love to have more follow up from our waiter and I'd hope that all the entrees all arrive around the same time too.",2013-07-29 21:47:58

I'm sensing that when the finishing touches of Downtown Pineville is complete it will add some more pizazz!! Ok back to food...because of short notice we couldn't get all pork so they gave an option of half chicken, half pork, which worked for us. The pulled pork was delicious, the sauce was amazing. The chicken was not so much. It was cubed, in chunks and didn't have much of a taste to it. No one ate it because I'm gonna guess that it didn't look ""good enough to eat"", definitely not appealing to the eye. I figuring it would've been shredded like the pork. The coleslaw was some of the best homemade slaw I've had in Charlotte. I will definitely go back and this time sit and enjoy a meal.

The inside decor is very stylish and spacious, and we were happily seated on some comfortable benches (this is important as I find cramped restaurants and rickety chairs to put a damper on any dining experience).

Everything at this restaurant is under $20, and their menu items range between $14-$18 (mains). I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries, and it was honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The fried chicken was very large and generously brushed with buffalo sauce. The sandwich comes served with lettuce, tomato, and a blue cheese sauce/spread. The fries were thin and deliciously crispy. The entire plate came to $15, which is very well priced for the amount and quality of food you get. 

On Saturdays, their drink special is $5 cocktails. I ordered the blackberry smash, as recommended by our waitress, but unfortunately was very disappointed in it. The drink was very bland and if I have to compare it, I would say it tasted like barely flavoured water (if you poured water into a glass that previously held juice then drank that, it'd taste similar to this ""cocktail""). I don't think there was any alcohol in it at all, and it wasn't sweet or sour so I'm still confused what I paid $5 for (probably just water with three blackberries floating in it). 

Luckily I very rarely base my reviews on their drinks, so I'm still going to give the Social Eatery a 5 star rating based on their service, food, and ambience. I will definitely be returning again, and if you plan on visiting in the future, please give the buffalo chicken sandwich a try!",2018-06-24 02:37:00

Food:  Run-of-the-mill food booths with usual outdoor fare.  TIP:  Do NOT get the haluska in the Polish food line.  I love this dish with noodles and cabbage but this was not anything representative of the dish.  It was basically egg noodles and a tiny few bits of cabbage swimming in oil.  Yech.  I do wish I had tried the lobster burgers (note:  they were off to the side and not in the general food booth area of Point State Park).  TIP:  Take your food and head to the Point State Fountain area for some shade because the picnic tables and food booths are totally devoid of any shade on a sunny day.  TIP:  We did find a food truck with bottled watter and soda for $1.00 each.  I thought that was extremely reasonable.

Music:  Many varieties, multiple stages for free.

Art: Surprisingly good selections and some very distinct high-end quality art from jewelry, pottery, wood bowls/vases, to paintings.  Not limited to local artists.   

Parking:  Might I suggest you park in the 1st Ave garage (right off 2nd ave exit on I-376) for a flat rate of $5 on weekends and take the ""T"" transit for free to the Gateway station.  You'll be right where you want to be and avoid congestion trying to park anywhere else.

Their bento box is good value too.  And I can have popcorn chicken bento box too (LOL). ~$7 for one main dish, 3 side dishes, and a soup.  They have so many choices for side dishes, love it!!  And their portion is pretty big.

Line up is a bit confusing.  Many people will line up at the cashier to place the order... Actually, we need to line up at the food counter to place our order first.  Then go back to line up at the cashier for payment and picking up our orders.  Hope that they can put some signage in the store.

We ended up switching, and drinking, although she didn't like mine either. If you want a great prickly pear margarita, go to Mesa Grill. At Mi Casa, it is pure sugar.

The chips were fresh and warm, which was a plus, but their salsas were lacking. None of the trio stood out as impressive.

The shrimp was cooked nicely, but was overpowered by the sauce it was smothered in. The rice was my favorite.

The other special we got was a tilapia with three shrimp over roasted corn and black bean rice topped with mango salsa for $18. I did not care for this dish at all.

I also had the Szechwan Chicken. It too was a mouthful of flavor.
Great dinner!",2018-02-23 01:39:04

I enjoyed the small venue and for the Giants game it was packed.  (I don't think they sell out their other spring training games though....)I'm pretty sure the sight lines are good from anywhere, save the extreme ends of the baselines.  The stadium reminded me a lot of the actual Angel Stadium including the Disney-fied outfits worn by ushers and ticket takers.  (Why the straw hats, why?!)  

Its in Tempe but just a short drive from Mill so you can head there before or after the game.  And I heard a rumor they run a shuttle from Mill so thats something to look into for future games.

No, this is not $150 omakase sushi, this is all you can eat, but it is truly outstanding! And I dare you to find fresher fish and more yummy side dishes for lunch at only $18.95 or so, anywhere in the city.

Do not miss the golden shrimp, big bouncy fresh shrimp tossed in Japanese mayo and tobiko, the tasty chicken and beef skewers, surprising Japanese hash brown patties, super fresh teriyaki salmon and chicken, or the dozens of other excellent dishes that can accompany your choice of sushi nigiri, hand rolls, and maki.

Personally, I cannot get enough of their amazing teriyaki chicken, which is not anaemic grey chicken drowning in a gummy sauce like so many, but is lightly sauced, with crunchy delicious skin, well seared on the teppanyaki flat top, and always just too good!

And if you are there for dinner, make sure to order at least one of the avocado seafood salad, it's a delicious avocado mousse with tiny flecks of scallop scattered throughout, baked in a scallop shell, truly a unique treat in addition to all of the other delicious all-you-can-eat items.  Order it early in your meal, because they are made fresh and take a little while to bake in the oven.

I always laugh at the number of people who, on any all-you-can-eat sushi review page, actually believe that there's some great conspiracy to withold food and bring them the wrong orders, when they should just not accept anything they didn't order, and reorder anything they didn't get, easy!

we arrived and were seated immediately, which was nice because it was dinner rush and we had no wait.
Danielle and i got the same things we always get - eggplant parm for her and rigatoni w/ vodka sauce for me. i won't speak for the eggplant because i hate eggplant and she's crazy for eating it, but the vodka sauce on my pasta was unlike any i'd had elsewhere. it seemed more tomato-ey. i liked it fine but it was different. i also ordered a meatball on the side. it's what i do. i like to try meatballs and this one was really good and tender. the tomato sauce was yummy and i sopped it up with my bread.
with my meal i got the wedding soup. it was good and hot but very sloppy. the saucer under the cup was filled with soup that had either spilled in transit or was just poured in when being ladeled into the cup. no one bothered to get a clean saucer. 
one a whole, the service wasn't the best. the server was very pleasant but we waited, what i felt, were long times between ordering soup/salad and getting it delivered, or waiting for drink refills, etc. i'm willing to overlook it because it was dinner rush and he had his hands full with the table next to us. the loud, annoying blowhard who didn't seem to shut up the whole time we were there just kept talking about football and some accident he'd been in and how much he was prepared to milk someone out of money for damages, etc. he seemed perfectly fine to me and should be ashamed of himself but that's another story.
as we exited the smell of the pizzas baking in the kitchen made me want to go back and order again.

They have a lovely menu of craft cocktails which I'm loving more and more these days.  There's an art to bar-tending but there's a magical art to craft cocktails.

My companion ordered The Farmhand and I ordered The Palmaire.  Both were delicious but The Farmhand was really something special, particularly if you like gin.  

We started with the mac n' cheese.  Definitely get the pancetta on it.  Without it, I daresay it might be underseasoned.  It was delicious!  Definitely not your mom's bowl o' Kraft.  Creamy bechamel sauce and house-made pasta.  

I rarely order pasta when I'm eating out but our waiter assured us that theirs is house-made so I ordered the sausage pasta.  I rarely voluntarily consume sausage but for some reason, this dish kept calling out to me and I'm so glad it did.  The pasta was fantastic and the sausage was outstanding.  I am generally dubious of tube-meat but there was not a tube in sight!  They source their sausage locally and it lacks the round Stepford shape of most sausages (which I admittedly find mildly disturbing).  It came with a rich tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes and whole cloves of roasted garlic.   

My companion ordered the special which was Shepard's pie and he enjoyed it immensely.  

For dessert, he ordered the fig/pecan pie with the ice cream on the side (he is lactose intolerant which is sad for him but happy for me as I often inherit his dairy castaways).  He said the pie was wonderful and I can personally attest to the fact that this ice cream might have been the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  If ice cream and cream cheese had a really shady tryst in an expensive hotel, this would be the love child.  It was ridiculous.  Thankfully, there was only one scoop because I would have kept eating it, warning messages from my stomach be damned.  

I ordered the bacon s'mores which were fantastic.  The bacon is chocolate covered and well done = WIN.  (Recent forays into bacon-dessert have left me disappointed.  Chewy bacon with sweetness is no bueno.)  The marshmallow is clearly home-made and the additions of caramel and peanut butter were yummy.  

The service was great.  The level of service was a little surprising given the casual-ness of the restaurant.  Our water glasses were constantly refilled, silverware quickly replaced, plates immediately taken away - pretty fabulous.  

The menu is gluten-free and vegetarian friendly.

3.5 stars... First visit!

Bookmarked this place months ago, and I finally had an excuse to make the trip from North Scottsdale... I'm taking Mom and aunt to see Cirque du Soleil's ""Dralion"" at the US Airways Center!  Thanks to friend and fellow yelper Dolores G.'s helpful info on where to park, I made the decision to choose Cityscape for both the chance to dine at The Arrogant Butcher and have my ticket validated AND take advantage of its proximity to the arena.  She wasn't kidding when she said that US Airways was across the street!  After waiting about 20 or so minutes for first availability, we were seated outside, and my views were of the four-way intersections, pedestrian traffic, and of the front of the arena, which were lovely given that most of my dining experiences have been in strip malls, Old Town Scottsdale, the Biltmore... suburbia.  

I was able to sample a couple of reds before settling with a nice glass of Sebastiani cab from Sonoma.  While waiting for our table, we all decided we'd try the Artichoke hummus app http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ#pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ, the Market salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q#p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q, the Beef short rib stew http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA#M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA, and the ""Fish and Chips.""  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA#aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA

We all loved the artichoke hummus and pita bread app!  The bread was soft, yet had a nice chew, in spite of it not being warm and crispy.  The artichokes had great flavor, especially those that were touching the tomatoes.  We also adored the Market salad, which had so many textures to delight the mouth: mixed grains, chewy cranberries, sweet and crunchy gingersnaps, and creamy ricotta... Mmmm!  Loved the almost-nutty bite of the roasted butternut squash.  I plan to order this again on my next visit!  

We also really liked the Beef short rib stew: I liked the smoky flavors of the beef and the green chile peppers, but my favorite were the beans!  Some were still chunky, while the others had tenderized down to almost like a dip you spread on crackers and crostini.  I didn't think the fried egg's presence made much of a difference...  I could take it, or leave it.  Since I couldn't sample the cornbread muffin (allergy), I had some of the fries from the fish entree with the stew, instead.  Mom and aunt enjoyed the crispy fish!  I really loved the batter, which was just the perfect amount to cover the fish and give it a very delightful crunch (and was the dish ever so pretty to look at!).  However, I found the pieces to be very salty, and I couldn't stand more than two or three bites of it.  

I think my Mom would very much like to return, and so would I.  :)  I am going to try to make it here earlier for happy hour soon.  I really appreciate the location of Cityscape, its parking garage, and its easy access to many restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues!",2012-12-02 06:52:57

I definitely expected something more savory and cheesy, but the sweet corn over-powered everything else. 

My 'meal' was the side house salad and a side of mac and cheese. I make really awesome m&c so I wasn't uber impressed with bandera's version but it was good nonetheless. The 'nice little house salad' was indulgent, my favorite part by far. Well-dressed, ribboned lettuces and cabbages, with I think 1/12th of an avocado and a tablespoon of goat cheese and a few other bits and pieces tossed in.

As burger joints go, Kickstand's got plenty of personality and charm. I love their bicycle motif, and the bikes regaled with beer logos serve as both a nice touch and plenty of advertising for local and domestic brews. 

Burger-wise, though, there's nothing that really stands out. Kudos for introducing a different spin on burgers, topping them with several veggie combos one wouldn't commonly think of, but, frankly, their burgers don't really knock me out. For one, the patty itself is achingly small, in comparison to other burger shops around town. And the patty tastes alright. It could stand a little extra seasoning.

Having heard plenty about Kickstand, I must admit I was mildly disappointed. But I'm very willing to give Kickstand another shot, because it does possess some redeeming qualities to make me a return customer.

Service can be a hit and miss due to the wait time. Some days wait time is fantastic and food arrives in a timely manner, and other times you may get frustrated because your food is taking way too long to come out. I ordered take-out over the phone recently and I had to wait an additional 25 minutes when I got to the restaurant. There weren't even too many tables when I got there - only about 3 or 4 max. There may be a language barrier sometimes, I noticed the older ladies typically don't speak english but the younger servers often do!

Food is extremely good! I always order the hot and sour soup - it is my FAVOURITE place to get this soup! I highly recommend it for a small appetizer with your meal. So far on their menu, I've tried their rice noodles with textured protein, lo han chai chow mein and tofu casserole. All EVERY good! My boyfriend is a heavy meat eater and was surprised by how good all the vegetarian dish I bought him were. 

The portions are fairly huge depending on what you order. The soup and noodles have big portions and well worth the price. I believe a small soup is $4.99 and the fried noodles range from $9.99 to $12.99. All of these were good to share between two people, and we even had plenty of noodles left over. The tofu casserole is probably my favourite dish but sadly I don't find that the quantity for this matches the price. It is the most expensive at $13.99, and I expected a lot more given the price that I paid. However I'd still continue buying it because it is so good! LOL

I've found that, in general, some food is excellent, while others dishes are a bit underwhelming.  The tacos are in the ""great"" category, as are the more traditional and less Tex-mex-y dishes, such as the Carne en Chile Verde (braised pork), whereas the enchiladas are fine but nothing to freak out about.   I highly recommend all the salsas and house-made chips.  I also like that the margaritas come in a pitcher, which ends up being 2-3 glasses, so that's a good value.

Was disappointed that Dr. B did not go visit my child at the hospital where he was in the NICU for 5 days. He did do a great job on his circumsicion and showed great care when doing it which I appreciate. I eventually started seeing PA Dr. Wood. She really takes her time with us and is generally very caring. She is the main reason I have stayed with this office. Yes, the waits are long, but where in Vegas are you going to find a pediatrician without a long wait? I would like to know of one. And if they do not have a wait. WHY? Do they spend 5 seconds with your child? I have been to this office and sat in a room with my wheezing child that had RSV for 3 hours to do back to back breathing treatments because they did not want to release him cause he was doing so bad. Yea, I took a room but there are times I have waited 1.5 hours to see the doctor for a well visit. I have had a pretty descent time with the nurses. They have all been very pleasant to us. 

The front desk on the other hand... Well I have had some issues. They referred me to a HORRIBLE ENT doctor to have a consult for a tongue tie issue. I was with a 2 week year old baby with a horrible ENT that did not even do tongue tie procedures and pretty much laughed at me. I immediately advised the front desk and they said they would not refer him anymore.  I eventually got referred to a pediatric dentist in Summerlin by a friend who did a fantastic job. The problem is that I did not get it done until 3 weeks later and it severely effected breast feeding. Also, I did not feel Dr. B supported breastfeeding. I asked him multiple times for advise and he referred me to a lactation consultant. I get he is a man, but he is a pediatrician and should be able to give SOME advise. Another front desk issue, I had to pay for my visit out of pocket at the 1st of the year because I had an insurance change. When I went back in for a follow up, I asked them if they could re bill the insurance as the issue was fixed with it and they  gave me a number for billing. Annoying that it could not just be done. It does not sound that hard. 

For now, I will continue to go, but may switch soon as my soon as a bad breathing issues which I may need a specialist or someone with more experience on the issue. Overall, as I said before, Dr. Wood rocks and see her if you can.",2017-01-24 05:24:40

I was immediately intrigued to try this place out, since it would be great to have a place to go to when you haven't made reservation at Guru Lukshmi but you are craving for an authentic dosa's really bad.
Located in Brampton (surprise, surprise) in a plaza, not very noticeable.
We luckily got one of the last tables available in the pretty small restaurant, which probably fits around 10 tables. The servers were very friendly, which was the first thing I noticed.
Since my brother is vegan, I was happy to see that they serve a combo consisting of medu vada and dhai idli, but this combo was pretty deceiving, or maybe I just read it wrong because what came was a medu vada and idli both soaked in yogurt, rather than a dhai idli and a separate medu vada. The dhai idli wasn't very good because it was literally a tiny idli drowned in a huge (gigantic, rather) bowl of watery and flavourless yogurt. 
For mains I got the mysore masala dosa and my brother got the chilli garlic dosa.
I liked that they didn't serve the food within a minute, which is what Guru Luksmi usually does. The dosa's arrived in around 7-10 minutes. I asked for no oil on my dosa, since that was an option, however oil was clearly used. Furthermore, my dosa was pretty bland. I couldn't taste any mysore paste and the masala lacked flavour. I did enjoy their sambar, though! the chilli garlic dosa seemed to be fine, since I didn't hear any complaints.
while we were eating a waiting queue had formed, which showed that this place is doing really well. 
One thing I did appreciate was that when another customer asked to sit at our table while waiting for his own table, the sever kindly gave him a seat somewhere on the side and explained that we should get our privacy when eating.

Sauces are cheap, kraft-style. And yes, obviously there are those biscuits - sickeningly unhealthy, and of widely variable quality. May I suggest not to try their cocktails - those are really bad.

Service is professional and reasonably fast, they all smile and sort of engage in a friendly conversation, but that's fake - try to talk to the same server just a week later, he won't even remember you. Surprise! :-)

After seeing a post about crème brûlée crepes going around Facebook, I found out that we have one here in Las Vegas only a five minute drive from my house! I definitely had to go there.

The cafe has a very cute ambience to it. The service was also on point. I got a crème brûlée crepe and an infused fruit tea. The crepe was delicious! I devoured it in seconds. It was everything you love about crème brûlée plus more a.k.a. the crepe side haha. The infused fruit tea was also very good. It was the perfect refreshing drink for this hot day. 

I highly recommend this place for a tasty dessert! I'm in love with the crème brûlée crepe so make sure you try that one. I'm excited to try the other ones too.",2018-06-08 00:36:52

pEDR_QXlADfsSmIYyxPvzg,6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,aqMfCbFNeWn1a4Evds83fg,2,6,2,2,"I sat on this review overnight, and the more I think about it, the more I am bummed out about my visit last night.  

I had heard mostly good things of this place, and had wanted to try it out for quite some time. The main draw was the Dutch crunch bread.  You never see that type of bread outside of Northern CA for the most part.  My buddy Sean has a joint up in South San Francisco (Darby Dan's) that he took me to a couple of times, and I fell in love with the Dutch crunch bread.  Not sure why its not used more often!  Anyways.... My friends from Northern CA always hyped Ike's and you would swear that it was the greatest sandwich of all time.  Um, about that........

I drove down to Tempe (Was going to a concert at Yucca Tap Room later that night) and decided to stop into Ike's.  I was kind of unfamiliar with the area, so I drove around the block once and finally found parking (underground garage, $1.00 for each 20 minutes).  I walked upstairs from the garage and the entrance to Ike's was right there.  I walked in and right away, I noticed a familiar face.  It was Ike himself!  He was chatting it up with a guy for a good 5 minutes.  

I stood there and looked at the menu for a bit.  It's a tad overwhelming!  The cashier was friendly enough and pointed me to a list on the wall of their ""Top 10 sandwiches"".  My buddy had told me to get the Menage a Trois (Halal bbq chicken type sandwich), but I wasn't in the mood for shredded chicken.  I finally decided on the ""Pat Tillman"" on Dutch crunch bread.  I placed my order, got a cup for water, and sat down.  It took awhile for my sandwich to come out.  Once it did arrive, here is how it was...............

The Pat Tillman-  This sandwich consisted of roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.  Sounded pretty damn good, and I figured that for my first time here, go with an Arizona original (RIP Pat Tillman!).  I added lettuce and tomato to the sandwich but skipped any kind of ""sauce"" (I had seen pictures of their sandwiches and they are drenched in sauce...I knew I wouldn't like it with that much goop on it, so I got it without).  I unwrapped my sandwich and the first thing I noticed was that it was a tad skimp.  It may have been 10 inches long, but it was not ""fat"".  For $10.80 after tax, I wanted something a little bit larger.  I took a bite and it tasted alright.  The Dutch crunch bread was fantastic.  That was by far and away the best part of the sandwich!  Crispy and crunchy on top, soft in the middle.  Really great bread!  The inner guts of the sandwich were skimp though!  It had maybe 4 ounces of roast beef, 3 mozzarella sticks, and a tiny amount of mushrooms.  The lettuce and tomato filled it up a little bit, but they key ingredients were definitely lacking!  Totally not worth almost $11.00!  I wasn't even that hungry and I finished the sandwich with ease.  After I was done, I was on my way.  About that...............

One of the reasons that I was not that impressed was the lack of caring.  The cashier was friendly enough, but was still kind of monotone and not too upbeat.  Seemed like he was just going through the motions.  It also kind of turned me off that Ike didn't say anything to anybody in the place.  He was sitting at a table on his laptop doing some work, but still....he could have stood up and walked over to the 4 of us eating in the restaurant and asked how our sandwich was, or at least said hello, or thank you for coming in or ""hope to see you soon"" or whatever.  When I was done with my sandwich, I walked up to the cashier to throw away my wrapper, walked right past Ike, and made it to the door without either one of them saying anything.  I know that may seem trivial to some, and it may sound like I'm complaining over some petty shit, but it still would have made my experience way better if I felt ""valued"".  Hell...they are probably printing money at this joint, and don't have to do a damn thing to retain customers (Thank you Arizona State and young college students!), but I sure do like to go to businesses that actually care that you are there.  

I don't think I am ever coming back.  It's too far away from my house, the sandwich was decent, but not ""good"", and the price of it was way too high for what you get!  I'm glad I tried it, but even if I lived close by, I couldn't justify returning because of the price and lack of main ingredients. Not bad enough for a 1 star review, but definitely a 2 star ""Meh, I've experienced better"".  Much, much better.........",2016-11-06 22:44:55

It was in the same giant off-strip strip mall as Lotus, and once we parked, it was this place or karaoke, and we did not have time for that.

The place was fun in a mildly desolate way. I've been to Vegas many times, but like most Angelenos don't venture off strip too often. Cue Club felt both more breathable and more depressing than manic neon Vegas, with lighting that was somehow both too dim and too bright. It was all very comfortably functional, a giant pool hall with old paint and old fixtures and a fuss-free bar.

I had a bottle of beer, Sierra Nevada or something equivalent. I was grateful for it, and for the space to pause a bit before dinner. I can't comment on the pool part, which seems pretty important, but I'm sure it's as useful and available as the rest of the place.",2017-01-12 06:18:05

She was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. She first walked me through my account and went over all the choices. I went buying the phone outright vs finance. I was considering the Samsung s 8 plus but asked for some other phones I could compare. She suggested the LG vg20. I tried both asked lots of questions, she answered them all and gave honest answers.  After chatting more with her and the wife I chose the lg.

On fight night though get here at least 45min early as the place gets packed and even though they have tons of tv's the layout isn't the best for a huge crowd.

I have to say as far as bar food goes this place is up near the top with the chicken parm melt being something that I actually will have a craving for once in awhile. The only food that isn't up to par is the Queso as it is just nacho cheese with chopped tomato and jalepeno. 

As for drinks I have never really had a problem with anything the one time my buddy and i did get one slightly weak we walked up to Eva the bartender and asked for it stiffer-MISTAKE- but in the best way possible as she loaded up the captain in our captain and cokes and did so till i had to ask her to stop so that I could get over my sea legs.

The food is super inexpensive, and everything was not only delicious, but super authentic!!

The portions are not enormous, so we were able to try all of this and finish most of it without needing to be wheeled out.

This is hands down the best felafel we've had - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, full of flavor but not at all greasy.  The hummus has wonderful texture and taste (I'm picky about hummus), the pita bread is fresh and soft, the olives are flavorful (not too dry or too oily, multicolored), and the tabouli salad is some of the best I've had (chopped perfectly with a little couscous and flavors - delish). 

The little cafe is super low-key and has cute murals on the walls, and the service is friendly and quick.  After lunch, we picked up some locally baked lavosh bread and some chocolate bars, and out total, uncluding lunch, was still just under $20!

All joyous emotions. I felt none of that during this experience. This was just flat out horrible on many levels. 

I avoided the dreaded $10 parking fee that others encountered. When I went with a buddy of mine Sunday night it was pretty dead. Guess the bad word of mouth had made it thru by then. 

The staff was just so blah. No excitement or enthusiasm of any kind. But I will say that it was at night so maybe they are just tired from repeating the same stuff over and over.

The ""interactive"" stuff isn't much. It felt very cheap and that they were thinking. Let's just slap the name Marvel on it and people will love it. The Spider-man wall climb was just a regular rock climbing wall that moved. Would it have killed them to make a rock climbing wall that looked like the side of a high rise building? Or something like a magnet or velcro suit that let's u stick to walls? Dome 1 mostly consisted of monitors that had the origins of the characters which were all covered many times before in Marvel movies and cartoons. And the noise level of the dome drowned out the sound of the televisions, so you couldn't hear anything anyways. The ""museum"" was a joke. I was thinking it was a hall of Marvel history with props from some of the actual movies. All the props looked like plastic toys you could get a any toy store. Most of the games didn't work right. The holo simulator was ok, but it felt cheap. As far as computer animation has come along the graphics for the heroes in dome 1 was very lackluster. 

The Quinjet that was advertised so much as a life size one that you wouldn't believe it was all one piece. Was just pretty much a wing. There was no cockpit or seats or anything like that. Just more monitors telling you about the origins of the villains.

They took away our initial bracelets when we reached Dome 2 and I for one have no idea why they gave them to us to begin with. Cause they told us when we first walked in that those bracelets they gave us didn't work. It just made no sense at all. The 3d movie was cool but it ends right when it starts getting good with no conclusion and the staff ushers you right into the next room. The 4d ride was fun for what it was. But again without those bracelets working the part where they want you to interact falls flat. 

The gift shop was full of overpriced items and not many things to choose from.  It consisted of a certain amount of items just spaced out in different parts of the gift shop. 

All in all for $37 its a major ripoff. I would feel like a straight idiot if I paid for the VIP package. The games are the same type of games you would find in a Peter Piper. You would think they would have people dressed up in character costumes walking around the place for photo ops. And it basically focus on The Avengers. If its a true Marvel experience where were all the hundreds of characters that they have in their library?
 
If your a 5 year old kid. This place is a blast. I got excited when I first pulled up to the place and I saw those huge domes all glowing and the music blaring. But if your a true Marvel fan thinking your going to go into the mecca of the world of Marvel universe. You'll come out very very VERY disappointed.",2014-12-29 18:36:06

At the same time the decor and the initial impression was like walking into a bar as good as any as one might find in New York City, this place has cool atmosphere in spades and just for that it is worth a visit.

I was going to to the opera (for the first time, yep, an opera virgin, who would have thought!) with some friends so we picked this place to eat at first. I had ridden the light rail from Tempe and you get off the stop at Washington and Central and literally, you are right there, so this place is extremely light rail friendly. You go to the building on the corner of Jefferson and Central and up to the 2nd floor, turn to your right and you are there! The opening leads into a long bar and the best part of this place, which is the cocktails. They must have a cocktail ice machine because the ice cubes are huge and perfect for drinks like the old fashioned as they keep the liquor cold but don't water down the drink and the old fashioned, I got it for the happy hour price of $6 and that is great deal. They have a whole book of cocktails and I haven't seen anything like this since I was in San Francisco earlier this year, which is sort of a cocktail renaissance mecca.  From what I saw Blue Hound can hold its own. If you just want to come for cocktails - 5 starts

Dinner, well, they seem to be trying but needs some work. It was noted that we needed to get the opera by 7:30 but the waiter seemed a bit aimless at times relative to keeping us on schedule and one of my dining companions was quite concerned that we would not have time to finis the meal. Luckily, there was a wonderful young lady who checked on us, and got our orders taken so that helped keep things running smoothly. For an appetizer, we had the duck confit flat-bread which came out wonderful hot and topped with arugula and green apple diced through a mandolin, it was delicious though two of my dining companions felt it needed more confit. 

We then did a salad and vegetable and i had a small dish of roasted cauliflower with pistachios, capers, and brown butter, and I thought it was quite good though I would have liked the cauliflower a little more roasted but nice - at this point, a solid 4 stars. 

As for the meals, three of us ordered the Kentucky fried quail and while it was okay, it did not come hot, the fried quail was room temperature, the gravy was not all that warm and the cornbread, almost cold and it was little bland. It was the blah part of my meal. Another person had scallops and though large and cooked perfectly she noted they needed some sort of sauce, also a bland dish. Finally, one person got the Kobe bone in rib, the half order, with the blue cheese grits, now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter, and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five (mixed group, men and women), was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers (and they have a good list of starters) then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot.

Oh, one final point, I could not figure out how to work  the salt and pepper shakers, the waiters might want to point out how those work. Bottom line, I probably won't go back for a full meal here but I will come back in a heartbeat for the wonderful cocktail and drink selection and the small plates, which may be the way to go. In my mind, this is about the closest  thing to a cool cocktail bar, like you might find in New York or San Francisco, that one is going to find and the location off of the light rail and big events in downtown Phoenix can't be beat and yes, I'm already looking forward to my next old fashioned at the bar!",2012-11-18 17:14:12

The size of the place is appropriate for the size of a café (i don't think a huge crew would fit there lol).

Quality: for my meal I started out with the soup, then had the risotto with chicken, and ended with the crème brule. The soup was warm and delicious, the risotto was spicy with a lot of chunks of chicken, and the crème brulee was a satisfying finish. To add a little more regarding the risotto, when I said spicy it wasn't meant as a con but rather it provided a different taste altogether. It was my first time trying risotto spicy and for me it was a surprise but still I enjoyed it. Portion wise, I'm pretty sure I got the bang for my buck (if not a lil more) for this meal. 

Service: Our servers were friendly, accommodating, and the food didn't take too long to make. Our waitress was informational with regards to the menu and it helped with my choices.

Best in Vegas?  Yes.  Authentic?  It's a small Korean chain and it's first location in the US.

The  ambiance, service, and experience comes straight out of a K-Drama.  In other words, friendly and prettied up.  All good things.   As for the food, limited selection but what is offered is done right.  Quality cuts of tasty, marinated meats.  Zero complaints unless you're a meat snob.

Tip:  Order sets (2 or 4 persons) for the best experience.  Portions are large.

For starters, the beef and honey (yes honey) tartare, a giant raw meatball, is surprisingly good.  soy, ginger, garlic, honey bring out the metallic flavor of the raw beef.  Good eats that would be outstanding grilled and put in a bun.

The beef, all USDA Choice Black Angus breed.  The two house specials; tender, flavorful marinated skirt steak and beefy ""aged"" short rib top the list.  Boneless short rib is tender and flavorful.  

Pork is excellent.  The tender, porky jowls and even more intensely flavorful neck good eats, while the very fatty pork belly with its crispy fat and burnt bits, a pork lovers dream.  Finally, the spicy pork, not too spicy but loads of chili and caramelized honey sweetness.  Very good.

Standard banchan.  Standard KBBQ sides including veggies for grilling, steamed egg and the obligatory melted cheese (I never understood this but to each his own).

Servers do the cooking for you over charcoal grills that are changed regularly.  Thicker proteins are grilled whole to preserve their juiciness and scissors cut for service.  Very good ventilation system so you won't leave smelling too much like KBBQ.  Disposable toothbrushes provided in the restroom so no chance of garlic breath.

Very limited selection of beer, sake, soju.  Decent enough to wash everything down.

In a word, solid.",2016-06-07 16:39:53

That Wicked Wedge is terrible crap and most chains in this province produce equally disgusting pies. We ought to have some sort of pizza-showdown here, where the best slice is determined by a panel of judges who understand what makes pizza good in the first place.

There was granola on the bottom and acai puree mix, then more granola and cut up fresh fruit on top. The fruit was a mix of bananas, strawberries, blueberries and coconut flakes on top.

I love how this Longo's has a civilized parking lot (has one way signs to keep the traffic flowing in front of the store), and civilized customers. Never have I had to give someone the stink eye or call them a friendly name under my breath. That is right people - no pushy cart people wanting to run you down. Plus, the staff here - hello - they rock! I have had the cart chaser staff come and take my cart from me after I loaded up my car.

Had Christmas come early for Shari?! Oh yes it had!! Decisions, decisions, decisions. As much as I wanted to knock a few to the ground and roll around in my own apple land (yes there would be oompa loompas there to sing and dance), I held my composure and decided on purchasing some honey crisp apples. What made me decide? Honestly, they all looked good, but the princess in me liked them the best because they were the shiniest. I know - how a true foodie should shop. 

Longo's has the best selection of fruits and vegs for a regular grocery store. If you want better produce - go to St. Lawrence Market or Whole Foods. If you need to buy shit-tickets, milk and fruit - this is your place. 

Another thing that I love about Longo's is their trays you can order. A couple of month's ago I ordered a huge fruit tray for a bridal shower. It was such a hit at the party.  When I picked it up from Longo's...oh yes....there was an offer to help me carry it to my car! I was surprised and thrilled by the offer, but I was good to carry the fruit solo. 

I think this will be a review that I update regularly...I do love this store!

We got the fried seafood, grilled calamari and two orders off the special's menu - both of them mussels. I personally only like mussels in a red sauce, so I asked our server what the italian description meant and if it would be served with a red sauce. He ensured that yes, it would be served with a red sauce, but 10 minutes later, another server brought out our dishes and the mussels were in a white sauce! 

I did speak to the waiter, who re-read the menu and said, ah it comes in a spicy sauce. Well, the sauce was spicy, which was the saving grace and essentially was what kept it's 5-star rating. However, I did urge that if he wasn't 100% sure, he should double check next time. He seemed nice about the error. 

For our mains we got the calabrese picante pizza, veal stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto, veal marsala and another special - venison with a blueberry, wine sauce. Everything was excellent. 
-My pizza was cooked in a wood-burning oven, and it was crispy, gooey and spicy. 
-The stuffed veal was a huge portion, and was so tender, gooey with cheese, salty and yummy.
-The veal marsala was also a large piece with great mashed potatoes.

Well, there don't seem to have such options and I ended up getting a sad meat plate with the equivalent of the meat for 3 tacos (no tortilla). Shredded beef because carne asada was not included in the Taco Tuesday special (which seems to be very popular, long lines during our meal, mainly to go, I think). So I was told because of the Taco Tuesday special it was going to be $6 plus tax for 3 very small portions of meat, of what otherwise would have been $9 plus tax for the same 3 small portions of meat (3 meat sides). I was going to add sour cream ($1) and guacamole ($2), but when I saw the portions I decided to not go for it. I just went home and had an additional 4 oz of steak : )

Located at west end of mostly empty, run-down shopping strip off W. Glendale, the interior was was decently appointed and public areas (and the men's room) spotlessly clean.  

Nothing we had gave any impression of dollar store sauces or inferior quality in any respect.  As to ""If it's so good why it remains empty?"" asked by another reviewer, well, it is in a poor location in a decrepit shopping strip that is otherwise nearly closed down.  Maybe too many people had an experience closer to yours than ours, but based on food, service, and prices - that would be a mystery to me as my dining partner Norm and I thought it definitely deserves more business than it has.
   
Generous lunch for 2 that we were both well satisfied with in every respect, $34, and still with enough leftovers for an additional meal - possibly two.  Lunch menu prices start at around $7 but I (we?) ordered off dinner menu for larger portions - 'cause I THOUGHT I was too hungry for smaller lunch portions.  So glad we gave this place a chance despite a couple of wicked bad reviews.   I would go back and would recommend to friends without hesitation as our experience was very different from theirs.",2011-07-18 01:19:00

If you frequent this mall you know that there's stiff competition for Chinese and Taiwanese food here, but this place manages to survive while others fail.  Why?  They offer juicy thick cuts of meat, freshly made, and sides that are inspired and made with care.  It's that simple.

Other food court chains tend to take shortcuts with either the meat, veggies, rice, or all 3 and they only compete on price, but you can taste the difference in quality here.  I got a seat at one of the two tables there, and in my 15 minute meal noticed a huge line of people come and go with their takeout boxes.

I've been in the cool of winter and in the heat of summer,

Shop and shop till you drop.
It does take a while to meander around all of the booths and displays.
There is a lot of stuff you don't want, but every once in a while you find that little treasure you can't do without.
The prices are great.
I do not buy a belt anywhere else after paying $3.00 for my last three or four.
I saw a set of glasses at the swap meet by the Rose Bowl in Pasadena that the vendor wanted $90.00 for the whole set.
The next week I saw most of the same set at Broadacres and the vendor wanted $6.00 for them - but that is the way it is at a swap meet isn't it.
They have some great food and drink booths. Vendors drive by on carts with drinks throughout the day.
It is just an enjoyable experience.....
and you might find that one little nick nack you have always been wanting.

As others have noted, the space itself is incredible, and well worth spending some time just looking around. There are some articles online that talk about the whole backstory of many of the items you can see and it's fun & interesting to read up before you go. Would have liked to see more victorian and less laboratory, but that's just personal taste. 

Everything here is incredibly artisanal. I'm sure you could get something normal, but why? From the cocktails (Smoked Whiskey & Cola, Jazz Hands, Catch 22), to the appetizers (we started with a mezze platter) to the small plates, everything was incredibly rich, incredibly well presented, incredibly delicious. Although meant for sharing, we each ended up ordering what we wanted, and although it wouldn't be enough for someone really hungry, the shared appetizer + small plate left us all stuffed. 

The service also rates a mention. This place is new, and our server was well-intentioned, but not well-trained. However, the overall service was very good. Attentive enough that they kept the water glasses filled, the drinks replenished and empty dishes removed, but not so attentive that you couldn't hold a conversation without interruption. I'm sure that as they get more experience, it will only get better. 

The one discordant note was the Top 10 music playing...surely there must be better music that could add to the theme experience?

Overall, well worth returning to, again and again, especially if they continue to improve.",2013-07-12 06:17:30

The presentation was very good, and I appreciated the ketchup and ranch being placed in separate containers. The care and attentiveness of the staff was great as well, both on the phone and in person. But, the place is difficult to get into and out of in that strip mall, and there was hardly anyone at their place. The burger wasn't as amazing as I'd been lead to believe, the patty had no flavor, the guac and ranch/onions did add an interesting flavor but not enough to hide the flavorless patty, which I guess I could understand if you don't want too much coming at you, just different tastes I guess. The fries just plain sucked, I wished I'd substituted to quinoa. Not bad if you're in the area and don't want burger chain, maybe trying one of the other burgers will be better??",2016-06-09 03:15:29

The roasted red pepper pesto turkey club, by the time it made its appearance out of the microwave, the deli meat had a mixture of plastic and freezer burn taste with a leathery texture.

It started when they forgot about us for 45 minutes.  We were wondering why our food was taking so long, when our waitress popped over to tell us that ""the printer hadn't printed"" our order, so we had fallen behind.  I am not sure whether that was the truth or not, but when one of our party (half-jokingly) asked if they were going to adjust our bill, she made some snide little joke about all she could do was keep our water glasses filled.  And guess what--she didn't even do that!

When the food finally came, it was pretty bland, and the portions were very small for the price they charge.  I didn't want to pig out, but I left hungry. 

Other small annoyances: 
-the hostess who sat us was quite rude, at one point informing us that we needed to move because we were ""in the way.""  Ok, that's reasonable, but that's not how you talk to a customer.  You ask nicely or at least say excuse me.  
-The board listing their specials was a night old, so we tried to order things that weren't available.  The waitress looked at us like we were stupid before we pointed out their mistake.
-It's loud.  Almost too loud for a bar, and definitely too loud for a restaurant where, you know, you might want to be able to talk with your companions.

It is not often that you find that a business take the time to review their Yelp reviews and follow up with their customers based on their comments. When they do, you definitely appreciate the effort. JJ Lux Spa has once again won me over. They have taken comments from customers to heart and have made all the right choices in the changes that they have implemented.

Brennan, who I have learned has been put in charge of the store, seemed completely tuned into what kind of massage I needed today. I walked in wanting to relax and to relieve back pain and walked out with my body feeling like Jello and completely at peace.

Brennan is magical in his ability to find and erase the pain from severe injuries. He seems able to genuinely understand each person's individual needs and knows exactly what to do. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire 90 minute massage and didn't want it to end.

I was so impressed with the new feel that I signed up for the yearly membership that offers great discounts. As a seasoned Groupon-er, this was a no-brainer - ask them about the deal.

Knowing that Brennan is now in charge of hiring qualified therapists, I can honestly say that I no longer have any concerns about any of the masseurs at JJ Lux Spa. I trust that he can find the right therapist for you. Give them a chance!",2012-03-25 03:09:09

I remember coming here a few times with friends a couple years ago and I had a lovely experience. However, I believe they have now changed owners and staff as I did not recognize anyone when I came here yesterday.

To be honest, after 5 minutes of sitting down, I was not 'wowed' and not happy with the service at this pub.

What bugged me:

I walked in with my boyfriend who were happily watching the blue jays game against the Yankees ( blues were kicking the Yankees ass by the way). Out of nowhere an Asian guy comes and changes the channel because him and his 'boys' want to watch the UFC fight. 

I myself, has worked in a pub and restaurants before, it would be nice if they asked if it was okay. You see other guests enjoying what is on the television, why not ask or let them know you will be changing the channel and that it might be better to move to another table or seat at the bar. 

That's the second thing I had an issue with. The girl who was the bartender yesterday night said i'll clean up the table for you if you want to sit there to view the jays game. uhh shouldn't you be bussing all your tables when they leave so you that you do not leave the pub looking like a mess? Perhaps I wanted to sit at the table that was dirty but didn't because you didn't clean up the tables. And the worst part, was she was making it seem like she was doing ME a favour. Honey, you're not doing me a favour, you're doing yourself, your boss and the pub.

I'm very disappointed with the service here, seems like the boss just wants to drink and get drunk with his buddies which is cool. But at least make sure service is great and that your new guests are happy. 

I don't think I'll be coming back here.",2013-08-29 13:28:22

The food and drinks are actually great and reasonably priced. Other cafes charge a cover by hour on weekends and a flat rate on weekdays. Why not spend your money here on food and drinks if you are going to order at the other places.

They have a wide variety of board games including retro video games. If you wanna go to an escape room place, the place also has 4 rooms to choose from.

I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.

Hunnie Bunnie got her Edamame and Japanese Udon Noodles which she enjoyed.
This is what I ordered:

Baked Green Mussels - these were really good, whatever sauce/toppings they put on I really liked and they were served nice and warm.

Calamari rings - crispy breading and served with a spicy dipping sauce. Not bad at all.

Soft Shell Crab - small soft shell crab, split right in half. Good stuff. I love sscrab!

Lettuce Wraps - they were out of this item!!! I really wanted to try these cuz it involved pork belly :-( Next time!!

Tuna Poki Salad - this was aiight. I've definitely had better. It's some kind of different sauce they put on and I think the spiciness of the sauce overwhelms the flava

Screaming Orgasm - not enough sashimi but lots of daikon

Yellowtail Jalapeno - they put sriracha on the jalapenos. I usually LOVE sriracha but i didnt care for it on this dish. And i wasnt really a fan of the sauce they used for this sashimi plate.

Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna Nigiri - SO good! This fish tates SOOO fresh and melt in your mouth! Nicr size cut of fish and a small serving of rice accompanies it. REALLY REALLY GOOD! I had given up on AUCE sushi because the fish just didnt taste that good to me anymore but this place changed my mind! 

Scallop: It's mixed with something, crab mix maybe, and not tasty at all.

Sweet Shrimp - I actually only ordered this so I could eat the fried shrimp heads. Nom. And to think I never ate them before... The shrimp itself wasnt very good but the heads were tasty!

Kwan offers a lunch special menu with prices ranging from $3 to $8 per item. I ordered shrimp/pork Siu Mai dim sum along with Shanghai style pork dumplings. Both varieties of dumplings were super juicy with lots of broth inside. Honestly, I have absolutely no complaints about their dim sum. They're as good as it gets. My only disappointment was their mango layered sponge cake. I had no idea it was going to be served steamed. A steamed piece of cake is the most weird thing ever. The texture and taste was pretty bad. I didn't even finish the cake. Time and time again, I get disappointed with pastries at Chinese restaurants. Then again, my reference point is French bakeries that know a thing or two about good cakes.

Bottom line: if you're craving dim sum there's not better place around Yonge/St Clair for some juicy dumplings and a whole bunch of other varieties of Chinese food.

My only little gripe is with waiters. I get it, it's hard work trying to please all kinds of customers in a fast paced environment, but I would suggest they take some etiquette classes on how to be more attentive and courteous waiters.

Kneaders is very much like those other chain companies that advertise lots & lots of fresh baked in-house breads and baked treats.  Kneaders has it in spades!  I assume it's busy because it is basically one of the only bakery/restaurant types in that area of town.

But actually it's not a bad place to visit!  Upon stepping in you get hit with that scent of fresh baked goods and boy can it be totally inviting.  Step right in...get your daily dose of gluten!

Before this review, I'd say we have gone to Kneaders at least 3 times.  A couple times at night and once in the wee of the morning.  I gotta say I don't mind the food at all.  Very rustic charm, very old-timey country American.  Kneaders is known for their sandwiches, breads, and pastries.  They also do soups and salads and even pies too.

On our first visit there we had:

-Club Sandwich ($8.39) - turkey, roast beef, ham, Kneaders sauce (similar to 1000 island), provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, salt & pepper, all on French Country Sourdough

-French Dip ($6.99) - roast beef, Swiss cheese, salt & pepper, au jus on the side, served on a baguette

Damn, they make some mighty fine sandwiches!  Wifey's club was a good side and loaded with meat.  Bread was baked relatively fresh, good crust on the outside with a nice tangy taste from the sourdough.  French Dip for me was great!  I love me a French Dip!  This one sure didn't disappoint!  Au jus wasn't too salty, baguette was crunchy and hearty but not stale.  Quite surprised, a decent sandwich from a chain!

With the sandwiches you can also combo up and add a small dessert/pastry, chips and a drink for an extra $4 or so.  

Don't forget the breakfast!  Upon a return visit the little one got the all-you-can-eat French Toast or Sourdough Pancakes for just $6 and change.  She liked their thick slices of French Toast!  Comes with a side of strawberries, whipped cream & caramel syrup.  Beware though, you can only choose French Toast OR Sourdough Pancakes.  When you refill, you can only get the same item you first ordered.  Which seems kinda silly to me but I guess that's just how they do it at Kneaders.  Same set price...why not let us try BOTH?

They also do something I've never seen in a restaurant before, build a basket?  Yep!  Have one of the staff create you a gift basket to take home while you wait or while you eat!  Full of fresh baked breads and pastries!  They really have all the boxes/ribbon/wrap all right there in store.  Strange, but I guess it works!

Only downgrade I have is that it can get a bit pricey dining at Kneaders.  I guess it would be on par with that of a deli joint.  No value meals here, but I suppose you do get value for your money regardless.  Just be careful, wifey's sandwich combo alone set us back more than $12!  To make up for it, grab an extra helping of some of Kneader's samples up at the checkout counter!

RhyeRzETlGdpPrHFRMJ18A,57tf_RmT5o3BiFj2gpV-Jg,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,4,1,1,1,"This review is for take out. I walked in on a sunny day shortly after tako had opened and was able to place an order seamlessly. I thought I would be the first one of the day but there were already a few people ahead of me who had the same idea! 

After placing my order, I waited in the entryway for a few minutes. It was nice to have the kitchen at work in front of me - I felt like I was at the aquarium or zoo watching behind a glass. Ha! 

I transported my bag of goods home and everything was packaged nicely and unharmed. I had ordered the tako and the chips and salsa (the taco was in a cardboard box, the chips in a paper bag and the salsa in circular plastic containers - all of which are in a paper bag so thumbs up to the packaging materials). I love octopus but have never had it in the form of a taco and given the name of the place I figure I might as well try though it was a tough decision. 

The tako was deliciously different - the octopus was probably the meatiest I've ever had in any type of food which was a delightful surprise, the fried beans gave a nice crunch and the person who built the taco you could tell was an expert - they weren't overfilled or too sparse with ingredients, and everything held together perfectly with the right amount of sauce. As for the chips and salsa I thought they were just ok. Just like eating in I received a trio of their salsas and each container was labeled which was a nice touch. The verde salsa was by far my favorite; the other two red salsas were watery so didn't taste like anything but bland mush, particularly the one that is suppose to be spicy which was unfortunate.

However the staff was so friendly and given the overall positive experience, taking out provides a great alternative to when getting a reservation at tako is not possible (and I've tried to make reservations on multiple occasions)! I think one of the major downsides though is finding and paying for parking in Downtown near tako. Also as others have expressed it is not a cheap meal, mine was ~$27.",2016-03-16 23:36:17

The Tomahawk Ribeye just an amazing cut of cow and the presentation just sells itself. If you've never seen it browse the pictures and it'll catch your eye, just remember TOMAHAWK ribeye...

I choose to have mine done Oscar Style which was explained to me by our super awesome bartender Gustav. Oscar Style tops the hunk of dead cow flesh expertly cooked with some asparagus, crab meat (Crab with a C not Krab with a K) and they drizzed Hollandaise sauce all over. Simply amazing.

From start to finish the steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and...perfect it was just damn near perfect. Remember that one scene in the first Matrix where Cypher was doing his dirty deal with the Agent and he was eating the steak? That kind of reaction but from the steak not the thought of betraying all your friends to get plugged back into a battery.

From start to finish the entire dining experience at Brand has been nothing but super amazing. Gustav knows his cocktails and he will sell you on the menu. He doesn't just know the menu he believes in it as well as can recommend wild and crazy hacks on certain dishes to improve the dish. When the steaks came off Gustav grabbed another plate and poured the two offered sauces on to the plate so we can try it and in the middle was a mix of both sauces. Didnt even cross my mind to mix the two sauces but man it was a great idea.

An amazing place. Highly recommended and locals get 20% off. So what are you waiting for? GO NOW!",2012-10-04 06:36:18

I have jumped twice in my life.  Both times were at Skydive Las Vegas.  So I don't have a comparison company to confirm my initial statement.  I can tell you that I fully trust Skydive Las Vegas.  I am a fan of them.  I drive out to their facility just to watch people jump.  It is $200 for there 3 mile jump (15,000 feet above sea level, 13,000 feet above the local terra firma).  That seems to be a standard fee for similar jumps elsewhere across the United States.  I have done my research as I plan for jumps in other areas.  

My first jump was in January af 2008.  It was beautiful weather.  Clear and cold.  I had a smooth ridde up and an exciting ride down.  I loved it.  I opted for the DVD and photo package as I had a coupon for it.  I am quite glad I did get it.  I had so much fun I had to go back for a second jump.  

Fast forward to May of 2008.  On a whim I deceided to go for my second dive on Memorial Day.  This one did not go so well.  The staff was still great as they had been on my first jump.  The weather, however, was not great.  The ride up was rough.  It was hot on the ground and cold in the air.  This caused a massive brain freeze when the door opened.  So now I was nauseous from the ride and I had a killer headache.  Then the instructor showed me how to spin.  By this time I was just ready to be on the ground.  When the chute deployed I was offered a chance to pull the toggles a bit.  I wanted to but I just did not have it in me.  We landed, I thanked the man, I drove home.  I still had fun but it took a toll on me.  

I have not jumped since though I would love to again.  I recommend to anybody to jump in the winter.  The ride up is so much more pleasent.  Regardless of when you consider jumping, stop considering and just do it.  You wont be disappointed.",2012-03-22 23:07:47

The food used to be really special and well made dim sum.  Now, it is average at best and maybe even below average for some dishes (especially the desserts).

The decor is still not bad, but you can see so much wear and tear in the plates, cups etc (lots of chips and dents).

The service is probably the biggest drop.  They used to seem to pride themselves in providing a more high end experience.  Now the service is actually below par.   We ordered a fried rice dish and it was really poorly divided into bowls.  I would say at least half a bowl of rice ended up on the table. I could have done a better job blindfolded. 

One particularly annoying thing is when we paid, the waitress counted each dollar (literally down to the dollar) in front of us as if she wanted to make sure we paid or tipped enough.  Really rude.

The bartenders were very courteous and made sure to check on us regularly. The highlight for me was meeting my all time favorite NBA player, Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers.

I went with a group of 15 where we had a reservation a few weeks in advance for such a large group.  After we made our reservation, my understanding is that they later asked us to move the time up from our original 7pm to 7:45 pm since that was a less busy time for them, which I found kind of odd since they should give priority to who called first.  Since they close at 10pm and dinner with that large of a group can take while, around 9:40 they started bringing checks out even though some people's desserts hadn't arrived yet, which I also found to be unusual and kind of annoying when they did push our time up 45 min.  

The service was just ok, but decent for such a large group.  When I sat down I had no drink menu (though did have a food menu) but there was one way on the other side of a very large table.  I asked the waiter for a drink menu and he said his hands were full but that there was already one on the table---ummm way down on the other end and people were using it.  He said he'd be back with one in a bit anyway, but when he came back he had no menu so I then had to eventually get it passed all the way down the table when he finally brings more.  They did have a very nice drink list, including an impressive draft selection that I was happy about.

As for the food, it was a little pricier than I was expecting for Caribbean food so I expected it to be amazing (most entrees in the upper $20's, and appetizers also expensive--chips and salsa was like $7/8!!).  I ordered the bbq tofu cracklings for an appetizer which was tasty but way too huge, and I normally really like generous portions--it filled up a HUGE plate and was bigger than my entree so I could not even eat half of it.  I would have much rather preferred a smaller appetizer for half the price.  It was tasty but there was a bit too much bbq sauce on it and it really was just fried not so crispy tofu, not sure why they called it cracklins--I was expecting something much crispier.  For my entree I ordered the flank steak and the presentation was beautiful and the fried egg on top was a nice touch.  I asked for it cooked medium and it came out exactly as I requested.  However, although it tasted quite good and flavorful, the steak was quite chewy, which was disappointing for something that looked so lovely.  I was expecting a higher quality of meat for the price ~$26.

The atmosphere and decor are very nice and the bar seems to be the centerpiece here although there's a decent amount of table seating.  I think I'd come back for their happy hour but I felt their dinner, while good, was not really a good value for the prices.",2013-01-16 04:18:32

It was huge and filled with chicken, mushrooms, spinach and cheese. Unfortunately I couldn't try hers because I was getting over being sick and didn't want to risk spreading it. She ate it all and ordered a lemon crepe to split with hubby at home.

On the menu my panini sounded wonderful, however it was pretty lack luster. The menu states grilled chicken, rosemary olive oil, garlic spread, sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella.   It was cut into 3 triangles and in some I found very little chicken but enough cheese to cover a large pizza. Tasted the garlic but other than an orange color in the garlic and oil I could not find any sun dried tomatoes. Funny how a menu implies one thing (tomato pieces) but what you get is completely different. It was basically a hot cheese and chicken sandwich with garlic flavor. I'm from Wisconsin so I like my cheese, but not a ridiculous amount. The next day when I went to reheat the remaining triangle I picked out solidified cheese chunks.

It's upscale comfort food, I get it.. totally.  Scanning the menu reminded me of a coglameration of the Food Network shows post 9/11 to today (when comfort food took a huge resurrgence and cooking magazine subscriptions peaked after the economy tanked)... the menu is inspiring, all within gourmet reach of making at home but you come here to eat it, because they (most likely) will make it better, present it better, or you just haven't gotten around to attempting it yourself.  And so that was how I ordered, to see how does the kitchen execute the dishes for notes on how I might duplicate the deliciousness at home.

Sitting at the table next to us were young children, and it was really great to see how the staff went out of their way to be extra nice and serve little treats to them at the end of the meal.  Comfort food AND a nice homey feeling.",2010-12-24 16:32:16

We ordered a really delicious bbq chicken flatbread and a bottle of wine to keep us company while we took a stab at the trivia questions.

I have to say this is the best trivia night at any restaurant around the area that I have been to. What is great about the trivia here is that they had a mix of questions that anyone could answer (e.g Candy Slogans). I actually left trivia night not feeling like the dumbest human being in Charlotte. 

The only recommendation I would suggest is that they read off the top ten names for every round, since we spend so time marinating on a humorous name.

Definitely need to come back here again for trivia night and a delicious meal.",2014-03-23 14:15:18

Entrees were taking awhile and our server did apologize couple times, we told her not to worry about the wait as we enjoying our night and not rushing anywhere. Entrees came out. We ordered pineapple duck and Thai chili beef. We truly don't care that food took longer than expected , what we do care about is the fact after waiting for so long you gave us cold food.

Went straight ahead and placed the order for food. Ordered the duck poutine pizza and the chicken pot pie. Food arrived quickly and it came together. 

First: Duck Poutine Pizza
Immediate reaction was that there is a generous amount of fries, I wasn't complaining as it looked mouth watering. Had to use a fork to eat of some of the poutine before I dug in with my hands. The duck in combination with everything was splendid. If there's a tip I'd like to share, it would be to fold the sides of the pizza slice and to eat it like a sandwich to really get the maximum experience. This is definitely a pizza I don't mind paying the price for!

All the various options were explained in great detail and with zero pressure.

When installation day came, the team was running a bit behind from their previous installation but had the courtesy to call to give us fair warning.  You don't find this courtesy often.  The installation team knew their product and their functions and delivered excellent service over multiple days (it was a big job).   When a problem existed from the installation done during the housing construction, Progressive Home was on the ball again dispatching the same service team to resolve the problem.

They ran out of coleslaw (which came with the meal as listed on the menu) so I asked for another side or some money back and they acted really peeved and said the coleslaw was a freebie.

Soupe a l'oignon  - french onion soup.  This was a pretty bold soup, and  seemed heavier than most onion soups I have had.  But it was tasty.

L'Assiette Gourmande ""Bacchus"" - This had Imported Cheeses, Charcuterie,Lobster Salad, Mixed Olives, Apple & Quince
Served with Artisan Bread.  I liked it mostly but wouldn't order it again, and I was not crazy about the Pate.  At $21 it seemed extremely expensive for what it was.

Marinated Roasted Beet Salad - this was a very very small dish, with a few slices of beets with Trout on top.  I liked it, because it is beets after all, but I wasn't blown away with it to drop $12 on it again.

Moules Frites - oh what a disappointment this was.  I was so looking forward to eating this the most, as after eating Mon Ami Gabi's delicious mussels, I thought this would be similar.  They were like night and day as far as quality.  As someone else has mentioned in their review, they serve the mussels in a bucket which makes the broth and everything else sink to the bottom, so you don't get any of that great flavor.  Additionally, I had many closed mussels in my pail, which means they were dead and should not be eaten.  So almost half of my dish was inedible.  They could very well make a patron very sick (enough to go to the hospital) with serving dead bivalves, so I was extremely upset that this was even served to me.

Peppercorn Fillet - My husband's entree and the winner dish of the night.  Tender, good quality, nice char, and flavorful.  However it is pretty small for a $40 steak and the accompanying sides are even more miniscule.  I would expect this price at the celebrity chef restaurants on the strip, but not here.

So I can't say I had an amazing meal here, but in the last week I saw one of Alex's former chef's and Mr. Stratta himself will be working here in some capacity, so the food will be revamped:

The bakery has homemade cookie creations and they distribute Bon Breads.  Having a store with Bon in the neighborhood is great.  Since I was there after 4 PM, the bread selection was limited.  I ended up buying a package of Bon parmesan lavash.  It is excellent.  

The gentleman running the store when I was there explained that they make all their cookies at the shop and they distribute Bon Breads.  It is great to have a place in this section of Summerlin where I can get Bon any day.  I will be back to get some cookies.  I was offered a sample, but I graciously declined after having had a sample bread stick.

A note on where the store is.  It's on the side of the strip mall facing Rachel's Kitchen behind the Starbuck's outlet.  Unless you know it's there, it's very easy to miss.  It opened at the end of April and I have been to that Starbucks several times and I never saw the store until I noticed that bicycle today!  I'm glad I found it.",2012-06-20 00:52:14

We were what appeared to be the only non-regulars and I felt as if things were a little awkward because of this. The bartender almost didn't know what to do around us (or at least it seemed so) because he didn't already know us. Otherwise, the atmosphere was good and the decor was very nice. I really liked it overall. 

The winning point: the dirty martini. Everyone who knows me knows that I love dirty martinis and my favorite is the Dirty Bird at Flying Fig. I must say the dirty martini here is an extremely close second and I found myself drinking it a lot faster than I expected! The key lime martini was ok, but not really my thing, so I'm glad I was just trying someone else's drink and I didn't have to drink an entire one.

As far as food goes, we had the Tuscan brushetta, which was amazing. Obviously I like salt, because along with my cheesey olivey martini, I really enjoyed the capers, feta and kalamata olives in this dish. The bread was big and thick, which was a little different, but in a good way. When we saw someone next to us with a dessert, our chocolate cravings kicked in and we got the molten chocolate cake. This was delightful! It was almost like cookie filled with molten chocolate with pretty syrup drizzled over it and some sliced strawberries. So good! 

When I'm in the mood for a martini, I'll most likely come here because they are absolutely delicious (not to mention cheaper than Flying Fig's). The only issue is that I have a bit of a drive, but that'll just make every time I come more special!",2012-01-16 23:31:07

And let's face it, they need all the growing room they can get.  So, up went the Ricoh Coliseum in a central easy to get to location that houses some fairly decent tier-below-the-top hockey.

Found on the CNE Fairgrounds , the Ricoh Coliseum is used primarily for hockey, but has also housed some exhibits when The Ex is on during the summer.  But mainly, it's a hockey venue.  In the design of the place, the planners also made it into a concert venue which, depending upon the act, can be good or devastating.  The acoustics I find are too dependent on your position in the venue.  For Kraftwerk I was on the main floor and the sound was fantastic.  For Franz Ferdinand, I was in the furthest seat away.  The sound was echo-ey, distorted, and crap.  So take your chances.

If you're not a Leafs season ticket holder (and if you are, I'll gladly take any donations you can provide, since you're obviously really well off), this provides the next best alternative.  You are able to see some current and soon-to-be hockey stars at a price that is reasonable for a family.  Finally, an affordable hockey game.",2008-10-10 18:26:06

In my opinion, they beat Mojo's and all the other yogurt places hands down.

Also, I think they have a more ice cream-like texture but since it's yogurt, I can lie to myself that this might actually be healthier than the tub of ice cream I have sitting in the freezer. But all that aside, I give this location in particular, 1 star.

So sometimes at the Tempe location, about half the yogurt dispensers are down. Fine, it's a high traffic location, machines need some care too. Whatever, I can deal with less flavors. Sometimes the toppings aren't stocked. Sure, I don't need any more than a scoop of this and a scoop of that.  Again, not a big deal.  Most of the time, the crew has yogurt stains on their shirts.

Breakfast is without a doubt the most important meal out of any. This being said, the varieties in breakfast fare from culinary adventurous, to hip and chic, to greasy spoon leave a diversity in the class of breakfast and brunch themed resteraunts or events.

To me, it is like Best Picture overall, Foreign Language film of the year, or Best RomComnotstarringSethRoganOrBradleyCooper.

Caffe Monna is its own niche. They can really develop this into something fantastic with their real estate. They have a quaint inside, and sidewalk seating. The outside porch is magnificent. Kudos for outside spaces that make our flighty Pgh sunny days all the more wonderful.

CM has a hipsterish vibe, and there is nothing wrong with that. Their menu is succinct and their coffee mugs large. The prixe fix menu is very reasonable on price, as are most of their options. They could use a few more meat and taters options though, as potatoes, to me, are the hallmark of a good brunch.

I ordered the Elvis Crepe and my girlfriend ordered the French toast. My crepe was somewhat dull and had too much peanut butter. The simplicity that is a perfect crepe was betrayed by the lack of balance in the ingredients. A crepe with bacon, bananas and peanut butter can be made a lot more interesting. The PB should be a very delicate spread though.

From the second I saw the black BentoBurrito truck sporting asian style burritos in the parking lot of Market on Macleod, my inner hipster did its happy dance. (Which ironically, isn't a very hipster thing to do.) 

BentoBurrito takes all the food items you'd find in a Bento Box and wraps it up with a burrito shell into one big mass of love. I could be wrong about this, but I think Bento Boxes are typically a Japanese thing, but BentoBurrito uses ingredient from all over Asia and americanized sushi, serving up items like the Chiki-Rito (Coconut chicken in a peanut sate) and the Cali-rito (kind of like a California Roll but in burrito form.)

I've seen other sushi/burrito places (like Sushiritto in San Francisco http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushirrito-san-francisco?osq=sushirito) but BentoBurrito does it a a little better. Instead of using the Nori as the burrito skin, they just just use a regular flour tortilla and put Nori flakes on the inside to give you the flavour. Much easier to hold, eat, and a little closer to a burritto than mowing on a gigantic sushi roll that hasn't been chopped.

They'll fill you up with healthy and tasty ingredients for under $10. Hopefully you'll get a chance to check them out before next summer.",2014-10-07 20:52:27

It's fine to make me wait 4 hours after the time they were suposed to be here, but it's not fine to stay an extra 20 minutes to finish the job?  They scheduled 1.5 hours to install the tv mount alone.  It took 25 minutes.  And they won't use the additional hour to set up the shelves.

To top it off, the manager I was speaking to on the phone while they were here, Bernard, said that he couldn't tell me when someone will come back to finish it, and wouldn't book an appointment for it because he had potential customers in the store right then.

We went on a Friday night around 8pm. There were maybe 3 or 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant. 

Everything was going well until we were seated and started looking over the menu. Half the dishes were missing! Apparently they re-designed their menu and did not update the website.

Not that big deal, as there were a few other items on the menu we liked. WRONG!! We were immediately informed that they were sold out of the surf&turf. We ordered the trout and a sirloin sandwich, only to be informed several minutes later that they were out of the sirloin as well. 

We ended up with the vegetarian lasagna instead. 

When the appetizer was brought out they brought us the order for a different table first.

When the main dishes came we were very disappointed. Not only did the lasagna look like it was a giant blob of food covered in tomato sauce, it was also cold in the center. 

The trout was swimming in roughly 1/2 inch of grease and was extremely salty. The little fried slivers of sweet poatato used as a decorative topic were very good and had to have been my favorite part of my meal.

My girlfriend really liked the dressing on her salad. However, the salad consisted of a huge serving of greens with a few bits and pieces of other vegetables placed on top.

The bill we received the first time was not for our table. 

Did I mention that we were here for almost 2 hours? The service is extremely slow. 

There was no appology from the manager for any of the missing menu items, cold food, long wait, incorrect check, etc. 

It is a shame, as the decor is tasteful and modern and upscale.

Overall I would recommend that you RUN THE OTHER WAY!!! You will get better service at Waffle House and they tend to have the items listed on their menu.",2012-07-26 17:53:54

The attendants were mostly Brazilian from all kind of ages, and by listening to some conversations (oops... yeah sometimes I snoop) between the waitress and some of the customers, I could tell that they were regulars, so I got big expectations about the food. 

The waitress was really friendly and nice, (she was born in Mato Grosso if you were wondering...) and her service was optimo!!!

The caipirinhas were spectacular and they came quick.

When I saw the menu it was disappointing that they lack some of the icons of the Brazilian food like the feijoada, and that they tried to reach a bigger audience by mixing Brazilian with Italian food... So my aspirations of tasting some authentic Brazilian food started to vanish.

The order was based on some appetizers to share: calamari, shrimps, and some Brazilian cut that was camouflaged like an appetizer, but when it appeared, it seemed more like a main course that would satisfy a cookie monster...

Why am I putting 3 stars? The 3 appetizers came at the same time but they were COLD... We still ate everything because the flavors were good, but when you ask for meat you want it to be juicy, smoking, tender, and hot, not warm, or environment temperature... You want it HOT.

The calamari was great; crunchy, not oily at all, and you could taste that the oil was healthy and not used over and over.

The shrimps had a great garlicky sauce that we couldn't stop eating with the bread. Unfortunately, they weren't hot either... (face looking at the side).

I'm really picky when it comes to the temperature of the food because I love to eat calmly, and because I think everybody deserves satisfaction when they are paying for a service. But when you know your dish has been sitting down it makes you wonder if it belonged to another table who rejected it, or if it could be spoiled, or if they don't paid attention to the customers satisfaction. 

I would give them another chance because I liked the amount of food they give, and because the problem was timing.",2015-08-14 23:48:49

Couldn't find a more fitting way to end my year and top off my 100 review challenge for 2015 than a review of our famed Las Vegas Strip. Where all sorts of debaucheries happen on a daily basis, day in and day out. 

Where you can find world renowned hotels and casinos that offer luxurious and high end accommodations and amenities. That houses the crème de la crème of chefs from all over the world and cuisines that can surely satisfy every foodie's fantasy. Along with world class entertainment like Cirque du Soleil and of course Vegas night clubs that are totally a world on their own, everything from concerts to street artists available at a drop of a dime. Where high end specialty shops and retail abound, a place for serious shopaholics. 

Las Vegas is a mecca of everything in excess, in all shapes and forms. The Strip is a perfect representation of that, after all it has a name of Sin City to uphold. But like everything else, moderation and caution should be exercised and best believe you can still have fun without the over the top craziness! And lastly, ALWAYS remember that if you by chance get married in Las Vegas during a drunken stupor, you're still considered married in all 50 states!

The staff here were fantastically helpful with grabbing me menus, getting me a picture menu, and giving me their suggestions since it was my first time trying Persian food. They offered me some tea while I waited for my order for which they gave me an accurate estimate (15 min). Plus: they have sugar cubes.

I ordered the:
#9 Salmon kebabs - Looked like a sizable portion with some dark meat still attached to the underside. It tasted fresh enough, well marinated and had a nice grilled flavor to it. This came with some basmati rice with a little saffron flavored basmati rice on top. The salad was an edible mix of iceberg and romaine with large sliced cucumber, carrot ribbons, and tomato wedges that tasted like it was tossed in Kraft Italian. Maybe it was?. Overall, tasty. (8.99)
Lentil soup - From what I tried, it was delicious! Lightly spiced, very hearty. I wish I could have eaten a little more of this, but it was gone by the time I went back for seconds. Yeah.. it was that good. (3.99)
Dolemeh - Fantastic stuffed grape leaves. Theirs are served cold, vegetarian, stuffed with rice and lentils. These come with tomato wedges and lemon slices. Delicious! (4.99)
Maust`Moosir - Yogurt with minced shallots. This was good, but pretty basic. I think I'd prefer the Maust`Khiar with cucumber and mint (like raita?) This is essentially a dip and the girl up front was kind enough to throw in a bag of pita for my dipping pleasure! This was a huge container and I have a lot left over. (4.99)
Shirazi - Persian salad. Diced cucumber, tomato and parsley. Pretty much what you'd expect. I think it's tossed lightly with lemon. Overall, a little too bland for me, but definitely a nice crisp and fresh accompaniment to the meal. (4.99)
Zereshk Polo - This. Was. Incredible! Fluffy basmati rice with berries that I'm kicking myself for not remembering the name of! They were small but taste sort of like a cranberry. The sourness of them with the saffron scented rice was amazing! Huge portion for (4.99). You could easily make a meal out of the soup and this rice. Mmm..

Everything was packed extremely well and they even thought to put some fancy utensils in the bag as well. I took it right home, but the thought was still nice.

There were two (bored) employees behind the pastry counter because everyone was ordering food and drinks other than pastries.

I then had to wait another 10 minutes -- croissant in hand -- to pay for it.  As we were (finally) walking away with the croissant, one of the cashiers (mind you, there's only two) ran across the room saying she'd be right back.

First off, I've never had a burrito take that long. For my friend ahead in line, she had the unfortunate sight of an assembler literally scraping the bottom of the container for the last of the barbacoa. No one wants to see that! You're supposed to keep up the illusion that everything is fresh. When it gets low, fill it up before someone gets the last scrappy bits knowingly. I thought everywhere knew that unwritten rule? Same went for the beans and fajita vegetables. I guess the turnover isn't fast enough. 

Ah so much about getting food is the experience! And when it was my turn to order and get the barbacoa, I was excited. I thought, yay, I'll get the fresh stuff! And then I saw them take it out of plastic bag they just warmed up in the microwave... Augh, really? You're letting me see that? I get that this happens, but you're not supposed to flaunt it. 

Then, I ate it. At first bite, not so bad. But as I made my way through it, everything dawned on me. The rice was mealy. The veggies were undercooked. The barbacoa was too salty and spiced in away that was too aggressive. The mild salsa had a 50:50 , tomato to red onion ratio to the point that red onion was all I could taste.

I go when I have 12.00 bucks to spare for lunch and when I want to eat ""whatever I want day."" I have been a fan of Mattas for years. I would go weekly. I have my favorites (ala carte Roberts ground beef taco and bean tostada) or an order of mini chili cheese burros. I love Mattas! However, sometimes it takes a bit to get an employee to fill your chip bowl. I love the chips almost more than the meal, so its frustrating to try to get their attention. Like I said, this is a splurge for me, so two small bowls of chips isn't ridiculous. (at one point I boycotted them for months because when I asked for more chips, the gal took a bowl from the tray of chips and sprinkled a few extra chips into my bowl. Gee, thanks for watching my diet. I paid 9 bucks for this food-(and 3 dollar tip) at least give me a full bowl! Quit being the chip police. It costs you pennies!!)
Lately I have been happy with therr crew and I don't go as much as I would like. Is it traditional mexican? Probably not, but the hot salsa is heaven in my mouth. Love this place.

Korean BBQ doesn't always have to be associated with AYCE. Instead it serves higher quality meat and amazing service. No wonder Andrew Zimmerman (from the Travel Channel) even made a visit to Hobak just recently. That's when you know you know this place is really something.

Apparently from all the other reviews, there's a long wait time. I was lucky enough to only wait 10 minutes on a Sunday night. Right when you walk in, there's a complimentary slushie machine by the door to sip on while you wait. You can always come back to the machine for refills even after you been seated.

The side dishes all look delicious! I especially love their potato pancakes. You are welcome to ask for more if you run out. They didn't hand it out to me unless I asked, but there's also salad and a bowl of rice. The salad had an interesting dressing in it which I really like!

My family of 3 ended up ordering the large beef combo which included three types of meat. We got the short rib, rib eye, and brisket. It was delicious!!! You can definitely taste the high quality in each bite. Unlike most Korean BBQs, this one has amazing service. The waiters are constantly checking up on you and cooking all the meat. They actually don't let you cook it yourself. At the end of the meal, there was also ice cream included! There was a good amount of flavors to choose from and it comes in a rice cracker-like sandwich.

Not only is the service and food amazing, but so is the bathroom! There's complimentary toothbrush, mouth wash, and toothpaste for your dental needs. Unfortunately it's only one bathroom per gender so it would be a long wait if someone was taking their sweet time. Apparently on the wall next to the outside of the bathrooms, they claim to have other services such as free wifi and chargers.

This was definitely one of my favorite place for Korean BBQ. A must try for all locals and tourist!",2017-09-18 05:38:54

The food is worth the drive, gas, distance, and time. I dream about eating this food daily. Last night, the place was packed with Korean families who could be making their own Korean food at home, but obviously weren't bc this place is out of this world.

The service is sketchy, but the food is the highlight. Don't let the bad service keep you away from the delightfulness your taste buds deserve. The flavor here is full bodied and inviting. I never say this, but it's better than the Korean food I had growing up in a Korean American household. THERE, I SAID IT. *drops mic, walks away*. (My mother was an amazing cook, too)

We usually order the pork hot stone bowl (bibimbap); it comes out piping hot and stays that way. If you order a hot stone bowl, be willing to share or don't eat for several days before; it's a huge serving. One serving could easily feed 3 people. I wish I knew the right words to describe how tasty it is.

The haemul pajun was hot, crispy, and not so thick. It was the most homestyle pajun I've eaten at a Korean restaurant. Like the hot stone bowl, this is also a generous portion I'd order this as a meal and eat it all by myself. Ok, I'm a liar. If it didn't make me look like a pig, I'd order 2... All to myself. 

We also had the Korean chirak. If you like sashimi, you'll love this dish. It's like bibimbap, but the fish is raw and it's served  in sliced red cabbage-like a salad. You get rice, on the side, to add in if you want. The sashimi was creamy, like butter, and incredibly fresh. You also got a lot of it. The cabbage paired perfectly with the sashimi. The sauce was a nice balance of spiciness with a hint of sweetness.",2016-03-27 20:20:14

After reading a glowing review for Blue Agave in the Isthmus I thought we might get a place that would give us some semblance of a modern Mexican place and not another Laredo's.  The Isthmus must just default to a glowing review if a place is in downtown because they get free drinks.  Blue Agave could only strive to be Laredo's.  It started with the overly friendly white boy barkeep that must be stone deaf and thought he was applying at Chili's. I ordered their standard marg just kick things off and he asked if I wanted it frozen. Bad sign for openers. They didn't have a top shelf marg that I could see, but it is nearly impossible to read their menu with a 0.25 font size. Hell even Chili's will make you a top shelf marg. Anyway, I tell him I wanted it served up and he laughed and brought it to me on ice. I told him again that I ordered it up and he laughed again, walked away and poured out the drink he had made and made another one...warm with no ice.  Obviously not a real bartender, or not a good listener. I drank it just because it was obvious this place sucked and I wanted to get this over with ASAP. Oh and the marg was a sweet and sour mix special and served warm, it was genuinely awful.
So they pride themselves with tableside guacamole - something seemingly new to the Isthmus staff but was new about 3 decades ago.  We got our guac with mango because as my wife added "" they are in season"".  At Blue Agave frozen mango is always in season!  We may have got about  two small pieces of frozen mango in ours. But the guac was the star of the meal.  
I got carne asada.  A standard that even Laredo's can do a decent job on.  What  I got was a large sheet of work boot leather with rice and beans.  I really laughed when I saw it.  So pathetic and sad. The poor busboy had to give up his shoes because someone ordered something besides fajitas.  My wifefriend got a fairly decent mole enchilada, nice flavor that was a bit unique but the mole was an afterthought.

One last thing. I love a place that pays attention to detail.  Blue Agave was using someone's iPhone for the music track (probably in violation of RIAA - but I'm sure they've got bigger things to worry about), which wouldn't have been a big deal except the person's phone kept getting texts and the music kept stopping, followed by a ""bing!"" And then resume.  But no one seemed to mind because they had frozen margs with a hint of rail swill tequila with only an old memory of an agave plant and a place other than Loredo's to get guacamole. 

So if you find yourself in here because you trust the Isthmus restaurant reviews one piece of advice ... get a beer and a bowl of the guac and go somewhere else to eat.",2018-03-11 05:41:34

This place is missing the heart and passion that makes a small business succeed. There was nothing special about this place, which in and of itself would have warranted additional visits. Far worse, however, was the lack of care I felt from the staff. 

First, the good: It was clean. There were at least ten varieties of yogurt. The tart was alright. Price was comparable to other fro-yo shops.

What could be improved:

Service: This is a hugely important category for me. Unfortunately, quality service, or really any service, is missing from Orange Leaf. When we walked in, there was nobody there to greet us. My boyfriend and I looked for a sample cup to try the flavours. After a minute or so of wandering about, the staff door opened, and a middle-aged man appeared, still without a greeting. My boyfriend walked towards him and asked for a sample cup. I was only a couple of steps behind. The man hands him a single cup and still does not offer me one despite my clear intention of also wanting to try the flavours. But, refusing to be deterred from my fro-yo ration, I also ask for a sample cup and receive a single one. 

At this point, I'm considering whether to try every single one and make full use of my single sample cup, or just trying a single flavour and risking it. I'm no biologist, but I feel like the health concerns are real. At the very least, my palate told me that a lot of these flavours should not have been mixed. I go with 4 flavours, and dislike almost every single one.

Food:
Tart is my go-to. It's how I test the quality of the product without being distracted by flavourings. Orange Leaf's tart flavour left much to be desired. The tart tasted like a tub of plain fro-yo had been churned half-heartedly. The ice crystals were huge and left my mouth and stomach dissatisfied. 

Strawberry: holy moly avoid this. This tasted like a few too many pumps of #5 food flavour was added.

There were two non-dairy options: pineapple and orange. Pineapple was underwhelming, but orange was passable.

Conclusion: This place felt and tasted like a cheap knock-off of a popular fro-yo franchise. The signs and many flavours were very similar to that fro-yo place as well. I was disappointed by my experience here and will not be coming back.",2017-08-22 22:47:50

The next to last time we were there, the time it took to get our order was very long--two tables nearby, seated well after us, received their food long before we did. More to the point, the preparation wasn't comparable to past visits.

The first time this happened, we chalked it up to a possible new staff in the kitchen and the inevitable growing pains that come with breaking in new cooks. Things happen, and we didn't hold it against the restaurant.

But we didn't go back as quickly as we had in the past, and when we returned last (about 8 weeks after the previous visit), the serving staff seemed to be completely different and the service was still extra slow. We even asked for a simple side substitution (one vegetable which was priced on the menu at the same price as the item the dish was normally served with) and were told we could get that item as a side at extra charge, but not as a substitution. When the food arrived (after about 30 minutes), they did do the substitution after all, but my food was barely warm, as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for the last 10 minutes--and the restaurant was 3/4 empty at the time, not busy at all.

I think this visit might have broken the spell. After a few years of what would have been 3-star to 4-star meals, our last couple of trips have been 2-star--and I am not certain when, or if, we'll return.",2010-09-27 03:32:17

It had true, thick, tender, lightly fried lobster pieces atop a bowl of cheesy goodness. Also, my hard-to-please dad couldn't stop raving over his pork belly tacos.

They have all the great products that World Market carries, but the staff and store lack the usual quality that I find at other World Market stores.

They recently had a sale on ""all pumpkin products,"" but after browsing the pumpkin pancakes and pumpkin soup mix, I gave up on trying to guess the price. I also found another section with a lot of missing price tags/labels. Not cool.

The second thing that grinds my gears is that they've started putting out coffee for the holidays (or maybe just because) during busy times. Twice in a row I've visited to find all 3 coffee pots empty. One of those times, I notified one of their team members, and he simply removed the coffee pots from the front of the store.

Lamb kebabs - little spicier, flavorful like what you might get at a Greek restaurant.  Very little to distinguish itself here.  Dipped in the raitka added a bit of flavor.

To me, the atmosphere is more like a quaint, rustic French bistro with a modern flair than it is Mexican, but pleasing, nonetheless.  Pay attention to their hours of operation.  If I had, I would've saved myself a trip on a Sunday, when they're closed.  On one visit, there was only one customer in the restaurant, but that's likely to change once the movie theater upstairs (currently closed for renovations) reopens.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  In fact, if you're nice, the guy behind the bar may tell you a funny story about a trip he once made to a local movie theater!

My friend tells me the nachos (served warm) and salsa were very good and the Taco Salad was crisp and cool.  I opted for the Carne Asada burrito which was very flavorful with its brown sugar and ""hot and sweet onion pepper relish"".  Both entrees were large enough for leftovers to take home.  If you decide to stop in, be sure to treat yourself to the Empanadas (served in a pair.)  My only gripe is that the menu states they are made of ""Flaky puff pastry"" when mine seemed more like deep fried tacos.  Overall, I loved the dish.  Don't be fooled by what looks like Buffalo wing sauce topping.  It's actually a ""Yucatan BBQ sauce"" which makes this a terrific sweet and salty dish (a plus in my book).  If you're looking for traditional Mexican, you'll probably be disappointed, but if you're enthused by trying new and creative food, it'll be right up your alley.

Prices are fair to moderate, but worth it, especially when you factor in Happy Hour discounts.  They're even better with Groupon!

A block or two away from OEB, and across the street from Diner Deluxe can only mean one thing: all the frustrated overflow traffic from those two breakfast places just saunter over to Carino, which happens to be mostly empty!

And that is exactly what I did this morning. I had just picked up my family from the airport, and we were starving. Not wanting to wait for our food, we decided to give Carino a try. 

Carino is where AKA Winebar used to be. As we walked in, it struck me how similar it looked to AKA. They had not done much in the way of making it look different, and had left most of the decor exactly the same. Upon surveying the menu, I recognized a few brunch menu items which were the same as AKA as well. Had they decided to carry over those items into the new menu because they were popular? That is what I can assume.

One thing that bothered me before I even ordered was the strong smell that hit me as soon as I walked into the restaurant. I have a strong sense of smell, so that may be why it was so unnerving for me, but it took a lot of effort for me to look past it. But it was snowing outside and we were already seated with menus in our hands, so I decided to trudge through it. 

I ordered an Eggs Benedict with salmon gravlax, while the other parties at the table ordered the Arigato Omlette, and Fried Chicken and waffles (a menu item that was carried over from AKA Winebar). We were served coffee promptly, and it was good coffee too. 

The food arrived, after a slightly long wait. The quantities didnt look plentiful, but the presentation was pretty. My Eggs Benedict was cooked PERFECTLY. The yolks were soft and runny, and the hollandaise sauce just the right amount. 

The Arigato Omlette was interesting.. a thin omlette over some rice, bean sprouts and japanese sauce. Very tasty and filling! 

The chicken and waffles seemed to be the lesser loved of all the items. 

The price was pretty average. About $69 plus tip for all four of us.

Verdict: Would I be back? Maybe. The menu was small, but the items were well-prepared. If OEB and Diner Deluxe both had a lineups out the door, I'd happily come back to Carino.

It's not as sweet as other places that I've gotten it at. I ordered the BBQ Pk and shredded pork dish (#42) and that was delicious. I tried some of their beef stew noodle dish and their egg noodle dish - both which were also good.

The spring roll was interesting because it was mostly all veggie with shrimp and beef slices. I'm used to the spring rolls having some mi fun (rice noodles) in it, too, but it was good regardless. 

The vietnamese coffee was also good. Very sweet, but good. I also like how cheap and clean this place is.",2013-07-26 03:44:07

We ordered the mix tempura and the sushi boat. 

My wife is particularly picky about sushi.  She was impressed.  

1) The portion sizes were huge for a sushi restaurant.

2) They were NOT skimpy with the fish.  They was a lot more fish with this sushi compared to the other places in the Phoenix AZ (which tend to load the sushi with rice to make up for the small amount of fish they serve)

3) The sushi was really fresh.  

4) The crabmeat sushi tasted like real crabmeat and not surimi or flour (imitation crabmeat)

About the only thing we could have done differently is order less food.  It was a lot, and we ended up taking part of it home.  

We would most likely go back here.  I will definitely take my in-laws (from Vietnam) here, and my own parents.  My parents are particular about their sushi.  

This place looks like it has a good clientele.  I hope that they keep busy, and are able to stay in business for years to come.",2014-02-15 03:22:37

The staff were friendly, not very expedient, but we were a large party and they were nice. 

First night, I ordered a burger and fries. It was better than fast food, but not a great burger. The fries were quite good. 

Second night, I ordered a chicken pot pie. The presentation was amazing, more what I would expect from a resort restaurant, but not necessarily from the lounge at that resort. The presentation is where my amazement stopped. The flavoring of the pie was quite good, but the chicken was way overcooked. I mean so dry and stringy and chewy and gross. My friend had ordered another chicken dish and reported the same.

Man, what a wild ride. Everything is a process. But my head is clear and this is a Yelp that's been demanding to be written for a while.

Yesterday, Amber W tweeted something very insightful. She basically said, I can't believe in the year 2010 or whatever year this is people still 1) smoke 2) believe in God in the traditional judeo christian sense 3) eat meat. Now I can imagine someone who does all three, or hell, any of the three, must believe that Amber and I and our cohort are pretty fucking stupid to think that any of those things are going away. For you, Sir, for you, Madam, I just hope you live long enough to see it because it's coming and true morality, true Golden Rule style living, will rear it's pretty little head. 

Sasha is someone who could give Damon B of Green fame a run for his money. She's creative. She's talented. Everything is delicious. There's no titanium disulphide in my food. It's fresh. Sometimes it's raw. It's local. It's largely organic. Did I mention it's delicious. She's experimental. She's kind. She's generous. She's all the things that we look for in a leader of the righteous food movement. BTW, there's no way she'd endorse that statement. That's all me. 

I get the vegan delight pizza. I get the masala burger. I often get the specials. The fruit smoothies are the best you will ever have. Seriously. Do something you can feel good about. Support this local business putting out the very best product at a very fair price... I promise you will not be disappointed no matter what your thoughts are on vegetarianism or vegan living.",2010-09-30 20:00:54

There are some pros and cons of using this new facility, however.  I can't give them too much credit.  The old facility that was located 1.5 miles away did have a tad bit more amenities but its seems like they sacrificed some things for the ultra polish look.  

PROS:

+ Decor: clean, modern, sleek
+ Lounge: TV, L-shape couch with large coffee table, high table with chairs
+ Technology: Cardio machines equipped with TV set, FREE WIFI
+ Parking: parking spots near the front entrance
+ Pool: include separate lockers and cubes if you come to just swim
+ Exercise Rooms: Cycling and Enormous Aerobics 
+ Prime Amenities: Pool, Basketball Court, Kids Center

CONS:

- No Sauna/Steam room
- No Racquetball Courts
- No Jacuzzi

Besides what I listed for PROS and CONS, expect similar weight machines and equipment to other facilities.  There are some new and unique machines that you may have not used before.  The front desk area is like no other facilities for instance, there is an area for new membership sign-up with touchscreens.  

If you are a long time member and in the area, do stop by.  Otherwise, I am quite pleased to have this new facility near me.  Say hello, if you happen to check-in with me.",2016-08-01 21:38:57

I ate there two years ago during a brief stay in Mississauga, and its still the best jerk chicken I ever had. 

Potluck Caribbean Cuisine is a tiny place that serves magical food. The chicken is tender, flavorful, and the gravy soaks the bed of rice and peas perfectly. The coleslaw is milky and mild, with just enough zing to contrast with the richness of the chicken. Portions are generous and prices cheap. I can't wait to try the oxtail and goat curry next time - I could probably eat that stuff forever and ever!

The scallops were Bay scallops, not Sea scallops, and there were very few of them in the roll.  The spicy sauce on the tuna was disgusting.  The tuna was chewy, rubbery and dark!

I had the mussels for my entree, even though it is listed as a starter it was more than enough. The broth was insanely good and I could eat it like soup. My fiance got the burger which he ate faster than I ate 3 mussels. Our waitress was great too, very attentive and wasn't annoyed by my questions about the menu. 

The only downfalls for me was it seemed a bit overpriced and the location is still not the best, even with several new spots opening up near by.

Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  

Rant:
1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.
2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it ""Hawaiian"".
3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me ""brah"" or asking if I ""hang ten"" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.

How does it stack up?

Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.

Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.
 
A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.

I was feeling rather hungry and decided it was time for lunch even though it was only around 10:30 AM.  Well, not many places seemed to be open that early.  Not where I was looking at least.  So I headed up Spring Mountain to check out Pho Saigon on Rainbow.  I figured if they were not open I could at least visit the market next door.  Much to my surprise I saw Woonam Jung right there too and it was open.  Well, I had never had real Korean food before so I thought ""what the heck.""  I may as well give it a try.  So I walked in and found it to be very quiet.  It was still early afterall.  The restaurant was beautiful.  Dark floors.  Dark tables.  Glass panels with a dragon etched in.  Remarkably clean.  I looked at the menu before deciding to actually eat there.  I did not understand much of anything on it as most of it was in Korean and I don't read the language.  The hostess was kind enough to explain some of the menu to me and I took my seat.  I ordered bulgogi since it was really the only thing on the menu that I was familiar with.  

It did not take long for my order to come out.  First up were the sides.  There was classic cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, bean sprout salad, broccoli raab, and the big mystery side.  That was some sort of shredded or noodle looking dish.  It was spicy and slightly fishy.  Good though.  More on that later.  The kimchis were both fantastic.  The bean sprouts were fresh and crisp.  The broccoli raab was just okay but I am not a fan of the green when it is cooked.  The bulgogi was great.  The beef was very tender and not at all fatty.  There was a certain sweetness to it that is hard to explain.  In any case, it was delicious.  The steamed sticky rice on the side was good too.  It was sticky enough to eat with chop sticks.  Something I have always struggled to do.  No problems here.  

After lunch I went for a walk through the market next door and discovered what I think the mystery side was.  Shredded dried cuddle fish.  That would explain the fishy taste.  It is strange to think I ate that becasue it is not something I am familiar with but it was good and I would likely eat it again if it came as a side again.

I was quite pleased with the food and service and would like to return again.  Maybe a ways down the road though.  The $13 price tag for lunch is higher than what I am used to paying.  When I feel the need for good Korean cuisine, though, I know where to go.",2012-05-21 19:23:17

I'm going to fore warn I'm going to make a few comments but it was still good and I would go back again.

Tried the fried chicken skins and bone marrow/biscuit/short rib - pepper jelly for the appetizer.  Biscuit was extremely dense AKA rock hard, to me it robbed the marrow snd jelly of the glory of being a fantastic dish. I know it is unconventional but I wouldn't have minded the marrow and short rib - pepper jelly on a KFC biscuit instead.  My mouth was focused on the brick underneath the savory goodness. As for the chicken skins...less is more sometimes. The batter on the skins was so thick it was ballooned around the skin....a lightly dusting on the skins would have highlighted a good old fashioned treat kicked up a notch with a spicy honey.

The pot pie with mash was good. It was exactly what it said it was...no frills. No peas. Herbs, spices, cheese and garlic are to cliche for the hipster vibe with mash potato but we all know how good it is...too bad they were absent.

In fact, before I tell you this story, I am going to tell you how much I loved this golf course. I loved this golf course because it's like no other golf course in Phoenix. It feels like a golf course up north. It's surrounded by beautiful old trees, many of the holes go down into the washes and it's green and lush. The course itself isn't the ""best"" around but I am not the best golfer so I didn't really care. The prices are also amazing in the summertime and be sure to eat at Tonto Bar and Grill before or after your tee time. Now it's time for my story.

When we got to the 16th hole, I drove the cart around to meet my husband by our balls. I got out of the golf cart and walked up the hill to the green. While walking, I passed by the sand trap that is right next to the hole. I glanced in and immediately turned ash white. There in the sand trap was a rattlesnake. Yes, in the actual trap! My husband immediately saw my expression and asked if there was a snake. I nod and run back to the golf cart. Needless to say I didn't finish the hole (like I said, I'm not an amazing golfer and was ok with the loss). After finishing the hole, my husband went towards the sand trap to look at the snake. Then we see the whole picture. This rattlesnake has a rabbit, a big rabbit, in it's mouth! Yes, the rattlesnake had somehow caught the rabbit and was trying to get it out of the sand trap. I took a couple steps forward to peek in but immediately retreated back to the cart. I had seen enough. I am traumatized for life. We had obviously caught the snake in the act right after he killed it because it stopped moving and then immediately tried to pull the rabbit up the trap but the rabbit was so heavy the snake was having problems.

Very small and a fun vibe, so be sure to set up a spot before hand. Most of the seats are at a bar, which can be fun for couples but needs to be strategic for 3-6 size groups.

This one is bright, clean, and seems to be better stocked than most of the locations.  Though I wasn't shopping for groceries, the produce section seemed much better and fresher, too.  Parking also was easier.  And I didn't feel as if I needed a shower when I left!

I had to return one of the items I bought, so I returned to the same location to see if my previous experience was an anomaly.  Happy to report that it wasn't!  And they also had more than one cashier open at the non-food end.  That in itself was a feather in their cap.

They have multiple locations and can accommodate multiple tests on the same day. (Today I am getting two MRI's and a CT Scan) 
They always give me a disc of my scans when I leave, if I ask. I like this because I keep everything for my medical files. 
The staff is very friendly, especially Michelle, always taking into account that you may not feel good. They never are grouchy and are careful to explain directions of preparations for tests. 
You always get called with a reminder of your appointment and what you are to do for your test. 
I drive out of my way to come here, because of their  upgraded equipment and great staff.

I was considering some chicken katsu, meat jun or fried rice til that caught my eye. I settled on black bean noodles. Side dishes included boiled peanuts, bean sprouts, kimchi, fish cake and pan fried hot dog & onions. All were good but the kimchi was a tad bland, probably due to it not being pickled that long.

However I really think the fotastes quite mediocre and not even as good as a typical Korean restaurant. The interior is nice and is probably a great place to have a drink. 

Yuk hoe tartare: I think it was just okay. There were some vegetable ingredients in the mix that's dominating the flavour of the beef, making it not as harmonious as a dish. I tend to like beef tartar where the taste of the beef is the main focus 

Eggplant: slightly sweet miso glazed eggplant. I always love it. 

Brussels sprouts: the combination of crispy Brussel sprout, sausage and cheese was good. But it's slightly too salty 

Octopus: I didn't like it. The octopus itself was nice and tender. But I'm not sure if the taste of bitter melon was a value add to this dish. I generally like bitter melon in Chinese dishes. But here it just adds a bitter and slightly sour taste. Also it comes with a lemon, after squeezing the lemon on the dish it becomes even more bitter and sour.

Bulgogi: the meat is nice and tender. But the flavouring is not as good as bulgogi at a typical Korean restaurant. The surface is also slightly bitter from the burnt. Also one area of the meat was especially salty so the flavouring was probably not evenly spread.

Ssam: probably the best dish of the night. But it's not any better than typical Korean restaurant",2018-12-12 04:56:26

It's not a pub nor a gastropub or even a restaurant. It is a gastro-house.

I must admit,  I was quite thrown off by this bustling place when I walked in. Because I was not sure what it was trying to be. Now, of course, I do know - a gastro house.  The vibe of this place does feel like a busy pub. I could hear the loud voices of men drinking and talking about man things. I assume because they were so loud. LOL

Happy hours with a constant jagermeister specials scream - pub. If only I was younger and thought this was wine.

Part of me thinks that because its not a restaurant it can get away with some culinary license. It is true but since it's not a pub I do expect more. So now on to the food.

Definitely more pricey than a pub. Not many a bar can claim foie gras and confit on their menus.  A variety of items to choose from including daily specials.  Categories to choose from include: ruffage, big stuff, handheld, gastrospuds, hodgepodge etc....

The funny thing I found about this place was the plating. Just not appetizing looking.  I was scoping out the yelp image bank and I scratched my head to ask, why, plate like that? 

The open faced steak sandwich was tasty. Grilled medium rare meat perfection. I could taste the char. Mmmm. If you are a steak lover - you know what I mean. The accompanying salad was overdressed but that aside I give them points for not using the spring mix.  What intrigued me about my dish was the rosemary focaccia bread the steak was paired with.  When eaten together it completely worked. I was sitting there eating this, surprise in my mouth. (yeah i said that). Although the bread was dry and the presentation, sucked, it was pretty good.

Many of the holes were updated with new hazards and the greens were all renovated.  Having played this golf course dozens of times over the years I was excited when a friend of mine invited me to play as I haven't played it since the renovation.

It was the 2nd week of December and the weather was perfect!  Temperatures in the low 60's, sunny, and no wind!  Are you kidding me?!  This is truly Golf Nirvana!

The newly renovated course plays a lot different than the old course.  The greens are much faster than they were and many of the greens were made smaller with a lot of undulations.....what this means is it's difficult to get the ball to stick on the green and putting is 10x more difficult.

The fairways and rough were in excellent condition.

The only thing I don't like about this golf course is that there's no beverage cart.  There's a snack shack on 3 and 14 or you can grab a bite/drink at the turn.  It's not too bad in the Winter, but in the Summer you wish there were more opportunities to buy beverages.

Some other things I love about this course is that they give you complimentary Bottled Water and Apples between the number 1 and 10 tees.  Additionally, this golf course is located in the community where the real life characters that were featured in the movie Casino actually lived.  You can see the house where Robert De Niro's real life character in the movie lived, which is located off the 15th hole, 5th house on the left.

Overall, it was a great golfing experience....I didn't do so well on the course, but like they say ""A bad day of Golf is better than a good day without Golf"".

Other notes about this place....

- You can rent out space for events here.....Weddings, Parties, Corporate Events.  I've hosted and attended several events in the past, they do a great job here.

- There's a Tennis Club with several courts.  Over the summer they have a kids Tennis camp program.

Note #2: There is a minimum charge of $10 for credit cards. The young lady behind the counter let me slip through, however, since I was outta cash. 

After hours of house hunting in the South Hills and a meal in Beechview, I had a hankering for ice cream and remembered reading about a new ""creamery"" in Mt. Lebanon, so down Washington Road we raced...

I spotted the sign in a flash as we sped by, causing a flustered Kay to make a loop back around to Washington Road. 

I must say that Betsy's sure is child-friendly. Each table doubles as a chalkboard, which means that resting your elbows on said table will, errr...turn you into the Rainbow Raider...

Not knowing what in tarnation to order, I went with a hot fudge sundae featuring Nutella-flavored ice cream. Not ever having had Nutella, I was left dissatisfied by the ice cream itself for didn't taste much like anything, let alone vanilla. The pumped on hot fudge and the prepared, bagged, and piped-on whipped cream (just like the Cold Stone Creamery chain does) rescued the sundae, barely. 

Also lacking was generosity. When I saw that tiny scooper and was asked if I wanted 2 scoops or 4, my heart dropped a little. A business cannot expect to garner repeat patronage with such stingy portions. 

Aside from that, the service was acceptable, and the ambience was downright playful despite the bickering of the harried (married?) owners. The joint was positively bouncing with youthful activity, but I wonder how long the parlor's novelty will last. Heck, I liked Scoops on Beverly more (shoot me), and their ice cream is purchased, not made on the premises. I guess ""housemade"" isn't always perfect.",2012-03-18 16:06:27

I've caught several games here over the years, so I am revisiting another familiar ballpark on my tour of the Cactus League. Surprise is destination #8.

In some other reviews I've read on Yelp!, people were complaining about the drive to Camelback Ranch. For perspective, Surprise Stadium is approximately 45 minutes from downtown Phoenix. Which is 15 minutes further northwest than Camelback Ranch. But seriously, who complains about going to see a baseball game?

Surprise Stadium is easy to get to as long as you avoid the obvious Bell Road route. The left lane on Bell backs up quickly from all the west bound traffic. A southerly approach on Bullard Avenue is much quicker. This is only the second facility I've visited in 2016 that doesn't charge for parking. And all the parking here is either on site or just across the street. It's a very short walk compared to most.

I was curious, so I looked up the age of this stadium. It was built in 2003 so it's probably still considered one of the newer, more modern facilities. The look of the press box and deck seating is the furthest thing from modern. Which is why I probably looked it up. But, understanding that this is the spring training home to the KC Royals and the Texas Rangers, it makes sense. I think the aesthetic chosen would look at home in either Texas or the mid-west. The architect might have been going for a modern take on an old ball park. It's nice and well maintained, but not my style. And it doesn't offer much shade for fans, compared to other stadiums in the Cactus League.

Surprise Stadium, also known as Billy Parker Field, succeeds at getting fans close to the players. Last season, I sat on the first base line in the second row so I can vouch for how close you are to the action and the players.

Speaking of action, the game was terrific! The visiting Padres battled back and forth with the Rangers and each team hit a barrage of home runs (eight total, I think). The game ended with a walk-off two run homer, giving the Rangers a 12-11 victory.

This ball park has charm. It's also another good venue for the Arizona sunsets. The pitch of the lawn seating and everything else just feels comfortable. Despite a lack of ""unique"" beers (no craft beers spotted) and a field that looked like it was prepped to resemble a bar code (see photo), I will be back. And I don't care how far it is from the east valley!",2016-03-26 22:36:20
R-7-F8sTW2njXlT-m6Relw,-VPbztwxZfQOnL6gar8Fvw,aTd8upPhfxefiecvTbtUMg,4,9,8,4,"Yelp helped me find this place, as it's close to where I work.  It was great, and there are some amazing specials... 10% off a pedicure on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  And also if you go on Mon, Tues, or Wed and you get a mani + pedi, they will give you a free eyebrow wax!  

The best thing about the place is the ""family"" atmosphere.  I think the whole family does-- literally-- work there, and they all talk and hang out like you are in their living room with them.  I told them that I really wish I could understand Vietnamese so I could be in on the jokes.  They laughed at me and slapped my leg like I was the jokey-est jokester of all time.  It was charming.

The owner gave me my pedicure herself, and I LOVED her.  (Maybe it's because she A) rested her boobs on my feet every time she laughed and B) burped with gusto.)  However, she is part of the only reason why I gave Top Design Nails 4 stars instead 5.  She speaks zero English, so when I tried to explain that I like my nails mostly square but with rounded edges (complex, I know), she nodded her head like she understood and then proceeded to file my nails completely round, which I do not like.  I could have corrected it, of course, but I was so charmed that I decided to be ""that customer"" on a future visit.

I decided to get my eyebrows done while I was there-- even though I usually get them threaded elsewhere-- and the job was totally fine.  The best part is that my pedi + eyebrows was a total of $23 ($15 pedi, $8 eyebrows)!!

One more random/interesting thing to note:  the owner also does clothing alterations on-site.  Apparently, she will hem a pair of pants for $4!  I know that must of us are in codependent, long-term relationships with our tailors, but I might have to give it a try some time, due to the ridiculously low price.

If you have (and strangely enough I have on many occasions) this is the place to get it.  It costs a whopping $15.85 for enough rye to make way too many sandwiches.

In all truth, I seldom require more than 1/10 of this at any one time, but if you find yourself with too much then it keeps very well in the fridge and freezes very well.  Just make sure the ask the check-out people you want some freezer bags.

They have a huge variety of other types of breads both large and small as well as a lovely assortment of pastries, danishs, cakes and more.  (How on earth do you spell the plural of 'danish'?) 

They have a small sit-down area if you choose to nosh on your goodies straight away which is often the case with the small treats.  I find them nearly impossible to resist.

To compliment the sit-down area they have the Schaerer ""Otto"" coffee machine.  This particular machine is touted (by the manufacturer) as  ""the worlds largest super-automatic machine"" and is rated for steady production of 500 cups per hour.  I'm guessing they are only using 10-15% of that rated capacity at any one time and do sell a decent cuppa for $1.  (It's an americano folks)  They will serve the other drinks (caps, lattes, etc.) but since it's a super-automatic, they don't have a dedicated barrista that actually knows what to do.  That being said the machine is 100% idiot proof as super-automatics tend to be.

First off, I have been coming here for a couple years and have always been happy with the manicure and pedicure that I've gotten. HOWEVER, the service here has gotten so rude and although it has never been customer service oriented, it's hitting new levels of neglect and disappointment. 

My honey wanted to treat me to something special after lunch, so we opted for a manicure for me and a pedicure for him. His first one. They started in on his pedi right away and I had to wait for service which was fine, thanks to an empty massage chair. Then I was kicked out of the massage chair by a younger female worker who didn't speak English, but motioned me to go sit at the manicure table, which I did. I thought she was ready to work in my nails. She then said something loud and snarky in Vietnamese and shooed me away from the table. Oooooh k....Went back to the massage chair to sit next to my honey. 

Watched one worker bring out a bowl of cut up fruit and share it with another worker who was sitting idly at her nail station. Odd and unsanitary.

Then the stupid part: EVERY worker at the salon started having a fit about one of the larger fish in their tank nipping at some of the other fish in the tank. They literally stopped working on customers and were gathering around the tank talking loudly and trying to use a net to get at the fish!!! Mind you, we had already been here an hour and my nails had still not been started on. My honey was irritated because he was left sitting there with some burning foot lotion/gel on his feet and NO ONE was paying attention to customers!!!! What's more important, customers or your oversized goldfish?! They took photos if the fish and stood around looking at the pics.  WTF.

I honestly felt stupid for bringing my honey here. The service was horrible and NO ONE cared. I have a hard time being yapped at and motioned to in a foreign language. A basic (and courteous) understanding of the English language goes a long way in customer service. And no one likes to sit there while people talk shit in Vietnamese.

I hit fandango for the tickets and printed them out to bypass the line...but when we got there the scanning machines weren't working. Then they attempted to verify using the credit card I paid with, and the results came back that the bar code already was invalid. Turns out the first time it was scanned it did go through but the stub printer was out of paper.

In the meantime, a dozen people or so were already able to pay, get their stubs, and walk inside while we were waiting at the counter. It's like pulling into the drive through because you only see one car waiting, when in fact that person ordered 100 cheeseburgers. A good, time-saving and efficient concept (online ticketing) killed by simple interface error. Just my luck!

I had the veggie sandwich...it was good, but I thought it would be a sandwich made of veggies, not with a veggie patty.  The veggie patty was good as far as veggie patties go, but I just prefer veggies in their natural form.

Yesterday I walked in and waited about 10 minutes for my turn. The woman working the door/reception was the one who seated me at her station. When I arrived she asked my phone number and confirmed I was in their database, which I took to mean they would email me coupons, or some garbage like that.

I sat down, she tossed a plastic sheet over me and asked me if this was the way I normally wore my hair. I agreed, thinking she must be able to tell a little something about my last haircut by the way my hair currently looked. But then she whipped out a pair of clippers and proceeded to run it straight down the center of my head. 

I asked what she was doing, and she said it was ok because she was using a #4. I assume now that has something to do with the clipper attachment, but I did not ask for my head to be shaved, and certainly didn't ask for a #4. When I told her this, she replied that it was in the system that I preferred this. 

I don't know what their system says about me, but I can't understand why you wouldn't ask someone before shaving their hair off, especially if it was clear they didn't have that down last time. 

The part that really bothers me was the total lack of accountability. She quickly told me it wasn't her fault and that I should have said something before she did this. I assure you, there was no real time to react before she had already lopped off a good part of my hair. 

Since I didn't have much choice a this point, I told her to go ahed and finish what she started, never getting an apology. As a matter of fact, she was actually rude to me about the whole thing. 

I didn't tip her, which earned me a snarky comment I didn't quite catch as I walked out the door. 

Now I doubt this is a normal occurrence here, but I did feel compelled to warn people that whatever the computer says, these lemmings will do without checking. The misunderstanding wouldn't have been so bad, if not the addition of the attitude that came with it. I'm obviously not going back, and I would advice other to use caution.

Was assisted by a young female, twentysomething.
I'm no teener, going to frat bash. More of a retired professional going to a formal dinner.
The girl did no more than the absolute minimum to accomodate me. Did not answer my questions accurately, could barely be bothered. They do not have the rental items on site, and little in store to even look at. She very obviously could not care less about proper fit, I pretty much fitted myself.
Bottom line...over $200.
Monday I went to ""The Tux Lady"" in Mesa. Was given personal, experienced service and fitting. Got a NEW tux & accessories. $125.00.
Went back to Wearhouse, cancelled order and received refund.

Very disappointing experience in the produce isle!  Most of the food is either covered in mould or old and mushy! And yes I'm finding expired food on the shelves!!! Why even put it out for sale??


After reading the very low reviews, I felt I had to put inn my 5cents.
I do agree with many previous reviews; but that's in the past!
I myself have been very disappointed when there would be very minimal stock or non-whatsoever in items that I am interested in purchasing the day of. Especially organic
Milk for our children, it happened many times within the year that I have lived near this location. Due to this location being so close to my home I visit it regularly, it had occurred to me one day to approach a couple of managers and comment on the fact that they are constantly missing the product that I would come out to get.
RECENTLY they have really improved!
They regularly stock their product including the fresh produce, dairy and bread. I am also very proud to announce that they have started an organic section, including fresh produce and dairy even gluten-free products such as bread crackers and even some desserts!! It is not a full sized or a 'large' location, so they many not have every single item as some other locations, but they do have what you'd NEED.
And u will repeat, since it's what's most important to our family; they now have a brand new organic section(s) and gluten free!! 
So give it another shot! You may be pleasantly surprised!
I even mentioned to ones agent that I'm happy to see positive improvement. Including more cash registers open during busy times.
And when there's something I don't like, I'll mention it to someone, because that's the only way we can see change! 
There's still some more room for improvement, but we are moving in the right direction :)",2015-06-08 01:57:20

In a snapshot: Thematic, multiple rooms in one escape mission, immerse experience

It is a bit difficult to find the entrance to the location so if anyone is looking to try out LockQuest, keep in mind that it is next to a barber shop.To begin, we have to mention our gracious game hosts; they are enthusiastic, passionate, and make you feel excited to be there.

The room we did was called 'Escape the Book Club Killer' - their first and only room, thus far. In this escape room, you can fit up to 12 players! What we really enjoyed about this theme is that many escape locations name their thematic rooms as Egypt, Satan's lair, etc. but when you walk into the room, it is a room that is barely meeting the theme name. In regards to LockQuest, they understand that their thematic setting is in a bedroom / living room, so it was exactly as we had expected the room to look like when we entered which was great. They know the setting they are working with and they are not trying to become a totally different theme. Much appreciated and to be honest, it was quite refreshing NOT to be breaking out of another prison.

Not an extensive amount of technology/gadgets were involved with the room (although there definitely are some neat gizmos in there!!) but the story line was consistent throughout. Everything in the rooms are relevant to solving the underlying problem to escape and all the tools involved have a great flow, direction, and make sense as to why it is placed in the room. Speaking of technology, we realize how many escape locations focus solely on providing technology whether it's automation, touch pads, lasers, etc and its only a strong complementary part of a good escape game puzzle. Quality of puzzles should not be sacrificed with techno gadgets and LockQuest has done a superb job in proving this point.

Another aspect definitely worth mentioning was how the game hosts provided hints for your team. Since you will be the only team in that room, they will constantly monitor your progress and provide well timed hints to your team. You will never feel frustrated or stuck on a certain puzzle. In addition, the way the game hosts provide hints was absolutely on point with the theme of the room (we wish we could say more, but we can't ruin how awesome it is).

We were on the right track to escaping the room, but unfortunately we were unable to escape. Before leaving the facility, the game hosts showcase a really creative way to display our results from the room.

Did you escape? No

Would you recommend? Definitely! The types of puzzles and overall flow of the puzzles kept us interested and on our feet. Would visit again in a heart beat.",2014-11-24 19:21:41

Why?

Well for starters unless you go there when it opens it pretty dirty with napkins and bits of food on the floor and on the seats. No excuse for this.  Secondly, the bathrooms are ALWAYS disgusting.  Honestly I don't know how it passes inspection with the bathrooms alone.

It is a great location and the ice cream is pretty damn good. Nothing fancy. It's old school ice cream, and for that it's fantastic.  The non-ice cream items (burgers, sandwiches, etc) should be avoided. Just get the ice cream.

Finally, like others have said the owners (not so much the staff) are on the rude side.  I have seen customers get yelled at because they asked for their table or chair to wiped down.  Maybe over the years they have become jaded seeing the countless number of drunks coming in here and acting like they own the place.  I can tell you that when he was yelling at the customer above she was very polite and it was in the mid-afternoon.

First things first, customer service was great! We were greeted immediately and were told to choose any table we'd like. Deanne came over to get our drink order then came back to explain the specials of the day. She took great care of us and made sure we were enjoying our food. Make sure to ask for her! 

I was torn between the crab cake benedict and the fried chicken and waffles. They convinced me to get the waffles and I regret nothing. On top of the Belgian waffles was a dollop of strawberry butter -- yum yum!! The waffles were fluffy, chicken had flavor (not dry!), and Deanne made this sweet and spicy sauce for me to dip everything in -- syrup and Louisiana hot sauce, so simple! 

My friend ordered one of the day's specials: French toast. She added bananas and chocolates on top. It also came with many other things -- eggs, sausage patties, and toast (or grits). She was hesitant about the grits but wanted to be adventurous. Deanne assured her that if she didn't like it, she could bring her something else -- such great customer service!

Service level depended on what night you were there.  We stayed for three nights but I hung out there for two nights.  Each set of bartenders were different.  The bartender on Thursday night wasn't super friendly and took his time taking my order even though (or maybe because) I was the only person at the bar.  

Friday night was pretty lively...there was a one-man band and my bartender was hunky and nice.  Lots of drunk people (fall-down drunk older lady groping younger companions were plenty entertaining) and a good amount of dancing...

Tried to stop by Saturday night but there weren't two seats at the bar so hubby and I moseyed over to the other bar in the middle of the casino instead.  

Gin & juice for the win except the hunky bartender made it especially good and charged me $2 less for it, probably because he just made me a Grayhound which I suppose I preferred.

Honestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  

First off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  

Major issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.

My food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the ""from your grocer's freezer"" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.

Our spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place.",2013-02-14 02:19:36

An incredible life size bronze sculpture of the Crazy Girls - the showgirls who perfom in the Riviera Hotel.  Although the hotel has gone way downhill over the last few years and is overdue for either a serious facelift or a complete tear down and start over, the sculpture known as ""No if, ands, or . . . "" is still bringing good luck to all that have the courage to walk up to 7 or 8 six-foot tall women and rub their butts!  After 10 years out in front of the Riviera the ""butts"" are now shiny and show signs of serious rubbing.  It is obvious that some folks have had the courage to try and bring some good luck to their casino nights . . . or whatever.  

This remarkable sculpture was created by a life-casting artist from Arkansas, Michael Conine.  After casting the girls, he then took the forms to Shidoni Foundry, a bronze casting facility just north of Santa Fe, NM and had the entire thing cast in bronze.  After all the final details were completed it was shipped to Las Vegas and bolted to the front of the hotel, where it stands today.  A reminder of elegance of the past.  I'm sure the Crazy Girls will continue to bring luck to whomever has the courage to step forward and rub . . . and hopefully they will bring a little luck and a new life with 5 stars to the hotel.

I sure spend alot of time here at The District at Green Valley Ranch. I love the way the west side area of outdoor shopping center is set up.  It's pedestrian friendly, you dont have to watch out for cars because there is no road that runs thru the tree lined cobblestone streets.

The spongy ground in the play area and outdoor picture shows are nice touches that make it a kid friendly place. Also it's pretty neat how pet friendly it is, even some store owners have water bowls out for your furry friend. 

I take advantage of the nice weather to sit and have lunch or coffee outdoors also because there is no car traffic noise to deal with. When it gets pretty warm out they have the misters goin on to keep you cool. 

There's not a whole lot of clothing shops but I love the selection of ones they have here. It's mixture of mid range and upscale ones you cant find at the mall like Anthropologie, Loft, and Brightons.  There is something for everyone as far as restaurants though. Bbq at Lucille's, pizza at Balboa's and healthy fare at Rachel's Kitchen are some of the popular choices.  Parking spaces are usually pretty easy to find and retail stores are easily accessible thru entry points throughout the parking areas and pathway from Green Valley Ranch Resort and Casino.",2012-11-28 15:05:17

I haven't tried the sushi here yet, but the hibachi here is amazing. The chefs are friendly and do a great performance, and communicate with customers very well. It's a blast coming here, I have more fun here then I do at some entertainment shows on the strip. 
The overall design of the place is great, when you first walk in it's the normal restaurant, and a whole separate room for the hibachi. The colors are dark but not depressing, and it's an overall romantic ambiance that's perfect for evening dinners.

Fabulous Gatsby feel (all the bartenders looked swank) - The entire place looked amazing on all levels, dripping with feathers and glitz, authentic period pieces and art.
Trapeze artist, Jazz band and D.J,  and upon the ice rink were skaters gliding and dancing ..it was magical .

Everyone was decked out to the Gatsby max, flapper girls and fly guys galore were rolling in. This event was crowded and as i remarked in the beginning of this review it was a dash small so dancing was difficult especially where the band was set up as there was no real defined dance floor space, so we just plopped on the comfy couches and sipped our champagne digging the smooth jazz sound.
We were thankful we reserved a cabana because most areas outside the VIP areas were swamped. My adult children were looking forward to cutting some serious rug when they heard the DJ, however in the end it was a giant grind ..in this crush.

We all booked the overnight package for this event, so each couple got to stay in a room above a standard room - called the wonderful .This room was very close to 500sq ft and super clean. Nicely decorated,  with a king size feather bed with pillow top, the bed was very comfortable, and i cannot rave enough about the bathroom as the floor was gorgeous and tied in nicely with the stone features and frosted glass.
Decent sized flat screen tv and ipod docker and seating area. We also received complimentary champagne for the room and a snack assortment. 

Staff was wonderful( professional ,helpful,personable)

It was so wonderful to start my birthday and NYE dining at Sushi Roku, then stepping back in time at the Gatsby bash and finishing the evening in a really nice room .
This cost a few thousand to step back in time, and we did !
The W exceeded our expectations ...we had a blast .

I totally look forward to coming back !

Wait was super long and they definitely should have better prepared for the crowds. Waited 20+ minutes to order and receive my food because they had to ""make"" more ice cream. Their organizational system was pretty flawed and they kept handing out the wrong orders. People that ordered more recently got their ice cream before those that were waiting for much longer. Seems like they corrected that issue once we told them they must've put the receipts in reverse order.

I tried the vanilla ice cream with strawberry, cacao chips, and hemp granola. The toppings were great but I wasn't at all a fan of the vanilla ice cream. I did hear from someone else the chocolate ice cream tastes way better. 

Prices aren't cheap at all so prepare to pay $7-10 for a juice/smoothie. They do use all fresh, natural ingredients so maybe that's worth it for some folks. I may give this place another shot at some point if I'm ever craving a healthy juice/smoothie, only because of it's convenient location within Tempe Marketplace.

The menu is a lot, but we stuck to familiar fare. I ordered the chicken fajita bowl & hubby ordered a steak burrito. The steak is an upcharge, but no big. The salsa bar is awesome and has a nice variety, but only pico as a mild option. That's ok tho because their pico is DELISH! They brought us some complimentary chips and I fell in love with the freshness of both the chips and the pico. Our plates came out fairly quickly and they both looked great. The meat is a little skimpy. I had a crazy veggie to meat ratio with a lot more beans and rice than meat. Hubby was a little disappointed that his burrito was mostly rice and very little steak for the extra price, but he ate most of the meat and left the filler.

Other Mama

If you are looking for something different, this is your place. 
For example, I had a fresh oyster, topped with uni and ikura. ..what a creative combination!  
Next, I had a Crab and Caviar hand roll. ..wow...I enjoyed the crab flavor, didn't taste too much caviar, but noticed a slight ""kick"" in it - that was fun! 
Then, had uni, nigiri style...yum! Don't you agree that uni is like butter from the ocean? 
Last, but not least, I had half a dozen NY Prime Oysters. I got a chance to select 2 dipping sauces so I picked Honey Lemon and Ponzu...  great variations for enhanced oyster experience! 

The above 4 items were some of the specials of the day. There were more items on the regular menu and I understand that those change once in a while. 

They service was excellent - maybe because I sat at the counter.  The ambiance was intimate and quiet. I imagine that it could get busy later in the evening as I had gone close to opening time. I liked the free parking and the cute decorations inside the restaurant!

The shrimp and mushrooms came in a bubbling pot of delicious white wine, butter and herbs, and the zucchini and mozzarella served with marinara were simply wonderful.

Each of us ordered a steak for dinner, he ordered the special - a bone in ribeye with onion fritte, and I had the filet minion char-grilled which was served with portabello.  The steaks were enormous - we each ate only half.  They were well cooked, and truly wonderful, however we both thought the sauces were a bit heavy/salty (each steak had a different sauce) and in the future we would ask for it served on the side.  The wine also left a bit to be desired, nothing was ""wrong"" with our glasses, but they did not really have anything to our taste of big bold wines (which was surprising at a steakhouse).  

The key lime pie was a sweet treat at the end - we thought it was pretty delicious.  I would skip the chocolate decadent dessert in the future unless you are truly a chocolate lover... it was a bit like eating a slab of fudge.

Sometimes their scoop sizes are not consistent: depending on who works there, you might get tiny or huge scoops. They usually have around 5 flavours available, 1-2 vegan options/sorbets. Their hazelnut gelato is my personal favourite. They always mix up their flavours, it's never the same one week compared to the other so you can try new ones when you go back a couple of days later.

Meatballs ($12)
Came with 4 meatballs. The waitress hyped up the meatballs so we decided to give it a try. Gotta admit it tasted pretty good.

Prosciutto Parmigiano Pasta
Apparently this location makes fresh pasta every day. Although from the picture it looks like there wasn't a lot of cheese sauce mixed with the pasta, the pasta was pretty cheesy and creamy. The prosciutto really brought out more flavor to the pasta which was good. 

My boyfriend ordered their daily special steak for his main. This was disappointing, especially considering it was $40! Not sure if it was because we came here after visiting Jacobs not too long ago, but regardless the steak was nothing special and overpriced.

And, I'm sure I'm not the only person who had cried over a bad hair cut. In the past I've resented paying top dollar to have my hair cut by a pompous stylist who would make me wait like he was the president of the United States so he could put the finishing touches on some jerk's faux-hawk for a hot night out, but would suffer through it because I knew he could handle my curls.

Enter Rob King. (Well, a chic named Erica, actually.) I always pay attention to curly hair and, when I see a person with great curls, ask where they get their hair cut. I was skeptical when I heard about Rob and Secrets salon. His rates were less than half of what I was used to paying... but Erica's hair looked so good, I decided to give it a shot. 

Secrets is a modest salon next to Sprouts around 28th Street and Indian School. I'd guess there are about six chairs, but the most stylists I've ever seen at one time has been three. It's quiet and simple. Unpretentious: a welcome change from what I had endured. They even put out a plate of cookies, which is a nice treat! 

I've been back three times since the first visit and always with great results! The cut is well executed and I don't have to wait a week or so for it to ""grow out.""  (Seems like some people don't realize that curly hair ""shrinks"" when it dries.)  As it's grown out, I have not wound up with, what I call, ""puppy ears."" The shape stays pretty well maintained. And, the cost savings has allowed me to integrate color on a more regular basis. Best part: Rob really loves cutting hair (""I've got a great goal for your hair,"" he tells me!!). It's his passion AND his gift.

The reason it's four stars instead of five actually has more to do with me than the salon. I like to wait as long as possible between hair cuts and, as you might imagine, I'm not the only person trying to get an appointment with this talented guy, so at least once I've had to have another Secrets stylist do my hair. The good side is that she did a great job (especially on the styling) but I'm a loyal gal and I don't like being tossed back and forth between stylists. Granted, I can manage this by scheduling my appointments in advance... I will work on it.",2009-01-29 21:41:36

A good way to keeps hands busy as well throughout the meal (not a chance of awkward hand holding) but dimly lit enough to make it feel intimate. 

Being overly prepared we called in advance and made a reservation for two along with a toddler requiring a booster seat. Upon arrival right before the dinner rush around 2:45 pm Saturday we were promptly seated and greeted and drinks came out immediately afterwards. Seemed to be the best time to come because it was empty when we first got in and filled right up starting at 3:15. The ice tea was delicious, we had refills. I noticed that the booths basically were benches and were kind of uncomfortable, with a very utilitarian feel that assured me that men probably love flocking here for happy hour with their buddies. I was not wrong once I saw the happy hour menu as it was mostly geared towards beers. We dove right into the menu and ordered pork belly and marinated Kalbi strips to bbq with rice on the side ($1.95) and I ordered the Korean soft tofu soup with seafood. 

Our server was attentive, not overtly friendly but helpful. Since it was just us two girls and we don't eat much we didn't get any appetizers or dessert. The first thing to come out first were the sides, which you get complimentary if you order at least two bbq dishes. There was a variety of them, what I noticed was the pickled vegetables were good, the kimchi was great and the bean sprouts were bland, but that was fine with me. Throwing them in the marinade they provide for dipping might help. Then our meats and my soup arrived. Oh my, delicious. We threw the meats on and I dug into my stew and it was instant love. Although the stone pot it comes in may seem small, the portion was perfect for me. The chef made it perfectly spicy, with a kick of kimchi taste and an egg cracked right in. There was a respectable amount of seafood in there which I appreciated, and the meats, once seared with a nice crust, were super yummy. I only needed half of the large helping of rice that came with my soup before I was full. 

I then turned to the sangria which I order partway through my meal just to try. It was delicious, but made with a dry red wine I didn't love, with blueberries and raspberries floating within. Perfect sweetness though so no complaints, I'm just more of a non-dry white wine person. If you enjoy red, get the sangria. If not, the plum wine might be a better choice as I love Asian plum wines, plus it's cheaper. As a side note, the women's restrooms are well-kept and clean but no place to change your baby so not too friendly for families with babies.

The Farm Burger was absolutely nothing to write home about.  5 Guys, Habit Burger and In and Out Burgers are dramatically better than Joe's Farm Burger.  The lamb burger was so rich, it caused my wife stomach distress for two days after.  The full rack of ribs was dry and the sauce was non-exceptional.  Garlic fries were garlicky, too much so and the onion rings were just onion rings, nothing new or better.  Sitting outside in the evening was chilly--they do not offer heat lamps.  Prices are on the high side, especially considering the quality of the food.  I have no idea at all why people wait in line for an hour or more to eat this food.

I usually run to the few aisles of baking stuff first and stay there for a bit looking at all the colored candy melts, fun sprinkles, and variety of shaped baking pans.  Then I wander through the random crafts aisles that follow, like the scrapbooking, and the jars/baskets, and the wooden letters aisle (I don't know why I love those wooden letters so much, I've never bought them but I love to look at them).

Premium spicy tuna good. Lettuce was interesting. Not fully sure how i feel about it really, but the fish was very fresh. I think next time i would opt for the standard. They marinate at time of making so you can request a spicy level.

The salmon yuzu style was good. Great quality fish, perhaps a bit too much lemon juice. Was not overly seared which is a good thing.

The popcorn shrimp was good, not great. An interesting concept, and tasty but missing....something...maybe if it had been on a bed of wakame...yes that would have done it...maybe some grated lemon rind and grated serrano chili...?

The bacon wrapped scallops were good. Huge scallop, tasty bacon, well cooked. Simple and elegant. For me, i prefer them with some teriyaki, but i am a foreign-devil.

The kumamoto on a spoon. How can you go wrong! Well, they definitely didnt. That said, i changed up the second one...for the better for me at least. I pulled some of the daikon root off (about half) and a chopstick tip worth of the green and then added 2 drops of soy sauce and two chopstick tips of wasabi. Then it was amazing. The wasabi didnt take away from the oyster, but left an awesome after taste and the daikon no longer overpowered the wonders that are a kumamoto!

The duck was good. A bit plain, but very simple and tasty.

The hamachi with cilantro was derishous. Mayhaps my favorite thing i had

The sashimi was very fresh. The albacore stood out the most

The fuji apple desert was good. A great set of flavors. A great experience all in all.

My date had to ask a few different people for his soft drink several times.

I could tell he was profiling his tables and spending the majority of his time with the wealthiest looking table in his section. His SA was very pleasant, and very attentive. The food runner did auction off our entrees, which is something that I'm not accustomed to at establishments like this, but was very pleasant. The portion size of the bacon wrapped shrimp was awkward since there were two people enjoying it, but the sauce was to die for, and the shrimp AND bacon were cooked perfectly.

They even took it out and set it up with us in the store so it was just plug and go once we got home.",2011-04-04 23:31:59

 That little detail really factored into my low rating.  I dont get how business owners are going to inconvenience customers by making them pay at an atm to get out money or walk to their bank just so they dont have to pay the service charge.  Also our first impression was the cook outside infront of the building, smoking as we entered.  So after we ordered 2 cod and chips portions and the total came to $18.06.  Now being in retail i always give people an extra penny, this guy would not take $18.05.  so i know none of this has to do with food, so lets get to it.  I love cod, even though its the cheapest i always find it delcious.  This had no taste.  The only reason i gave Chippy's 2 stars was bc their chips were so good.",2009-12-09 19:48:09

The wait time was approximately 30 minutes. Once we were seated, we found out brunch was only available on Sundays which was a little disappointing.

The decor was new and the seating was a mix of booths and tables. The spacing between the tables were well thought out. The tables far are enough, so you are comfortable eating and not worried about bumping into your neighbours table once you get up.

I decided on the classic breakfast ($9) which consisted of either white or brown toast, two eggs, potatoes and a choice of either hickory bacon, beef bacon or sage sausage with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice ($3). The classic breakfast was nicely done, the eggs were perfectly done (sunny side up), the potatoes were perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned and the toast was perfect. The bacon could have been a little bit crispier for my liking.

My friend ordered Joe Fries ($14) which consisted of bacon brisket sloppy joe, fresh cut fries, sriracha mayo with a fried egg accompanied by a regular coffee ($2.50 and bottomless). The dish was pretty good, the fries were nicely done and crisp but not too crisp and the bacon brisket sloppy joe was really good, nicely seasoned, flavourful and moist. My friend also mentioned that the coffee was fresh and qood.
The portions for this particular dish was quite large.

The server was friendly and overall I would say that the service was good but not great.

Next time I'm in the area on a Sunday I'll definitely drop by to try their brunch menu.",2013-11-11 05:14:02

Don't expect anything fancy - this is a dive with greasy ""bar food""and cheap drinks. What is not to love?

We popped in here around 8:30p on a Thursday night and could not wait to try one of their famous burgers! I ordered the cheese Wineburger with American cheese and mushrooms. YUM doesn't even describe the goodness of this burger - it was super juicy and literally melted in my mouth. Not to mention, IT WAS HUGE anddddd....I ate it all! {#noshame}. It was under $10 and worth every penny. The best part, all of their Svedka vodka drinks were only $3!!! Yes, $3!! They even had cucumber! Um, yes please! They also have daily specials that are a steal - $6.50 for an entire meal, can't beat that! My husband and I walked out with 2 meals and 2 cocktails for under $25.

It was around 3ish and we had our choice of seating so we picked a table outside along the bocce court. It was so cool, breezy and open that I loved it immediately. The giant glass windows in the back  give the outside a real modern, open feel while the inside/bar area is more dark, cozy and den-like. Both nice places to hang.

We were famished and started with the palate pleasing artichoke and crab dip. It is served with these perfectly seasoned crackery triangles that are awesome all by themselves but dynamite paired with the creamy dip. We also tried the ""hot vings"" appetizer  which were covered in a sweet and spicy sauce that was very well received at our table. 

Being a Sunday, we were able to take advantage of half price bottle day and split a bottle of chardonnay with our lunch/dinner= linner? I had the salmon with asparagus which was really good except for the sweet corn cake that came with it. That managed to be both hard and gummy and tried its best to spend the rest of the meal plastered on the back of my throat. The salmon was perfect and so was the asparagus, I just wish there had been more of it. 

I tasted the steak sandwich which was pretty good but if you don't like onions you will abhor it because its loaded with grilled ones. The standout on the plate was definitely the sweet potato fry dipping sauce. It was a dirty yellow and red flecked curry flavored sauce that was great on everything! Next time I""m there I will order a side no matter what I""m eating.

I also tasted the grilled veggie sandwich and found it incredibly  hearty full of flavor! And it also benefited from the curry sauce. 

After all of this good food and wine I was sooo ready for a nap. The Vig Uptown was impressive and I know that I will be back again soon.",2010-04-21 21:33:09

I'll start off by saying that there is nothing fatally flawed in the place, and the concept is quite good. Combined with Churn and DeMarco's I consider it a hipster urbanist interpretation of a  shopping mall food court for the 30-50 demographic. Everything in it speaks in some way to those who were in high school or college in the mid-eighties through mid-nineties. Let me take a moment to gloat: My BROTHERS AND SISTERS! WE ARE IN THE RICH PART OF THE NOSTALGIA CURVE NOW! ENJOY! Anyway, the concept and decor is great and just works.

What's wrong? Well, the food. Everything I have ordered off the appetizer menu is either too salty or not quite there in some way. Portion was too small or was over/underdone. I don't mind the fact that they don't really have any happy hour specials to excite and entice, but  if there's no discount to convince me that I am somehow getting a deal, the food better be terrific. And it isn't. The groups I've been with have left half portions of small plates that should have been wiped clean.

What else? The service was noticeably slow and a bit cold each time I was there. Yes, I get it: You're young, attractive and hip and are probably working on a screenplay that will sensitize all of us to the ecological plight of the pygmy eskimo wombat, and working this mind-numblingly-dull waiter job is such a condescension. Just bring me a beer.

Also, the music is too loud. I didn't like most of that stuff the first time around, but I'll indulge it for nostalgia's sake. 

Anyway, not bad but not quite a destination. Needs some work.",2011-09-25 16:23:49

We were headed elsewhere, but popped into Streets when we noticed they were open. The space is nicely decorated,  it offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere, with a large dining room and bar with a few taps. The sign suggested seating yourself so we grabbed a table in the center of the dining room.

We sat a little too long before someone came over. Our drink order was taken but we weren't certain what we wanted, a menu would be nice. He realized and brought two over. We had questions about slices that he couldn't answer. He walked off and I thought he was going to ask, but ended up on another task. Our waitress came over. Fortunately, she was able to help. Slices are pre-baked as cheese pizza and they add whatever toppings you like. 

She further explained they've been open two weeks in this location and the original location is up north. We mentioned this was our first visit and we'd like to know what's best to order. She suggested the slices, chicken parm, eggplant rollatini and a couple subs. I went with two slices: sausage and pepperoni. My husband chose the eggplant with penne.

Breadsticks were brought over with marinara sauce. The sauce was more of a paste which I don't care for, but my husband didn't mind it. The breadsticks were ok. Rosati's does these too and theirs are warmer, crisper and more chewy. They were too similar not to compare them. 

While we waited we noticed the restaurant had a lot of bodies, few customers (us and another table) and waits were longer than expected. I've never seen so many people moving about but doing absolutely nothing. Our waitress and the other checked on us periodically so service wasn't bad it just was up to par.

Finally our food was served. The pizza didn't look particularly appetizing, but I dug in. The sausage was terrible. I took two bites to confirm. It tasted like frozen pizza. My husband wouldn't even eat it and he eats most everything. He thought it tasted like microwavable pizza. The pepperoni was a bit better when loaded with chili flake. It was cooked more evenly  too. 

The pasta and eggplant rollatini were a bit better, but the eggplant wasn't heated all the way through. It was still cold in the center. We waited way too long and paid too much for what seemed to be microwaved eats. The bill was $23, usually I'd consider that pretty affordable, but in this case?  It was too much.

They have a lot of work to do. There are several solid pizza joints nearby, they will have to seriously step up their game to even begin to compete.",2013-01-20 20:32:53

Had the opportunity to sit out in the patio where you have front row seats (from the back) of the fountain show.  The location was enough to make this a 5 star location.  Every 15 minutes, you are enchanted by the fountains of Bellagio.  What else do you need?  You can get full of that! But luckily, this place serves amazing food as well.

Seafood Platter:  A medley of raw oysters, raw clams, lobster, king crab legs, mussels, shrimp and a mixture of dipping sauces.  The oysters were extremely fresh and sweet.  The lobster was cooked well.  Not chewy.  The king crab legs were brine-y but also sweet in flavor.  The shrimp may have been one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever had.

Filet Mignon: Ordered medium rare and it came out medium rare.  What a shocker.  No matter where I go, it's always so hard to get a steak delivered to your preference.  The meat was tender, not salty.  Dip it in their special soy dipping sauce, which the waiter said goes well with anything, and you are in carnivore heaven. After the platter,  you don't have any more space for the whole filet but you will want to eat it all.

Truffle Mashed Potatoes:  Creamy, rich goodness with the essence of truffle throughout.  SOOOO Good.  A must try when you are there.  Sprinkles of truffle on top.  Be shady and just scoop the top layer so you can get all the truffle flavor that your taste buds can handle.

The service was also amazing.  Waiters (and waitresses) were very attentive: always refilling water, refilling wine, providing details of the dishes and always asking if everything is OK.  Very polite and also very personable.

The hotel is huge and is a few steps away from Calgary Tower.  It could easily host a large conference or other big venue.  The week I arrived happened to be Calgary Pride Week, so the entire parking lot was full and many streets were blocked off.  Luckily the bellman showed me where to park for free across the street.

Things I liked about the hotel:
+ Spacious, comfortable rooms with powerful shower, mostly comfy beds (firm mattress, but wished pillows were softer).
+ Gym: Small, but clean and equipped with machines, dumbbells, and cardio equipment.  They have a pool and jacuzzi too.
+ Wifi: Free and powerful.
+ Restaurants: Thomsons is an excellent brunch buffet that I'll review separately.  They also have a decent coffee shop with pastries, snacks, and sundries.

Things I didn't like as much:
- No restrooms in the lobby area - in fact you need to sneak through the bar of Thomsons.
- Limited self and valet parking.  The driveway to access the lot is rather narrow, and I was surprised it filled up that quickly.

We spent the entire afternoon (about 6 hours) here hiking and exploring, and still weren't able to see everything.

During this summer, they have concert events where you can picnic and listen to everything from classic rock to polka which sounds like such a blast, but is a bit too far of a hike for us on a week day night.

I am confused. Are they saying they only serve soup for lunch and pull whatever is left at 3? This would mean they don't offer soup for dinner. No need to go on at this point and I hope somebody from the store sees this post.

I came here a few times when I was in college at UNLV (back in the day, I remember how small it was- small parking lot too- and that it was busting at the seams- another location opened near Chinatown BTW). Our most recent visit was when a good friend was moving to another state- it's her favorite bar. I didn't eat- it was a little too late for me. A couple of our friends did and their food looked good. I did sample a few fries. We had a couple drinks while remembering all the good times. The server was really nice and came around often, checking on us. Since it was wednesday night, it was karaoke night- which made it more fun- it's great hearing people perform- some people are so animated. We hung out for a few hours. There was a good crowd but it wasn't as crowded as it would be on a weekend, I imagine. 

I am interested in trying the fish and chips sometime, since I hear that it is a specialty of theirs- being an authentic British pub and all. The atmosphere is rich dark woods and heavy furniture (chairs). It is a little dark inside too.  

Just a note, be careful with the step on the way (from the front of the bar to the other side of the bar, on the way to the bathroom, I totally missed it and fell! I was ok, though, just a little embarassed, but not sure many people even noticed it.",2010-12-20 19:26:13

WT-zqE5kGeqCHWkekKwn6Q,-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,IRd74NCWiC_ybtMw4cHYSg,4,11,4,4,"Location is downtown near the Eau Claire market, and my YMCA search continues.  

Luckily my neighbour works at this Y, and he has kindly given me passes to general locker room access and women's plus facilities.

First of all let me start with location, this is very central, downtown to be exact so what is our first hurdle? Parking! Parking downtown can be such a beyotch.  

Choices range from anywhere at Eau Claire market to surface parking with park plus at 5 to 8 dollars an hour, yes you read me correctly between 6am to 5 pm. Or simply pay an early bird rate of $25 dollars - $28 dollars maximum for the whole day.  If you go to the gym 3 times a week this will cost you well you do the math. Damnnnnn.  

So your best bet is the Calgary Curling Club during peak hours of 5 am - 6pm, which is one dollar for the first four hours and then 2 dollars thereafter.  This is located at 720 3 Street NW.

After 5pm, 2 dollars flat rate at Eau Claire market or surface parking and again your best bet is Calgary Curling Club which is free.  My head is in a confused tizzy, what the heck just take a bus there.

Okay let's get to the facility, nice facility, clean with two swimming pools, an indoor runny track, cardio and weight equipment and 50 drop in classes each week. There are two fitness studios, a full size gym, and a squash and racquetball/handball court.   This is all accessible at $59.11 a month and this Membership fee gives you access to all YMCAs in the city.

Now the beauty about this gym is that you have a Membership plus upgrade which gets you  whirlpool and steam pool access, private exercise and TV lounge area, you are given towel service and personal care products and there is laundry service but this is for men only. This is $77.31 a month for women and $91.53, wow that laundry perk is 20 bucks more, but then again have you done a man's laundry? 

There is also personal training staff that can assist you with personal training and you can anywhere from 1 to 40 sessions.

My visits have so far been very pleasant especially the member plus option, the comfy towels, blow dryers and curling irons are a nice touch, but what I love the most is the whirlpool and steam room comforts! 

The service is impeccable and the staff is extremely friendly, so if a downtown location is what you need you have several great options at this facility.  

I am docking a star because I think there should be a much affordable parking perk built in to the YMCA membership.",2009-12-05 20:48:47
0t_iLLJOvz8VWZO-J-qi9Q,7KfPI_otF_Lw27dL_y0aag,bEyd0DDhnLGVLIS0bJlR9g,5,8,2,1,"I was worried.  As in, very worried.  What in the world was I doing, going to a Great Clips in Steelyard?  Why was I even considering going anywhere other than the expensive salon I'd been going to for years?

Reasons: Cost and Time.

It takes weeks, as in WEEKS to get a hair appointment.  By that time, not only is my hair even more grown out, but inevitably, something else comes up that night that i have to cancel on because of a hair appointment.  Even the haircut takes more time (ahem, I'll admit, there is some credibility to skill equating to time, I get that).  Then I leave with a $80 bill and blow-dried hair.

So I tried Steelyard's Great Clips on a whim.  I needed a haircut and I didn't want to wait or pay for a salon price.  Now that I've gone to the ""dark side"", I may never go back!  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  My shampoo was great - in fact, I was thinking I could just visit for the $5 head massage!  My hair was cut exactly as I'd instructed (1.5 inches off, layering and a face frame) and it was blow-dried with no frills, no gel, just like I like it.  I'm very happy!!

In the midst of this, the whole staff bantered back and forth, it was a fun atmosphere.  The only negative I could think of was that the stylists seemed to constantly be counting their tips.  I felt obligated to tip.  Then again, I should feel obligated to tip and $24 for a shampoo, cut,blow-dry and tip, is MORE than enough of a deal for me.  

ps: Another negative?  Extra cash in hand...which I promptly spent at Marshalls on a new dress.  Oops??",2014-03-24 20:51:08

That was the way I fet on each venture (there were many!) to Pho Ao Sen, which ofrmerly occupied this space.

That is NOT the case with this ""Replacement"" for Pho Ao Sen, of which I said the following in my Review.

          The Pho was ""ambrosia."" Very aromatic, nice amount of meat and delicious!

Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the New ""Replacement."" Don't get me wrong, NOT bad Pho, just NOT what had been in this location. It is still a beautiful Restaurant and the Pho is okay, but would NOT be rated among my ""Top 5."" 

Also unfortunate that the unique ""Best Springrolls in Phoenix"" are no more and the new ones are quite usual. Such a shame to lose at least the second best bowl of Pho in Phoenix (I have been to most!).

Although the entire plaza has always looked old and ghetto. The food wasn't outstanding, but it was good enough and you had no reason to complain about the prices.

I have ordered a variety of food here, but nothing really stands out. The fried shrimp has never let me down. But then again, fried shrimp pretty much tastes the same everywhere. I do like the sweet potato tots and they do give you a generous portion of them. The clam chowder that I had once was tasty and my husband said that the fish and chips was good here.

It attracts some of the types of people I try to stay away from (perhaps you've seen me mention wannabe hipsters in other reviews, especially about downtown places?), but most of the time I can overlook that. I might come back more often if the service were better and the drinks were cheaper. I had been handed a free drink coupon by one of their staff during some event I was at, and when I returned a few months later and gave it to my friend to use, the bartender not only refused to honor it, but also confiscated it from him and threw it away. WTF? There was no manager around at the time for us to consult with. That whole experience was a huge turn-off. Other times, a few of the different bartenders just haven't been that friendly, and they also didn't pour their drinks very well. (To be fair, some of them are very friendly and/or can also pour well; I just wish that extended to the entire bar staff). Normally, I just stick to going to Lady Silvia only on nights when Rock & Roll Wine does their free tastings there, or to stop in for a quick happy hour drink pre-First Friday activities.",2013-01-21 01:17:42

My husband received a coupon via email for $14 off an oil change. He called yesterday and asked if he had to print it out or of he could just bring in his phone. They told him he could show it on his phone, and then my husband informed them he'd be in the next day to redeem it. They said okay. So fast forward to today (1/24). My husband shows the guy the coupon when he went to pay, and the guy said he wouldn't accept it because they were already running a $10 off deal. Obviously we knew we weren't going to get $14 off the already discounted price, so we just asked him to price it at regular price then give us the $14 off since our coupon was worth more. He didn't budge. We had another coupon for 15% of the other services they did but they still wouldn't take it. So I'm angry for two reasons: 1) our coupons were completely invalid when they shouldn't have been and 2) nobody told my husband that he couldn't use it when he called about it yesterday. Although it was only 4 dollars, it's really the principle. We didn't even get an apology for this inconvenience. Pretty poor customer service on their behalf.

We don't really have much choice, so we frequent here about once a month or so.  The pricing is a little high, but the restaurant is nicer than most Mexican restaurants out there, and the food is decent for North Scottsdale.  I should clarify that we only order 3 things here....EVER.  The tableside guac, and the beef or chicken fajitas, and MARGARITAS! The chicken enchiladas are o-kay, the cream sauce is seriously on the rich and heavy side. Don't order their crunchy tacos, the shell is like something from a grocery store shelf!   

We order the beef fajitas medium rare and it is more than enough for two people especially  with the guacamole.  When the server is making the guac, don't let him add the entire 'spice'  mix...if you let him your guac will be a salt lick..unless you like that...

Chips and salsa aren't bad...I'm not super huge into the roasted tomato thing, but nothing is perfect I guess.  Still good.  Maybe one day we will venture away from the fajitas, or then again, maybe not :)",2010-09-28 01:06:39

They didn't disappoint. Dinner consisted of crab legs, oysters, fried shrimp, clams, white fish, chicken, beef broccoli, etc. hate to say it but they cook similar to my mom but better. Yes, it's sad. I have one of those moms. Where I really don't want to go home and eat her cooking. The selection here is pretty decent. I did not bother to try sushi bc I go to a sushi restaurant for those. But it looked ok. The oysters were pretty good.

They had 4 soups of wonton, beef, sweet and sour, egg drop, the usual suspects. So the wonton soup was only ok but I stuck green onions on my beef broth as it was good enough. I find that coming in with low expectations makes everything not that bad. They had quite a few desserts. The macaroons are soft and tasted ok. Had grapes and watermelon for dessert. Watermelon was crunchy.

Service was ok. Most smiled at me as I passed them and my plates miraculously disappeared when I came back. I dined Han Solo so had a chance to actually eat and observe quite a bit. I don't know why ppl complain so much for a $14 dinner buffet. A Korean and Japanese one starts at $26.

qxHBWodjxrgkUFdanDDZkg,I2K4dZgIyrfvgp63fyjs2A,6n_MDeYxU1ihB38be9TkVA,3,2,1,1,"If you head over to Sushi on Bloor any given night during the dinner rush, you will see a line going straight out of the door.  Luckily enough, with two floors of efficiently used space, the wait for a table is generally going to be pretty painless, especially if you have a small party.  

I can't argue that it's popularity is unfounded - the place is nice to look at, the staff is quick and friendly, and the food is pretty good.  I've heard some hard core sushi fans complain about the sushi, but I like it very well thank you.  Then again, I', someone who likes lots of appetizers with a few maki rolls loaded up with all kinds of fatty extras (tempura bits, avocado rolls, etc), so I'm not exactly demanding plate after plate of flawless sashimi either.

The best thing to do if you're set on S.O.B. (as I lovingly call it) on a busy night is to step in, leave your name and ask if you can come back later.  They will usually gladly give you a return time when a table will be ready, and you can then use your time to go grab a beer at futures or something.  Polite as Torontonians are, I've never seen such bad behavior as people dealing with the hosts at SOB.  Which is ironic considering there is hardly a dearth of sushi in the Annex.  

My favorite items on the menu are pretty basic but also very tasty: the crunchy roll, spicy salmon roll, and the Salmon Dragon Roll is really nice if you like unagi (eel). They also have a lot of vegetarian rolls and appetizers, so your veggie friends aren't stuck eating only cucumber rolls and veggie tempura.  For non-sushi items, you can't go wrong with the cloquette (crispy fried balls of mashed potato with veggies inside and served with dipping sauce), chicken karaage.  The bento options are forever popular as well.

My very favorite part of a trip to SOB is not just the food, but the service.  Unlike some of the more bare-bones sushi houses, SOB without fail will bring you tea or water when you sit down, and miso soup soon to follow.  If you order bento or a combo, you will also get salad in short order.  And at the end, they give you ice cream on the house even if you just got an appetizer.  So, worth the wait in line after all!",2008-11-19 02:28:26

We stopped by after walking away from another dealership in the middle of paperwork. I had no intention of getting a VW (truth be told, I thought it would be beyond my price point). We were promptly greeted by our sales guy, Michael Thomas, who has outstanding customer service skills and is a great listener. 

We described what we were looking for and emphasized our price point and he led us right to a car that met the criteria. From there, it came down to finding ""the perfect car."" Michael was patient and even allowed us to drive multiple vehicles as we compared the options. 

It must be a fun place to work: his fellow co-workers came together to get some great options out there for us as well -- a friendly competition that in no way felt  targeted at us (the customer). 

The entire experience was super low pressure -- in fact, we left for a bite to eat and to think about the pricing and when we called back close to closing time to assure them we were still interested but were still at the restaurant there was no urgency. We just pushed the negotiating to the next day.

Michael has greeted me by name every time I've returned to the dealership: for paperwork, to take delivery or to have them do a biosweep to get the faint smell of smoke out of the car ( that only I and other former smokers could pick up on and; which, so far as I can tell, was really effective!).

It truly has been a great experience. I'm super happy with my purchase so far and I've already referred someone to the dealership!

My compliments (and thanks) to Michael and the rest of the folks who helped on this purchase.

Our group of 4 was scheduled to go to Coca Cafe for about 3 weeks.  Arrived and reservations were perfect and wew set by a nice window seat for late afternoon St. Pat's day celebrations.  Place is immaculate, and oddly retro artsy.  A fun exploration visually, and with a walk around to the sunny back room area, one could see just how much space they had created in this small area for customers.  There is even an outdoor seating area (for later this spring).

BYOB but a very minimal PER TABLE corkage.  None of the rip off per bottle regardless of how small or large your party might be. The fact they do a PER TABLE corkage has now ruled out even experimenting with places that was a $5-7 per bottle...   Really?

Seated immediately; water to table; drinks very fast indeed.  We ordered a cheese plate sampler -- the goat cheese / blue cheese (forgot the name) was excellent.  Explanation of the range of cheeses professional. Slow, even pace of visits by the waitress -- no rush, no push, even as the place was filling up.  FYI -- when we left at 8, there was not a single seat available in the place.  As we were readying to go, there were two more groups ready for our table.  They are doing something right. But were not under any pressure to move and relax where we were.  None.  

Brisket, Brisket, sake marinated Cod -- all perfectly done with extra care on the presentation.  Anyone can slop food on a plate but few groups know how to properly arrange it visually.  White China -- what else.  The Cod marinade was done exactly correctly.  Most fu-fu places cook the fish until it is unrecognizable -- this was done closer to the raw side, which is my favorite (specially if one has lived in Japan and understand a bit about actual fish that is not-flash frozen.

Double espresso was nice.  Wine service could not have been better.  As the cafe loaded up with so many people, the waitresses were becoming stretched, BUT, honestly had everyone under control.  Busing to/from tables gentile.  Kitchen staff filtered out as necessary to keep things moving.  This felt like a slow meal in Athens, Greece actually, or an off broadway bistro in NYC. On a slower night we probably would have stayed another hour and chatted more. 

Menu was 14"" long and narrow.  With fresh paper for each.  None of crap recycle plastic over paper one finds so often. We were tempted for dessert but the meal was ample.  Next time, we will start with desserts...  Prices were very reasonable for the quality of experience.  

A dozen (yes) people came by carrying their bottles of wine and looked in the window to realize it was full, then moved on.  Noses pressed to the glass type of looking in... 

We are interested in a repeat visit for the breakfast and brunch, then a visit to the strip district perhaps.  

Some reviews from a year ago have ""issues.""  I didn't see a single issue last night worthy of any comment.  I wish Coca Cafe had a place up in the Cranberry area which is apparently the ""good food desert"" for western PA.

For $20.13 I received an amuse bouche of super addictive cheesy, garlic bread, a cup of white bean soup, 2 margherita pizza slices and a vanilla ice cream sandwich with a shot of blood orange soda.

Everything was super delicious; the soup was nice and hearty (although I could've done without the dried herbs) and the pizza was super delicious. For dessert I expected a run-of-the-mill ice cream sandwich, what I got was a sandwich comprised of two galletes with vanilla ice cream, how cool is that? The blood orange soda is made in house and was amazing as well. 

The service was great as well; our waitress told us a ittle about the chf and asked us where else we were going to go for RW. She recommended Sage, which I tried at RW when it opened and is mind-blowing.

I made reservations as a Yelp friend had recommended well in advance of the date I wanted.  I had a ticket to see 'O' at 7:30 and this was one of the Bellagio restaurants that I never went to and also one that opens at 5 giving me plenty of time to enjoy dinner and not worry about making the show on time.

I was seated promptly after a few parties ahead of me.  I was taken to a side room in the front--not one of the coveted center tables directly overlooking the fountains--but it was a really nice room and I could see much of the fountain show in any case.  My servers were Team #18.  I'm not sure if the waiter gave me his name or not.  If he did, I missed it.  He asked about drinks, gave me the menu, and explained some of the things on the menu.  I was also brought a nice selection of bread and some butter.  The bread had been warmed nicely.

I started with the tomato gazpacho.  The bowl had several groupings of avocado, celery, some peanuts and other goodies.  Onto this vegetable grouping, the server poured the cold gazpacho.  He then ground some fresh pepper on the soup and I was off enjoying the first course.

For the main course, I got the 14 ounce filet with bone in cooked barely--blue.  It was accompanied by two shishito peppers.  I also got a side of gratin dauphinois with Comté, a gussied up name for potatoes au gratin.  When I saw Comté, I knew this was it.  It's the kind of cheese I always buy for eating at home.  The steak was done exactly the way I like.  The potatoes were excellent.  A very pleasant side dish that I almost finished.  With the steak, the waiter brought a platter with three sauces, peppercorn, a classic Béarnaise, and their house soy, rice wine sauce.  Of the three, I liked the soy, rice wine the best but I used it sparingly.  I'm generally a purist when it comes to steak.  It really doesn't need a sauce.

For dessert, I got the coconut soufflé with chocolate sorbet.  The plating was beautiful.  The soufflé was perfect and the round of sorbet on a small bed of toasted coconut was a perfect accompaniment.  

Now as to service--it couldn't have been better.  It was top notch.  The server was a friendly gentleman and the bus person was quite efficient.  I had a fresh glass of iced tea before I finished the first one.  The plates were cleared promptly and when my server said the soufflé would only take 7 minutes, he was correct.

The maitre d'hôtel came around twice during the meal to check how things were and we chatted for a bit.  It was a grand meal and I'll be returning.  This would be a great anniversary dinner.  I think I'll make the reservation soon!",2013-07-26 21:26:51

It started with my iced tea. It was an unexpected fruity flavor but what really annoyed me was the very old orange slice hanging on my glass. I could tell by looking at it that it's been around for at least more than a day. That sort became a kiss death in my opinion and maybe blemished my experience a little bit. 

They started us off with a generous amount of chips and salsas. The chips were fresh and slightly on the thick side. The salsas were both unique one was a very limey tomatillo and the other was a creamy very spicy red that had a smokiness to it with a slightly bitter taste to it.

I had the smaller sized Quinoa salad that was mostly quinoa. I thought the salad was OK. I liked the pumpkin and local yulu seeds in it. I also thought the sweet roasted corn in it was a nice touch and it would have been better with just a little more roasted corn.  I would have enjoyed the salad more if I didn't add the chicken because I didn't care for the taste of the chicken. I""M NOT SAYING IT WAS BAD in any way but it had that similar taste to it that the hot sauce had that I didn't care for. It was something smokey and the salad flavors, the fruity iced tea and the smokey chicken just didn't taste good together for me. But I note that's just me and anybody else might like it.

My husband had what they called Paella. He said it was OK as a chicken with salsa and rice in a skillet kind of meal. It didn't have the crust of rice one expects at the bottom to be paella and the rice was mushy but OK. It seemed like more salsa than broth. He didn't recognize anything pork in the dish but was told it was in there when he asked about it.

Walking in I thought to myself where is everything? No art? No decor? It seemed so bare. Everything is the same color and blends into each other.

Once the experience began and the service was extraordinary with multiple staff members making us feel like the most important people in the room. After a long day at work and traffic on the strip this really made us all just feel so damn good. It was also genuine and not pretentious. It felt as if they appreciated us choosing to dine with them and I have to point this out because it really made the entire experience that much more special.

So the food was perfection. Not only did it look appealing to the eye but it tasted just as good as it looked! Every little detail was thoughtful and I couldn't believe that everything I tried I wanted more of. I began with the sushi combo which was presented like art. I also had the tandoori chicken which was perfect (climax moment). And all of this was followed by a very simple mango tapioca which once again hit the spot (back to back climaxes). I don't even love mangos and I would have licked this up if it wasn't completely inappropriate! Sweet, tart, creamy and crispy little nuggets for an amazing texture experience! 

I also tasted my friends Beijing duck salad that was so simple but packed with flavor and the skirt steak which was cooked to tender perfection with some of the juiciest & sweetest tomatoes. Everything was so flavorful yet so simple with beautiful presentations. 

I was also so relaxed and just enjoying myself. My brain went back to why this place was bare. Its designed to put people at ease and you forget about the chaos in your everyday life. Simple, sleek and elegant is what this place is all about. I loved it. I need to make an effort to simplify my world and have less shit in it just like this design.",2015-06-19 07:52:30

I read a lot of reviews about the ordering process and how it was confusing. I think they must have heard because when we went it was really clear how to do it and I found it very easy. They have a big sign with instructions and instructions inside the menus, also. To be clear, you go in the door, there are menus, the American and the translated. You take an order pad and a pen, write down the number of what you want, take it to the counter and pay. They give you a number then bring the food to your table. After you pay, there is a table with flatware for you to grab. They bring your plates, napkins, and chopsticks to the table for you. Simple and easy!

The translated menu has SO many choices! I didn't know what to order so I went with the standard General's chicken and my hubby got the Schezwan chicken. We split the pork filled pot stickers. Everything was amazing, just amazing. Best Chinese food I have ever had.I think next time we go, I'd like to have my Chinese friend order for us. I think that'd be a lot more fun and I'd get to try more authentic foods since everyone has been raving about them. I think he'd choose a lot of different and tasty stuff besides the Americanized dishes. 

We got there a bit after 5. Around 5:30 it was like the flood gates opened at it was PACKED (it was a Saturday). There are a lot of tables. It's good for groups too because they have a lot of big round tables with the lazy Susan in the middle for sharing and passing different dishes.

I am so glad my friend took me here and I can't wait to come back!  The only thing I disliked was the lady asked if we would like some tea just like in most Chinese restaurants and charged us.

Well, the food was great! Awesome for me. I got the Brussels sprout salad,which has a touch of bacon. $14.00, Very good but, very high priced even for the Airport.
My friend got a burger that came with fries. For $13.00 that was a bit high I thought.
The bun completely fell apart, & we don't know why. However, the food is very good, so that is not the issue.
The issue was our server.
She was the absolute worst!!
 Everyone else is happy in here, taking good care of their customers and really working hard. We had to get the one that did not want to be there, that did not have any idea what was going on in the restaurant at all.
Our server was Imelda, She may of been having a really bad day, or just completely uncaring about her job.
 We waited about 20 min for our food. Which of course this is a sit down place, so I am not complaining about that at all.
However, In over an hour in the place we were never offered a refill on our tea. I had hot , she had Iced. Our food was brought out to us, she never asked , do you need anything else, how is everything, something more, a refill, dessert...Nothing. when she did a drive by to throw the check on the table, I was able to ask for a Take Away container for my friend. Which she did bring to us.
But, really it was a horrible experience with Imelda.
I would watch her walk around not really doing anything, just stroking her hair.
I wondered why she did not check on us. It was 2:30 in the afternoon she was not even busy.

The place is decorated very nicely. With a nice faux fireplace which I think is really nice and relaxing.
I really wanted to have a nice time here, I told my friend from Denver that she was going to love the food here.
Maybe we will try it again. But, I will be sure to get a different server.
The hostesses were sweet and friendly.",2013-01-20 02:53:59

Problems;
Walked in and took forever to be seated. The place was empty except two other tables. He NEVER brought us silverware. My salad had 8 pieces of lettuce and the rest was carrots and those purple pieces. GROSS! My crap was over stuffed with cheese to where ti was ozzing out. NASTY! there was almost no apples or whip on it. My daughters pancakes were cold. He charged us for her food even though, it said everywhere KIDS EAT FREE. dummy. then he didn't take it off of our bill cause we were using AAA card. um, so what? they should eat free anyways. it works at all the other IHOPS. He never came and took our plates so we had to pile everything at one end. By the end of our meal we had 8 plates stacked up.  My husbands food had literally 10 fries. talk about skimpy! Ive never been so disappointed in service or food. Instead of looking after his tables he was constantly sitting down and talking to the cooks in spanish. DO YOUR DAMN JOB!

The BBQ Pork (Char Siu) is amazing as it is the perfectly cooked and the fat ratio is good.  The Roasted pork is good as well and the skin is always crispy.  The price is decent for the amount of food you are getting.  This place is cash only.

I think I tried almost everything in the menu and l liked almost everything they offered but my fave is the roasted duck and BBQ pork (char siu) for sure.

I've tried everything on the menu and I've been a regular for several years.  If I had to recommend one thing on the menu it'd be the Italian Cheesesteak (add mayo, lettuce, tomato to make it 'hoagie style').  They grill that bad boy up fresh every time.

Multiple 4 and 5 star reviews praising good food, a warm atmosphere and interesting drinks. Muddled by a series of grumpy 1 star-ers upset at the demise of the former Avenue Bar.

A couple of thoughts:
1) Read Avenue owner Joey C's comment to Eric M's one star review. She says: ""Thanks for your post.  I agree with you that the old Avenue had incredible charm and the most Wisconsin feel you could find in Madison, but it was not a busy restaurant.  Friday nights were our busiest night of the week, but a business can't sustain itself on one night a week.  We kept the tradition going with minimal change to the menu and interior, but it just wasn't sustainable.  I'm sorry that you feel we've taken a classic away.  Our hope is that with the changes we've made, the Avenue will continue on for 50 more years.  ""
      It seems as though the previous Avenue, with all of its charm, was untenable.

2) The new management did go a bit... overboard. The entire restaurant screams ""out with the old and in with the new!"" between the mid 2000s indie jam playlist, the Ritzy ""bubble up"" bar design, and the contemporary decor. We were surrounded by tons of mid-20s/early-30s couples and groups, though, so it must be working.

3) As for the actual substance, we were very pleased. The cornmeal-breaded calamari was unique and delicious. My pastrami challah was well balanced, not too heavy, not too salty. My girlfriend wanted something ""hearty"" so she ordered the beef rib stroganoff, and said ""wow, I feel like if I closed my eyes, I could be right back in the old Avenue."" And she used to go there every Sunday AM with her grandparents, if that says anything for their cues towards tradition.

4) Drinks were good. Variations on classics. Not too much mind-blowing novelty, but definitely a menu created by someone who inherently understands the component creation of drinks. We were happy.

So overall? As long as Avenue continues to weather the inevitability of criticism that comes with change, I'm sure it will do well. The simple busyness of the restaurant seems to assure that. And, for all their insistence on the new, it seems their heart is in the right place.",2015-10-03 14:54:47

Had the chocolate and caramel fondue cakes. I would recommend getting the chocolate fondue cake with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream -- classic! But the cake wasn't warm. It just tasted like they pulled it out of the display case and threw the syrup on with a scoop of ice cream on the side.

I just feel happy starting my weekend at the market - browsing, shopping, enjoying the activity, talking to people I see week after week, and getting a little breakfast. People and the whole vibe is so friendly.

Though you might consider things a bit more pricey than what you'd find at a store, keep in mind that this is locally produced by people who work hard to make artisan products and grow/raise organic food. I appreciate this so much since I have a ""black thumb"" and can't grow much of anything. The in-season product is so good. Asparagus and scapes in the spring. I brave the heat for the corn, peaches, and tomatoes that are their best mid-summer. The kale, squash, potatoes in the fall. Offerings throughout the season include baked goods, jams, handcrafts, jewelry, soaps and salves.

There's plenty of free parking for both cars and bikes. It's easy access. Bring sunscreen if you're going to hang and bring your own shopping bags if you can. There's all sorts of music going on. And sometimes there are special programs - like local bands, grilled pizza tutorials, bike clinics (where you can get a free tune up!), blood drives if you're able to donate, etc.

Bonus: Due to my weekend habit at this farmer's market, I smell and look amazing because I've gotten so much handmade soap and jewelry from vendors here. I go hungry but leave happy - partly because I really enjoy the breakfast burritos, donuts, kettle corn...",2016-07-13 19:21:48

The outside has many nice features including waterfalls, sidewalks, ample covered parking for those who pay, and a restaurant.  And what research park isn't complete with a shaded intersection.  Actually, the giant sun shade is what gives SkySong so much character.  So when we pass the giant tent, I can tell my daughter, ""That's where daddy works."" And she says, ""I know that already.""

Props for having calorie counts posted for every menu item!

The Nachos and Nachos Grande on the menu are different only in size, with your choice of protein and bean- the regular chicken with black beans was a huge portion more than sufficient for two to share, but I will say that I personally prefer more melty or liquid cheese on my nachos rather than just broiler-melted shredded cheese. That's a personal preference though.
The tacos also have tons of choices: pick your protein, your tortilla, and then what style you'd like with toppings and sauces. The California style grilled shrimp was an excellent choice while the steak was seasoned well but fairly plain when ordered street-style. 
I didn't much care for the Sharkys chicken salad I ordered but will note that even the half-size is pretty good sized with ample protein. 
Menu also has protein combo plates, a couple of pizzas, and entree plates- the stacked chicken enchiladas in particular look tasty. Don't forget to add on a watermelon basil lemonade, which was tasty without being too sweet and similar to an agua fesca. They also offer beer and wine.

Sometimes you get jaded and don't believe you will ever find a true gem anymore.  There is always some knockdown. Either it is too pricey, too pretentious or they simply don't know how to cook.  Rare is it you find a place where the food is great and they make you feel at home.

So, ignore the fact that this has a large bar and gambling area.  What place in Vegas doesn't.   From the moment I arrived, thanks mainly to the many positive reviews here on yelp, I felt the love.  Pete, the owner, greated me at the door, and ushered me into the dining area, sealed off so the smoke can't get in.  There was a graduation party going on in the same room and the owner assured me they were a quiet group but to let him know if there was a problem.  There wasn't.

Our waitress was immediately over to our table to provide menus.  My daughter was hungry but my wife wasn't there yet and the waitress took her order and was happy to alter the menu to fit her tastes.  

ASIDE - if your gps is out of date you might end up near Green Valley for some reason.  This restaurant is right by the 15 and Las Vegas Blvd near Tahiti Village.

Our waitress (why didn't I ever get her name) was friendly, fun, and made us feel very welcome, even during the delay waiting for my wife.  When my wife finally arrived after her adventure in Henderson, we selected some menu items with plenty of help from the waitress who guided us in the right direction.

When my wife ordered a drink that was not what she thought it would be (chocolate cake martini) the bartender came out, got a better idea of what she was looking for and brought her a well prepared chocolate martini.  I tried the Pineapple Cake which was excellent and the blueberry martini which was also good.

For food we ordered a house salad side portion, a shrimp cocktail, greek meatball appetizer, surf and turf and pork chops.

The salad was excellent.  The dressing was fabulous and I don't usually like dressing.  The meatballs were superb with a hint of mint in the sauce.  Four large greek style meatballs and a handful of fries could have been a meal for some.  My steak was cooked perfectly, something I am very worried about when I am in a place that doesn't specialize in steak.  The shrimp cocktail was all about the shrimp with large fresh tasting shrimp and a bowl of cocktail sauce.  (I hate the places that waste greens no one eats for the purpose of hiding the smallish shrimps they try to pass off as edible so this place gets 5 stars for the shrimp cocktail).  The surf and turrf came with shrimp scampi (I am not normally a scampi fan) with just the right amount of butter and garlic to please the palate.  The mashed potatos are every bit as good as the waitress advertised.  My wife's pork tasted fantastic and she is looking forward to having it for lunch today as well.  

The portions are reasonable.  They aren't so huge that you will have dozens of leftovers but rather they are the right size so you don't go hungry and might even have a treat left over for the next day.  
 
As for prices, you couldn't ask for more reasonable prices in this economy.  My surf and turf was 17.95 and that was the most expensive thing on the menu.  The martinis were a reasonable $7.00 each compared to as much as 14 in most of the restaurants on the strip.

We got a present of greek cookies from Pete who came out and shook our hands and shared his story of his former restaurant in Boulder City called Pete's.  Hence the name RePete's.   I know I have mentioned it several times already but the service here, especially our waitress really was excellent.  She handled every question and request with a smile, a detailed explanation and really made us feel at home.  It was a pleasure meeting Pete and I hope he sits down with us next time we come to share more stories.  We will be back soon and often.",2012-12-21 20:45:47

From the get go it wasn't too bad - great friendly service with a smile and we were started off with a delicious chocolate red velvet cake muffin that was, as they say, to die for. But from there the service got slow and the food got worse.

I ordered fried seafood platter that was named something like ""Fisherman's Duo"". And I wish I could remember the name exactly to tell you to AVOID it! It was served hot but I was disappointed to see what looked like two hand rolled fish patties battered and fried like glorified fish sticks alongside just FOUR crunchy, overcooked shrimp. I substituted mashed potatoes for fries and those weren't bad. My friend had a salad that looked pretty much plain and basic - I would've been disappointed to be eating that!

Topping it all off the waitress was just so slow getting back to us so we could order our red wine. It ended up taking forever to even get us our wine when we did order it. I'm no connoisseur but I don't think I got the Merlot I asked for either. And at the end of the night we were practically being pushed out the door while finishing the wine they brought out to us so late. The only thing keeping them at 2 stars is that muffin.",2012-02-22 02:00:52

SoHo is adds something new to Ohio City dining options - and it's a welcome addition. We went with a friend before seeing a show at Playhouse Square - so we arrived around 6:30 and were easily in and out for our 8:30 show time.

The hostess asked if we ahead reservations - since we didn't we were seated at a high top in the bar area. Within 30 minutes the main dining space tables were FULL with those who'd reserved in advance.

Our friend had already visited, so we had some insights ... Main insight: Desserts are small (we passed, but did see some and they are petite sized).

The biscuits with butter and preserves were a nice WELCOME - and rather than losing the bottom half of mine to my husband, our server brought more when she saw my biscuit dodging his grasping hand. 

I had the chicken & waffles - a dish that is different everywhere you go. Our friend was afraid the portion was too small - I assured him that the waffles & coating were so rich, the portion size was perfect. It was crispy outside, with wonderful dense flavors. For some people, the sweet potato waffle might seem dry, but it's a savory accompaniment to the chicken, and is great with the warm bourbon maple syrup.

Our friend said the shrimp & grits were divine and my husband really enjoyed the catfish po'boy. He loves a good BBQ potato chip, so he really liked the crunchy chips at SoHo.

From where we we seated, I had a great view of the electric atmosphere in the dining room - a great mix of patrons enjoying a night out. I also watched the bar tender carefully crafting drink after drink. I'll be back and try out some of their signature cocktails. If they reflect his attention to the details, they should be fabulous!

The only gripe I have is that the shape of the serving plates makes it impossible to rest a knife on the 'side' of your plate. Not sure where I'm supposed to put it between uses. 

I'll deal with random utensil management issues since SoHo will definitely be part of our dining rotation in Ohio City.",2014-03-24 04:44:49

I have been looking for a large portioned and aggressively priced provider of scrumptious fish.  I tried other places and service left much to be desired, but Harbor Inn was flawless.  I called in an order and they said ten minutes, I got there nine minutes later and I waited one minute and my food was ready.  This compares favorably to the hour and a half I spent elsewhere waiting ten minutes.

The flavor - perfect.  The food is greasy, but it is minimally greasy to accomplish that perfect flavor profile without making you feel weighted down.

The portions - massive.  I got the Friday special and for $7 I was stuffed to the gills.  A healthy portion of fish, an abundance of shrimp (I almost couldn't finish it all), along with about ten hush puppies.  The only thing I would want more of is the fish, I would gladly trade some shrimp and sides to get another filet in there.

The sauces - spot on.  The cocktail sauce is just the right amount of kick to make you take notice.  The tartar sauce is rich and mild and goes well with everything.  They give you butter for the puppies if you are so inclined.

I will be here every Friday until Lent ends, and then I will probably just keep coming back.

Perfection.  I am a big fan of their tortillas.  They are smaller than average (but stuffed to the gills with meat) but their taste is incredible.

There are imaginative cocktails and the menu is filled with items to be shared.  The chef's favorites are pulled together as a single prix-fixe meal - for simplicity, and because we couldn't hear the waiter (too loud) or read the menu (too dark), we chose that option.

Not only are they serving up tasty dishes, but they actually seem to care about animals, the environment and people too. Serving only Organic, Vegan, Non-GMO, Peanut & Nut Free with a number of Gluten Free options as well, you can see they've put some thought into this.

I've enjoyed many a meals at their Eglington West location and was overjoyed to see them opening up this new place near my work. One neat thing about this location is that it's 100% Organic. I like eating Organic and it shows how they're actively trying to do something for the environment. Unfortunately this made the prices go up a few dollars for each of my favourite meals, which I am not impressed by, hence the missing fifth star. 

I highly recommend trying the Chow-Mein. It's a large helping of fried noodles, veggies, tofu and soy protein thingamajigs. Definitely my favourite dish, and sometimes it's even enough for 2 meals. You can ask for it sans ""fried"" noodles as well, and just have the noodles soft, if you're not a fan of the crispier noodles. The Sweet and Sour fireballs are really good as well and I'm also a big fan of the Savoury Crisp.

The lunch special is great. It's $8.95, and comes with a decent sized meal plus a soup. There are 3 meal choices available, the Chow-Mein (which if I haven't mentioned yet, is my favourite), a Thai curry (also quite good), and Eggplant with Black bean Sauce (I haven't tried this yet, but give me a break! They've only be open for a couple weeks! Ok, you're right, I'm sorry. I'll go tomorrow). The soup is usually a simple vegetable soup but it's super tasty.

Ok, yes the place is run by some sort of Vegan cult (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching_Hai, note the big screen tv in the restaurant playing the ""supreme master channel""), but honestly, if religious establishments concentrated more on opening tasty restaurants then on bigotry, I think I could get behind them.

I generally avoid buffets at all costs, but this one offered me plenty of green items, a good tofu dish and absolutely perfect sesame balls filled with red bean. There were even plantains! Every chicken dish I sampled had a great flavor, and all of the servers were smiling and clearing plates lightning fast. When we visit buffets, I keep track of how many items I am compelled to spit out, and I am happy to report that there wasn't a single item here that didn't pass the test. I didn't love the spinach or the green beans, but they were not overly salty or flavored poorly. They were simply plain.

Is this gourmet? No. Is this healthy? Probably not. It is a Chinese buffet with an odd sushi section, congealed salads on the fruit bar, and pizza, but in that world, this is a pretty good option.",2011-11-23 00:21:20

The AC lounge is acceptable with some extras (such as having Guinness on tap.)  However, I'm pretty surprised by people who give it five stars.  Those that do are travellers who obviously have never travelled to places where they have far superior airport lounges for frequent travellers.  Just to name a few, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific lounge and London Heathrow's British Airways lounges are far superior and may deserve 5 stars especially if you're in the first class lounge at Heathrow.  

The food is really mediocre at the AC Maple Leaf lounge.  I mean the international lounge serves this Olivieri pasta and sauce which is horrendous.  I don't eat such prepared foods at home, and would expect something cooked rather than reheated out of a can and bag.  This is what you get when you've paid several grand for a business class ticket to fly overseas?  That's just lame.  The BA lounge at Pearson for business class travellers provides a proper buffet dinner!

The domestic and US lounge is a bit better with slightly better food, but still pretty lame.  Just head over the priority pass lounge as a comparison.  It's quieter, and again with better food.

heuEz1VIW5kenQU2Oe8x2w,RaNkWBMywhBqCZOQWSN_SQ,2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,3,0,1,0,"Ever since the wife got a tattoo just up the road from this place, giving us an excuse to eat here for the first time (see my original review), I've been jonesing for more. Fortunately, she booked in for another tattoo a couple of days ago which gave us another excuse to travel the 45 miles and have another bite at the Casa la Dinge. Unfortunately, the way the day played out meant that I headed in to Tempe with her, then had to kill about three hours waiting for her tattoo to be completed. During this time I met some friends and because I was starving I wound up having a quasi-lunch with them at Slices Pizza at the cnr of 6th and Mill. Doh! The wife wouldn't have tolerated me doing Haji Baba's with them because SHE wanted to join me at HB for a late lunch. I thus had two lunches on the day, but because I wasn't too hungry after she and I arrived at HB, I had to make do with a couple of appetizers. I ordered the Foul Mudammas, the falafel and the yoghurt soda. The soda made me shudder at the unexpected taste, but I did manage to strangle down about half of it, with a face that probably appeared to onlookers as though I was being cornholed with a pineapple. Reminded me a lot of salt lassi, except this was saltier. Basically like drinking salty melted butter out of a bag of Orville Redenbacher. The wife grimaced at her first swallow, then came back a few minutes later for another go-round (that's my girl!) I can see why the damn stuff is popular - in a Warheads-candy sort of way. The Mudammas was pretty good, but my gut was quite full by this time and I didn't even finish the falafels. Oh well. Wife had the chicken kabob, same as last time I think - the plate was overloaded and the food was delicious, once again.

After we finished I started with the usual wandering up and down the aisles looking at the weird foods and their names. Wife said she needed to hit the restroom. About a minute later she was back, with sort of a guilty wan smile on her face. I was wondering whether the crapper was out of order or something else funny had happened. I was wrong. Apparently the previous occupant had dropped a couple of foul mudammas of his own in the bog, and the stench was so rancid that my wife threw up almost all of her meal. I kid you not. She said she struggled to hold her breath but in the end, blammo. By this time I was doing the potty dance as well and with more than a little trepidation went to the restroom. I sniffed (WHY?!) but the smell had cleared out by now and it was tolerable. However, the toilet fixtures themselves were disgraceful. I took a couple of photos of the faucet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=R-J7WlBAZ7cGGRMTetoRxA), and the string holding their mirror above the sink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=DkWNs54J3xmfmZ1KHX2CbA). If they're going for realistic Arabic slum atmosphere and decor at this place, congrats - they hit the mark one hundred percent. Please, DON'T go into the restroom if you visit this place.. you'll spend the rest of the day, like I did, wondering if the kitchen fixtures look the same. Spoiled the experience for me, and there's NO reason they can't renovate such a tiny room and make it at least a little more passable. Made the shitter in ""Trainspotting"" look like the jewelry counter at Harrods.

Three stars (two knocked off for the state of the restroom, and I'm not counting the stench/vomiting incident in this demerit), and my brief addiction has been broken. I probably won't go here again since it transcends even my fairly liberal, old-city standards of cleanliness. Cheap food, good tasting, generous portions, I didn't get food poisoning, and the cashew baklava was awesome, but next time we're in town I'll probably go back to Slices Pizza or look for an alternate Middle Eastern fix. Then again, Greek Wraps is closer and just as tasty. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. Seacrest out.",2010-12-24 04:22:59

Henry's is essentially a takeout only place, with very limited seating (one counter, a few stools). Whatever seats they do have are often occupied by the many teenagers that go to Henry's as a hangout spot.

Now, the juices, on the other hand, leave a little something to be wanting.....

On the menu, I ordered a lemonade (I can't remember the name, it was Indian or something) anyways, the description was ""ginger lemonade with Indian Spices"". The thing is, when I read ""lemonade"" my brain associates that word with a sweet drink. THIS. WAS. NOT. SWEET. My drink was PURE lemon with a hint of ginger, with floating peices of lemon seeds. Talk about lip-pucker!!! Now, don't get me wrong... I see the potential, so I actually took it home, strained out the seeds, and added unfiltered apple juice. It was......better. So, I would suggest either changing the drink description from ""lemonade"" to ""lemon juice"", or, just change the recipe to make it sweet (and notice, I say ""sweet"" and not ""sweeter"")

1st Course-Tomato Soup:  Layers of flavor.  Earl, who is not a tomato kind of guy, loved this soup.  The Watermelon salad with goat cheese was very delicious too.  The goat cheese was of great quality, and I love the crunchy wasabi that was added to this dish.

2nd Course-Earl and I both got the monkfish with onion jam and dill.  The fish was cooked to perfection.  The meat has the same texture as lobster.  

3rd Course-Strawberry Sake Shortcake: We liked the black pepper whipped cream on top of this shortcake.  Other than that, it was pretty plain to me.  The Chips and Icecream was interesting.  The chips were a tad too salty for me.  The lemon poppy icecream was pretty good.  Only gripe is that there wasn't much icecream or chips, compared to another table that was ahead of us, who also did the restaurant week spring menu.  Upon inquiry, we were told that the amount of icecream and chips on that dessert will be the new quantity on that dessert.

Service was awesome!  Our waitress was very friendly and personable.  Added to this memorable fun lunch was to have it with an awesome group of people.  Lots of fun and laugh.  Additionally, we got to take pictures with Angelo Sosa!!!  I was hoping that we will see him today too.

Outside of those apps/small plates, I have only had a few of their pizzas: the Margherita and Roasted Garlic Chicken are the only two I remember lol (hey, it's been awhile!). The margherita has been great majority of the times that I have ordered it. The roasted garlic chicken did not sit well with me. The garlic taste was way overpowering because they have rather large pieces of cloves scattered throughout the pizza. Imo, I love garlic, but it should be kept to a minimum as the flavor is incredibly intense.

Drinks-wise CPK does alright, nothing special. I wouldn't go just for drinks, I should say. There are a few places I would put ahead of them.

I didn't know how the system worked and there wasn't a waitress / hostess around and so I sat down and waited for my friend (just following what a few others had done).

I was ready to give up our table but she was kind and insisted that I stay.   It all ended well as others were leaving and everyone got a table.  She then felt bad an apologized (which was SUPER nice of her cuz I wasn't insulted and it wasn't her fault - she was just doing her job!).

The restaurant is dimly lit and intimate. The exposed brick walls adds character to the place - gives the restaurant a trendy vibe.   

The food is delicious and is worthy of the hype. There are a few standouts. I would recommend starting a caesar (which comes with) and some oysters.  The oysters were expertly shucked, meaty and fresh.

For the mains, we enjoyed the signature lobster poutine, the pasta and duck. The lobster poutine consists of french fries, lobster meat, cheese curds, and lobster bisque reduced until it takes on a gravy-like consistency. The lobster poutine is a must. There is a reason why it is a signature dish. I would recommend getting a the small size as it is really filling. The pasta with rabbit meat was delicious. The duck was flavourful and cooked medium rare.

The room they gave us had a view of the parking garage.
There's no fan in the bathroom whatsoever so when we showered the room was very humid afterward.

We ate at the buffet. We are platinum members with their rewards program, but the line for platinum members moved slower than the regular line so we moved to that one to pay. After paying we moved back to the platinum line to be seated, but again the regular line moved faster and the people who were behind us in the regular line were seated before us, even though there was only one lady ahead of us in the platinum line.

The food at the buffet was a total let down, limited variety on everything but the desserts. The greens at the salad bar were wilted and the toppings were sparse. The wait at the carving station was long and the portion sizes were small. I total disappointment.

We went to the pool two separate days. The first day we couldn't get a waitress to come by at all so we finally left to go get drinks at the casino. The second day we got out there at 10am (the pool opens at 9), 2/3rds of the lounge chairs were reserved with towels by people who weren't even at the pool - they just came out to reserve seating. We finally found 2 chairs together and relaxed. They had made me throw out my coffee on our way in, they have a sign posted that says no outside food or drinks. But I started getting more and more upset as I saw person after person walk in with drinks or food in hand. I was pissed that I had to toss the remainder of my iced coffee but so many others were allowed to bring theirs in.

The slots were very tight. We like to play the games that have bonus features like free spins, but we wasted $20 after $20 in various machines and only found one that we could ever get to trigger a bonus.

The resort is nice looking. The pool is pretty and has a sand on one side (great for keeping most of the kids in one place). But the service was so poor and the room was a disappointment so I really don't see us staying here again.",2013-04-05 22:57:56

A modern Vietnamese restaurant that has the city talking and even some of the country talking with their introduction to whole lobster pho a few years back.

I didn't dig the interior. It reminds me of Boiling Crab with the log looking tables and wall fixtures. The emphasis on sports and drinking with all of the TV's make it an option to watch sporting events.

The thing about District One is that their pho broth wasn't good. We tried two bowls of pho, oxtail fries, and egg rolls. I had this thought in my head that they really had this modern Vietnamese restaurant that improved on a classic and elevated it, but the pho was so bland. With Vietnamese pho I am a purist. I add my veggies and that's it: no fish sauce no hot sauce, nothing. I had to hook my broth up so much to make it decent. The oxtail fries were good with lots of oxtail meat, but not as good as Bachi's. The egg rolls were so small and the filling very dry and at $9 for 4 pieces was a hard no from me.

I have to give them props on their staff. They have a lot of staff and they are very attentive-you're not only helped by one person.

At the end of the day I would not go back to District One for pho. If I want a good bowl of pho I would definitely try somewhere else. I recommend stepping the broth game up otherwise nothing is enticing.",2018-05-28 16:25:26

When I first came here, I didn't realize that their food menu was so extensive.  The drinks are truly fantastic... and like it's sister location in Arcadia, large espresso drinks are quads, which means four shots of espresso!  That makes the caffeine-addict in me quite happy, since I almost always order my drinks that way anyway... so no upcharge to do that here!  I most often opt for the cafe mocha latte... and it is perfect.  EVERY TIME.  Consistency is not overrated... and is actually the biggest factor that separates the successful restaurants from the not-so-successful restaurants.  

On my sixth or seventh visit, I realized coffee alone was not going to get me through a focused work session, so I ordered some food.... the breakfast sandwich with bacon to be exact.  Let's just stop right there and reflect for a minute.  I had been here some a half dozen times or so and had never ordered this incredibly incredible sandwich before... WHY OH WHY?!?  It is SO GOOD!  I had wasted six or seven days of my life by not eating this amazing sandwich before this visit.  

If you have not yet been to a Sip location, then get over there and enjoy this local staple of the Phoenix area today!

The food is pretty decent, except for anything from the weekend brunch menu. It really isn't anything that special. But, whatever you decide to order expect the worst.
 
Recently, with 2 other people, we waited a good 5 minutes to figure out who would serve us. When we were, it took even longer to get our drinks and take a food order, of which was not taken correctly, if at all. After that, she just seemed to disappear for whatever reason and never bother to refill any of our drinks or settle our check. Eventually someone else apologetically picked up her lame attempt at serving.

Then there was the time I decided to try there brunch again. She was more involved in some dudes story at the Willie Nelson  concert than to focus on perhaps refilling a drink for myself and whoever was across from me. That, and, taking my card to settle the bill but completely forgetting to swipe it. Just disappeared and left it on the other side of the bar like a dope. Really fucking pissed off about that. Eventually she remembered she actually had a job to do and closed it out, with a half ass apology to follow. 

So, if you are lucky enough to get one right away  you can expect to have a server right up until your food is served. After that, well, no one really gives a shit. Definitely starting to rethink how I should tip anyone based on what I've been dealing with lately. Also rethinking how much more I really want to come back any time soon.",2015-08-18 23:03:19

I got the machaca burrito - the meat was tender, not fatty, and had good flavor. It was wrapped in an authentic tortilla (no Mission/Taco Bell style tortillas for this girl). I loaded up on salsas at their salsa bar (pico, roasted tomato, medium, extra hot, chile verde, and more). I had the horchata to offset the spicier of the salsas (none were overly-intense).

Nevertheless, I gave Rubios fish tacos a try and fell in love. These delicious tacos are crispy, crunchy, flaky, tender, and melt in your mouth. With the addition of lime juice they are heavenly. Along with the fish tacos I frequently enjoy their quesadillas that they fill generously with cheese and whatever fillings you'd like, and a plain bean burrito. I'm not sure what it is about the beans, but they are amazing. Everything on the menu is tasty and fresh; you can order as healthy or unhealthy as you'd like, and there is something for everyone. Rubios offers a variety of salsas to choose from
at their salsa bar where you can fill up as much as you'd like (I suggest the chunky mild red and the green sauce). One of my favorite treats is their churro; they don't skimp on the cinnamon and sugar, and they are fried to perfection.  

I order and pick up from here often, and they always get my order right. While it isn't necessarily expensive, I wouldn't say it is cheap either; expect to pay a decent amount. I prefer to pick up and take home because the atmosphere isn't very comfortable to eat in.

But I've never seen a tribute band before.

These guys know their music.  Every note and pitch they were supposed to hit, they did.  They copied the mannerisms.  As picky as I am about Beatles reproductions, they nailed the whole feel.  They also did a tribute to John Lennon (complete with ""Imagine""), and it just about killed me emotionally.  Good job all around, Faux Fab Four.

They had some goofy stuff in between acts.  Inoffensive, but I was ready to get back into the music (they change costumes and mustaches to represent the eras).  There's one performer who did a credible enough Ed Sullivan, but the ""surprise"" appearance of Austin Powers (which weirdly didn't feel that out of place), needs a little more work on the mannerisms and smarmy tone.  A little more animation and exaggeration would help to complement the Sullivan improv.

But the whole group, from the band to the dancing girls look like they're having a good time up there, so who am I to be too hard on anyone in that regard?  Beatles songs are very complex, and to play and sing like them simultaneously is quite the impressive feat.

So much must have gone on here throughout the years - you could kind of feel it. And nowadays, a rather decent Taco Tuesday is going on. (Signs alluded to other popular days like wings on Wednesday and German food on Saturday). 

I ate 5 tacos. Chorizo and spicy beef were my favorites. There were so many meat types that one could fill their tacos with. I tried a chicken blend with bacon that was interesting, but good. I would definitely come back here for Taco Tuesday. The price, portion and flavor were all good.

I also got an empanada, which I wasn't a super big fan of. I found it a bit tasteless...overpowered by oil. The size was big though and it was well stuffed with meat. All the taco meat options are options for stuffing the empanadas as well. 

Prices were more than reasonable with $4 pints and $1.25 tacos, hard or soft shell. Burritos were also an option. 

Service was friendly. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and went over her favorite taco fillings with us. Orders came out as requested, with or without cheese and sour cream and in the requested shell type. 

Our waitress took our names down and the kitchen sent out the tacos divided up accordingly. When I finished my first three and ordered two more the kitchen was super fast in getting them out. 

Not a fancy place, though they do have a patio (folding chairs and tables on the grass), but definitely worth checking out this 2016 Cleveland Scene Magazine Best Taco Tuesday winner.",2016-06-29 16:07:44

I knew I wouldn't be able to handle a whole dozen from KK because I find the doughnuts to be too sweet and they just don't have that mom & pop quality that I can find around town and personally enjoy more, so I just picked out 4 doughnuts during this trip. Since it was Sunday morning they were busy, but the employees did a good job and helping customers and I was in and out in about 10 minutes. One thing I have experienced at this location over the years is that if sign is flashing HOT NOW it doesn't always mean that the glazed are ""hot now"" which is a bummer. A lot of people (myself included) come here only for the fresh, hot, glazed doughnut of goodness and it sucks when they aren't hot! 

Original Glazed ($1) - When these tasty gems are fresh and hot is when they are best. This last visit the light was on and the glazed actually were nice and hot! Soft and just the right sweetness. The hot glazed are the only reason (OK well maybe the chocolate iced custard filled too) worth making a trip to KK in my opinion. 

Honey Bee Doughnut ($1.59) - This was a glazed doughnut with some yellow icing on top of that with chocolate drizzled on top and a candy bee. I love the original glazed, but this one with extra icing was way too sweet for me. I ate half and then couldn't handle all the sugar.  The honey bee decoration was very cute, but rock hard. The whole doughnut was very cute looking yet just too sweet for me to get again.

Oreo Dirt Cake Doughnut ($1.59) - Has filling and cookie pieces inside with chocolate icing and cookie crumbles and a gummy worm on top. Another cute doughnut. The gummy worm was half hard, but the rest of the doughnut wasn't bad and it wasn't great to me however my hubby really liked it.

Glazed Raspberry Filled ($1.10) - Glazed on the outside and raspberry filling inside. The glazed part was very good, but the raspberry filling wasn't good.

They have a $16 ""choose your own adventure"" style lunch menu as well as their standard menu. As enticing as all the options were on the lunch menu I chose to go with their arugula salad and added a flatiron steak. 

The salad was large in terms of how salads go. This is on purpose though as the menu items here are designed to be shared. The salad was tasty and light and hit the spot. The bartender didn't ask how I wanted my steak done so I'm not sure if there's an option. The steak was cooked to medium rare which is just the way I would have asked anyway.

The plaza hides this gem of a place. Hands down, this is the best patties in toronto. They come in spicy beef, chicken and curry goat. you can order them hot, room temperature of frozen. now don't be fooled, this is much better than a regular patty. The only way to describe them is the filling is creamy.

This place is known to those who know. I travel far to get my quarterly dose of this stuff. you can buy them by the dozen for $11, and they will put them in a box, etc. A must is to buy their fresh coco buns and put the patty inside the bun and eat it like a sandwich. Pair it with a ting or a kola champagne and it's a good snack.

UA5pswzonkeIFlpIh8RUBQ,xwXw5HW3Y6Gr37V0KxX8sA,oZcbn7ENit23xbCsyu9xbA,5,7,1,2,"Recently, I have been to several major US cities, and in each one, I made it a point to find the best sushi I could, with varying degrees of success.  One of my friends asked me, ""Why haven't you found the best sushi in Phoenix?""  Lack of urgency?  Needless to say, we began a quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix.  It will be an expensive quest.  And I think we started at the right place.

We started with the miso soup with clams.  If you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like, imagine taking miso soup, and just adding clams.  I can't really think of any other way to describe it.  It's really that simple.

When the waitress took our order, we basically just went to town.  And everything was brought out, for the most part, one at a time.  This gave us time to enjoy each dish, and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived.

The first dish we had was the ankimo, or steamed monkfish liver.  This delicacy is something I had in Denver, San Diego, and San Francisco.  Here, it was served without ponzu jelly, but otherwise similar.  The others in my party, who hadn't had ankimo before, liked it.

Next, we had hamachi carpaccio, which was a hit.  These perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night.

After that, we had yellowtail tartare.  This got mixed reactions; I'm not sure what they used in the flavoring, but I did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it.

We then had the amaebi sushi (shrimp), which was served in two stages: first, the main part of the body, peeled and raw; and finally, the head, deep-fried.  I had deep fried shrimp heads before, but it was a first for my two dining companions.  Really, the head is the most interesting part, and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head.

Next was brought out a whole fried european sea bass.  This was one of the most passable items for me; I usually prefer my fish to be served raw.  It was a nice change from everything else, but I probably won't order that one again... Or maybe I'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs, and I didn't get one of them.

We then started on a rainbow roll, which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something ""safe.""  I ate a few pieces, but I never really get excited about rainbow rolls, or really any rolls.

Next they brought out the sushi: we had ocean trout, young yellowtail, and red snapper.  The waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces, and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce.  I liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form, and not just something to stuff your face with.  My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail, but all were good (and fresh).

Afterwards, we had one more sushi item: the foie gras sushi.  It's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras; it is distinct, but not overwhelming.  It was delicious, and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept.

For our last dish, we had the cook make us something of his choice.  He personally brought it to the table, and explained what it was.  He made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel, with foie gras on top.  As if the meal wasn't already awesome enough, this totally elevated it to a new level.  It may make me a snob, but there's nothing I like more than having a piece of art made just for me, and having the artist personally unravel it.  If you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form, this is clearly the place for you.

We finished our meal with the UFO dessert, which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura, and topped with ice cream.  It was pretty good.

Now, I have had some pretty good meals in my life, but if I were look back and consider which one was the very best, this one would definitely merit consideration.  It may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls, but if you like trying new and interesting things, you're sure to find some potential here.  The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none, as far as sushi restaurants are concerned.",2012-10-26 22:38:21

- No towels provided to you.  The locations I visit in Vegas always provide workout towels.  They do offer some logo'd ones for sale....#fail

- Old, creaky equipment.  The elliptical I was on squeaked and 2 were out of order.

- Old TV's.  They are the old school square type with bad pictures.....they should have been replaced a long time ago.

- Dirty floors.  The gym floor was gross near the free weight area.  I like to do some floor exercises like pushups and stuff like that in between sets.....that's how I noticed how dirty it was.

- Locker room was smelly.  I didn't like the locker room at all.....it smelled musty.

Overall, I didn't get a good vibe in this gym.  Looks like I'll have to pay LA Fitness a visit.

When I first came here, I was a KBBQ noob. I've tried many more across the city and even when we visit Cali. Still, Hobak sets the tone and keeps the bar high for my KBBQ preference. I've narrowed down my top 3 KBBQ restaurants in Vegas, and Hobak continuously remains at #1. This includes #1 even throughout the ones I've had in Cali. 

I rave about this place to all of my friends and social media followers. So far, everyone who has gone under my referral has reported back how much they loved their experience and the food here as well. Randy is our favorite server. He's like another homie at the table with us. 

I'm impatient when it comes to waiting for food. But I will wait that hour or a little more here. Deem me crazy, but as long as I'm not dying of starvation, it's worth the wait!! From the banchan to the meat quality, the service from beginning to end, is like no other KBBQ anywhere. It's also an added bonus that there is no corkage fee.

I don't think anyone in management read that review, but boy, they sure respond to tweets.  Through that process I was able to provide them with the details of what I posted here, and I received a call from one of the Asst. Mgrs. of that store.

When I grilled him, he admitted that the store has 39 registers at the front end (and I think that's in addition to the self-check ones), and he had to agree with me that there was no excuse for so few being open when the lines at those registers were chock-full of customers, nor for the lack of cashiers in customer service.  He said they have a staffing problem.  Gee, what an easy solution:  PAY YOUR WORKERS!!!  Costco doesn't seem to have any problem hiring cashiers, right?

In the interest of full disclosure, he did promise me a gift card to make up for the nightmarish experience I had at the store, and I had to return to the store to get it.  That in no way has influenced the uptick in stars I'm giving for today's visit.  The reality is that today the first cart I disinfected rolled just fine.  There were four, count 'em, FOUR cashiers at Customer Service, and at least 14 registers open and working.  And that is why I'm upping my update to three stars.  It will also not influence me if, when I return to this store, it has reverted to the way it was last time.  One can only hope that won't happen.",2015-04-25 07:23:32

Although there were plenty of lunch time patrons at this place, the food was still served pretty fast.  I ordered the Thai Style Tom Yum noodle soup with rice vermicelli only because my wife said the Tom Yum was good.  I don't really care for Tom Yum flavour and the rice vermicelli.  I don't think it was a good combination with this type of soup.  So I guess I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I also tried to order their duck fried rice, but to my dismay, they ran out of duck, so I had to settle for the crab fried rice instead.  The fried rice did have real crab meat in it, but there weren't that many pieces and the flavour of the crab was not infused into the fried rice, so again I was disappointed.  But then I saw the table next to me was eating the rad na with what looked like wonton noodles and it looked good.  So on a separate occasion, I ordered the rad na to take out.  Now this dish was quite flavourful. Redemption!!

I think this place deserves more customers, but the odd location makes it easy to overlook.  It's small, cozy, comfortable, and casual.  The service was attentive and friendly. I felt both happy and sad that they weren't busy on a Friday night.  Happy that I wouldn't have to wait long for my food but sad that they haven't attracted enough notice yet to bring in the crowds.  Based on my order (cognac duck, Kohana roll, dragon roll, crepe cake), I will most definitely be returning for sampling of their other menu items!  The cognac duck's tamarind sauce should be doused over your rice because it's too delicious to be wasted.  The Kohana roll is pure crab and avocado heaven!  The dragon roll was very tasty, and I was impressed that they didn't skimp on their eel or overloaded it with rice.  Their only dessert is the crepe cake, and it'll certainly please those who like green tea and thai tea flavors (i.e., moi).  

Taiga Japanese & Thai Restaurant is just 7 months old so I'm sure they will improve if more customers give them a chance.  So please keep giving them the chance and try some of their other outstanding dishes!  I believe a good restaurant should be judged on the overall menu quality and not by a few items that might turn out disappointing.  I was a little surprised that they didn't offer Pad Thai noodles, but once I experienced their cognac duck, I was like: 'Noodles, what noodles?'  :p


I returned for a 1:00pm  lunch on 3/14/14 with my mom, and the place was almost as empty as the last time I had visited for dinner.  It's gotta be the location because their menu prices are reasonable for food that is presented well and tastes good.  We ordered the cognac duck (yes, again), sea scallops, takoyaki octopus balls, and a dragon roll.  I was mildly disappointed that the cognac duck sauce seemed a little blander  than my dinner version, but that didn't stop us from eating everything on the plate.  I would've loved the takoyaki balls more if there hadn't been a chewy piece of octopus inside.  I would've preferred if they had just pureed all the seafood in the middle to make it more melt-in-your-mouth and to better balance the crispy exterior.  Suck on the sea scallop lime wedges because the flavor is incredible!!!  The dragon roll was still terrific so no complaints about their sushi, and the cushy chairs were a pleasant bonus!

Perused the wine list and decided on my favorite Silver Oak Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon which really was fairly priced at $120. 

My dinner companion, who is less then adventurous, was under strict instructions to ""eat outside the box"" tonight. So for starters we had the beef tongue with sweet and sour eggplant. It was very good, I was interested in the eggplant make up and was not disappointed in the combinations of flavors. 

Moving onto our salad course my friend had the arugula salad with pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and turnips and ate every bite, I had the shaved mushroom salad, which is basically a large bol of shaved mushrooms but it's served with a lemony caper dressing and baby sprouts that added the perfect blend of zing and texture. I cant wait to make this one at home!

For dinner he opted for the veal breast with salsa verde and polenta. It looked delicious and he enjoyed it as well. I had to try the skate wing as I never had. It was  lightly fried with lemon and breadcrumbs and served with a panzanella salad. Very good, odd texture skate has, it's stringy to cut yet extremely delicate in your mouth,,,very interesting...also very good.

Some ladies brought about 6 kids to this movie ranging from approximate age range of 2-6. Really? you brought a 2 year old out to a movie in the middle of the night? So of course the kid was bored and started running around the theatre and crying. Awesome. Bad parenting... yes, but not the movie theatre's fault. In addition,  I don't like that they have do it yourself butter.... I mean come on movie theatres... why would anyone want to do the butter themselves? You can't get any in the middle!

Another feature worth mentioning is that you can rent gear here like snowshoes so if you're tempted to try a new outdoor activity but don't want to buy anything until you have tried it and know you want to commit to it consider renting.  There are also a variety of other services like gear swaps and recycling of goods like bike tires and climbing ropes.

Its one downfall is the location.  It is not very accessible by public transit and Marche Centrale can be a zoo at times (especially on weekends).  Navigating the parking lot and finding parking during these peak times can be annoying.  If you can try and come during the week when it is quieter.

You have to be a member to buy anything here since it is a coop.  Membership is $5 (at least it was a few years ago when I joined) and is good for life so its not an expensive commitment at all.

I've ordered delivery from here (with coworkers) several times since I work late nights.  

The food has never been anything to rave over in my opinion. The last time we ordered, we received half of a pizza that we didn't order.  It might have been fine if it was a whole pizza for free, but it was peculiar.  

Additionally,  they always forget the ranch...  If you love hot wings with ranch,  and don't have any ranch...  The wings become pointless. 

Also, one of the 'grubhub' drivers isn't very nice. Not sure of her name, but she drives a green car. 

Bottom line- it's open late, they have a lot of options on the menu, and they deliver. We only keep giving chances due to the above.",2014-11-08 21:15:17

We were staying at the Palazzo and we took the Grand Canal Shoppes to try to go here and definitely got lost for about 40 minutes. We were about ready to give up and eat somewhere else but we pushed through. We got there at about 2:40pm only to find that they close at 3pm for brunch. But alas! They still seated a group of 8 for brunch which I was very thankful for :) We actually ended up staying until almost 5pm when they open for dinner...which kinda sucks for them, but they were so great they didn't even kick us out!

The restaurant had a very classic feel to it and the big windows on one side show a great view of the garden and the pool. We got seated by the windows which was great. Our server was wonderful very helpful and a great attitude. A little slow at times...but maybe we were just all starving.

I ordered from the specials on the blackboard: the breakfast sandwich..$18.50(I think)...It was more than half a plateful of fries and the other half is a waffle sandwich with sausage, melted cheese and egg(your way). And omg! That waffle was literally the best waffle I have ever had! I would go back just for those waffles! At first I was looking for syrup, but they already put it on the waffle for you, in the perfect amount of sweetness but not too soggy. It was great.

I came here for a surprise birthday party at the recommendation of a friend. The game is a fun little adventure where you find clues and try to solve ""The Case of the Book Club Killer"" before the serial killer comes to get you and your group.

You don't even have to read the book!

We escaped just in the knick of time when we finally figured out the last clue and got the door open (okay, it was actually Andrew G. who figured it out, but whatever).

We had a group of 12, plus a woman named Olga who was randomly there to play with us too. I don't know if she bought a ticket in advance or what, but one person in our party had forgotten to, so maybe that's how that happened?

I'm not sure how to resolve situations like this, but the business should probably have a policy, since you all play the same game together and it did make it ever so slightly awkward. We were all thinking, ""Who knows Olga? Someone must know Olga. Otherwise, why would Olga want to be here?""

For this game, I recommend going with a group of 8 for ideal game play. That way, there will be enough clues and puzzles for everyone to have something to do. 13 was slightly crowded and there were a few moments where I felt like I was just twiddling my thumbs, but for the most part, it was exciting.

There are no walk-in games, you do need to purchase tickets in advance. The space is near Summerhill Station, right on Yonge St. Look for the little hobbit door south of Boxcar Social.

There's only one room escape game to the space at a time, so once you play, you'll need to wait for them to change the game to play again. I had, for some reason, imagined room escape places to be like a karaoke bar with all these little private rooms. I don't know why. 

My only criticism of this game was that the depiction of women characters in The Book Club Killer game, specifically some imagery in the room/poster and the newscaster for the clip at the end of the game were all a bit... lusty. The newscaster's clothing were more Naked News than NBC, not that you really need to suspend disbelief, but it was something we all noticed.

Such imagery is sadly rather common in comic books and board games, even though these mediums are not gender specific and attract a lot of women players and readers. It does make me feel a bit uncomfortable, like this game maybe isn't meant ""for"" me. I'm hoping a gender and sexual orientation neutral experience will be taken into consideration for the development of the next game, because, it was fun!

Update: I received a thoughtful response from the owner about the depictions of women in the game that I'd like to acknowledge. 

I'd also like to acknowledge that speaking out about this issue got me trolled by an MRA loser type that could barely spell. 

Yelp, per the usual, gave a very weak ""just block him"" response to my harassment complaint. That really isn't good enough, Yelp.

We march onward.",2015-01-03 00:01:37

I like the layout of the restaurant: each table is enclosed and separated from the rest so you are afforded a more intimate and secluded experience. Our waiter did a really awesome job at filling up the water glasses BUT I couldn't help but noticed that the water glasses were very small. If they used bigger glasses, the wait staff wouldn't have to fill them up so often. But then again, I'm at a fancy restaurant and they aren't known for efficiency optimization.

Prices are very reasonable. I made my way toward other athletic wear, and was delighted to find tons of shorts made for long-legged guys like me. I appreciate it. 

Of course, there will be the dressy selection as well. It was just a little bit small for my taste. I'm also underwhelmed by shirt sizes. Places like H&M, Van Heusen, or even Banana Republic have 36/37 sleeves without assuming the customer will be like 400 pounds. I feel like I would have to get the most simple items tailored. Bummer. At least the tie selection is very stylish, and has surprisingly low prices.

Everyone knows Lucky Boy still rocks...a Phoenix classic that's still around not because it's trendy and swank...it's because they serve quality day after day (and work their butts off doing it).

I recommend the Lucky Boy original...comes with fries for like $3.99.

And, if you happen to see sketchy people around, do the whole neighborhood a favor and call phoenix pd non-emergency number (602-426-1231).  

Anytime I mention where I live to anyone who's lived in Phoenix 30-50 years or so, they always say ""oh, that's near Lucky Boys.  Damn good burgers.""",2008-10-16 01:03:17

We were greeted warmly by the bartender and asked to seat ourselves anywhere. Oof! Was this difficult! So many appealing choices to pick from. Ultimately we settled ourselves on these super comfortable couches. After explaining our schedule constraints to Ashlynn (who rocks it with her blue tipped hair) our food came out in short order.

Lest I forget, their coffee is served with a treat of sweet heavy cream. I missed the introduction as I was powdering my nose. But it is sufficiently flavored that many may not need sugar. Yum!

Their cheese board is ginormous! I love cheese and was craving something warm so we also ordered the mac & cheese WITH BACON. Yes. That exists. You should try that if you're ever in the mood for some comfort food. Be warned this is 1) not diet food 2) very filling 3) should be shared.

So I wanted to try something different here. Someone recommended jamburritos. Ironically enough, I did NOT get the burrito because I've seen my share of korean burritos, indian burritso, etc so I wanted to try something else and plus sometimes the tortilla is just eh and I just like the filling inside a burrito better. :)



So I got the jambalaya chicken bowl. My initial bite - ehh it's kinda salty. I ate some more and I love the spices to it. I love the kick of spiciness and the sauce that comes with it has tomato flavor and spiciness to it. Overall, it was good. LOTS of meat, I am glad there was a good proportion of rice and meat.The cheese was piled on top of it and I am not sure if it would have matter if there was cheese or not for me because I think the rice, chicken and sausage with the seasoning and sauce is good enough for me!

In fact we just like to go out and have fun and I think we picked the best place to celebrate. You walk in and are greeted by two hostess in sleek dresses,smiling and ready to seat you. There is a short wait so my beau and I head to the bar for a drink. The male bartender hands us the ridiculously big menu ( I think there should be a separate cocktail menu ) I order the Hana berri cocktail which is sake and sparkling sake and something else the drink was ok not anywhere in my top 10. The beau orders a tall Japanese beer, I should have ordered that instead. We get sat next to a two top table by the sushi bar. Perfect seating to see everything! When I say everything I'm talking about the performance, the waiters, and food runners coming out of the kitchen, and the tall male manager talking into an ear piece and putting his hand very low on the hostess back who looked like she needed to ask something (awkward) I felt that was inappropriate. I'm not a prude but it made me feel like I saw something I shouldn't have seen. Anyways our server comes over younger thin guy I think named Eric and he begins his spiel he is knowledgable of the menu and gave us superb service! Even though the place was busy he did a great job of recommending food. After he takes our order another server comes up Named DJ and he begins to do a spiel. We let him know Eric already took our order and the face DJ flashed was kind of an annoyance. My only suggestion would be for the team to have more communication going on.

I've tried the chirashi don, which is pricey at $35. However, the quality of fish along with the types they give you make it more worthwhile. Just coming back from a trip to Japan a few months ago, I would say the fish quality was at a similar level.

The ramen with pork is really good, the broth is tasty and the ramen itself is just the right texture! Again, on par quality with what I had in Japan!

I also had the chicken wings (I believe its 3 for $7?) which were huge and tasty! I actually ordered them because I saw that a lot of people in the restaurant had ordered it, and I'm glad that I did! The outside is crispy, the inside is moist and the sauce is tasty and not too sweet or salty. 

They have an assortment of skewers you can order as well, and we opted for the 5-skewer assortment set that is picked by the chef for $12. Each one was good, there was none that I didn't like.

That would be the commission scheme.  You see, Best Buy (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/best-buy-toronto), does not have a commission scheme and the staff will still look after you knowing that they are being paid fairly for the service they provide.

This particular Future Shop has all the charm of the market from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", there's merchandise everywhere and salesman running around eyeing you pornographically, circling the same way that sharks do before swooping in for the ""commission"".  In attempting to buy a pair of headphones for a computer, I was happened upon by one of the serfs with dollar signs for eyes.  Taken to the Phone section (that's right, not the Computer Accessory section that you'd anticipate), I was assured that definitely, definitely, this pair of headphones would work.

They didn't.  Add to this that your sales rep will have to take everything from you and bring it to the front cash.  That is of course if they don't take off looking for more victims while you further browse.

Organic and naturopathic foods are significantly more expensive at places like Noah's as an example, especially when comparing against offerings at the major chain grocery stores. I've found Ambrosia prices to be a lot cheaper than those of other health food stores. They are also among the largest I've been to so they've also got a great selection.

Although lineups can get busy at checkout time, I've found the wait not too long as they have five cashiers and one express line.

The only possible inconvenience is parking. They are located at a curved part of Doncaster Ave. that creates an odd shape for their parking lot.

Unfortunately the restaurant is only open until 930pm and the waitresses kindly remind you that last call is 930pm. I kind of wish they opened longer. Nevertheless by 930pm, most items are sold out. They're out of rice so they kindly sub with an extra piece of eel or Mochi. 

Since we were freezing cold on a nice August evening, My friend and I ordered the Kitsune soba and unagi ochazuke which was their traditional green coloured Cha Soba noodles in soba soup topped with fried bean curd (which was soft and omg delicious .. like a thin piece of fried and soggy but delicious bean curd .. kinda like a Dow Pok in canto but not as puffy) , a thick piece of pink and white fish cake , and green onion. Taste was pretty regular and the broth wasn't out of  the world ... but what rly made the dish was when we asked for some 'spicy side sauce'. They came out with a small dish of fried garlic and some other fried red stuff .. maybe red peppers or some fried shrimp paste or chili without the seeds ? I don't know .. whatever the red stuff with fried garlic was.. it was sooo tasty. Nice and slightly salty and a great addition. 

A lot of their menu consists of cold noodles dipped into their signature sauces. Although it looked amazing , the AC was on so high that I couldn't bear ordering anything cold . Unfortunately there was only One warm dish.... and it was good even though we ordered the soup to be extra hot. 

We had a great experience and the staff were friendly . 
Wish they would have let us try their soufflé pancakes though! Looked great in pics! 

We also tried their Sakura mochi which were four tiny little pink rice mochi balls wrapped in some edible leaves. They were tasty and slightly salty but delicious. Wish they were bigger for the price. 

We also tried the o matcha sampler platter which came with two scoops of matcha green tea ice cream and one scoop of another tea ice cream. I liked the brown ice cream a lot ! 
The chiffon cake was a bit dry, but the jelly was nice when mixed with the red bean. It would have been better if the servers told us the preferred way to eat it. It was okay but tasteless when everything was eaten on its own. It is way better if mixed together and maybe if it had some sauce.

The meal came within a reasonable amount of time (about 10 mins as promised), and the price that I likely to gauge sushi venues with (average of $1 per piece) was definitely less at the very least for my chirashi meal. All the meals came with soup & salad.

A number of the piece of fish in my chirashi tasted very similar to the smell of fish that were just caught and removed from a lake. An odd taste that I've never experienced while having sushi, which I did not find overly appealing. M'lady complained about having symptoms of food poisoning after her meal.

Tasty pizza bagels - which are not bagels, but flat discs of bagel dough with sauce and cheese, are a hit with the kiddies since the sauce is a bit sweet.

I'm a fan, and always have some in my freezer for bagel and onion bun emergencies!",2017-06-16 16:04:21

I am not sad however to give an honest opinion. To help promote your business, you enlisted the celebrity of Snoop Dogg, which is awesome, if that is what you are in to. Personally, loved him......20-25 years ago. The additional ""security"" personnel left much to be desired. When I get told to ""park my fuc#ing car and walk up the fuc#ing stairs"" by some just turned man who is hired for the day, that is about as unprofessional as it comes! When your employee for the day says ""just go buy your weed"" that leads me to believe that his impression of your company is that you are a common drug dealer who rents a building rather than stand on a street corner, versus a dispensary that is state sanctioned to dispense medicine to your legally approved patients. It might have been different if we had been able to use your website to order and then go pick it up at your hub, but unfortunately, your website is not updated with any regularity, which is why we have shown up in the past to be told that it was not available but no one from your company bothered to call or email to save us a trip.

What, what?  I was stoked!  We became friends up in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area, which was where the Habit originated.  We used to work about a block away from the very first, original location in Goleta.  I have always loved their food and was super excited to have one close by.  Today I decided to make my way down here.

I got off the 10 on 99th and then made a left on McDowell. Its a few blocks down on the left hand side.  I pulled into the lot and made my way around towards the drive thru. First Habit I have seen with a drive thru!  About that....... The Habit is probably one of those places that SHOULDN'T have a drive thru.  They make everything fresh and aren't exactly the speediest when it comes to getting your food out (not turtle slow or anything, just longer than other freshly cooked spots).  I got in the drive thru at 3:40pm and there were maybe 5 cars in front of me.  I finally got up to the drive thru speaker and placed my order for a Santa Barbara Cobb Salad.  4:15pm, I was finally parked, eating my food.  If you come here to the drive thru, plan on being in line for a while!  Because they cook everything fresh, each car in front of you has to wait on average 5-8 minutes to get their food.  Unless I have my kids in the car, next time I am definitely walking in and ordering.  I finally did get my food and pulled into the parking lot to grub down.  Here is how it was...............

Santa Barbara Cobb Salad-  I opened my bag to remove my salad, and noticed that there were no napkins in the bag.  I hate when that shit happens!  Not a complete deal breaker, but really, how hard is it to throw in 2-3 napkins?  Anyways........  I ordered my dressing for my salad on the side, and they hooked it up with 3 dressings (only used 2) which I appreciated.  I took the lid off my salad and it looked and smelled fantastic!  (I had been to the Habit down on 7th a couple of times, and was never too impressed.  It was not as good as the Santa Barbara/Goleta locations, or even as good as the Mission Valley location in San Diego.)  I poured my dressing on the salad, mixed it in and dug in.  The SB Cobb salad comes with a bunch of shredded lettuce, a chopped up egg, tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, grilled chicken, bacon, and a nice sized scoop of avocado!  This salad was awesome!  Every component worked together in harmony.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, bacon was crisp and crunchy, the avocado was soft and delicious, the lettuce fresh and crisp, the tomatoes perfectly ripe, the blue cheese crumbles provided a nice ""bite"" and the dressing is not too heavy.  Pretty much a perfect salad, and definitely perfect if you are on a low carb diet!  I scarfed that thing down in mere minutes and was completely satisfied.

Overall, I will definitely be back!  With it being only about a 20 minute drive from my house, too, I should be back often.  I don't think I would use the drive thru again though...took way too long.  Service from the cashier who took my order and handed me my food was friendly and all smiles.  Glad to have this place here and the delicious salad today reminded me of why I fell in love with The Habit back in the day!  Good stuff!",2017-01-22 06:08:29

Don't be turned away by the excessive richness of this glorious menu item. The Barrie Burger at AJ Bombers is a strange masterpiece you didn't know you needed in your life until you've had your first taste. One bite and those buds in your mouth will be confused. The unctuousness of the cheese, the heartiness of the burger and the succulence of the bacon all manage to meld in cohesion with that crunchy peanut butter. 

It's as if Mary Burke and Scott Walker were to run into each other on the street. They of course acknowledge each other on good terms and carry on because that's what politicians do. This is the confrontation between the burger and the peanut butter. While there is some initial tension and wariness, both parties coexist in relative harmony. The peanut butter and the bacon cheeseburger are the same way. They meet, acknowledge their competition, and live on as two powerful flavors/political figures.

I certainly didn't have any issues here. They have a very good selection of places to eat within the hotel such as the Hash House a GoGo and Beer Garden that I tried and a Pizza place my wife liked. They had some donut balls that she bought and I got to taste that were really good. Sounds great for 3 Stars right!

They have some challenges. While the room was very big and comfortable, the bathroom was microscopic. It didn't need to be, there was plenty of open area. A bigger complaint for me was the sunlight coming in through the top of the drapes. I asked my wife, ""why did you turn on the lights"". What lights she replies. I go around the corner and realize that although the bottom of the drapes are together, the top won't stay closed and the sun is beaming in. Since I am too embarrassed to say what time  we came in [I will say that we were not in bet too long before that light beam came in] it really sucked and I was too tired to jimmy something to keep it shut. The air conditioner would go into short spurts of where it would get musty. I do mean short spurts because then it would kick back in and get cold. On our second night, we could hear the pool party on the 5th floor roof top from our 10th floor room. I would have hated to be on the 6th or 7th floor but it is Las Vegas and you cant complain about the PARTY!!!!. It wasn't too bad but I had to get up to see.

I believe it was a popular weekend and hotel rates were obscene. The price caught my eye on one of those popular hotel discount websites and I thought I would give it a whirl.

Although off the Fremont street experience (minus one star) I thought overall it was an awesome value. It got a cool old Vegas feel and is popular with locals. We even got a room with a stunning strip view - if that is really important to you ask upon check in.

Bathrooms are on the exterior wall in the tower like at the Cromwell and I think it makes the room feel larger due to the lack of a hallway - although there is less privacy if the maid service wants to play peekaboo like they always do.

I think if its New Years eve and you don't want to pay $1000/night on the strip for the Linq there is no shame in staying here - even if you aren't a broke 21 year old college student.

4. Calamari (Fried calamari served with peppers, onions, marinara sauce and lemon) $9.00

My favorite out of these would be the chicken wrap, although I wish the dressing was already inside the wrap because the wrap was packed so tightly it was difficult to get the dressing ratio right in the wrap. The turkey club also had a lot of flavor to it as well and the garlic mayo gave it a nice touch. The salmon BLT was not as good as the ones I have had at Piper's Pub but still adequate.

The customer service has been phenomenal each and every time.

All their items vary day-to-day, so what they stock one day may not be there the next. If you're looking for something specific, call them in the morning and ask them to put it aside for you (they sometimes do this, depending on how soon you can pick it up).

The cakes are small for the price, but they're very tasty. They come in different flavours such as variations of chocolate or fruit (i.e. mango). 

However, my favourite is the macarons. In terms of Scarborough, there aren't many places that sell quality macarons, especially in so many flavours!

   ---   ---   ---

I have a confession: I did not intend to visit Maskadores. I had it all mapped out - I was going to land, grab my rental car, and head to Little Miss BBQ, which recently was named the #2 restaurant in the U.S. on Yelp. 

And then I got to the Little Miss BBQ and they had no parking spots left + an hour and a half wait, which I just couldn't make work. It was a very sad day, but the consolation is that it led me to Maskadores.

Though I was devastated to miss out on this meal I'd looked forward to for weeks, I pulled over into some random parking lot and asked myself, ""Self, what are you in the mood for?"" And because I was in Arizona after all, I decided to Yelp the best Mexican around. Maskadores had great reviews and was close by, so the decision was made pretty quickly!

The line wasn't super long, but it moved slowly, so I had plenty of time to decide on what I wanted. The wet burrito seemed to be the consensus as the top item to order, so that was my plan. There were two different kinds of wet burritos, so I asked for clarification on what a Bandera Wet Burrito was. It turned out that some of the sauce poured on top of the bandera was really spicy, so I asked for jus the regular wet burrito instead.

Unfortunately, it was hard to hear each other and it seemed that the level of English spoken was minimal, so she thought I asked for a (dry) burrito. I normally would have asked them to re-do it, but I was running late for where I needed to be, so I just let it be.

The burrito was solid, but it also didn't taste a ton different than what I could have gotten from Chipotle. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but I was hoping for something a bit unique while in a new place.

So that was my Maskadores experience. It hit the spot, but just not quite a home run.",2018-03-30 12:49:21

The servers are friendly and knowledgable. The beer list is great and features local brews. And the cocktails are unique and adventurous - and totally tasty (and pack a pretty good punch too).

Also, why all of sudden are people so interesting to talk to. No ""tear in my beer"", or ""Me-Monsters""...

Vig- Single serving greatness.

She left us alone to try to figure out how we order and we managed to find the bags and start filling them out. Once we were ready there was no one around and we waited while another girl tried to fill the drink dispenser. Finally we said forget it and left without getting a chance to even order.

These memories are about ten years old though, and needless to say, it's changed. 
My friend and I decided to meet here for dinner. When I arrived close to 5 it was nearly empty - three other tables were occupied. By the time we left around 7:30, it had amassed a bit of a crowd. Nearly half full. This is nice in terms of ambience and being able to hear your conversation. The music was amazing - 90s hits. I mean spice girls, Hanson, coolio. It was awesome! A nice level too. I liked being able to hear the music but also easily able to drown it out. 
There wasn't a whole lot in terms of gluten free options, but I have to applaud them for knowing what it is and having a ready response. That sometimes makes all the difference. 
So there was the basic grilled chicken/baked fish with salad. Or pad Thai! So of course I went for pad Thai. My friend had souvlaki. She also eats gluten free but won't die if she eats gluten so I'm not sure how safe her meal was. So go for the pad Thai, or ask some detailed souvlaki questions. The pad Thai was great! Very flavourful and super spicy! The only part I didn't like was the egg. I would have preferred no egg, or for it to be crumbled much smaller. It pretty much seemed like a piece of an omelette on my pad Thai. I also really enjoyed the carrots, bok choy and red peppers. There were tons of veggies mixed in. I couldn't even finish the meal and that's saying something! 
Our server Daniel was great. Very chatty and nice. Not annoying, didn't hover. Checked in just enough, added in some fun humour. In all, he was exactly what you look for in a server. 
The menu itself is huge. Tons of options for all of you people who are able to eat gluten. Sigh. The menu is somewhat reminiscent of a pickle barrel.

Just adding another 5-star review for this place.  One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Been here a few times and typically opt for the max number of courses.  On our last visit, we ordered a bottle of sake (Dassai) and received the following:

Ever so slightly seared fluke in grapeseed oil - excellent
A small salad with trout and tuna sashimi - very good, the dressing especially
A sashimi course with aji (horse mackerel), kanpachi (amberjack), and uni (sea urchin) - excellent
Tsukuri Six which consisted of:  o-toro tartar, ankimo (monkfish liver), shrimp with a little caviar, Hokkaido scallops, Kumamoto oyster with uni, and octopus.  The ankimo, shrimp, and oyster were excellent.  The scallops were very good.  The octopus and o-toro tartar were the weakest of the six.
Wagyu beef, ishiyaki-style - excellent
Nigiri course inluding: kanpachi, o-toro, toro, and two other fish I don't remember - excellent
Chawanmushi with seasonal fruit - excellent.

That's a lot of excellent dishes.  Some things I've had on the menu every single time (the fluke, o-toro tartar, oyster, octopus, Wagyu), and a couple of these I've gotten a little tired of, but there is enough variation from visit to visit that I still love this place.  This visit, we had the most raw preparations than we've ever gotten before.

I've also picked up a great yoga mat, gifts for my friends kids and my nephew (great selection of hard cover books for much cheaper than retail prices), packets of cards for the notes I like to send, and even a duvet set and sheets for our spare bedroom.

Our table was ready - set for a group of 20.  Luckily, we only had a dozen people.  The table wouldn't have been able to comfortably equip 20, but was great for 12.  Just not enough space for the larger reservation we had made.
I had read the reviews first to see what kind of menu they had.
I opted for the brie and fruit appetizer, along with apricot iced tea.  I'm not HUGE on apricots, but I ended up having my glass refilled twice.  It wasn't too sweet and came with a slice of lemon.  I could have drank a gallon, if not for the fact that I'd be sitting in the theater to see the short films!   What a surprise to have it come - an ENTIRE wheel of brie with some baguette toasts, 2 strawberries and 5 grapes.  Yes, that's all that came with an ENTIRE wheel of brie.  I did ask for extra toasts and got that with no extra charge.  The entree cost $11.  I think that's pretty comparable to going to the market to buy an ENTIRE wheel of brie, fruit, etc.  More fruit would have been nice, though.  I now have a HALF of a wheel of brie in the fridge for later.  :}

Overall, I still prefer to shop online, since you tend to get the best price, especially if you are willing to wait for it to be delivered.  However, seeing the products in person can make a big difference in some purchases, like TVs, sound systems, etc.  And either I look like I am lost and in serious need of shopping assistance, I usually have associates seek me out asking if I needed any assistance or have questions they can answer.

Since moving out to LV, I have only played video games when I go back to CA and visit my brother.  Which is not very often between school and work.  So after scoring the PS3 and XBOX Holiday bundles during Black Friday, I went back in to get a few titles to add to the library.  The associate from the gaming section who ended up assisting me was obviously very passionate and informed about the games and consoles he is selling.  He was able to give specific recommendations based on my gaming preferences.  I felt a little weird, asking for such recommendations, since I used to be pretty up to date and informed on this gaming stuff.  But it was one of the best shopping experiences I have had.

While researching TVs for the new place, I was pretty much trying to read up on the various specs and differentiate any discernible picture quality of their big selections of LCD and LED televisions.  After a few minutes of solo research, a floor associate or supervisor showed up and ended up answering all the questions I was going to google, once I got back home.  Saved me maybe 20-30 minutes worth of surfing the Internet, which I spent instead on Yelp.

This place is awful and I will never, NOT EVER, step foot inside Adrenaline again. Here's why:

I called Adrenaline on a Friday and asked to make an appointment to get some ink done on Saturday. They said they were wide open and to just walk in anytime between 2pm and midnight. Alright, no problem. So I get there on Saturday and they inform me that they do not have a single appointment available and that I should come back on Monday for my appointment. Okay, a little annoying, but okay. To make use of my time, I describe what I would like to get done and they refer me to one of their artists, Alie, who will design it for me. Apparently she's the shit (turns out she's just shit, but more to come on that in a minute).
So I come back on Monday for my scheduled appointment at 11am. At noon, Alie strolls in and shows me what she has designed for me. I don't love it, she gets a little pissed off. I then describe what I do want, she redraws it and shows it to me. I'm happy with it. Then, instead of getting started, she goes and chats with the apprentice for an hour (WTF?!?!?) while I continue to wait around. 2pm rolls around (this is when my appointment was scheduled to end), and I tell her that considering she hasn't even STARTED inking me yet, we better rebook because: 1. the time I had booked with her is up and her next appointment has already arrived and is waiting for her downstairs
2. I have to be somewhere at 2pm (considering my tattoo was a 5 letter word, I didn't anticipate it would take longer than 3 hours to do so I made other plans!)

Alie looks at me a little pissed off and says ""Okay, you're lucky we don't charge a chicken out fee"". Who's chickening out? I'm BUSY. Anyways, fine.

So I reschedule for the next day (Remember, this is now day 3 of TRYING to get inked at Adrenaline).

I get there and am sitting outside the tattooing room and I hear the guy who walked me up the stairs go talk to Alie. He says: ""Your next client Sapna is here, how long are you going to be?"" After Alie delves into a HUGE rigmarole about how she still has a ton of work to do on the client that she was in the midst of working on, she adds: ""Anyways, that Sapna chick is a HUGE pain in the ass.""
Oh. No. You. Did-NT.

I get up, march right into the room, look at everyone who is there and say ""I want my money back, all of it.""

I'm taken downstairs where the manager Marty is all like ""I'm sorry things didn't work out"" to which I respond ""Oh, no, they would have worked out just fine if your artist wasn't a #$@#%"".

And that's that. I marched out and will never, not EVER step foot inside this piece of crap tattoo parlour again. I suggest you boycott it as well, especially considering there is an amazing tattoo joint right across the street from these guys (Tribal Tattoos). That said, why would ANYONE give these fools their time of day?!?!?!

I went in - shared a soup, and a Shanghai noodles.  They were both tasty treats - but they weren't the greatest thing I'd ever had, and the price point was higher than just about anywhere else in China Town.

I'm thinking this is a place best for groups of four or more, because while the portions are huge, you don't really get that much variety, because two people can only eat so much.

If I had a tour-guide with me, I'd return in the future.  It was an experience I'm glad I'd had - but I'd rather someone else help me out with what to eat.

A bit confused when they brought out the hard tacos and hot sauces. Was it an app or was it to go with our dish? We did both. 

Since it is make your own tacos we had sooo many dishes on the table. The tables are super duper small - we had to put some dishes and the water bottle on other surrounding tables (I cannot imagine where to put stuff if the resto was packed).

I will say though, the gourmet dogs are on the pricier side and you may not feel full having just one. 

Nonetheless, our group had a good time here for lunch. 

Shoutout to the owner/manager/employee (whoever you happen to be). He made us 2 baskets of fresh warm donuts on the house. This was a great gesture...he didn't know this but in our large group, a few were visiting Toronto for the first time from USA, so this added to their positive impression of the people and the city, and put us all in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon.",2017-08-15 05:47:20

Sometimes I go and its great all around, food, service, etc.  Other times the service is laughable and food stinks.  Or just one is off.  I was craving a margarita (not an alcoholic I swear!!)  So before dinner plans at Good Food my friend and I said we'd meet here.

I got there first and walked into the bar area where the couches are.  There was someone cutting fruit and he didn't look up so I asked if I could order a drink from him.  Sure no problem.  So he makes my drink and tells me its $7 and change but I ask to start a tab.  Then my friend called and asked me to order him one, so I went back to the bar and there was a woman there now too.  She apologized and said she'd get me some chips.  She brought the drink to the table and again mentioned the chips and I told her its fine I'm not in a rush.

When the chips came they were fresh and salty and warm, all good things!  The salsa however was unbearably salty and really think, like paste not watery like it usually is.  We had to take it off the table because I kept absentmindedly sticking chips in it and then recoiling from the salt overload.  We told the new server when she came by and she was just like ""oh really?""  After another round we closed out to meet my sister for dinner.  Check was $30 for 4 house margaritas.

Egg Rolls, Shrimp and pork! It was around $10.95 it was filling but I think they need to serve it with a side of spicy sauce to give the plate more flavor. I thought it was worth getting and I was happy with my choice. I remember some guy passing by saying that it looked good but my mouth was so full of food all I could do is smile and nod. 

I also had some spring rolls to start with a side of peanut sauce because that is another one of my favorite things to order. I had a friend with me who has never has Vietnamese food so she stayed with a safe choice for her and ordered the Won Ton soup ($6.95).

Everything about here is 100/10 from the customer service, aesthetics, and most importantly, the drinks. After coming here a few times a week since they opened in September, I can say that I have never had a bad drink here. 

Don't let the lines fool you. During rush hour, it can look time consuming but I have never waited longer than ten minutes for a drink (and that's solely because I ordered a tea that needed to be brewed). The people working are always super friendly (shout out to Caroline) and helpful in the instance that you're indecisive about a drink (Sou always gives us the best drink recommendations too)! Seriously though, everyone here is super nice.

You have the option to adjust the sugar level and choose a medium or large. Get the large, it's worth every calorie. 

Although I haven't been ordering boba as a topping lately, they have the best boba not only in Vegas, but that I've ever had. It's just the right amount of chewy but simultaneously soft. My top favorite drinks would have to be the iced Chrysanthemum brewed tea, mango latte, matcha milk tea, & the lychee peachy green tea. You can never go wrong with anything though. Trust.

This is also a really good place to catch up with friends or catch up on that homework that you procrastinated on. My best friend and I are literally studying here at least once a week. Productivity and boba drinks! 

I used to drive half an hour to their other Rainbow location (which is also 100/10) but my dreams came true when they opened one down the street from my house. Whenever I leave town (like right now), I literally have Brew Tea withdrawals. Come here, you won't regret it one bit.",2018-04-01 02:11:51

2012 was located in the Port Authority by Browns Stadium.  An interesting warehouse setup with a good selection of local stuff (I got a cute ring there) and crazy art.

They took their time overhauling and reopening, it shows. The interior is lovely, featuring custom woodwork and light fixtures by a prominent pair of designers. The only challenge is a very narrow area at the bar. At the moment, there is room for several stools at the bar - but behind those stools is room only for 4 hi-tops and a banquette on one side. So two can sit side by side, but it works less well for a group of three or more.

I tried to take a friend last Friday night and arrived at 7ish. Hour wait, no reservations, but they are dealing with an onslaught of patrons in the most fair way they can. It is what it is.

We ended up eating elsewhere, but returned around 11 for wine and something sweet, which then turned into also something salty. Service was good, friendly without being inappropriately casual, super efficient. The coconut almond cheesecake tasted good and light. We also had homemade chips and bean dip. The chips were a little on the sweeter side but delicious, and there were a LOT of them. When they open for lunch I can picture myself on the patio with this dish, a book, and the full hour for lunch I'm technically supposed to get. 

We ended up trying again the following Monday. When I arrived at 7, the place was essentially empty. Before I could even be greeted, nine other people lined up behind me and suddenly place was packed. My dining mates did not arrive for another fifteen minutes (the third was an hour late!!) but they still sat me at a table for four (prime real estate) despite the fact that the party of seven could really have used the table (and would be paying more.) Even after I ordered nothing while I was waiting, they didn't ask me to move, they acted like they didn't even notice. After a few minutes I insisted on giving up the table anyways, but my point is this is NOT usual treatment in Toronto's trendy/popular restaurants. Hell, if you try to sit at a table at the Ceili Cottage and just order drinks? Lord help you for having the audacity to try. My point is they are focusing on welcoming service first and profit second. And at least in my case, well, customer for life. Basically, they had me at hello.

In the end my dining partner arrived and we both ordered ribs, her with fries. The ribs come up FAST, with three variants of BBQ sauce to try. 5 generous bones are somewhere between a dry-rub and your typical sauced preparation. And they were money, son. I mumbled ""I don't want this to be over,"" as I finished making out with my third rib. I wished for one more and my partner could have done with one less, so with an app I think it's the perfect portion for most people.

The slaw was fine and the baked beans were crazy good. We both agreed they were the best baked beans we'd ever had. The fries were a little underdone but the kitchen re-submurged them for us graciously upon request and were then perfect. 

Our late friend ordered the portobello frites. Amazing idea, but has the same mouthfeel as a deep fried pickle - without the lovely acidity. It's less frites, more like a mozzarella stick. As a mushroom enthusiast I insist the concept has potential and I hope they experiment a bit with the panko proportions.

To be fair though, I have yet to try the famous Little Miss BBQ, but I find it hard to get much better than Trapp Haus....AND there's not a crazy line where people are bringing their own lawn chairs to wait. Serving BBQ from a food truck only 6 months ago, they are now housed in a newly constructed space using modern construction techniques. 

I was surprised how small the dining area was, but it seemed to work perfectly. Along with tables and chairs, they have standing areas for people to eat along the walls, and there is outside seating. The restrooms are located outside and you have to get a key from the cashier, which I thought was weird. However, the restrooms are very clean, spacious, and they use modern materials and equipment.....with a nice little Dyson Airblade attached to the wall, and automatic fixtures and soap. One of the cleanest restrooms I've ever been to. 

The employees were friendly.....all of them were friendly. I felt like they genuinely wanted me to have a good experience. 

I ordered an ice water, and I expected to get tap water that tastes like tap water. Instead, there was a water dispenser serving purified drinking water. Who does that? Ice water is free, but they still serve you the good stuff. 

Now to the food.......get ready. 
I ordered ribs and pulled pork (the family combo, which is a great value by the way). The pulled pork was tender, juicy, and wonderfully fatty. It was a bit salty, I have to admit though, but overall, very good. 

The ribs were out of this world. They were the most tender ribs I have ever had. They were ""fall off the bone"" tender, but strong enough to stay on the bone for easy handling. Even the skirt (my least favorite part of a rib) was so tender. Skirts aren't usually tender. They mop the ribs a bit, but not too much. They're kind of a cross between dry and wet. 

One thing I want to point out is that the sides were amazing. Every single side I ordered (cornbread, coleslaw, potato salad, waffle fries, mac and cheese) all tasted delicious. You could tell they put much thought for every single side. I can't confirm, but I would bet they were all made in-house. They all had a taste to them like they were made by the same person. Every side was delicious which is unusual. 

The pitmaster ""Ribs"" came out to talk to me. I told him that I always look for new places to eat in Phoenix. He told me ""you just found your new home"". He was right. I'm coming back. Often.",2018-09-17 18:32:05

In all foodie honesty, Z-Grill is home to some of the best Indo-Pak food I've ever had. This praise comes with a reminder though...it is divey.

Z-Grill is located inside Zam Zam World Market, which is a decent little grocery, but it lacks the umph that other well-known ethnic groceries delivery. With that being said though, other groceries lack Z-Grill, and this is why it matters...

Everything I've tried from the restaurant, and I mean everything thus far, delivers. From the hummus, to the samosas, to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi, I've only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite. The flavors are robust, the sauces are spicy and, surprisingly, the prices are unbelievably reasonable.  It's safe to say that I'm addicted to this place. 

**A word of caution when trying Z-Grill. They are sometimes out of items on the menu. I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch, others might not. If they happen to be out of something, do yourself a favor and just try something else.**

I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill. This is a must-try in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy Indo-Pak food. Go try it!",2011-05-23 19:08:03

We arrived around 6:30 on a rainy evening so there was no wait. We were escorted to our booth and our waitress was quick and attentive. 

We had her put in the large sausage and mushroom deep dish pizza with extra sauce first because we anticipated a 45 min cook time. We then decided to get the calamari app to hold us over until the pizza came out. The app came out quickly. The calarmari was crispy and  properly seasoned. The pizza came out quicker than expected. It was massive, big enough to feed a family of 6. We were served a slice each. To be fair, I'm not a huge pizza fan in general but have enjoyed deep dish pizzas. However, I didn't like this piece of pie one bit. The pizza crust was a little limp on the bottom, the mushroom was undercooked and there was entirely too much cheese on it. 

With all of that being said, we had more than half of the pizza left over. We asked for two to-go boxes. The waitress came out with boxes --- all I could think of was -- yeah, I'm not eating any of that pizza. It's not because the pizza wasn't good as I mentioned since I could reheat them in an oven and could make it a little better.

We arrived around lunchtime on a Monday and the place was sparsely populated. I gave the menu a quick scan and almost immediately landed on the Jerk Pork Sandwich (""scotch bonnet aioli, fresh mango, coleslaw & tomatoes in a pita, served with fries & curried chickpeas"").

It arrived about 20 minutes later and I have to admit it's much, much better than I was expecting. I've grown a little weary of anything with jerk seasoning as of late, given that every time I seem to order it, the dish is bland and, worse still, hardly spicy at all.

That was definitely not the case here. The intimidatingly large concoction is full of well-spiced and flavorful pieces of pork, and the heat-level is, much to my delight, definitely higher than I was expecting. The mango, coleslaw, and tomatoes all work perfectly in the sandwich, while the pita tasted fresh and actually held up well to the various ingredients contained within (which is itself no small feat).

My one complaint would be that certain pieces of pork were a little chewy and overly fatty. With a sandwich like this, one wants unctuously soft chunks of meat and that was unfortunately not quite the case here.

As for the fries, they were outstanding, and the curried chickpeas, though not entirely necessary, were also quite good.",2018-08-13 19:53:41

There was lots of parking and we get seated right away.  We order the guacamole classico and the elote callejero. They both were so tasty.  I especially liked the elote - corn with cotija cheese, mayo and parpika.  Mmm- good.  

We then ordered pear mojitos, which were really good as well.  I then decided to order a carne asada taco and my date decides to order the enchiladas verde.  The carne asada was good, but quite honestly, I think it tastes just like any other Mexican joint.  I had a bite of the enchiladas and they were really good.

Pros:
-as expected, the view is spectacular
-it's not as hot as you think, the slight breeze from the water helps
-the bread and caesar salad was very good
-great picture opportunities

Cons:
-they only had one main server (with many sous servers) to take orders and give out the checks for the entire patio area of like 9 tables (we had 2 hours set aside for dinner before the show and we ended up being a little late)
-if you don't order a steak here, don't expect much as the seafood is just average here
-dress code somewhat enforced, might be inconvenient for people walking around in the crazy summer heat all day wearing shorts

I wasn't crazy about the atmosphere. And our table was very tiny, cramped, and uncomfortable.

But the food was very good overall. For my starter I got the chopped Stetson salad without salmon. I really wanted the mac and cheese (I'm obsessed)  but it is made with bacon. Maybe they can try putting the bacon on top instead? It's a peeve of mine when restaurants put meat products in their mac and cheese considering it is one of the few veg options. My husband decided to torture me and order it as his starter and he said it was very good. Especially with the spicy tomato sauce on the side. Back to my chopped salad. It was divine! Beautiful presentation, fresh tasting ingredients, delicious dressing. I loved their crunchy ""trail mix"" in it. Before Cowboy Ciao, Postinos was the only place I would go specifically for their salad. But I might have to make a few trips to Cowboy for this delicious salad.

For the entree my husband got the scallops. He loved them. I got their famous mushroom stir fry. Was it good? Yes. Did I hear angels singing? No. Now, don't get me wrong, I do think it was tasty but not worth the hype. The sauce is what made it good. Delicious, slightly spicy, creamy sauce. Like another Yelper stated, I wish it was served with a little bread, maybe a crostini, to sop up all the leftover sauce.  The mix of mushrooms were nice and the polenta was so-so. A little dry and under seasoned. And I was disappointed with how much avacado and cotija cheese was on top. Barely any, more like a garnish. There needs to be more because it really helps make this dish so delicious!

Desserts were good. Just good. I got the bread pudding. I liked the pine nuts in it. Nice unique touch. My husband got the banana pudding which he enjoyed, however he was a little frustrated he was having issues breaking the chocolate shell it came in. But watching him was quite amusing.

Saigon Nites also has some of the best pho that I've had in the valley. Their Pho Ga is fantastic and their Special Pho is made right, tripe and all!

Now the people running this place are the real reason that I always stop in. The service is usually amazing (unless they are swamped; it happens) and they are always very welcoming. This is the kind of restaurant that if you go in often enough, they will remember what you get and if you order it a special way.

When I find myself craving some good pho or curry on my lunch break, Saigon Nites always delivers a quality experience.",2009-12-18 09:14:11
r7rho1QlLfoouw3xNfOTaQ,p_OlY_uSdI6qyqJnC2-oRw,PBmMvDows5HWIqrEVvNfQQ,2,7,2,3,"We decided to try this restaurant today for the first time.  Hopefully, the issues that we experienced are due to the fact that the place is only 2 weeks old.  The decor is very nice but the South Braddock side dining room seems very cramped.  The tables are so close together that the servers can barely pass by without bumping the customers.  The servers are very nice and the owner did pop by our table to say hello which we appreciated.  The food service is slow.  Very, very slow.  Granted, the restaurant was very busy but Middle Eastern food isn't terribly time-consuming to prepare so, I was shocked when it took over 40 minutes for us to receive our dinners. My husband ordered the salted yogurt drink which was tasty until we found the remains of a metal scrubber pad in his drink.  The water glasses were water spotted and my glass still had lip prints on it.  Our server did bring me a clean glass with an apology but, looking around the dining room, I saw more dingy water glasses on the tables.  The cold appetizer plate was tasty but for $14 bucks, a little on the small side.  The grape leaves used in the dolmas were stringy but otherwise tasty.  After 45 minutes, our dinners finally arrived.  I ordered the chicken kebab which was tasty until I discovered that some of the chicken was undercooked.  The server apologized and they replaced the chicken that was rare with properly cooked chicken.  It came with rice, pickled red cabbage, and a small green salad.  The rice was a tad over salted but I can live with that.  My husband ordered the lamb kebabs which were delightful and tender.  Our daughter ordered the chicken Adana and that was pretty tasty but a bit dry.  Our daughter's boyfriend ordered the falafel platter which he said was OK but not great.   Dessert was really good.  We each ordered one of the 4 desserts on the menu so we could sample them.  The rice pudding is amazing and the portion is huge and the baklava was really good and dripping with honey.   The revani is a semolina cake that was not overly sweet and very light.  It was quite tasty.  The big winner of the night was the kazandibi - it is similar to creme brulee but without the caramelized sugar on the top.  The desserts almost made up for all the issues we experienced during our dinner.  Unfortunately, given all the problems with our dinner, the only thing we got for the trouble were apologies from the server (who was great).  But, there were no comped desserts for the inconvenience of the metal in the drink or the undercooked chicken.  I think I will wait several months before we head back to Istanbul Sofra in the hopes that time to mature and add more staff will make the experience a better one.  The final tab for the four of us (mind you, this is a BYOB so there was no wine involved) was $120.00.  In my opinion, that's a bit pricey for a restaurant with no liquor license.",2014-05-05 01:28:44

Let's start with the positive. 

Great patio and dining room. A pretty cool door in the bathroom-although there's rust in the sink and it's not that clean. Service was just OK (there you go, the 2 stars right there).

What i didn't like:

1. Labeling. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants call food a name that it's not accurate. Tortilla soup is more a Caldo Xochitl (tortilla soup has a tomato base broth). Rompope has no tequila.

2. Food. Cuitlacoche crepes tasted good but they had an after taste of burned oil. Tortilla soup was lame and well, not a tortilla soup. Mole was thin. Chiles rellenos had like pound and a half or cheese. It was just offensive the amount of cheese stuffed in this things. Bean & cheese tacos (kids menu) were bad. Guacamole was packed with onions and serrano chile, too overwhelming (I belive it was serrano). Rompope was just alcohol with milk, it tasted ok, but nothing impressive. 

The only dish I really liked was the chocolate cake. That was tasteful. 

3. Price. The price is ridiculous, specially what you get for it.

Most likely, I won't go back.

The best (worst) part is that they rather not accept American Express. They try to push you to use something else. wow",2012-10-29 16:23:46
RtM3HJX_5rJjxgWElWeazw,_MfYDCxHmMIQtrIIUBPW5Q,lo8WwqKogC-kz4toRvkdUQ,5,5,2,5,"KOKO! Share Bar is the newest effort by restaurateur and hospitality consultant Sang Kim (Blowfish, etc), and master chef, Shin Aoyama.  The two worked together on Ki Modern Japanese, where Shin was the executive chef. 

I was lucky enough to be invited to the grand-opening where I could sample several of the dishes.  I cannot explain how lucky we are as Torontonians to have access to a talent like Aoyama.  And even though the space is small, it's designed beautifully to be warm, inviting, and intimate, which is the key to making the ""Share Bar"" concept work.  Apparently, sharing food is a major part of Korean cuisine culture, and at KOKO! you're encouraged to dip right into the plates of your dinner companions.  Being able to share the experience of every single morsel that arrives at your table is one of the most extraordinary things I have had the chance to be a part of.   The bar could perhaps use a bit more variety, even keeping within the theme, but as it's only the first week, I'm sure this will come with time.  

The service is really what makes this place special.  In a city where so many of us have had some of the worst service imaginable, Sang Kim has spent an immense amount of time hand-picking only those individuals who are the most committed to GREAT service.  In an article by Daniel Alexandre Portoraro, of martiniboys.com, he explains ""Kim put out an open call to applicants; 192 answered, and each were sent the question of 'how to make the world a better place'. 57 answered, and each of them went on a 15-minute walking interview with Kim, talking about similar questions."" 

This will no doubt be one of Toronto's top restaurants in a very short time. I highly recommend the tuna and the butterfish.   I also highly recommend making a reservation before there's a waiting list.  ;)",2010-02-15 15:22:39

Despite all its offerings, the aisles are still spacious (I pushed my behemoth stroller through the whole store). Also, a family parking spot out front. Score!

I came here for pastries and left with six delicious items. It's no tax if you buy six, so how could I say no? Items range in price from $2 to $5, so pretty standard bakery fare. They also have cakes (6"" and 8"") starting at $30.

I also went cheapie and picked up a six-pack of discount nutella bombs (think boston cream donuts but with nutella inside and icing sugar outside) and it was not good. Very dry, and the nutella maybe only filled up 1/4 of the donut. Dry, I understand - I'm buying old donuts that are probably going or have gone stale. But there was definitely not enough nutella in there to compensate for the dryness.

The small cakes though - those were a gem. I picked up a variety of items and they were all fantastic. My favourite was the caramel crunch and the napolean, while my three year old gave two thumbs up for the chocolate cream puff.

They were weighed by the receptionist, initially checked out by a tech, and then finally given a good once over by the vet.  She was helpful and answered my questions about pet foods and meds and the like, and also told me about how they will price match name brand medications (in itself an ok deal, but they didn't carry any generics).  She was also suitably gushy about how gorgeous my animals are.  Standard vet visit (why don't people spill prices on here more often? is it considered rude?) was a bit over $50 per animal.

This is a formula restaurant that try's to appeal to young men who drink a lot and like Mexican food, and the young woman who are GFs, wives, or looking to be either that follow the men here. Just like hooters is an Owl, Pink Taco is an actual taco dish and not a sexual innuendo. (Yeah, right!) 

This is the first location, inside the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel, established in 1999, followed by Scottsdale, AZ and this year in Los Angeles, CA. They are planning to open in San Diego and Huntington Beach in the near future, but had problems with the name  in trying to open up a second Scottsdale location. (They should have tried Tempe!) 

The food isn't bad, actually, and the all female hostess/wait staff doesn't wear pink shorts and t-shirts like you would find in Hooters. 
The food is better than Hooters, which isn't saying a lot. I tried the chicken and cheese enchiladas, which came with finely shredded chicken stuffed into 3 enchiladas, and covered with half green and half red sauce (my choice) and covered with baked cheese. Rice and beans came on a side plate, all for $12.50 during lunch. Chicken Tostada was $10.75, and the Steak Burrito was $12.25. Soft drinks were $3.00 

This could be a fun place to go with your friends when a little drinking and humor are perhaps more important than the food you eat.

My husband and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night, and although not crowded, the restaurant was pretty busy, which I'm happy about. I want this place to stick around.

I've never had Cambodian food before, but as others have reported, it's a lot like Thai and Vietnamese food with French influences, which is not surprising.  I had the crepes.  They were filled with shrimp, ground pork and bean sprouts, and they came with mint, lettuce, cucumber slices, and cilantro.  I used my hands to make little crepe/lettuce rolls and then dipped them into the fish sauce.  I'm not certain that's how I was supposed to eat them, but it worked for me, and they were delicious!  My husband had the lak lok (I think that's what it was called--marinated beef pieces on a bed of greens with a side of rice), and he really like it too, although I think mine was better. . . .  We also each had a monster spring roll to start.  We really could have shared one, but I'm kind of glad we didn't.  Finally, we each had the iced jasmine tea.

Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool. 

 Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills. 

 Everyone's happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended.
 There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important. 

 Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice ""I'm over my man cave"" Craig's list second hand-me-down.

 Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience. 
 I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind. 

 If you want to know about the food- it's frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don't come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you. 

 In short, it's where you can take the kids when they've outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that.",2015-08-28 23:04:36

I visit Ellsworth ave plenty and I have been to Harris grill on numerous occasions. After working all day, and driving 2 hours to get home I was a little grumpy and wanting a good drink.

My two friends and I decided on the sangria. I've had it on numerous occasions and it can really hit the spot. The waiter suggested the caraf but HB warned us saying that they stuff it full of ice. The waiter insured us we would get around a glass and a half. We bypassed HB and ordered the caraf. Upon arrival we knew it was no bueno! The caraf was heaping full of fruit on the top followed by way too much ice. Our serving glasses also were heaped with the stuff even though we had asked for lite ice. I asked the waiter to pour for us bc I knew sangria was going everywhere. We ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail. We all told the waiter that it was pretty awful but he did nothing to correct the insult. Never ever order the caraf!!

To eat I had the pulled pork sandwhich and a side of mac n cheese. The flavor of the pulled pork was good and the pasta was delish. I will say the pork had some fatty bites that I didn't care for.

I have to preface that I started drinking beer for taste 2 years ago. I never liked it before that--was a wine and liquor person. When I tried sour beers I went berserk and started trying them like wines. Apparently marketers call people like me an ""experience maximizer"". So if you like to try a lot of something in small amounts, and enjoy tastings or sampling nice things alone, this place is for you. If I recall correctly, 4oz pours are $4. It gets way too easy for me to drop $20 here every week as my studio is a block away. Service is fast and the setting is perfect for a chatty intimate hangout as it never gets too loud. I have asked why their beer doesn't sell at the LCBO and the cute guy at the counter told me they need to produce a huge volume and they are just keeping up with their demand right now. Furthermore, if they were to enter the LCBO they'd have to make the same beer all the time and that would be no fun!

Anyway, on to the beer. I can't pretend to know anything about it and I'm only able to describe it using boxed-wine vocab. I am really into this place as they make many sour beers, and actually decent pale ales. Most IPAs/PAs have what I consider a sewage-y after taste. Their toad of light IPA is a lighter option and more wine-like than other IPAs. They have the Blood Light (a poke at ""bud light""?! lol) which is the stronger PA counterpart, which is medium-bitter but it doesn't linger. I also like that they have wine-hopped sour beers (White lies riesling, muscat, and sauvignon blanc) and citrusy flavours (Shu mei) which never overpower the taste of beer. The Paradise Lost guava would be an easy drinking intro to sours. There are many more like Fall of Thebes (in blueberry and cherry?) and Dark'n'Sour but those appear to be seasonal or come and go with tap rotation.",2018-09-12 19:17:51

This was a quick visit between my bar hopping and other eats this Vegas trip. I told myself I had to stop in here since it's been a year or so since I last visited and I did just for an appetizer. If there's anything I truly enjoyed from my previous visit, it was the sweet potato tamale that came with my pork tenderloin which prompted me to try the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic tamale this time around.

This tamale was very flavorful...a perfect blend of sweet corn and garlic. The tiger shrimp were a nice size as well as delicious. $18 well spent for a quick snack and worth it.

If there's one thing I can say about Mr. Flay, he knows how to make some damn good tamales with any spin he throws on them. My taste buds love it which means this will most likely draw me back in for another visit.

First off, a huge shout out to Gabriel N for taking me here! I remember coming here when I first arrived in Charlotte in 2011, but came at night. I thought the Sushi was good but nothing special.....

However, I remained a Ru San BUFFET virgin until Gabriel suggested we enjoy it together on a Friday. And I am SO glad we came here!

The selection of different Sushi's was really wide, and they had a surprising selection of ""hot"" entrees like fried rice and noodles which were very good.

But unquestionably the star was the Sushi. And I partook in almost all of them! My only ""complaint"" was that they were NOT labeled....I would HIGHLY recommend that Management do that so you know what you're eating! Thankfully I liked just about all of it, some more than others.

Then Gabriels orders 2 speciality dishes...the first being a Shrimp Tempura and the other a Fried whole clove of garlic roll. WOW was that ever good! But you better love garlic....and I certainly do!

And of course, they have some really good hot saki for a reasonable price.

Overall this really is a great value and the quality surprisingly good for a BUFFET. It has a definite ""Hipster"" vibe to it and is a lot of fun! Definitely on the recommended list! And thanks Gabriel for sharing this great place with me!",2015-02-12 16:19:36

The Italian bread was fresh and tasty, the 6"" sandwich which is more like 8+"" is loaded with meat (prosciutto, ham, salami, capicola) and fresh mozzarella.

Well, when I sunk my teeth into the ciabatta bread at home, it was not quite what I expected in the bread.  Ciabatta is rustic, with holes in it, crunchy on the outside, resistant to the tooth(a little bit).  This was not your typical ciabatta.  I imagine they made it at Blimpie so it is not the same as baked in a bakery.

5 Spice Hen w/ Tomato Rice -- The spices used on the chicken was pretty good. Chicken could've been a little more moist but none the less pretty well cooked. It was also a good portion. It looked like a whole chicken (or should I say hen) was used. It was about $13, which was is a good price for the portion. 

Oxtail Fries-- This was part of their specials & not on the menu. It was fries with oxtail, gravy, chopped green onions, and an over easy egg on top. The flavors really burst in your mouth. It was very unique. Honestly, I thought it was going to be like Carne Asada Fries but it had no resemble to it at all! Very good. That was about $9! I thought it was going to be more expensive! 

Vietnamese Donkey-- This is their touch of Moscow Mules. & we all know I order that everywhere I go. This one was a lot sweeter than most moscow mules I've tasted. They used a Lycée alcohol and you can defiantly taste it. It even comes out with an actual Lycée fruit that I appreciated very much.

I feel like these places aren't transparent about their materials, either. The salesperson did try to tell us that a dining table we were interested is was some composite of hard woods. When I went online I realized it was engineered stuff covered in wood veneers. I'm going to shop elsewhere for a dining set. I'll spend a bit more for something of higher quality.

We decided to try the ""flan de queso"" which was amazing , same quality you get in the island! You have to buy the whole flan which is like $6 and it is great to eat some there and then take home the rest. They sell tres leches too but they didn't have any left... no wonder!

We had a veggie bannock--which is just a sandwich. Although I know what a bannock is and realize the bread from the sandwich is ""the bannock"", I was expecting a type of pot pie. Still, it was a really delicious sandwich! We also had the tofurkey cutlet which was AMAZING. It is not the brand Tofurky sold in grocery stores, for you vegetarian savvy out there. It's just tofu. It's not breaded (thank goodness) but is smothered with mozzarella cheese--admittedly a first for me after 21 years of being meat-free [note, I started very young; I am not very old]. It is served with the most delicate quinoa and a very strong salsa which I think was loaded with horseradish. I hate horseradish but totally finished this! Alone, each component was good but together it was a magical symphony. The chef is a genius.

The sweet potato fries deserve their own separate paragraph. They are the BEST SWEET POTATO FRIES in Toronto!!!!! First, they are the perfect french fry shape. They are long rectangles--not shoestrings or tiny little nubs that you can find at other restaurants in the city. Second, they are fried to perfection. Third, they are fried with herbs which gives them an amazing flavour; not to mention the fried herbs are pretty tasty. Fourth, they are generously sprinkled with high quality sea salt. Fifth, they are served with a spicy mayo that has a real zing. Again, each component is good on its own but together they create magic.

On the downside, it was a little pricey. Overall, the price of the meals weren't bad but the portions were a bit small for the price. So, I have concluded this must be one of those high-end restaurants. :) The sweet potato fries however are perfectly priced.

The decor is breathtaking. Very rustic and industrial. I found myself really looking at the architecture and appreciating the time spent on every detail. They also have take away for lunch, which is great for people who work in the area.",2013-02-11 11:11:17

The dining room is open, bright, and very comfortable, with the bar being the main star of the space. My partner and I were greeted quickly when we walked in. The gentleman gave us the choice of two awkward tables in the dining room (well, one was in the entryway of the restaurant, and the other was an awkward high top in the middle of the dining room), so we opted to go outside. Not sure if they were understaffed, or if we caught the tail-end of a massive dinner rush, but every open table was dirty, and most not even pre-bussed. It took him about 5 minutes to clean our table (we were, however, greeted by every employee while we waited), and I must admit, it was worth it. The evening was beautiful last night, and the singer on the main stage of the Container Park was very talented, which really help compliment the evening for us, since we were celebrating a new job that I just landed. 
Our server, Alexis, was very friendly and accommodating. She was obviously busy, but she made it a point to come chat it up with us on a few occasions. It turns out that my partner and I know her sister's boyfriend - Vegas is really a small town, when you get down to it.  How often do you have organic, pleasant conversations with your server, and figure things out like that? My partner has a tomato allergy, so she was able to come up with substitution ideas on the fly, and they were spot-on!
We started with the Bianca Flatbread, and added the prosciutto, of course. I love it when they print the up charge on the menu so there isn't a question of what you're getting yourself into. The Flatbread was delicious, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, the toppings were generous and the sauce was delicious. 
I used my Yelp Check-In and got a small glass of the 1664 Blanc. I've had 1664 before, but never the Blanc. I was living for this beer! I really enjoyed the peach notes, and how smooth it was. I had to get a pint. 
I had the Hanger Steak Sandwich for my main course. It was cooked to a perfect medium, like I asked, and the caramelized onions were on point. The mayo was a bit overpowering, and the bread a little too tough, but it was still very enjoyable. The fries were great. My partner gave the fries a 6 out of 10, but I say they were more of an 8. Lol They were crispy on the edges, but still soft inside. The seasoning and truffle oil really set them off. 

This was a great first impression, and can't wait to try them out again. I had my eyes on the Chicken and Waffles...",2017-02-05 19:53:32

We stayed for a few hours in the afternoon and before we decided to leave (around 7PM), I noticed they had a projector screen. It looks like in the evenings they play movies and the night we went they were going to play Harry Potter!

I had never been to Aladdin's and was pleasantly surprised by their emphasis on fresh, wholesome ingredients. I ordered Aladdin's favorite combo to get a taste of beef, chicken and kabob. When the meal was served, I was a litle disappointed in the quantity. There was about 2 ounces of each meat. Just enough for about three to four bites. It truly was a taste of each. For the cost, I was expecting a little more. However, the quality of the meal was exceptional. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The meats were juicy and tender. The meal also was served with a small mixed green salad on the side.True mixed greens, no iceberg here. I chose to try Aladdin's dressing which was tangy and delicious.

I found the Diavola to be a tad under seasoned but when I dusted the surface with some parmesan it brought the desired level of saltiness to the pizza. I also found that the spicy salami did not bring the spiciness I wanted from the pizza. The Salsiccia was perfectly done and had  great flavor.

Best way I can describe it.  As their name suggests they emphasize outdoors and/or active wear.  They have shirts, pants, shorts, coats, and even shoes.  All supposedly geared for active lifestyles.

They are very pricey, but their garments allegedly have unique characteristics.  For example, I bought a shirt on sale that supposedly helps to cool you.  For what it's worth, if I'm walking down a hall I do feel a slight chill (if I'm just sitting around I don't feel it).  It appears to be a golf shirt.  They have others that wick moisture away from you.  Though I find cotton will do that, the synthetics do dry faster.

Sales people are helpful.  Occasionally it is difficult to find one who is available, but generally not too bad.

We tried a ton of different foods - will try to load pictures - we tried 45 different foods and only 4 things were repeated because we loved everything and were too full to order more between us three. My mom and sister enjoyed the experience as it was their first time. 

The service was fast for a Thursday night at 7 and the food was piping hot. A must try are their spicy salmon on a chip and their sushi rolls. The fish was fresh and delicious. Their ramen, pork fried rice etc was to die for! They even have takoyaki where I was soo surprised. We tried the salmon head (yum) and the dimsum which my mom stole all of cause she loved and ordered it twice more. 


Their mango mousse - you haven't lived till you have tried it! It's creamy and pulpy and cold and refreshing - I'm drooling as I write this!

Overall - great experience, good price for what they offer and totally family friendly.",2014-11-10 17:58:56

Cd_JiBTBiiZtzVb4u4hUnQ,cek_1lxcWUmOkVBtYMbQ-w,VHsNB3pdGVcRgs6C3jt6Zg,3,0,0,0,"My friends and I came in for an early dinner at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday.  We put in our names and hung around for 50 minutes, enjoying drinks and appetizers at the bar before being seated.  Even with a few tables opening up in the patio with the nice weather, this place is cramped and claustrophobic.  By the end of the meal, we had people's butts bumping into our faces as there was only standing room and we were seated at a table of normal height.

Probably one of the loudest bars I've visited in Champaign.  It's not that they blast music at obnoxious volumes, but the acoustics of the room amplify people's voices into a deafening jargon.  I was screaming in my friends' faces for most of our meal.  I guess I would recommend this place if you have hopes of getting cozy and face-to-face with a date.

Food was hit-or-miss for me.  The menu claims that their meat products are sourced from local farms (though I didn't inquire further).  My friends and I shared an appetizer of sweet potato chips, which had a nice dusting of curry powder on top.  For dinner, I had the fisherman's stew: the seafood was nicely cooked, but I didn't bother finishing the tomato broth, which was overpowering and somewhat jarring with the delicate seafood.  Since 50% of the bowl is filled with shells of various sea creatures (as you'd expect from ordering anything with mixed seafood), it makes a pretty light meal.  My friend absolutely loved the corned beef and cabbage, which was hearty and robust (I saw many plates of this popular dish being passed around the restaurant).  The dish is a little more refined than traditional corned beef; Dublin O'Neil's uses red cabbage and kale mashed potatoes in place of the usual boiled veggies.  Another friend said he always comes on Friday for the lunch special: meatloaf with some kind of spicy sauce concocted in the restaurant next door (301 Mongolia).

Drinks are very much on the affordable side, with every 20-oz. draught around $5.  There's also quite an extensive list of bottles and spirits, though given the competition between bars in town, it probably doesn't have the most absurdly obscure things.  I felt like the Irish theme here was kind of forced and contrived, but I appreciated that the bartender knew how to make and serve a snakebite (snakebite = 1/2 Harp Lager + 1/2 Magner's Cider).  This is the perfect summer beverage, and I'll be stopping by Dublin O'Neil's over the next few months solely for this drink.",2012-03-28 13:35:47

We had made reservations earlier in the week for when Kaya opened and I am glad that we did as the restaurant seemed to fill up quickly shortly after we arrived.

We decided to start off our brunch by splitting the conch fritters.  There were seven conch balls that were served on top of a tropical tarter sauce that contained capers.  The conch was nice and crispy and paired well with the slightly salty tarter sauce.  For my entree I decided upon the slow roasted pork benedict.  After a long wait of about 70 minutes after being seated, it finally arrived.  Even though I generally do not like cornbread, I enjoyed the play on Eggs Benedict by using the cornbread as the English muffin and pork instead of the ham.  It tasted wonderful as well with the pork being tender and juicy while the lime hollandaise sauce had a good flavor to it.  The sides were good to as they made a sweet and savory mixture with the hash browns mixed in with pineapple chunks.  Several times during the wait for our entrees the waitress apologized to us and even took the step of notifying the manager that our food took a long time, without us saying a word about it. After the meal the manager came over to us and apologized herself and comped two of the meals, once again without us having said anything.  From that I would have to say that they have some pretty good customer service.

For the most part, it's your standard taco joint that sort of falls in the middle between the bottom of the barrel cheap tacos and the more upscale joints that keep popping up in Phoenix.

At two dollars a taco, you're actually getting a lot of food. All tacos were heavily packed with meat, which many people probably appreciate. My girlfriend and I tried the asada, pastor, and a chorizo. Additionally, I ordered a bare-bones cheese quesadilla.

Quality of the tortillas and meat is fine, although nothing I'd really call spectacular in comparison to other places. The oil they provided is decent, but insanely spicy, so be very careful. You'll receive plenty of limes and cucumbers without even asking, which should always be a no-brainer regardless. The quesadilla was just kind of bland.

The restaurant itself, even with its air conditioner, is freaking hot! And despite its grade-A cleanliness that people keep mentioning for some reason, their bathroom is anything but. Not that that factors into the quality of the food, of course.

The food is tasty but the service is horrible. I typically go through the drive-through about 3 to 5 times a month to grab donuts for the kids and inevitably in every order, they mess something up.

Once it was so comics I couldn't help but laugh! I got to the drive through and I ordered the normal: one rainbow sprinkles and one chocolate glazed. Haha!! When I checked the bag I had two rainbow sprinkles. I politely ask them to correct the order one rainbow sprinkle one chocolate glazed. You would think that's simple enough but instead I then got two chocolate glazed and zero rainbow sprinkles. 

No, this still isn't right... I asked again for them to correct this. I need two donuts: one rainbow sprinkle, one chocolate glazed.

Finally success with the donuts. But we still needed to correct the milk. I asked for chocolate milk and received white milk. Oh the frustration!!

Today, I ordered six assorted donuts and a 12 pack of donut holes along with a small vanilla latte.  I got to the window and the donuts were not the donuts I asked for. So I politely ask the lady to correct the order and mentioned that every time I visit this location something is wrong with my order.   She smiled and said but not today, right? Instead we just gave you an extra donut. 

I said, ""sure, but what about the vanilla latte I ordered."" ""That will be $1.53 ma'am,"" she replied.

Kaya has a lower price range but I still don't think the food is worth the amount they charge here. I had the conch chowder, which was fantastic, and the crispy fish tacos. The tacos were huge - I will give them that - but they were mostly packed with cabbage and impossible to eat without making a mess. I am a very experienced taco-eater and know some taco-eating tricks, but I tried just about everything including using silverware, and was quite unsuccessful. I was also bummed that they took the coconut milk cocktail off the menu - that was my favorite summertime cocktail in all of Pittsburgh. Oh well!",2013-05-03 22:05:05

For a fastfood Asian establishment, this place kicks ass. It is so good. I had a large Sukiyaki Bowl and it was so big I had leftovers for dinner. Because I loved it so much, I made my husband go get the Teriyaki Beef since other Yelpers raved about it. He said the owner or chef had him try the sauce first and he couldn't believe how good it tasted. Lots of depth of flavors, hints of citrus, the right amount of savory and sweetness, and seriously like crack. I WILL be back.

I love the FISH TACOS entree & it comes w/ plantains & coconut yogurt dipping sauce.  You can also order the same fish tacos for the happy hour special, minus the plantains which are like dessert to me!!  Similar to how my mom makes them.  The tacos have big chunks of lightly battered mahi mahi, lite pico de gallo & a Chipotle type mayo dressing.  I add Cholula.

I was hooked on the STEAK SALAD for months cause of the tamarind dressing!  The slight sweetness it adds to the steak, potatoes & dressing makes me order extra dressing every time!  I love the Roma tomatoes w/ alil salt & pepper.  Also the dehydrated type of mushroom they use adds a wonderful touch.  I promise everything it comes w/ is well thought of & filling for a salad!

The Veggie Farro w/ chicken is also healthy yet very filling & fulfilling.  It has a beautiful cauliflower steak as well.  

The stuffed chicken is absolutely to die for!  I do not like cooked red pepper & this dish is the only that I can actually order as is.  The sweet tomato type dressing & stuffed chicken remind me of home, fantastic.  

The HAPPY HOUR menu is so well worth it!  The Duo of Dips, believe it or not is incredible.  Now I only order it w/ only the two cheese dips.  Coconut shrimp is butterflied & served w/ a tropical dip that compliments it well.  Also my friends & I love to share the Pork Quesadillas w/ this amazing goat cheese.  

The wine selection such as the Raeburn is my go to Chardonnay.  I prefer the Dark N Stormy, a rum drink, to cocktails such as martini's & Mai Tai's.  They are all tasty such as the Coconut Cloud & Key Lime Pie martini!!  The two I absolutely recommend if you're not into rum.  Lastly, they had a chef's special tonight which was a clam dish w/ toasted garlic pesto bread!  WOW!  An absolute must.  Cheers!",2016-12-03 07:41:33

The suite wasn't what I had expected a suite to be.. it for sure wasn't Wynn or Venetian type of room but it did make the stay a bit more pleasant. The restroom didn't have a locking door, it was just a sliding glass so that was a bit awkward.

The rooms were pretty clean but I still felt it was definitely a step down from like a Mirage. Given the price and the quality of room, I'll come back again. It was also pretty close to everything so that's a plus.

I had been to the other Times Square (Deer Valley) a few times and decided to check out this location.  I called in and placed my order for their carryout special of a 16' One Topping Pizza for $12.00 ($13.00 after tax).  I went with a plain cheese pie with garlic as my topping.  I drove down, walked up to the bar, paid for my pizza and was on my way. Here is how it was.............

Large Garlic Pie-  This thing looked great.  Looked like the same crust and cheese as the other Times Square.  I took a bite in and noticed that it was just a tad ""off"".  They buried the garlic underneath the cheese and right away it tasted different.  Not sure if the garlic cloves they used today were bad, or what?  I know minced garlic tastes a bit strong sometimes, but this was more powerful and bitter than usual.  Besides that, even the cheese didn't taste the same as the Deer Valley spot.  It wasn't as stringy and flavorful.  Maybe I should have went with a meat topping like before?  Who knows?  The crust was pretty good but even that wasn't as great as I had remembered, either!  I ate 5 slices of it and couldn't do anymore.  I gave my remaining 3 slices to a homeless dude on the corner of Bell and the 17 freeway right before I went back to work.  He was stoked!  

Overall, the pizza was just meh today.  The service on the other hand was outstanding!  The bartender/waitress lady was very nice and smiley.  She asked how my day was, we talked about the weather etc all while she was getting my pizza and paper plates.  She was incredibly friendly and was the highlight of my visit to the restaurant.

They have both an indoor section and an outdoor though I feel that their outdoor patio isn't all that special and better ones can be found in the city. 

First impresions were great as the waitstaff were very generous with their attention and very friendly (earning their tip!) the sushi chefs were also quite friendly and helped me with my choice of fish for lunch. 

I enjoyed their lunch time sashimi  plate, which consisted of 15 pieces of delicate and very good quality fish. salad and miso soup was automatically served with the order and I found that both were good but their salad was more of a standout. The meal in my opinion looked better than their summerlicious offering and I would definitely go there for lunch again, though it would have to be for a better reason than just being hungry.

The prices are pretty standard and you're looking at  an under $20 lunch.

It's a little hard to explain, but it's nice to feel like you're at home and not in a theater because you can't see the people below you . I also like the concessions more here too because it's mostly self serve and pay at the end. I like being able to get candy and mix and match by the lb vs buying a $6 bag of one kind.

The food here is cheap and really good.

The scrambled egg sandwich was done just the way I like. Soft white bread with no crust. Eggs buttered up and a bit runny. 

The rice rolls were also done really well here. Soft with a bit of chew to it.

The dish that really impressed me was the satay beef with noodles and soup. The bowl is super large portion size. Choice of noodles which made me happy since I prefer the thicker noodles. The satay beef was so plentiful and it was also soft and tender. Also came with some veggies too.

There is a nice variety of sandwiches with cool names and tasty ingredients -- their cheesesteak is good, even if it isn't something that the people from Philadelphia would consider authentic. The bread is fresh and so are the ingredients.

My kids love the pizza here, which doesn't hurt when we're deciding where to go. Because they have other good things on the menu, even if I don't feel like pizza, they can get what they want. And, if I want pizza, I think it is pretty good as well. 

I enjoy the salads. The spinach salad with spicy pecans is probably my favorite, but there is another one with a fried ""wheel"" of goat cheese on top that is nice as well. 

This latest visit -- I think this is the 35th time I've checked in here on Yelp -- was for their new breakfast offering. Currently, only offered on weekends, they have a good selection of options that is not overly extensive, but covers most of the bases. Since this was my first time, I ordered the first thing on the menu: a smothered breakfast burrito. Mine was 3 scrambled eggs with chorizo and cheese, smothered in a spicy green chili sauce and served with hash brown potatoes. I enjoyed it a lot. Note that they warn you on the menu that their green chili sauce tends towards spicy. They are not kidding and I suggest getting it on the side if you are worried. It is not just spicy, though, it has a nice flavor. 

They brew coffee from local roaster Piexoto. I had heard of them but have not yet made it into their shop to get coffee. The coffee had a good flavor and they've moved up on my list of local coffee shops to visit once I can get over to their Chandler location. 

Since I have only tried the burrito, and I don't know that the biscuit my wife had was quite as good as the homemade tortilla that was wrapped around my eggs and chorizo, I can't speak to the overall breakfast offering, but I would go back for the green chili sauce alone. And the coffee.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the staff. They have been consistently friendly and helpful during our many visits. It was the ""breakfast grand opening"" this time, and the owner even stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking.",2017-01-23 15:52:27

Love Tadka! Love! I haven't had Indian food this good since I moved home from London. I am sure there are other good Indian restaurants in the Cleveland area; I just haven't found them yet. 

Both Tadka and the Chinese restaurant next door have a sleek modern vibe to their decor (as sleek and modern as you can in a strip mall); probably hoping to cater to new audiences. However, when we walked in - on a Friday night - the place was empty save two small tables. The host cast my mom and I a sideways glance and asked ""Are you here for Indian or Chinese? Cos Chinese is next door."" We assured him we were there for the curry and were shown to our very long, very low booth. 

Our waiter ending being the manager, possibly the owner, so I went with my gut and had him select our courses. He asked our likes and dislikes and went about with suggestions. We started with an ""amuse bouche"" for lack of a better term of chana masala. It was tasty and pleasant way to start the meal. We moved on to our appetizers: samosas and tandoori lamb. The samosas were perfect - crisp, flaky exterior; soft, pillowy interior - and huge! It was the tandoori lamb that stole the show for the entire evening. Four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. I think they were too spicy for dear mom - I do believe her spice tolerance has decreased with age (I hope she's not reading this...). They were amazing - perfectly cooked with just the right amount of gamey-ness in the lamb. And yes, you do need a little bit of gamey with lamb otherwise you might as well order beef (but I guess you wouldn't in an Indian restaurant, but anyway...).

After our starters we split a basket of regular and garlic nan (don't kiss anyone for at least 24 hours after), plain basmati and tikka masala. I know, tika masala is about as authentic as I am, but it's still tasty and a good intro for mom. Everything was amazing and there was plenty to take home for lunch the next day for both of us. Can you believe it all came to under $40? 

The manager/owner also surprised us with a complimentary dessert. Now who doesn't love that?",2010-09-20 17:51:41

A side of house made steak sauce and some himilayan salt was presented to enhance the flavor.  I preferred only the salt after grilling.  The fourth course was six pieces of nigiri including three rare fishes from Japan that I had never had raw, and a very nice piece of oh-toro to finish off the meal.  Finally, they brought a custard desert with fresh fruit which was a great way to finish the meal.  We each had a half bottle of booze (sake for me and reisling for the lady).  The bill with tip was slightly under $300 so be prepared to spend.  That being said, if you found A5 kobe at any restaurant it would run $25-30 an ounce and the portions here were about 4-5oz so I felt it was well worth the price.",2014-01-30 16:20:39

I ordered the Lobster & Shrimp Linguini, which at $23 was a bit of a fat whack, but I do love seafood.  Besides, the business associate that invited me was paying.  

The dish arrived with a half tail of lobster, which was about the size of a large langoustine, or one of the jumbo shrimp at St. Lawrence Market.  That was it for the lobster.  Also included were 4 medium shrimp.  That was it for the shrimp.  That was it for the seafood.  That was it for $23.

I hesitate writing that as I live for burgers but this place really made an impression on me. To start, the lady that took my order was incredibly helpful, and that pleased me. I must have looked confused because she chimed in with some of her favorites, some great options, or letting me know that I can create my own. So, thats what I did. 

I created and ordered a double, bacon, swiss, avocado, and mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. As I read on the menu, and what struck my fancy, is that the burger meat is from the ""highest quality, Black Angus whole muscle cuts of short rib & chuck, produced by NYC's own Pat La Frieda!"" I like that they are conscious of the meat they are using. I don't know if it's where the meat came from or what, but it was delicious. It was very very juicy and flavorful and I had a hard time putting it down and breathing during my bites. Also, I liked the toasted bun and the fries were so good, not soggy or cold and the perfect compliment. 

The amount of food was more than decent and the presentation of the food was cute with the little cutting board and basket of fries. It also came with the 'bang bang' sauce, which I didn't use on my burger but did dip some of my fries in it and it was good but I wouldn't want to take away from the burger by using it too much or pouring it on top. 

The other menu options look pretty tasty, I have to try the pork belly burger, and the other specialty burgers all look appetizing. I will say, food and service is a 5 for me but the place itself is probably a 4. It's on the smaller side and is an order upfront, get your drink, sit down and then they bring it to you, smashbruger, type set up - but smaller. When I've gone there were only a few people and still felt myself having to consciously maneuver around, so I could only imagine how it would be with just a few more people.

I finally went earlier this week, and was extremely impressed with the decor and the service (everyone from the host stand to the waiter -- service is top notch here).  When the menu came, I was in a seafood eater's heaven!!  Their seafood, which ranges from the traditional (tuna, salmon, swordfish) to the the more interesting (opakapaka and chilean seabass), is flown in fresh.... and that's what allows Mastro's to keep the flavors simple so that the fish remains the star on the plate.  I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass and my man went for their jumbo lobster tails.  Brilliance.   The group we were with also ordered almost all the sides on this menu and stand outs were the creamed spinach, the asparagus, and the sauteed mushrooms.   Their wine list is also pretty extensive and the sauvignon blanc was fantastic.   We skipped dessert because we were too full... but the tea we had (they have really interesting flavors, including chocolate coconut) was a perfect compliment to a great meal.  Given the choice between Bartolotta (see my review) and Mastro's, I would take Mastro's any day.  Bravo, Mastro's, on a job well done!!",2010-08-01 06:02:10

I've been looking forward for this place to open because there can be limited options for me to get food on time when I am on my break. My coworkers also recommended this place for their cheap lunch specials and their fancy dish arrangements.

I called Bonsai one day to order a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box during my break. Since it was around $9, I would consider this lunch bento box to be very affordable, and there are also a lot of options that you can choose from, such as chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki. When I came to pick up my food, I got a salmon teriyaki lunch special instead of a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box. I was kind of disappointed because I wanted to try their shumai and California roll, but at least I got to try their salmon teriyaki, rice, and miso soup. The salmon teriyaki and rice were very appetizing, but I believe that I should have gotten the salad instead of the miso soup. 

I am giving Bonsai four stars for now because I believe that there are still improvements that they can make since they are a new restaurant. If you ever order to-go, make sure that they give you the right type of meal because there's a chance that they can give you a lunch special instead of a bento box for example.

As many have said before, cash only. So if you don't already have your cash or stopped at an ATM, no need to worry there is an ATM right as you walk in.

The place is set up like a classic diner inside with the addition of some late model wood paneling. It's hideous, and I love it. From the booths to the counter seats (where I assume you have to be a regular to sit there). Even the desert case at the register, sadly only filled with minimal treats to take with you.  The bathrooms are typical and scary. I walked into a swimming pool waiting to happen because someone forgot to turn off the water. 

The food, hmm the food. What an interesting array of food to have for this place. From grape leaves to meatloaf. Speaking of meatloaf, that's what I had. Two decent size slices of meatloaf, a scoop of diner mashed potatoes, and the gravy on the side.

I sat at the sushi bar and I was familiar with the staff, my old sushi chef from Yama Sushi was now here (surprise surprise) making my rolls.

I adore the Family Roll and the Leo Ball. The Mochi here is also excellent.

My previous experiences were all good. I had gone with a friend once and they had a super spicy roll. The waitress noticed they were having a hard time with how spicy it was, so she brought us FREE mochi ice cream.

I was expecting good service and good sushi. Few people were in there as it was lunchtime and a weekday.

Regardless of there being multiple sushi chefs and very few customers (4 at most), my rolls weren't made very well and they took a while to arrive, even with help. My drink was constantly empty. And the worst part (and this is why I haven't returned since and didn't give 4-5 stars...), I WAITED OVER AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES FOR MY CHECK.

I was at a loss. I wanted to dine and dash so badly, but I'm not like that. And hell, I haven't even gone back - so maybe I should have.

That was the most ridiculous experience ever and I turn the other way now and go to Sapporo down the street.

The food was definitely better on this visit.  I wanted to give them 2 last time and couldn't do it just based on one visit.  They could just have had a bad day.  I ordered the same this time.  1/2 rack, beans, slaw.  It was good.  I would return.  I think some things could be better so I hesitate to give them 4 stars.

The ribs are good.  I like them to be a little juicier but they were definitely not as dry as my first visit.  I liked the mild sauce.  It has a little tang and is sweet but not sickeningly so.  They have a rub on them but it's indistinct to me.  Does it sweat off in a wrap as they hold them?  I don't love the texture of them and maybe this is a heat issue on the smoker and maybe it's the way they hold them.  I still like them and gobbled them up.

The slaw was good and had a lot more flavor to it than the first time I tried it.  A little sweet with a nice tang.  The beans weren't swimming this time and I really enjoyed them.  

This is a trailer, not a restaurant but I do wish they would do a couple things to rise above.  There's no recycling.  None of the product they use to serve and package is recyclable except the grocery bags. Not even the aluminum foil lined tissue they put in the bottom of your styrofoam box is recyclable.  DON""T serve my food in aluminum!!!!!!  I also saw they wrap their ribs in aluminum foil and I hope they use plastic wrap first.  Either way, I bet they're throwing it away.  If you aren't going to offer recycling or use recyclable product, buy biodegradable.  It's time to take some responsibility.  It's not the 70s anymore.  I didn't order a drink (all bottled) or I would have taken the empty with me.  You can do better than this and for $15 a half rack I think you could step up and spend a little more money for some better service ware.

I've dropped by here to see a few different films, most recently ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"", part of the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson.

The theatre itself isn't too much to write home about - it's older, not super clean and hosts only two theatres. Pricing is roughly the same as other local Regal theatres, but the reason it's a four star and not a three star, IMO, is the selection of indie flicks. While they only play two at a time, the selection changes over every few weeks - giving movie goers a chance to make a trip to see that selective release. 

The concessions are just as tasty as other Regal theaters and the seats are pretty comfy, albeit a bit lower than other theaters. That's worth noting for those of us who are vertically challenged. Employees aren't the most chipper here, but really, it doesn't bother me too much. 

FYI to all: As Jason mentioned, the bathrooms are upstairs and for the ladies, there are only two stalls. So, hold it afterwards and head next store to Panera if you're in a crowded theater! 

Yay for a local, classic theater with interesting flicks.",2010-09-06 22:34:56

We figured it would be like Max, Salo-Salo and Cebu Inasal combined.  Unfortunately, the latter two restaurants were already closed down.  We were fully satisfied with the service and great food.  We had Fish Balls, Ginataang Langka, Chicken BBQ skewers, Crispy Pata, and Buko Pandan.  The Fish Balls didn't taste like the Fish Balls we remembered.  The Ginataang Langka was so delicious!!!

Groupon makes me try new restaurants and an expiring Groupon brought me here last Saturday night for dinner. I was not alone in my procrastination, as they were packed early in the evening, leaving me with an 8pm dinner reservation for two.

The booth we were seated in was comfortable and the atmosphere was warm, inviting and not formal at all, which I was thankful for. I was thankful for this because I was wearing shorts and flip flops as were some of the other diners. It's a golf resort establishment, so wear something with a collar but no need for a jacket or tie, y'all.

We didn't do the Restaurant Week menu- it was not an option to be paired with Groupon- so we ordered the charcuterie plate and I opted for the Cedar River AZ ribeye and my main squeeze ordered the pan roasted halibut. *FYI- the menu on Yelp is old and dusty and not at all close to what they're serving now so find that here:http://wigwamarizona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Litchfields-Menu-Summer-2015F.pdf

Servers brought warm sourdough on the half-loaf with house made herb butter. Delicious and not too overwhelming portion wise. You ask for more, and they'll bring you some. 

The kitchen is open to the dining room and I mean it's one of the more transparent food prep and fire areas you'll see at a restaurant. There's a wood-fired grill and oven with a gas range next to it, each one helmed by its own chef in clear view of the dining room should you choose to see how they work the food orders for the waitstaff.

For $15, the charcuterie plate was crazy good and the portions were enough for 4 people. Duck prosciutto, hot coppa ham, dried chorizo, some fresh white cheeses (cheese should never be yellow or American), corn nuts made in the kitchen, some bomb ass olives, pickles and small slices of grilled bread. Damn good, people.

Plates were timed perfectly as our entrees arrived less than 5 minutes after we finished destroying the appetizer. 

The presentations are not crazy artistic with lots of sauces drizzled and things on plates, but my steak and her fish filet looked outstanding. The ribeye was served with garlic mashed yukon golds and a nice, smoky red wine sauce while the halibut was laid atop some wild mushrooms of several varieties, baby spinach and snap peas. 

Both the steak and the fish were cooked to perfection- with the halibut having that golden crust that makes for terrific flavor and a medium rare ribeye from the wood fire over cast iron grates. Both entrees were delicious and the portions were large but not overwhelming. 

I ain't new to eating good food so believe me when I say that we had great service and a dynamite meal at Litchfield's. I don't know what the deal is with the other reviews dissing the place. I will definitely be back for dinner.

I came here in February 2016 and my first thought was that the restaurant was TINY - there are very few tables and it is very cramped. Between the two of us, we were able to sample a lot of the Winterlicious menu:

Bread to start (complimentary) - Nothing special, thin pieces of baguette dipped in olive oil
Chestnut soup - Really flavourful and delicious, no complaints here
Squash and Beet salad - Tiny portion with tiny pieces of squash and beet! It seemed more like it was meant for a tiny baby with a tiny mouth and tiny teeth. Such a sad excuse for a salad even though the flavour was okay.

Squash Potato Gnocchi - the gnocchi had good pillow-y texture but I found this dish way too salty. Would not order again.
Beef Cheeks - really good, fall-off-the-bone meat with delicious potato puree and sauce.

Chocolate Mousse - This dessert was delicious but I do think it's difficult to ruin a chocolate mousse. The serving size was very reasonable and the flavour was rich and decadent.
Creme Caramel - The salted caramel topping was delicious, but the ""creme"" part just tasted like flavourless cream. Nothing special. 

Drinks - I had the Bara drink, which is a combination of gin, sake, pink peppercorn, blackberries and rhubarb bitters. I really think the restaurant needs to rethink this cocktail because it honestly looked like dirty water! It was brown and opaque with several fibers floating around in it. The taste was okay but the presentation was off-putting. 

In conclusion, I definitely would not recommend Winterlicious at this restaurant unless you only order the chestnut soup, beef cheeks, and chocolate mousse. Based on reviews I think it would probably be a lot better if you ordered off the a la carte menu, which is not an option during winterlicious (except cheese/salami boards).",2016-02-09 04:58:32

I had the DAM burger special, which is 1/4 pound beef patty, fries, and a drink for about $6.50.  I added mushrooms and Swiss cheese, which were .50 each extra.  I was disappointed that the mushrooms were not fresh, but canned--blech.  The fries weren't bad, but I wish I had ordered onion rings instead.  The good news is that the service was very attentive, even though it was busy and there were customers waiting for a table.  Overall, it wasn't a bad meal, but just okay.

I put a couple glops of mild chili pepper paste in my tortilla soup, it makes all the difference (use half malt-liquor, half chicken stock for the base), add roasted poblanos in adobo sauce (1 chile and one teaspoon of sauce is good for us), and fry some thinly sliced pasilla or anaheim peppers in the chicken fat rendered from the skins removed from the chicken thighs that you'll later shred and add back to the broth.

The tea selection includes six Sloan Leaf options. While the Signature Black isn't the most aromatic, it's a strong full-bodied tea, which I find is required to hold up against all the sweets.

In lieu of the tiered plate tower, a decorative holder arrives instead. While pretty to look at, it's difficult to use as you need to keep swiveling it to the side (on a small packed table) to extract food. For anyone who's clumsy, I'd approach removing the middle items carefully.

I'm always partial to the tea sandwiches. Ritz Café offers four with the afternoon tea: a traditional cucumber and dill cream cheese that's open faced and incorporates strong dill flavours; smoked salmon with pickled onion stuff in a croissant; a ham and cheddar in a bun that's way too hard; and the best of the bunch, a mustardy egg salad enhanced with celery seeds.

Of course, it's not tea without scones. While, I personally prefer one large one to two small scones (so there's more of the fluffy innards), Ritz's scones were warm and thankfully didn't contain any fruit to allow the Devonshire cream and selection of Graves preserves to flavour the biscuit.

To end the meal off on a sweet note, a selection of desserts including a creamy lemon cheese cake; a really chocolatey and overly sweet macaron; and a tasty raspberry tart that had a light crispy shortbread crust.",2018-10-31 10:21:34

VbbQoo_DHYdS15aUlAbTvg,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,zuVvDYJkKAbXQTTBauAqJQ,3,4,2,2,"With a whole day of eating including a 26-course masterpiece at Binkley's behind me the second day of my trip to the Valley would be a clinic day...starting at 8:00...which of course meant a 10 mile run at 5:00am was not out of the question, nor was breakfast beforehand, in this case a place recently brought to national attention by (insert synonym for annoying) food personality Guy Fieri - Over Easy Café.  Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting (and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding) the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go.

Arriving shortly after the doors opened at 6:30 Over Easy Café was easily located via GPS and attached to the Phoenix Coyotes Ice Den practice facility I allocated parking quickly and after a quick browse of the rink I made my way into the café - a starkly decorated seemingly converted office space with a breakfast bar and Formica all around and with a few tables of patrons already seated I was greeted at the door with the suggestion to sit anywhere I like.  In this case electing for a two-top near the doors I took my seat where silverware wrapped in napkins along with the menu were already in place and grabbing a copy of the local paper I started to peruse the menu moments before service would arrive, a pleasant young lady named Samantha who appeared to be the only server working the room.

Clearly a place for regulars as nearly ever patron to enter after me was greeted by name Samantha welcomed me and filling my water asked if I'd like coffee while I perused the menu; an offer I gladly agreed to when I noted that they were serving the same locally roasted Café Cortez as the day prior at Morning Glory.  

With my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 7:00 I opted for two dishes, both garnering a ""good choice,"" and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive.

With service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some (Food Network) call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs, three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar.  Warned that these were hot in temperature but mild in flavor Samantha suggested a combination of maple syrup (not authentic maple, mind you) and hot sauce as a condiment for this and first tasting the Dogs themselves and then with syrup and sauce I had to admit they were better dressed but not terribly impressive either way.  A bit spicy and a nice blend of sweet and savory the overall impression was that yes, this was kind of like a corndog, but without the cornbread and thus inferior.  Light and without oiliness the crispness was appreciated, but overall rather lacking for a ""signature"" dish.

Moving next to my second selection, the better of the two by some degree, a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients, but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas, crunchy pecans, and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee.  Certainly not a breakfast for those lacking a sweet tooth one slice was definitely enough, especially after the waffle dogs.

With a coffee offered for the road and the clock just shy of 7:45 I accepted the to-go cup and after paying the admittedly modest tab plus tip made my way from the restaurant en route to clinic along with the newspaper housing and sports sections that I was encouraged to take along with me.   Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy, but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad.",2011-10-13 01:36:41

Fix8 seems to specialize in meal prep, but does offer individual meals to enjoy there or grab on the go. I don't mind doing my own meal planning and preparation so this isn't a service that I'll probably ever use. 

The inside of the restaurant is simple. There are a couple of tables and no décor. Several shelves of nutritional products line the front corner of the restaurant. 

Meals are ordered by the ounces of protein and then include two sides. There is a large list of sides to choose from including potatoes, salad, rice, vegetables, etc. They have a large variety of protein options including chicken, steak, fish, and tofu.

I went with nine ounces of the Garlic Steak with sweet potatoes and grilled mushrooms. This meal comes in at $16.99 which I thought was pricey. I went with the larger portion so I could make two meals of it and justify the cost a bit. I've ordered this steak every time I've stopped here and it wasn't that great this time. It was a little tough and not very flavorful. The potatoes were plain and don't have any seasoning. The grilled mushrooms were fine. My meal wasn't bad, but it wasn't flavorful either. Restaurants like this appeal to me because my hope is that they can make healthy food taste better than I can at home. 

Overall, this spot is good if you are in a hurry or feeling lazy and need a healthy meal.",2018-06-06 15:05:25

Arrived just after they opened and was seated rather quickly. Server took drink orders quickly, the complementary chips and salsa came out promptly and our order was taken. We ran out of chips and our server was busy on the other side of the room helping other patrons or getting food out from the kitchen so we were worried we wouldn't get a refill till our meal came out. After about five (wife says more like 10) minutes of waiting, the hostess surprised us and delivered some fresh chips to all the dining tables including ours.  Food was filling but the flavors didn't provide any wow factor to make us want to come back anytime soon. The chicken empanada was the worst item. Only minimal chicken inside whose flavor was overpowered by the cheese. The cheese inside as well as the cheese dip it came with tasted like canned cheese from the store. Bright spot of OTB is the runner who first delivered our chips and then our meal. She was very cheerful, and acknowledged us when we said thank you as compared to our server who did his job but seemed to already be thinking of the next table.  Three stars for providing a filling meal but not an experience.",2015-01-17 21:50:26

Located in the lobby of The Stratosphere and operating 24/7 since its inception Roxy's Diner had always struck me as the sort of restaurant targeting the hotel's drunken late nights but with a recent menu update and a fresh coat of paint I suddenly found the place calling my name, a 6:00am breakfast proving well worth the trek.  Large in size and copious in choices from the 'all-day' menu as Marilyn Monroe films and 50s décor flourish beneath an era appropriate soundtrack it was to smiling service that my arrival was met and although coffee refills occasionally required reminder nothing about kitschy cuisine lacked in the least.  Beginning first with a duo of French Toasts, one part savory and one thoroughly sweet, suffice it to say that when compared to central-strip 24/7s like Central or Carnegie Roxy's portions trend large for the price and although the sandwich was quite good with crispy bacon and fluffy eggs between supple bread it paled in comparison to the cinnamon roll's gluttonous spiral complete with frosting and further gilded with a warm maple sidecar.  Setting aside parts of the first course ""to-go"" (a ridiculous $1 surcharge for the box on my bill) and turning attention to desserts it was to another duo that I was treated and although I'm rather certain the bread pudding suffered a delay en route given the lukewarm temperature and melted ice cream the flavors were quite pleasant, a compliment equally offered to a sizable $6 carrot cake rife with cinnamon and thickly frosted with citrus-tinged cream cheese.",2014-04-14 03:39:30

The Ikura was ok, a bit small but tasted pretty good. The avocado roll was my favorite of the three; in general, they got the shape of the hand rolls correct, which is a prerequisite for me to give them the thumbs up. The sweet potato roll was a bit less distinctive as the sweet potato was a bit hard in it. Service was professional.

Massage Works is truly ""no-frills."" The business is located in a pretty red brick business park with sufficient parking, a real plus in Uptown Charlotte. Upon entering the lights were dimmed and the massage therapists were seated behind a desk that looked like it might be better suited in a business office, but who even cares? These women had MAGIC HANDS.

My biggest complaint about massage places, and female masseuses is the lack of firm pressure. (I know, my sexism disgusts me, but at least I'm aware of it!). I like a massage that works out all my knots and kinks...where I want to scream at the top of my lungs, ""COME ON BABY MAKE IT HURT SO GOOD!"" And I never can seem to find that elusive balance of pleasure and pain. But now I have.

My boyfriend and I did a couple's massage...we called the day-of to see if we could be squeezed in and were graciously accommodated. At the end, we both slowly peeled ourselves off the table, looked in each other's eyes, and said in unison, ""That was the best massage of my life. JINX.""

The massage was affordable, and Massage Works offers a special where you can purchase four massages and get a fifth free, and they don't care who uses the massages! So couples like us can purchase one package to pay for our next few sessions. Which we scheduled immediately. Because is was really THAT amazing.",2016-08-02 21:26:04

Japanese owned and run.  Certain fish they consistently get really good ones, while others can be hit or miss. 

Here are some tips based on my experience:

The IKURA is excellent - some of the best I've had anywhere.
The HAMACHI and SALMON are always very good here.  
Ah-Chi-Chi roll is one of my favorite rolls anywhere. It's a little spicy.
Unagi is always bad.
Mackarel is not very good.
Tilapia is solid.
Toro is usually just so-so.  I like the hamachi better than the toro here.
Uni is hit or miss - I always order it with quail egg added.
Ama-ebi is always bad.
They have some crazy rolls with cream cheese and deep fried this or that if you're into that kind of thing.  
Salmon skin roll pretty good.

The deep fried oysters and dynamite are pretty good.
The poke is not great.

If you like toro, ama-ebi, ikura, and uni then order the all-you-can-eat DINNER even at lunchtime - it's only $5 more and you get those four ""premium"" items which any one is around $5 and you cannot get with lunch.

If sitting at the sushi bar - avoid the old sushi chef with glasses - he is slow and grumpy.  There is a young Hawaiian guy JR who is great.

I always get iced green tea here - it's pretty good.

Oh puh-leez!  Ask him which university he graduated from and the douchebaggery is over. 
 
This place is chill. You sit, drink and have a conversation. Older men smoking their cigars. There's live music. The band that was playing the night we went was actually pretty good. The set they played sounded like something from my playlist: ""Drive"" by Incubus, ""Wonderwall"" by Oasis, ""Pumped Up Kicks"" by Foster the People, and I want to say they performed ""Yellow"" by Coldplay but I'm not too sure after a few drinks. I was singing along and feeling good.

They gave us Japanese crackers and wasabi peas. The drinks were not so expensive. The restaurant we went to prior to Lift was charging way more for a glass of Riesling. I also tried their Nacional (rum, Licor 43, pineapple juice and lime)...delicious! The service was good too.

(Tip - if you sit outside, ask for a table in the shade - it's well-worth the longer wait. If you're in the direct sun, like we were, you'll roast and sweat if you don't ask and once you lock into your seat, it's tough to move because apparently those seats in the shade are locked up by those waiting in line. We eventually got to move though (since they realized we were in for the long haul that afternoon, haha... many, many drinks.) 

PS - Swear this is true but that night after Cabo I had a dream like Point Break where I was in charge of finding the head of a surfer crew who was robbing banks, lead by Sammy Hagar. I found them surfing at a cove in Mexico, chased him up a mountain side to the edge of a cliff where he jumped, turned in the air, flipped me off while smiling, pulled a ripcord and base jumped. He cut the cord in the air, tucked and rolled, yelled and took off in an awaiting jeep.

Came here in a Tuesday evening and found out the large specialty pizzas were $12.00. We ordered the Upper Trio and the Margarita Pizzas. 

The Upper Trio was excellent! Generous amount of pepperoni, sausage and meatballs. The crust is excellent and the type of pizza you fold to eat. I like the slight burnt spots so you know it is cooked just right with not overly over cooked. 

My daughter had the Margarita and she said it was very good so getting a thumbs up from her you know it was good.

Their pastas are also excellent and previous we had the Alfredo Pasta and Meatball Pasta which each were so good.

AS7ei9aBCGewQUVZnf7SqQ,t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,5,1,0,1,"Been here a few times, and I've loved it each time. Tonight's particular occasion was to celebrate my boyfriend's mom's birthday. We originally had our hearts set on going to Bacchanal, the buffet inside Caesar's Palace, but the line was ridiculously long. So we checked out the wait at Mesa Grill, and the tables were filled, but they were able to seat us without too long of a wait--thankfully!!! I was famished!!

Right in the heart of Caesar Palace's casino, the decor is colorful and inviting. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. The dress code can be anywhere from casual to dressy. We were dressed casually, but never felt that we were underdressed. The atmosphere felt easy and had an eclectic array of patrons!

We started off with classic margaritas. Not too tart or too sweet, but refreshing. They brought out a bread basket which came with an assortment of cornbread, a jalapeño bread, and a raisin bread--all done with a southwestern flair. The jalapeño bread definitely had a kick!

For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp and grits. It was one of the specials they had for the night. Two jumbo sized shrimp on a bed of corn and grits, with a spicy, chile type of sauce with hints of cilantro and peanuts (which gave it a Thai kind of flair, I think).

For our main course, I ordered the blue corn crusted halibut. It was served on top of a ""warm salsa cruda"" which was a mixture of olives, tomatoes, jalapeños, and capers. The blue corn crust added a delightful crisp to the fresh and flaky halibut, and it's flavor and texture were only complimented by the salsa. Delicious! I also ordered a tamale as a side. It had some jalapeño butter melted right into the tamale--yum! My boyfriend had another one of the specials: the pork chops. It was served with vegetables and potatoes, and had a nice smokey, spicy flavor. My boyfriend's mom had the salmon with a side of mashed potatoes. The salmon was grilled and slightly charred, which added a good smokey flavor to her dish, as well. The mashed potatoes were also delicious!

At this point, we were pretty stuffed but my boyfriend's family is friends with Chef Augustine, and he brought out 3 different kinds of dessert: a strawberry tarte, an assortment of sorbets, and a coconut cake. The strawberry tarte was my favorite. It reminded me of a fancy strawberry shortcake, a buttery tarte shell, filled with a strawberry compote type of consistency, topped with a fresh whipped cream. The sorbet assortment came with 3 different favors: coconut, raspberry, and mango habanero (which was such a strange and exciting burst of flavor lol). The coconut cake consisted of several layers with a coconut creme anglaise and toasted coconut--not to sweet, great with coffee, a must for coconut lovers!

Finally, for the service. They've got the friendliest, knowledgable, and thoughtful group of servers, hosts, and food runners. 

Everything about this place is pretty great. You gotta give it a try!",2013-09-01 05:50:44

Decided to stop in on my way to a meeting downtown recently and the burrito was as good as I remembered and definitely filling! Both the red and green salsas are delicious -- the green more tangy and the red offering a little more heat.

The service was friendly but I was a little disappointed to get a flat soda replaced with another flat soda with no one sticking around to see if it was any better (which it wasn't, obviously). When my food arrived, I let them know there was no improvement and requested water instead and I wasn't charged for the soft drink. Good communication, but I really could've used that caffeine boost to survive my meeting.

This is definitely a place to come and share food. The portions are large and you will really want to try a bit of everything rather than eat an entire cheese bread to yourself!

Breads, pickled vegetables and sauces - yum! Bread was served warm and the sauces were great.
Cobb salad - it was ok, a bit too saucy for me.
Potato pancakes - I really enjoyed these with the sour cream.
Hachapuri suliko - this was a puff pastry with cheese. Awesome option for cheese lovers! I don't eat much cheese though so one slice of this was plenty for me. Imagine a large circle if cheese coated with a very thin layer of puff pastry.
Hachapuri adjarsky - this was the boat shape bread with cheese and egg. This is really good too if you are a cheese lover. Tasted similar to the suliko cheese but with bread instead.
Lamb ribs pilaf - delicious! Lamb was so tender and rice was flavourful.
Beef dumpling - this was ok. I prefer chinese dumplings.
Crepe with lamb - looked like a giant jamaican patty. Tried a bite of it and it didn't stand out for me too much.
Rack of lamb - super tender and juicy

The hostess was very friendly and helpful in getting us seated and equipped with menus. An assistant dropped chips and salsa immediately.   After a few minutes a waiter came by to ask if we had been helped and took drink orders when we said we had not. We then waited for what seemed like a long time for beverages, including water. After we received our table side guacamole, one friend asked for more chips. The waiter first moved my chips across the table but after that move we did get another basket. I ordered a glass of wine to go with my entree. It arrived several minutes late. In fairness to the waiter, I don't know if there was enough staff for the 40 or 50 diners who were seated in the half hour after we arrived. He did check on us after we got our food. 
I ordered the dish I have ordered several times in the past ten years. It was ""hotter"" than in the past, hard to eat. One friend couldn't get through her meal due to heavy handed use of chiles. My wife wasn't impressed with her entree salad. The guacamole is always good. We didn't have dessert. I had the CasaRita and it was as good as I remembered.  The wine list isn't long but is adequate.

Each and every one of them was fantastic. The audience loved them. The bar worked around all the music, serving drinks and food. The staff was friendly and did their jobs very well. Prices for drinks and food was reasonable, given there was no charge the entertainment. But, there was a bucket to pay the performers and I gave them a goodly amount as they deserved it.

So I had to do a triple-take when, in the course of scouting out Michelin-rated restaurants, I saw that Mesa Grill's Yelp entry had been changed to just ""Casual."" Really? Get your jeans on, honey!

Now, if only I had done a triple-take at my Michelin list and realized that it was from 2008. Mesa Grill lost their star - Chef Bobby Flay's only Michelin star - in 2009. Oops! Oh well, here in 2012 we like Yelp stars better anyway, don't we?

Lunch (12:30ish) was busy, with many patrons looking like they were brokering some kind of big shoulder pads deal at the table, but there were also plenty of tourists wearing ""ordinary"" clothes - nice jeans or pants, nondescript shirts, etc. One guy at the bar had a baseball cap on. A woman at the bar was dressed for a Pussycat Dolls audition. The typical range of casino couture.

We only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated at one of the many two-tops on the upper elevations in the restaurant.

""Remember those tables on our last cruise?"" Mike asked. He meant the ones where you could hug the people at the next table without hardly stretching. The closeness of these tables at Mesa Grill was disappointing, and next time I'd wait for something a little more to the side, or for a four-top when things are less busy. Being distracted by our neighbours' conversations as well as repeating ourselves in ""safe to be broadcasted"" murmurs is not part of my ideal dining experience.

The good news is that the food is so delicious that I can't wait to go back. 

Our meal started with a complimentary bread basket: Jalapeno Asiago, Corn Muffin, and Raisin Bread.

I figured the corn muffin, a yin-yang mix of yellow and blue corn meal, would be the best. Mesa Grill specializes in southwestern cuisine, after all.

Meh, it was okay. A bit flat. Maybe a tiny-tiny bit metallic? Then I tried the jalapeno and asiago slice.

Oh-Em-Geezers. A-MAAAA-ZING!

How could this unassuming white, porous, fluffy bread pack so much sharp and sour flavour with a crusty edge?

I only had a little nibble of the raisin bread (sweet crumb, very bitter crust) because our appetizers arrived. Chicken and Black Bean Quesadillas for Mike, Cremini Mushroom Quesadillas for me.

Two words I could just copy and paste 100x into this review would be ""subtlety"" and ""layers."" With every bite of everything we ordered at Mesa Grill there would be a new flavour to discover. I'm sure I ate half the meal with my head cocked as I tried to taste everything that had gone into the dishes.

Nobody adores cheese more than I do, and I know some people have criticized Mesa Grill for not offering very cheesy fare, but my quesadilla was perfectly ""cheesed."" In fact, I kept peeking inside until I could figure it out, but the cheese was melted in such a way to completely cover and blend with the tortilla to create what I thought at first was just a thick bottom tortilla. Harmony: Mesa Grill does it.

Contrasting this pillow bottom was an overall crispiness. Crispy, but not burnt whatsoever. (I don't like even a suggestion of burnt taste.) Between the perfect cheese, the crunch, the light layer of mushrooms that didn't dominate the dish, and the yummy dollops of cream on top of each quarter-slice, how is there any praise left for the fried egg on top?

Oh, but there must be, because this was genius. The fried egg just added a very simple ""edge"" to the quesadilla's taste without interfering with any of the flavours already going on.

My stomach was full and my heart was broken that I couldn't eat my last three bites, but we did have main courses coming. Gah! (Next time I'll just get a starter and dessert and skip the corn muffin. There was absolutely no room for any of the exciting dessert options on this trip.)

Mike had ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which are an interpretation of satay sticks with tortillas and peanut-chile sauce. (I'll let him talk these up in his own review.) I ordered the only vegetarian item in the ""main dish"" section: the Cornmeal-Crusted Chile Relleno. (Note: there are more vegetarian appetizers.)

Often I find chile rellenos too greasy or samey or gloopy, but they can be good. I wanted to see what Flay's people would do.

Short version: it was the best chile relleno I've had in my life... and I say this even though I thought the cornmeal coat was absolutely bland if not a bit yucky. (If there was any seasoning, I couldn't taste it.) But once I peeled that back, the chile itself (and all the complex cheesy yumness inside) was delicious. With the herbs on top and drizzled sauces underneath, every bite was just as intriguing and new as with the quesadilla.

Yelp says I'm out of characters, so I'll just say this: Michelin needs to bring back the Las Vegas guide and bring back Bobby's star.",2011-11-19 19:02:18

Park Central  is a great traditional deli with a large varied menu. Today we had the sloppy Joe and it was very good, as were the side dishes and desserts.  Our Sloppy Joe sandwiches were big, very big, and very flavourful  and Park Central  doesn't skimp on the meat. Even the children's  menu is a bargain. It's rare to find a deli where the food is good and still be able to satisfy my nephews craving for a grilled cheese sandwich. 

Deli staff comes around to see if you need a refill, napkins, or just to ask if you need your table cleared of dishes.  It is comon to see staff carrying food to tables for elderly patrons or mothers with small children.  What more can I say, good food, good  service.

We did the loop trail, which was 4.6 miles. You don't have as much of a panoramic view as you do when you're hiking camelback, but the trail is very peaceful for a Sunday afternoon. This is more of a relaxing hike than a exercise hike. It's a good running hike, since you don't have much of an incline, but be careful of all the rocks and unsteady gravel. There are a lot of cacti here, I bet it would be amazing to come here when they bloom. Anyway, I became bored halfway in with nothing much to look at, but the start of the trail is really cool. 
You have a map of the mountains and the types of routes you can take. Also have a lot of information on the preserve.

It's a nice spot to wind down the evening right on the casino floor, but it's not a boisterous loud bar. It's more of a leather couch and quiet conversation place to kick back and relax with a well made bourbon drink. Dimly lit and low key.

I walked in to this so called ""comfortable"" lobby and approached the main desk to inquire about an oil change. The little guy at the counter said ""wait one minute, I'll be with you soon"". So I stepped to the side. After standing there and waiting for 10-15 minutes, he finally acknowledges me again and we start the process of getting the oil change. I got the synthetic-blend for $29.95. I also used the ""$10"" off for checking in on Yelp! discount they had. 

""It's going to be an hour wait""... so I sit and wait.. now the true colors start to shine. Just with me waiting there, I'm hearing the counter guy calling a lady about her vehicle, each call adding another $160 to $220 more than what was originally quoted to her.. after three calls in 40 mins this lady was charged an extra $700 on top of the original quoted $70 job!!! (Stick with me now)

Next, there's a guy in the waiting room with me who was getting a/c work done. He was taking advantage of their a/c special which (if I remember correctly) was $69.99. This guy sounded like he was in dire need of an a/c fix. Next thing I hear is the counter guy telling the car owner that there's a pin hole leak in one of the hoses and to fix this it's going to cost another $100, the customer hesitantly agrees to go with the fix. 10 minutes pass by and the counter guy ask the a/c customer to come back to the desk where he then tells the customer that the previous solution was an ineffective solution and now they think it's the o-rings causing the leak and IF that's the problem it'll cost this guy another $160 to repair.. for O-RINGS?!?!? $160 DOLLARS?!?!?! So by this point you can see and hear the customer starting to get worried and again hesitantly agrees to pay the upcharge. So he walked in looking to pay $70 and will be paying an extra $260 on top of that for a solution that ""MIGHT"" work.

I start thinking to my self ""these a-holes better not try upselling me for anything, I just want an oil change"". So my name is called, my truck is ready, and BOOM... ""well we see that your brakes might be a little light and causing a slight squeal which will cost $199.99 for front or back brakes... also we noticed a slight leak in the front struts which will cost $308.99""

Now the fun part--- the oil change was $29.95.. I used the Yelp! $10 off any service coupon which would put me at $19.95... my bill total was $40 dollars... now I'm left scratching
my head, where is this extra $20 coming from?!?! He proceeds to tell me it from TAXES!!! Are you fkin kidding me?!?!?! 

This place is a scam center and perfect scamming for those people too stupid to realize they are being worked over.

The shipping side of OnTrac seems to be good, but when you need to contact them it's a pain.  You can't even call them to schedule a delivery unless you want to wait on hold for almost an hour.

When I want to pay OnTrac MONEY I can't even do that, they don't have online billing, I have to call and wait forever just to pay them.  UPS isn't much better.  I wish DHL was still around.",2016-03-05 01:46:06

I've taken work friends, family, friends here for both dinner and lunches and not impressed.  For the money, you're better off going elsewhere.  I do miss the service we used to get here and we've even had birthday parties here (adults), but that didn't matter the past few times.

Very quick and thorough service.  Our waiter, Dave, was friendly and attentive.  He's clearly a professional and knows what he is doing.

We ordered the tortilla chips and salsa and guacamole for our appetizer.  Nothing special, but a good pre-dinner snack.

My main course was the mahi-mahi burger with a side of their potato salad.  My fish was cooked well but I will say that if I hadn't had the side of ""boom boom"" or ""bam bam"" sauce it would have been a pretty bland dish.  The potato salad was just ok.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  My mom had the fish tacos which you are given two of.  She said it was ok, but nothing spectacular.

When I tried it, my first thoughts were it was gritty/grassy and tasteless/ice watery. The lady then said she could add more agave to make it sweeter. It was better but still not that great for $13. 

Next time, I think I will stick to their juice. I tried the bee royal sample and it was good.

We hadn't planned on that taking an hour and a half so that was really unfortunate.

When we came in we decided to sit at a booth because it was pretty chilly out.  It wasn't too busy, but we only counted 3 servers.  I think that was what caused the majority of our problems...

It took our waitress like 10 minutes before she came over to greet us with our bottle of water and glasses.  Because it took a while for her to came over we ordered drinks and chips and salsa.  Drinks took another 15 minutes so by the time they came we had already finished with our chips and were so hungry we almost ate the paper.  

Two of our friends ordered the tacos which they said were decent.  I ordered the tinga burrito bowl.  Luckily the meat was good because the black eyed peas were an awkward addition and the rice was hard.  My other friend ordered the nachos (with no meat) which also had the strange black eyed peas and some cheese sprinkled on them.  So unfortunate the food was a flop. Bland.

She didn't come back to check on us very often and we noticed two other tables complaining from the same issue, different server.  Seems like they were understaffed and it impacted the service in a BAD way.  

It's unfortunate we didn't like it here because we were excited about the new location and the cool new look.  We left saying we wouldn't come back.  Hopefully after a while of being back up and running they will get things going a bit better, I'm not opposed to giving it another shot.",2014-02-03 02:42:09

Everything about the food pissed me off.  From small things like selling three kinds of iced tea but not offering sliced lemons to accompany (instead they have tiny industrial packets of lemon juice).  Their baked beans were a sugar-dominated gloppy mess.  No smoke flavor.  Their sauces are similarly sugary.  No depth.  No smoke.  Just sugary sweetness.

But of course much could be forgiven if the BBQ rocked.  It doesn't.  I came in with a group and we decided to order a 'family meal' for 4 which included our choice of meats.  So we opted for ribs (on the list of meats) only to he told, after some confusion at the counter which required a few workers to be consulted, that we could not order ribs for a 4 - person family meal.  Okay.  Whatever.  So we opted for brisket instead.

The brisket arrived as a shredded pile of plain, ordinary meat.  I was expecting slices of pit-bbqed beef - not dried shredded pile of beef.  No smokey flavor.  No dark bits of 'bark'.  Virtually indistinguishable from a roasted piece of a cheap cut overcooked and shredded and left for hours to sit around.

The 'hot' bbq sauce was not hot and with little tang - just overwhelming sweetness.  The condiment bar had pickle slices - the cheapest, most industrialized, neon-yellowed pickles you can imagine.  Felt like I was eating from products right off the shelf at Smart & Final.

I rarely get pissed off by a meal - but this one got to me.  BBQ can be great, and it's just not that hard to do something at least ordinary.  But these folks have managed to screw it all up, royally.  I won't be back - unless after permanently shutting it's doors they auction off the furniture.  In that case - I'm gonna come back and buy that pig portrait hanging on the back wall.  That thing is hysterical!",2016-11-04 13:44:13

It is ridiculously inexpensive, and for the money, I thought the food was decent.  We started with the homus.  I didn't think it was great, but it was okay.  The pita bread it was served with was nothing special, similar to the pita pockets from any supermarket.  The Arabic bread my lunch was served with was much better, a soft flat bread.  I had the chicken shawarma plate which was served with rice and tabouli.  The tabouli was very good, although I don't much care for tabouli in general...or rice.  So I'm not sure why I ordered the plate instead of the sandwich.  Maybe I just wanted to see more food on my plate.  That sounds like me.  The flavor of the shawarma was good, but I was really disappointed in the chicken.  It was everything from larger chunks of meat to itty bitty little scraps, mostly scraps.  But again, dirt cheap so you can only complain so much.

We also browsed in the grocery part and picked up some packaged goodies and 2 pieces of baklava.  Probably some of the best baklava I have had!  They were out of the pecan variety, but there was also almond, pistachio, and cashew to choose from.  It was something crazy like a buck a piece.

Overall, I'm glad we went, and I would go again.  But I don't know I would go out of my way unless their dinner menu is different than the lunch menu, or I was seeking out the baklava.",2009-09-07 02:42:59

My 5* is reserved (see below) for the best of a category.  And although this place rocks, it's not the absolute best.  That being said, it's the absolute best for a reasonably priced restaurant that's in my city, that I can go to without saving and setting aside money just for the event.  I'm giving it a 4.5* that I cannot round to 5 just because I'm sticking to a consistent rating system.  But by every-day standard, this place is a solid 5*!

The bf brought me here for my birthday dinner, and we had the omakase (6-course meal).  We both really enjoyed the meal, and left sufficiently satiated. The problem with omakase at sushi places is that you often finish the courses and still feel hungry.  But here, we had a cute little appetizer dish, followed by a wonderful grilled black cod with miso paste (I'm assuming it's inspired by Nobu's black cod with miso -- different, not as good, but still delicious).  The next 2 courses were a sashimi platter, followed by a nigri platter -- both serving quality fresh cuts of fish, presented beautifully, and yummilicious!  And the last 2 courses were miso soup and a dessert.  Their green tea ice cream is made in house using match green tea -- which I love!!  But if you're used to the store-bought super sweet green tea, you'll find this to be much less sweet and a stronger green tea flavor.

 If you call ahead quite a bit in advance, you can reserve a table.  We did, just because the bf hates waiting for restaurants.  But they have very few tables, most of the seating is at the bar -- and that's walk-in seating.  If you come during peak hours, you'll likely have to wait 60-90 mins for a seat without reservations. If you're planning on walking in, try going before 7pm or after 10pm to avoid the long wait.  But regardless of how you go, just go... it's delicious!

Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back

2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.

I asked her to shave Milo but to leave his face round, I have severe allergies and needed to keep his hair extremely short to avoid dirt and grass getting stuck in it.  She explained very carefully that it would not be a ""cute"" cut and I was ok with it. Well, few hour later I came back to pick up my puppy and let me tell you, I don't know what she meant by not cute. His hair cut is perfect!! It is short, cute, there are no blunt lines throughout his cut, he smells fantastic, and he looks absolutely cute. 
The best part in all of this is that Milo didn't run to me when I came to pick him up, which means that he was happy and had a great time while at The Dog Wash.

We brought our own wine, which had a $2.50 fee for the bottle - it's nice when BYOB is free, but $2.50 split between several people is really nothing, so no biggie. She opened the wine for us and brought glasses.  I know that a few people ordered non-alcoholic drinks and did not receive them, but were initially charged for them on the check, so we had to get that fixed.  Minor hassle.  We began with fried green plantains which were hot and crispy - they were served with ketchup, but when we asked if they had any other sauce, she brought us out something more flavorful to try!

I think everyone like their entrees.  I know the flavor of mine was fantastic - the server recommended the BBQ Jerk Chicken, with their homemade BBQ sauce, and it really was great.  I don't think it's too spicy for anybody who can eat Thai and Indian food at a moderate spice level, but it does have heat so I would not recommend it to someone who can't handle that.  Anyway the flavor was great, but there just....wasn't much chicken!  There were 4 pieces but it seemed to be mostly bone/connective tissue - the meat-to-bone ratio was sadly low.  The meat was so juicy, I would've loved a bigger portion, or bigger pieces of meat!  I got black beans and rice/peas for my sides.  Heads up people - ""rice and peas"" = rice and beans, so don't go blaming the restaurant for getting your side dish wrong.  The sides were very mild in flavor, which was nice because they served to calm the palate after the spicier entree.

We were there for an hour and 45 minutes before we'd all paid, so things did move a bit slowly, but we didn't really mind.  Sounds like other people are saying that the restaurant is often slow, so heads up about that.  The waitress also brought our checks before asking if we wanted dessert, and I know some people wanted cake, so that might be in their best interest to fix!

All in all, a tasty and authentic meal.  I would loooove to up my review to 4-stars, which I would do if I came back and got another great-tasting meal that had a larger portion!",2010-09-16 00:57:12

***********PLEASE READ************:: Their spicy level is NO JOKE. They have a 1-10 scale with 10 being the most spicy. Now, I love spicy foods and can handle spiciness. When I go to Thai places and order my pad thai spicy, I usually request my spiciness in the B grading scale range. Soooo....I ordered my chicken pad thai with a level 8. HOLY SHIT.....this was wayyyyy tooo spicy for me. I couldn't even eat my dish because my entire mouth was burning. Even with a small bite, I had to gulp down water. I got full off water.

If you have trouble finding this truck around town, you'll have no trouble finding it at Food Truck Fridays. (Additional Info. below).

Chef Brown's truck is infamous for its legendary Jamburrito. Legend has it that the Jamburrrito is  jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla. Intrigued by what I had heard about this Southwest Cajun Fusion, I had to experience it for myself, and I took my husband along for the ride. Just like Indiana Jones looking for the lost ark, we journeyed downtown to Food Truck Fridays on a quest for the Jamburrito.

We discovered the Jamburrito three Fridays ago, and have returned often.The truck serves up food that is fresh, addictive, top quality, reasonably priced, and packed with a lot of punch. You're left full and satisfied because of the cajun flavors and portions. I can see why this truck was given high marks in AZ, and was almost selected for the Great Food Truck Race on the Food Network!!

Recommendations: 

CHICKEN or GRILLED CATFISH JAMBURRITO
We usually order the chicken or grilled catfish jamburrito and some hushpuppies. Oh my gosh!! Heaven in our mouths. One of the things I am particular about are tortillas, and the tortillas Chef Brown uses are spot on. While eating the Jamburrito I felt like I had one foot in New Orleans, and the other in Texas. 

BELGIAN WAFFLES AND BUFFALO WINGS
This order includes one waffle, three buffalo wings, and some hushpuppies with dipping sauce. Best waffle and wings ever!!!! The waffle is crisp and is dusted with bacon and powdered sugar that can be dipped in syrup. Yummy!!!! The wings don't look like your typical wing. They look like mini lamb chops with a little bone sticking out. The wings are meaty, juicy, and have a crispy skin. The wings are placed in a rubb and sauce. Amazing!!! Oh my gosh!!!! My mouth is watering while I type this up.

Stop reading...go and visit..and tell him that Tenisha says hi!!!


Additional Info:
The truck is a part of a food truck coalition that can be found  in the Phoenix Public Market Parking Lot on Fridays from 11am-1:30pm and Saturdays from 8am-Noon.

Decided to finally stop out at Pgh Winery on a rainy Saturday during one of the wife and I's ritualistic sip and savor tours of the strip.  Decided to drive down as it was a bit of a hike from the main weekend activities around Wholey's.

I'd say the wine itself is average for your typical Western PA buy/import grapes and process establishment, but that's not a bad thing!  (Seemed reasonably priced)

Where Pgh Winery really shines is down in the basement.  Do yourself a favor, bring some good conversation, but a bottle of wine and go down there when no one else is there.  Sounds odd, but my wife and I had one of the best times taking in the ambiance of the place (walls are lined with wine barrels, tables are wine barrels with lights in them, etc.) and grooving out to whatever Pandora station they had playing at the time (almost positive it was the Beastie Boys).

Being in the hot dessert year round, it's  only natural that these business pop up here and there.  What we do (or did) lack was REALLY GOOD indoor playgrounds.   Fortunately, Kangamoo is now here.  

Touted as a playground for children ages 1-10, Kangamoo caters to the parents as well.  And that's where they win my recommendation for best indoor playground in Las Vegas.   For the children, there are 10,000 sq feet of slides, tunnels, swings, trampolines, bridges, and many things to climb.   A separate area at the front for infants and toddlers holds toys, a play kitchen, bouncing balls, and rocking horses.  There are separate stations for arts and crafts and a ""Mommy and Me"" nail salon.   A track for running or jogging or even power walking with provided weights encircles the main play area.   

An ample amount of very comfortable couches and free wifi make lounging as a parent very relaxing while allowing your children to roam free.  If you need some extra comfort, one of their four full body massage chairs will bring you fairly close to what heaven might feel like.  Fully customizable, these chairs squeeze your arms, your legs, your feet and massage your neck and back.  Amazing.

Snacks and drinks are available for purchase while during this week coffee, water, and tea were free.   The price for open play is $10 but they provide a punch card deal of $65 for ten days of open play.   Party packages are available for the weekends.

My suggestions to make the experience even better:  1)  The zipline landing area needs more padding.  Unless your child is landing perfectly, falling to the ground or hitting the wall in front of the zipline is pretty rough.   Parents should be cautious on this.  

2) I'm sure a computerized system should be set up soon that way parents don't have to sign waivers at every visit.  

3) Block exits in the back a bit better.  Past the bathroom hallways there are open doors that lead wherever (which I assume children shouldn't really be there).   Some courageous or curious kids can definitely wander past.

Other than that, my coworkers' and my children had a very good experience the two times we have been here.   I've already bought the punch card and my kids definitely look forward to coming again in the future!

My mister and I stopped in on a random afternoon, and it was pretty empty inside. There were some folks clearly making use of the WiFi along with other patrons having an afternoon meeting. No worries though because it was easy for us to grab a table. What was not easy though was trying to figure out how to order! 

No one greeted us when we walked in, so we were left to creep around trying to figure out the menus. There is a coffee/hot beverage menu listed on a board above the cash registers, so that was easy to figure out. But, help a girl out and show me the wine and dessert list! Off to the side of the register, we found standing menus with charcuterie options. Apparently, they also make sandwiches as evidenced by another patron, but we couldn't figure out where that menu was hiding either. Finally, someone came from the back to help us, but she wasn't exactly helpful in explaining the options because never did get to see the wine list.

I wish that the menus either had pictures or that there were refrigerated display cases up front to look at to help with ordering decisions. Truthfully, I somewhat disappointed with the desserts as well as the dirty chai. We ordered one of each flavor of macaron and the green tea mille crepe cake. The desserts were straight up out of the freezer, which definitely is a no-no for macarons. Room temperature is best. The dirty chai came out after the desserts and was lukewarm at best.

We were seated right away on the cute little patio outside, facing the back of the restaurant I might add, so you get none of the noise from Scottsdale Rd. They've really made the outside look quaint and inviting, both in the front and the back. 

I was a little surprised to see the high prices on the menu but I think that's just because I'm skeptical of any Mexican/Southwestern restaurant that's expensive. I've been disappointed in the past. I ordered the Carne en chile colorado (chunks of beef in a guajillo sauce, spinach and potatoes) and after a few bites I knew I ordered the right thing. Although I have a feeling ordering anything on the menu would have been ""the right thing."" 

The party I was with all loved their entrees and we all enjoyed sipping our Patron Silver Margaritas. Usually I don't get too excited over Margaritas at a restaurant because they all taste the same to me but I especially liked that this one wasn't crazy-super sweet and that it was strong, of course. The sweetness can sometimes make me feel like I ate a bowl of candy but not these. I'm sure the Patron Silver had something to do with it too. ;-P

The service was a little spotty as our waitress didn't come around much and I asked for water I didn't receive. Although I  was already done with most of my meal before I remembered, and by that time it wasn't a concern. The  food was so good I didn't care.",2008-11-06 14:43:41

We were expecting for a small portion since the price was lower than other breakfast places.  When we saw the dishes,  we were so surprised the portion size was very big and the food was so fresh and tasty.  Our favorites were definitely the pancakes and the fish.  The buttermilk pancake was crispy on the outside and very fluffy inside. The hint of cinnamon powder on top add an extra layer of texture to the pancakes. The chef pan fried the pancakes into bear shape.  I am sure all girls and kids will love the look of their pancakes.

The highlight of our meal was the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe, which was bucatini pasta in a light cheese sauce, with cracked black pepper. Perfectly cooked, the sauce wasn't too heavy and the pepper added just the right flavor.

We ended with the olive oil cake, which had a hint of citrus and was served with fresh whipped cream. I've had olive oil cake at other places before and did not like it, until I tried this one.

Originally a farm equipment sales and repair shop, Puckett's is a great place to take in some country, rockabilly, honky tonk, and americana music.

They only serve beer, but its cold and its cheap the way it should be.  If you are going to run the risk of bringing a flask, be discreet or make trips out to the car because Gary Puckett has a zero tolerance policy about people bringing in liquor.

The decor is all old south including tons of dusty NASCAR posters and memorabelia and a confederate flag or two.  There is electronic darts and two pool tables, but most people go for the music.

The Cash Bash, the South 85 Jam, Elvisfest, and the Rockabilly BBQ (rumored to now be defunct, we shall see) are all awesome events that bring everybody out with their pompadours combed high, their rat rods tuned, and the women in knockout retro gear.

The no smoking in Carolina bars law has forced them to add a perfect little fenced in area just outside what used to be the bay door for bringing tractors in.

Shout out too my beast training partner Suzy H for showing me this gem after our beast bike ride not think of better place too refuel!!! 

Unfortunately the only thing with this gem is words out. So we were very lucky too find spot too sit down for lunch at prime time 12. But they do have outside seating and few inside or if anything can always order too go. It SOOO worth the wait!!

I order the chicken pesto sandwich and we shared the granola bowl. I mention many times but really believe no matter sandwich its ONLY as good as the bread. The baguette. It bread from heaven. Truly  only one other experience that had that baguette had that authentic everything on point. It nice crispy crust one that bread the bread away with hands, It nice moist and hot on the inside. I could just go bread crazy eat baguettes all day, Inside find perfectly cooked chicken breast nice moist and hot just like the bread. The pesto spread was awesome! Basil, pine nuts, cheese, and chicken is there better combination for chicken sandwich. Maybe the curry chicken sure bookmark that one for next time. I like the little (literally) salad couple bites. I like the salad dressing on top of it. Not sure if house salad dressing but in any case could have had big salad be happy for lunch. The granola I really enjoyed. It came with fresh cut banana on top and side of milk. We tried it both ways. I prefer it with the milk but either case really good. Suzy nice enough got too try her acai bowl. It first time tried one. It was delicious. All the menu items are under ten dollars for the most part so definitely affordable lunch/breakfast spot. 

I love the fact the owner Oliver very much puts his stamp on the restaurant. He constantly on the go walking around asking customers for their input and making sure everyone happy! The acai bowl something relatively new on the menu asking Suzy her thought on it if something that could improve the dish on. I respect any small business owner that always willing too listen too customer feedbacks. You can tell much passion goes into all the dishes at Baguette Cafe.

My proximity suggested I pay my first visit to Crown & Anchor on Trop. On the bucket-list since lots of Yelp colleagues have been praising the dining there. If the graveyard cook is on-point, then dinner certainly going to measure up.

I ordered ""the graveyard burger."" That's just $5.95 for a 8-ounce, cheesed-up, baconed-up, tasting-of-charcoal, juicy piece of meat, with a side of pretty-crispy steak fries. Yeah - this WAS a good idea! 

Jason, the bartender attending, offered up intelligent convo before & after my plate. Much more than other graveyard mixologists often muster.

Since I am not big on either drinking or sports, to me this space would be about the food. 

But if I urged to tap a Guinness Stout (my beer of choice when I do imbibe) ... here would certainly be a good spot for it.

Only a few stools were being warmed, not surprisingly at this time-of-morning. But, according to Jason, if you want to party with college students at 1am ... or if you want to slip away from the nearby Strip to take in a live Euro soccer game at 7am with your team's jersey & some pub-grub ... this venue also qualifies well.

Me, I'll be back at some point to take in the dinner menu. The burger sold it. And I found out there is an AYCE Fish-n-Chips deal, 5pm-midnight on Mondays. 

Ummm. AYCE. My favorite culinary monogram.

Oh, it's a British pub concept throughout. But you already knew that.

UPDATE: I've been back to test the AYCE Fish-n-Chips deal. Not too exciting actually. One plank, then the refills one plank each. Not near as tasty/crispy/greasy as found the Village Pubs. And I've had my fill at Village Pub for $10, less than the AYCE here.

The people who work here are very nice, helpful, and friendly. Their recipes are mostly Italian based, which makes them a little different than other local bakeries. After much deliberation (and I mean MUCH.... like extensive), I tried the brownie and the cheesecake. The brownie looked kind of dry on the outside, but don't let that fool you, it was somewhere between a cake texture and a fudgy brownie texture, certainly not dry. The brownie was chocolatey but not overly rich with chocolate chips throughout. Was it my favorite brownie in town? No (I am partial to a fudgy more chocolatey and rich brownie). But it was very good and if I were in the neighborhood I would get it again. The cheesecake, on the other hand, was fairly awesome. This was no New York cheesecake. It was surprisingly light and airy, not the heavy oh-my-god-I'm-so-full-need-bigger-pants kind of cheesecake you get most places (not that I don't like that too, this was just something you may want to eat with more frequency). It was sweet without being overly sweet and they didn't complicate it with toppings or flavors, it was just a good plain cheesecake. Oh, and it isn't served in slices, it's served like a cupcake.... so cute. Anyway, each dessert cost 3$, so the prices are competitive with other local bakeries.

Cleanliness: 5/5

Service: 5/5
Best in town! Full body massage plus tip will not make you say ""it was okay."" This was the best massage I've ever received. Though the head rest/piece was a bit uncomfortable even with the towel on, it still is the best massage. 
If you're a local, ask for their ""punch card"". Once you get a certain amount of sessions, you get one I believe complimentary or at a discount rate...I'll have to look at it again. 

Ambiance: 5/5
It was very dim which was good for taking your mind off anything and forgetting your in Vegas with the spa like decor. The music was a mix of jazz and something else which was good for me. When relaxing I prefer nature sounds, but in this case I would have been knocked out with the right music and a great massage. This is good for me since I was asked to turn from my back on to my stomach for the next session.

Not only is the Las Vegas location similar in style as the original in Yountville, the food is spot on as the dishes served at the Napa Valley location.

The foie gras is silky smooth once it reaches room temperature and while on my most recent visit, the ""foie gold"" as the layer of duck fat is referred to, was removed and whisked away, it can certainly be enjoyed on the never ending toasted bread that is made available for this delicacy.  While all the dishes I have tried at both the original location and the Las Vegas location are identical in taste, portion and presentation, I do find it amusing that the servers need to educate the Las Vegas crowd as to what certain items are, including certain spices and seasonings, including perhaps taking my ""foie gold"" away as they assumed that I was not educated enough to know what it was - this would never have happened at the original Yountville restaurant, as the Bay Area is foodie central.

Lt96wPT7khS13aWTJNV6BQ,HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,bsrj9_hFAql3dlSf244zpg,2,25,9,5,"I recently attended an event at the Trump Hotel which was held in the Empire Suite on the 64th floor. When I see the Trump name on a property, I have a reasonable expectation that from the time I step foot on the property until the time I leave my experience will be a cut above the competition to put it mildly. Unfortunately this is one Trump property that has not impressed me, and it's all about attention to detail. 

1: Valet. When you pull up the service is great. But when I was ready to go I understand I need to wait and be patient. When I walk up to the valet please take the time to acknowledge that I am there and say I will be with you in a minute. Don't leave me standing there for a couple of minutes without saying anything to me. 

2: The lobby is typical Trump...polished to perfection with nothing out of place and top notch service. If only the rest of the property looked as good. 

3: Welcome to the 64th floor. Make sure you look down. I'm not talking about standing at the window looking down at the view below. I'm talking about making sure you avoid stepping into one of the 2-3 floor outlet covers that were half missing. If you have someone accompanying you in high heels, this was a safety hazard. For a property like the Trump surely someone could afford to purchase replacement electrical outlet covers and replace the broken ones instead of covering them by strategically placing tables over the damaged outlets. 

4: I don't expect white glove service. But if the walls are painted white I expect them to be clean. When you open the door to a penthouse suite I don't expect to see dirty, grimy doors especially in the area around the door handles. Or scratches. Or a hole in the wall opposite of the door. 

5: Service. One should not have to keep asking if a manager on duty can come up to address minor issues. I know they have other matters to attend to but when one of the people in your group has to make repeated requests to call a manager.... it's ridiculous. 

On a positive note there were no issues with food service, and the bartender was a pleasure to work with and certainly knew his stuff. 

Overall while the view from the 64th floor is nice, the Trump Hotel - Las Vegas is a property that I do not look forward to visiting again when it comes to attending a special event. If I want the true Trump experience I'll wait until I go to Chicago. Granted the Chicago property is relatively new, but their attention to detail is impeccable, and the level of service is stellar. The staff from Las Vegas could learn a thing or two from the staff in Chicago on how to properly manage and maintain a facility.

My co-workers and I have been eagerly awaiting the Grand Opening for this Chipotle, just three blocks away from our office. We have a Qdoba nearby already, but we all agree that Chipotle is much better. For the past few months, we've seen the old building get torn down, a new building go up, and one day after we all wondered what was going to be there, a sign went up that said ""Chipotle, Coming Soon"". Giddy, giddy, giddy. You can imagine our excitement since all of us are fans. But that sign was mean, because it was up for over a month without any indication as to when ""soon"" was. Come on! That is just way too long to be teased, wouldn't you say?

Well, the time has finally come. November 21st is the GRAND OPENING, as the sign outside now says. 

I did pass by today, the day before the grand opening and the inside was curiously crowded. Turns out they were having a ""training day"" for the employees, so thanks to an invitation by the greeter outside, I strolled in for a sneak preview of my - soon to be regular lunch - steak burrito bowl, tortilla on the side, with corn, tomatoes, hot salsa, sour cream, and cheese. Optional is the guac, cuz sometimes I feel like a guac, and sometimes I don't. Or rather, sometimes I feel like spending an extra $1.80, and sometimes I just don't.

It's basically layered sliced potatoes with creme fresche and cheese with a bit of garlic and scallions. A version of a Julia Child type of dish.

Grilled fish tacos:  was nothing but ordinary to me. It's made of grilled white fish, tomatillo sauce, avocado, pico de gallo and a side of white bean concoction. Still good but I could get the same elsewhere for a lot less. $17

Step 3: Jerry went to bathroom while I moved tables because the one we were at was covered in crumbs.
Step 4: Wait. Wait Wait Wait Wait.
Step 5: After a good 5-7 minutes, Jerry goes up to the bartender to ask for menus, a water and a beer... and brings them back to the table himself. The water has a funky chlorine taste.
Step 6: Chat, I look over menu.
Step 7: Waitress comes by to ask if we're ready to order.
Step 8: Waitress leaves when Jerry says he hasn't even looked at the menu yet. He said nothing was jumping out at him off of the menu.
Step 9: 10 minutes later, a different waitress takes our order. We split a ""basket"" of boneless chicken wings and fries, with a side of blue cheese and ranch dressing. We order them ""extra hot.""
Step 10: Wait wait wait. Jerry tells me he'll pay me $50 to tell the really loud drunk at the bar to STFU. I pass on the offer.
Step 11: Waitress brings food.
Step 12: We eat the food - it's the first time that something has been so spicy, it makes my stomach feel like somebody punched me right where the umbilical and hypogastric regions meet on the human body in anatomical position. Although the food was so spicy it bruised my innards, it was tasty.
Step 13: We sit around forever. Waitress refills our cups, although we're clearly done with our meal. 
Step 14: Waitress leaves.
Step 15: After waiting around for 15 minutes, I go up to bartender and ask for the check and the box.
Step 16: Bartender gives box to waitress and she delivers it, with the check, 5 minutes after I got back to my seat.
Step 17: Jerry paid the $20 ticket (2 beers, tap water and a chicken basket) and we left.

Honestly, the customer service was non-existent. People shouldn't have to wait around and ask to get served. I understand that it's approaching 1 AM, but if you don't want to serve customers at tables, close the kitchen and only open the bar portion. There's no excuse to not acknowledge customers, let alone serve the customers when the place is dead. 

When Jerry and I got back to my house after the meal, my sister and her boyfriend were gone.

It is with this in mind we write reviews.

HUMMUS is terrific.  It is a small place, a little tricky to find, that offers excellent flavor varieties of hummus and middle eastern food.  It is set up similar to a Chipotle in that you choose your hummus base, your greens, your rice or black beans, your protein which consists of beef, chicken, lamb, grilled vegetables and other choices, your sauces and enjoy it in a large bowl or wrap configuration.   It is outstanding! Healthy, vegan and gluten free options if you prefer.   The flavors are magnificent, the ingredients fresh, the serving size is ample and a value for the price.  They also have unique soft drink flavors.  This is not your run-of-the-mill middle eastern restaurant.   It is very casual and comfortable.  Old movies play on the wall while you eat which is fun.

I enjoyed my food and I took some home for my husband and he also liked it. I will come back to try their chicken noodle soup. 

Kudos guys for a wonderful meal and experience.",2018-03-03 22:26:06

I have to preface this with the only reason I actually went inside to eat was I was with a friend who has a toddler and the only thing that was going to make him happy was the play land area. Ok here goes, when we first walked in I noticed all the fake plants everywhere, and the fountain, and the bench. Am I at McDonald's or an old ladies house? By far the strangest mcds I've ever been to. Then it gets more interesting, the inside is a poor attempt at making this a hip lounge. With damask wallpaper and a small sitting type lounge area with a cheap chandelier, I couldn't help but laugh. Oh and did I mention the guy passed out sleeping in this ""lounge"" area? Random men were walking in and out of the restrooms, I truly felt like I was in the twilight zone. 

Now onto the service, we had a fairly simple order, and not only did they get it wrong not once, but 3 times, and gave us an attitude with it. This isn't rocket science people. Learn to speak English.

By ""bland"" I don't mean not spicy. They will give you habanero sauce if you want it. But their pork, chicken and beans are devoid of any seasoning. And their veggies are often undercooked, often making raw green pepper the dominant flavour in a burrito.

In this location in particular, watch out for them being skimpy with the cheese. They'll fill the scoop, and then quickly tap 1/3rd of it on to your burrito. Watch out for dry, crunchy white rice as well.

I don't need a lot out of a hotel. I don't go places to sit in a room and I think we only turned our TV on once this trip. So fancy TVs don't impress me and I don't need much more than a comfy, clean bed. Our room had no fridge, no coffee maker, no plasma TV, but it certainly was clean! Perfect!

I was super excited when we checked in on a Saturday afternoon.  We had valeted our car for free and the neither the valet nor check-in lines were very long. Crossing through the casino to get to the room elevators, we could see the garden area outside. Couldn't wait to check this place out!  I've been to LV a million times but never stayed here. Now, I don't know that I'd ever stay anywhere else.

The walk to our room from the elevator was pretty far. Surprisingly far, but walking is good for us and so I wasn't complaining.  Our room was on the 10th floor and had one lamp with a lightbulb out, a faulty shower with a slippery floor and a broken ice machine on that level. It had pink and black decorations and a very clean wood-like floor. I hate gross carpets so this caught my eye first. One night of sleep and we agreed the bed was comfy but the pillows were not. Bummer - I love lots of fluffy pillows.

The second day we stopped at customer service and asked for a room closer to the elevator. Lots of people had checked out (since it was Sunday). The lady at the counter hooked us up with a similar room but on the 21st floor, very close to the elevator and with a working ice machine outside. Everything about the room was great and it was very clean.

Good experiences with valet all week. Great experiences with the staff.  Even the cashiers were extra friendly; drink service was fast; and bartenders had heavy pours. Bugsy's Bar is one of our favorites. 

We sat at the pool in the mornings. The GO pool (21 and up) wasn't open yet but will be in a couple of weeks, so it was important to get there early to get a lounge chair in the sun. This was not a problem. I had been getting up early every day. There was a bar at the pool, and you could not bring your own drinks in here. They ID'ed and checked for alcohol. I did notice a couple flasks around though.

One of the best features of Flamingo is the location. It's on the strip and centrally located. It's not one of the newest hotels but has undergone nice rennovations. We walked lots of places, even though we had a rental car. The watershow at the Fountains of Bellagio are just across the street. Quad is recently rennovated and closeby and Bills is presently undergoing construction. Paris is near, but we really liked the open-ness of the casino rooms at Flamingo best. We went next door to Margaritaville a couple times, since they're connected by a fun bar and some machines we bet pennies on.

The outside area had waterfalls and fountains, big sitting rocks and wildlife that included turtles, fish, and real flamingos. It was all fantastic. There aren't many stores inside, but there are a few for shopping (even one just for adults with some fun stuff!) and only a few restaurants (I recommend dessert from the steakhouse). The Pizza Joint stayed open till 2am, but we were in bed before that every night. 

You have to pay for the fitness center, but 30 flights of stairs are available for free. Save your money and run on the strip for free. Make sure to do it early because it sure gets HOT in Vegas. Spend that saved money on a show. The X Burlesque show was in the Flamingo and very, very sexy. Make sure to search for cheaper tickets online, and ask for discounts at the Players Club desk. The Total Rewards card you get will save you money in restaurants at other casinos, as well as the Flamingo. We also received free tickets to comedy shows and the Auto Collection showcase from the Players desk.

Spent a wonderful 5 days there and I already can't wait for the next stay here. Couldn't have asked for a better room for less than $100 a night! (A lot less with the deal we found!)",2013-03-11 22:51:49

Arrival to this hotel was very smooth. Called for a shuttle from the airport at past-midnight, was told did go to gate 8 and within 20 minutes a shuttle would arrive. The shuttle did arrive within that time limit and I was able to check-in super quickly. 

However as I was getting ready to go to bed all of a sudden the lights went out. I tried calling front desk with no luck. Thankfully the iPhone has a inbuilt flashlight and I was able to make my way to bed. Consequently the next morning, it was a very scrambled breakfast, with omelettes the only hot food available as with loss of electricity the fridges were not functioning and so the normal hot breakfast foods were not available. However the hotel made it right and I was comp'd for this night. 

But that wasn't the end of it. The next night I waited close to an hour and a half with 8 other travelers for the shuttle to pick us up from the airport - it was insane as we kept trying to call the hotel front desk and it would go straight into an endless loop. Finally took a taxi and when we got to hotel, front desk staff told us the phone switch was down. So yeah, not a happy camper. 

You know how things happen in three's?? Well two nights later, their hot water boiler broke and it was cold showers for everyone! (Brrr!)

So definitely an eventful stay and it was weird too because some mornings I would wake up smelling breakfast food, as if their kitchen vent and the AC to my room were on the same circuit or something.  

Breakfast wise, it was a decent variety and there was this one particular chef who I went to every day as she made the best over easy eggs! One let down at breakfast was the orange juice which was horrid - it was that kind that comes in juice boxes so super sweet and not freshly squeezed variety.

While staff was nice (the Mgr was happy to get stamps for my postcards) and breakfast was good, I'm not sure if would stay here again when next in Pittsburgh - this trip was just too eventful!'

Ok so I wanted to give this place all 5 stars for its cozy feel and wonderful atmosphere but our hostess scratched in hopes of that happening.

Positives:
Great music
Great happy hour menu
Good food


Negatives:
Had to wait 20-30 minutes at a time for the hostess to come get our order.

By the time our order was taking happy hour prices were over even though we arrived a full 2 hours before the cut-off.

Out hostess seemed like she didn't want to wait on us and wasn't friendly at all.


Overall I like this place but hopefully when I go back I will get someone friendlier and someone who is faster in taking food and drink orders.",2013-08-25 14:46:11

A very interesting concept that offers both buffet and plated brunch fare. The buffet is all cold with wonderful selections like shrimp, king crab, sushi, and salmon caviar. The desserts were good and selection plentiful. Buffet is $30.
  For an additional $4 to $9 you can have a plated hot meal. Hard to pass this up, we got the pork sandwich topped with poached egg. Jeff,  the steak and eggs. Both were amazing! Had we not been on vacation, there would be plenty to take home!

This place is truly a gem. Little hole in the wall located in Tempe, AZ. I have been coming here for years and I always get the chicken shawarma plate with extra pita bread for my hummus. I love when the pita bread is burned a little bit because I prefer the crispier taste. The plate comes with chicken, rice, hummus, and tabouli. I prefer this place over pita jungle to be honest. The location is small, but the food is always good and consistent. :)

The grocery store is cool to browse around after you're done eating. They have spices and other cool treats for cheap. I would try the Baklava if I were you. One of the best Baklavas I have ever had.

After expressing my concerns about the liquid nitrogen incident from last time I was informed that it is safe even if it splashes on you. Either way I hope they will take care not to let it splash on customers in the future. Perhaps a sign of some sort would help (they already have one telling you not to put it in other containers).

This time I tried the frozen breath (Cheetos frozen with liquid nitrogen) and the chocolate brownie ice cream. The frozen breath was a pretty cool experience actually! I was surprised by how cold the Cheetos were and it was fun blowing out the smoke(?). You should eat this first because the effect wears off. I think this was worth the experience.

The chocolate ice cream comes with brownie chunks and two toasted (torched) marshmallows. I was surprised by how rich and chocolatey this was - if you're a chocolate lover you'll like it! Personally I'm more of a matcha person but this was still good. The toasted marshmallows add different flavors as well. The ice cream here tends to melt fast!

One of those fingers includes this review so no, this is definitely not an area I frequent often.  I have been to the Southernmost Point marker in Key West more than I've been over the bridge on Cherry Street in my life.

It was one of those days where I take the entire day off and spend it eating and drinking with a fellow Yelper and when the day ends at Cherry Street BBQ for the last meal of the day I can say that it was topped off properly.  We had a light late lunch That went well into the 3pm time of the afternoon.  Thankfully it was light and on the way down from Greenwood and Gerrard we hit up a 3 places to grab a drink along the way.  Cherry Street BBQ was going to be the last stop and everything leading up to it just complimented the meal even more but even without going to the other places this BBQ joint had it going on.  Did I know it even existed?  No, I did not.  If not for my friend that decided this was a place we were going to check out I would never have even known because as I said, I pretty much never go to this area of town, ever.

Stranger in a strange part of town I suppose.  It was like being a tourist for a day without having to travel.  This place that felt completely new to me was something I never knew of so it was going to be a complete surprise.  We ended up eating on the patio because the weather was nice.  You have to get in line and order inside and then  you get a number with a stand to take to your table where they will in turn bring out your order to you.  

The menu on the wall gives quite a few options for straight up BBQ or some sandwich versions of meat between bread.  For the meat options (what we were interested in) it pretty much had all pricing in half pound increments.  Essentially you'd be paying by the half pound for say ribs (3 bones), brisket, sausage (which equates to a single sausage) or for the ribs they were also available in half and full racks.  There were 3 of us so I tried to order accordingly.  We decided upon a full pound of brisket, a half rack of ribs (6 bones), and a single sausage.  It seemed like an appropriate amount for 3 of us.  The platter came out and they included some sliced bread  (normal thickness, not Texas toast thick slices) and it all looked really good.  

The sausage we simply cut up for sharing.  It seemed either very fatty or we weren't even sure if there was cheese inside it was hard to say.  The casing kept it together until we started to slice is up and it became somewhat crumbly.  The sausage I think was quite salty but I loved that about it.  My wife would have certainly found it far too salty for her liking but it was really flavorful and savory just eating it on its own.  

The ribs were unlike any ribs I've had before.  The meat almost seemed as if it was cured because it had the look of dry ham but it almost looked like the color of bacon.  Those are two areas of the pig not necessarily related to ribs at all.  The ribs were dry and almost red in color but fully cooked.  The meat seemed to almost chip off but it still stuck to the bones.  The best description I can use to put into words is that ribs seemed to be ""candied cured"".  Not juicy, tasty but very different almost like jerky still on the bones... unusual but I liked them and ended up eating most of the ribs.

The brisket however was downright delectable.  The rub on it rubbed me the right way.  It had kick but it was full of flavor, not overly spicy (for me) but so juicy and tender I probably could have chipped away with it with a plastic spoon.  I mean this brisket was simply melt in your mouth goodness.  I have to say it's probably the best I've ever had in my memory because it was just so juicy.  I'm so used to getting dry, tough brisket that it has to be smothered in sauce to lubricate the meat but not this serving.  I was completely wowed by the brisket, the juiciness, the seasoning and the texture.  

For the shared meal for 3 which was the pound of to die for last meal on the planet kind of brisket, savory sausage and candied cured type ribs it came out to a bit over 60 bucks plus tip.  The pricing seemed a bit high for the portions but the quality as far as I was concerned was above and beyond quite a few BBQ places I've been to in my life all over the place including the deep south.  The brisket easily won me over, that I have no doubt.  We had issues with our BBQ sauce dispenser which was being able to squirt out the sauce.  Something kept plugging it up.  There was only one variety of sauce available as opposed to the half dozen you may see in places in the south.   Cherry Street BBQ is a well kept secret because of its seclusion to the rest of the city being in such an inconspicuous place and because of that it's probably one of best kept secrets in town.",2017-07-26 19:37:00

I love the set-up.  The huge patio outside makes you feel as if you are not in Las Vegas, and the ceiling fans keep it surprisingly cool.

There is plenty of seating and you are not forced to make a reservation or buy a bottle just to sit down.

The crowd is a good mix of people. Youngin's, grown and sexy, 50+.  There is a little bit of everything here!  The DJ is usually good, playing a mix of top 40 and hip hop, with some old school jams thrown in there.

I had some friends in town and we were looking for a more relaxed place to go, where we knew we could sit down, and this was the perfect place.

We swooped in on a table when another group left and immediately got some drinks and a hookah.  Now, I am a beer drinker, so I just can't justify paying $14 for a fruity martini.....but oh well.  ""When in Rome!"" The prices are just a bit outrageous, in my opinion.  And our server was VERY slow.  It took at least 20 minutes to get change when I paid, and I had to ask for it.  The hookah was a great part of the night, although I don't smoke.

Blue Martini served it's purpose - we had a nice, chill evening with a few cocktails and some bumpin music.  I just don't like having to pay a cover ($5-$10) for a local place and then pay $14 per cocktail, otherwise I may frequent this place more often.

You've got a house full of guests, each with his/her own culinary quirks (the snooty foodie, the ethnic restaurant authenticity police, the cheapskate, the unadventurous picky-eater who finds chop suey too exotic, the militant vegan, and the long-suffering mother); the only thing everyone can agree on is: No more leftover turkey!  This would be a good time to pack everyone into the car and head out to Hokkaido Seafood Buffet.

To Asian food aficionados, Hokkaido Seafood Buffet may look kinda sketchy -- being sandwiched between a Dunkin Donuts and an IHOP in a divvy strip-mall, its location does not exactly screams ""oishii!"" Its very buffet-ness also induces skepticism -- good food and buffet are so very often mutually exclusive.  All the same, curiosity got the better of us, and so we find ourselves in Hokkaido Seafood Buffet this Saturday post Thanksgiving.

The name of the restaurant is somewhat misleading. There's nothing particularly Japanese about this place. It is really set up to cater to Americans and Chinese. The food offerings run the gamut from pizza to pig's ears and chicken feet. They do have vegetarian fares, and you will also find dimsum-y snacks, Korean pancakes, chow mein, fruit, ice cream, and, of course, sushi. 

The qualities of these dishes vary. The dimsum-y dumplings are probably your best bet (though the wrappers are too thick). The noodle and mongolian bbq station is also a nice touch. The sushi offerings are ok (for buffets) if quantity is more important to you than quality.

Summary: Food-wise, HSB probably only warrants a 3 stars, but I'm giving it an extra 0.5 star for its wide cuisine coverage and another 0.5 star for providing a compromise to a group of diverse eaters.",2009-11-28 20:33:54

I have hosted a work party at this place before and we were happy on that night, but this time I came with my family.  My 6 kids and my parents, so between us there is 10 of us.   It bothers me when I go to a restaurant and they tell you they are going to automatically add a tip on the bill for parties of 8 or more.  My family is large, but I am not a group of teenagers, or a group of drinking 20 somethings.  We are a FAMILY.   We were told by the host when we checked in that they required a mandatory 18% tip be added to the bill.  I immediately said I don't want to be required to have a tip added automatically.  She said, well it is our policy.  I said, please bring the manager over then.  Unfortunately, that meant that we had to wait, instead of being seated.  So, we sat for 15+ minutes waiting and then they didn't even bring the manager or even address the concern, they just came over and said, ok, ill seat you.   After I was seated, the manager came over and he was friendly.  he didn't get the RIGHT story, so I clarified to him what our concern was.  He seemed very nice and said, ""No problem"",  we will make sure you are not charge the tip automatically.  And what I said to him was... we always tip well for good service, many times over 18%, but I don't want to be forced to tip before getting service simply because I have a large family.    He pointed out that he will have the female manager check on us, because he had to step out and he assigned a waitress to our table.  
   We went on with our meal.   Now, I don't know if the waitress made up her mind to not give us good service because there was no guaranteed tip, but that is what happened.  We just got terrible service.  When she WAS at our table, she was very nice and personable, but getting her to our table was impossible  We ordered drinks and literally sat for 25 minutes before she even took our order.   My father was so annoyed he was going to just go get someone else.
   The food was ok.  But it was not till after we went home that we realized that they charged us for EVERY side we asked for... including Pico De Gallo.  and extra soft tortillas.   Now, we ordered a fair amount of food, to be charged for a small Pico is silly, but even worse is the tortilla.  If I knew when they serve a bowl of Queso for an app, they would only give you TWO small tortillas, I would never have ordered it.  When we asked for more, we were charged.  Stupid.  And my mother who got Fajitas only got 3 soft tortillas for her huge order of Fajitas.  You couldn't even fit the about of meat and vegis on 5 tortillas, so there is nowhere near enough.  I can understand only giving someone 3 to start, so you don't waste them, but to charge when they ask for more...that is just greedy.  
    My father who paid the bill, still gave the waitress a 20% tip, even though she didn't even come close to deserving it.  He did it simply because of the hoopla about us not wanting to pay a required tip up front and didn't want it to seem that we didn't because we wanted to be cheap.
   We simply wanted to pay a tip based on the service we got, not based on the amount of people we have.
   Unfortunately, I don't think I can go back here just because of how poorly they handled simple tasks.   I gave them a 2 instead of a 1, because what food we did get was not terrible, it was just everything else that sucked and I was frustrated to pay anything frankly.  if I was paying the bill, I would have given the waitress 12% based on the quality of service.",2016-10-08 20:17:22

My twin offered to take me to one of my bookmarked restaurants anywhere for my birthday present ^_^ So I picked one as far away from the west side of Mississauga as possible lol we belted in my nephew and mom and off we went for a mid day lunch. 

We had a fun time lifting the stroller down the flight of stairs as strangers looked on. Once we got in we grabbed the last open table (wheeee) and the owner came over all smiles with menus and said you need to try the ox tail soup it's amazing! We ordered 2 small orders amazing wished we ordered 2 large. I would have been super happy just having that soup for lunch, so full of flavor and jam packed with tons of ingredients. She said they change up the soup often but it's amazing sways good... I've decided to believe everything this woman says from now on.  

We also got the goat cheese salad, the dressing looked homemade and was served on the side with out us asking which was great! Then we followed up with some delicious bacon, fried onion peirogies!!! Heaven!!! The bacon was plentiful and the cheddar and onions added the sweet contrasts and texture with the sour cream and large potato peirogies :)

We ordered the chef wings which the owners aid was sweet, tangy and spicy... lol of course it was all of the above. The wings are a great size and the sauce really is finger licking good!

Lastly we over finished our full lunch with a jerk chicken entree. It was moist, fatty and full of flavor! A dry rub version of jerk chicken and served on top of jasmine rice. 

We are never too full for dessert so we ordered the chocolate baileys cheese cake topped with ice cream! Finished it off in less than 1 minute haha

The owner was joking and playful with us right off the bat and just over all great even though it was busy the whole time we were there.

My mom (who never really enjoys the non asian cuisines and I normally get the eye rolls for every new place I try to take her) was licking her fork clean and fighting for the last piece of every dish lol and she doesn't even like chicken.

I always load up on sesame seed and poppy seed bagels when I'm in the area.  The best part too  is that they make them all day long so they're usually very fresh when you pick them up.

After some delay I ordered the cucumber salad as a starter and the Sweet Basil Chicken with steamed broccoli (they offer sliced or ground chicken options which is nice.  Overall assessment was that the staff was attentive, flavors of the main dish needed some work (ie. Soggy and cold egg roll, watered down sauce for the Sweet Basil Chicken - some ""sliced"" pieces were stringy and varied in size, and the veggie soup that comes with the special is mainly cabbage while still bland).

I used to think that I couldn't like this restaurant, as the food is ""traditional"" (i.e. outdated, boring) steak+seafood throwing-everything-under-a-broiler type, and I am not super comfortable having senior citizens wait on me. 

Fast forward.......a few encounters with tortuously bad trendy / fusion meals later, I've come to appreciate this place more because it sticks to what it's good at, and delivers consistently. 

As for service, if the senior citizens working there are happy doing what they do, I figured I should just be thankful and enjoy the impeccable services that result from their years' of experience.

The good:
It's always clean and there's a good security presence since a shooting that took place here a few years back. There have been tons of renovation to improve the look of the mall and a few still ongoing. Tons of selection to choose from.

Homeless / drunk people frequent the mall (my guess is to window shop). Parking is available but is paid parking (downtown of course). Can get crowded at times.

The bread with whipped brown butter was absolute heaven. I generally don't eat bread, but this is something special!

Aloette Fries will put any poutine to shame.

Finally, the lovely snails... nestled in baby greens with pork belly and king oyster mushrooms--they were joyous! Excellent with a glass of the Greek varietal that is offered for $10/glass. Ridiculous pairing!

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Came here twice in one week and I've concluded Belgo Brasserie is NOT the place to go for a nice meal or drinks. The one thing that stands out in my mind is how terrible the service is. On both visits, I happened to have the same waitress and it took her a good 10-15mins before she even acknowledged us... it wasn't even busy! She immediately asks us if we wanted any drinks, and on both occasions never offered us water. 

Belgo Brasserie is a fairly large restaurant with tons of seating. There is the front of the restaurant where the bar is, a second level, and then more tables towards the back where you can host private parties. It has nice high ceilings so it doesn't feel too stuffy, and has a simple yet modern French Bistro look. There were inconsistencies with the table setting though... the smaller dining tables had tablecloths while the taller 'bar tables' didn't. I happened to sit at one without a cloth and found that the table was dirty with cup ring stains and god knows what else.

On my first visit I had drinks and dessert. Majority of their drink list consists of wines and beers ($7+), traditional cocktails ($9), and martinis ($10). I tried their West Coast Caesar (Smoked Salmon Vodka and Wasabi Salted Rim). It had a strong Smoked Salmon taste which was interesting, and the rim tasted more like seaweed than wasabi. For a girly/sweet drink I suggest a ""Blue Orchid"" Martini (Gin, Soho Lychee, Blue Curacao, and Grenadine). Very strong, but delicious to sip on. 

The highlight was their ""Creme Brulee Napoleon"" dessert ($10). Big enough to share and packed with flavour and textures. The dessert is like a wagon wheel with dark chocolate and an almond cookie crust. Instead of the marshmallow fluff you have a yummy custard in the middle. The flavours and textures worked very well together and it wasn't overly sweet. My only complaint is that the sugar on top was burnt and the custard could have been smoother. I highly recommend this dessert!

The other desserts on their menu are generic: Molten chocolate cake; banana split with mango and coconut gelato; strawberries romanoff; maple toffee cheese cake, and lemon tart. I also tried their Strawberries Romanoff dessert which was terrible. Made of Florentine cookie, citrus mousse, and grand marnier infused strawberries, I was expecting the traditional dessert. Instead, I received plain old strawberries, and a hard buttery almond cookie shaped to encase a store bought tasting sponge cake with a grainy mousse on top. 

Their dinner menu has a little bit of everything: steaks, seafood, pasta, poutine, sandwiches, ribs, salads, etc... Belgo Brasserie's cuisine is ""French Fusion"", but I saw very little French influence. 

I ordered their Oysters on Half Shell ($3/each) paired with a delicious mignonette sauce. The oysters tasted very clean. I also shared an order of Mac and Cheese ($16) with lobster, bacon, mushrooms and cognac cream. A nice big portion with a lot of fresh, sweet lobster pieces. If you love mac and cheese, this is the perfect dish since it was very creamy and full of cheese. My only criticism would be that the cream/cheese mixture wasn't even distributed throughout the pasta. 

Overall, try to avoid Belgo Brasserie. It's like a more expensive version of Moxies. There is no real 'flair' to the menu and the service is terrible.",2012-06-12 04:05:27

Is this place good? You better brie-leave it. Shucks, that pun was no gouda. 

I went for The Sheeva. This is macaroni and cheese inside of a grilled cheese. What? You read that right. It was a-ok, perhaps a bit bland for me. I would have enjoyed some sharper flavours in the cheese sauce inside the sandwich, but I perked it up with some hot sauce. My friends both had the Ruben grilled cheese, and I think they won the ordering round this time. Really nice meat served with some seriously banging Dijon. 

They've done a great job of making this place comfortable with the indoor picnic tables, while staying true to their name. I'll definitely be back when I'm next at Yonge and Eg, and I think I'll go for their spiciest sandwich.

I absolutely love that you get sticky rice with your order rather than the more common long grain rice. It seems to compliment the curry so much better and carries the sauce in a way that any other type of rice cannot hold up to. 

For my first go around at this spot I tried the eggplant curry. The emphasis here is definitely on the curry and less on the eggplant. Also, the eggplant was not cubed like I was expecting. Rather, the eggplant was cut closer to the skin and without much of the white vegetal matter at all. It was wok-fried and placed into a dish with the curry sauce. 

Definitely heed the warning that this place does deliver on spice levels - they are not catering to the Midwest version of ""spicy."" Medium was all I could handle, tasty, but any more would have been WAY too much for an enjoyable lunch.

I do have to give a word of warning, which also will explain my overall rating. Though the food is tasty, the portions are tiny.

Spices were a little steep in price, but the quality seems to be there. I also like the small tin packaging and the amount that is sold.

When you step in, it feels like a cafe. There's classy jazz music playing in the background. The decor is really fresh and modern; the flooring looks like a marble finish and the walls and counter have wood paneling. 

I feel like I definitely should be ordering an earl grey with cheesecake in this joint. 

But on to the food. We got the steamed rice roll with beef, the sate pho and the house special pho. The rice rolls were hors d'oeuvre size, but were tasty. The fresh mango rolled with the beef also was an unexpected surprise. 

The pho broth I'd have to say was mediocre. It lacked the zing that I have come to know pho to be distinctive for. Also, I asked to add tendon to the sate pho since it only came with rare beef. They gave me 2 dime sized pieces and charged me $2.50. The total for that one small sate pho with tendon was $12.50 before tax...

I don't know if that's the best way to launch your business guys. The portion sizes definitely cannot compare with the pho powerhouses that are pretty ratty looks wise, but make up for 10x more value (ahem chunks of tendon) at almost half of the cost and fragrant as hell broth.

I want to throw some axes! I know sounds super dangerous especially since it's BYOB but they have many safety precautions to ensure no one looses a limb. 

I'm not going to lie, the first time holding an axe was a bit intimidating. Throwing an axe is not something most people can say they have done. You are basically going against what common sense tells you to do. I mean we were all taught not to run with scissors, now I am spiralling an axe towards a board. Pretty bad ass feeling if I do say so myself. Every group comes with coaches to get you started then they organize a competition with point scores and narrate with microphones. Totally worth 45 dollars a person!  Each area comes with a fridge and table so I brought pop, alcohol, food and cutlery. I saw one station and they had a slow cooker plugged in. How smart!

Everyone here is so nice. The staff is so friendly it makes you want to work there. The company was started by two brothers that started it in their garage I believe. They personally came up and introduced themselves and wished me happy birthday. As I walked around other staff members started wishing me happy birthday. It was truly a unique experience. It's rare to experience hospitality like that.

I had a lunch combo of 3 items for $9.99. The lunch combo is available everyday, including the weekends, which was a nice surprise. It was a great deal because I got a ton of food for that amount.  I went with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, beef empanadas, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The sour cream enchiladas were definitely the winner of the trio.

It's been a while since I've been to Lawry's and I was excited to see if it was still as good as I remember.  It's near the Howard Hughes business area so there's always a ton of businessmen and women having lunch here on weekdays.  With this in mind, we decided to meet at 11:30 am (opening time) to beat the lunch rush.

I went up to the chef and ordered a BBQ Beef Sandwich ($12), Cup of Chili ($5), and an Iced Tea ($3).  The BBQ Beef Sandwich was very good.  The Beef was juicy and the BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and not too sweet....just the way I like it.  The one negative for me was the amount of Sauce, I would have preferred less Sauce.....you can't control the amount of Sauce though, it's served that way.

The Chili was amazing!  It is easily the best Chili I've ever had.  It's not for Vegetarians though.....there's Beef in the Chili.  The combination of ingredients was perfect....I wish I knew what was in it!  It also had a slight spicy kick to it too.

The atmosphere is upscale and professional, perfect for our lunch meeting.  Overall, it was a great experience.

Apps- We ordered the queso dip and before you imagine that bowl of yellow-ish melted cheese, think again. They mastered the art of melting cheese in a little skillet and mixed in is your choice of veggies or chorizo. We opted for veggies and it was great. Veggies tasted very fresh and the cheese was melted enough to use with a chip but not an actual liquid.

Entrees- I ordered two tacos. Carne asada and Al Pastor. The carne asada was the better of the two. Great flavor, moist, cut up well.. summed up as a tasty carne asada taco. The Al Pastor was great aside from the pork being a little dry. The sweetness from the pineapple was refreshing and salsa on top was a great savory touch. The wife ordered the chicken enchiladas and she really liked them. She got them with red sauce and it wasn't the ""normal"" runny red sauce that you get.

I've been coming here for the past couple of years and have always found items that were difficult to come by, deals that couldn't be resisted and always helpful staff. Though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude, they are always willing to help you find what you're looking for. The layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel. 

These guys have a great selection from different brands. North Face, Arcteryx, Patagonia, Marmot, and some others. I also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear. Their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need. 

I've never purchased one from these guys, but they have a killer selection of knives, too. 

In the past couple of years I've purchased plenty of MSR camp stove canisters from these guys. They always have a plethora. Also picked up a nice Thermarest from here. Most recently, my wife and I were looking for a nice mid-layer jacket for the winter for her. We checked out a few different options in the women's section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from Patagonia. It was on crazy sale, too. Don't remember exactly how much we ended up paying, but I know it was close to 60% off from the previous year. 

If I'm ever looking for something particular, Jessie Brown's always has it or at least something comparable. Love coming to this local shop!",2012-11-29 14:08:53

I plan on spending many weekend afternoons here drinking day beers. The decor and open layout make for a very inviting atmosphere that begs for both happy hour banter and solo study time.

I would however recommend more chickpeas as there were only about 10 in total. My hubs loved the hummus sandwich. It came with chips and slaw, and while I typically love vinegar based cabbage slaws like this, this one was average. We both indulged in the peanut butter cookies which definitely satisfied our sweet craving. I can't wait to try that cinnamon coffee cake with a big cup of coffee soon. 

The beer. Whoa. What a selection! I enjoyed a Lil Sumpin' Wild on tap which never ceases to amaze my mouth.

However, they don't really do ""traditional"" kbbq, like the flavors and ingredients are not down to the details authentic but it was still good, kinda like a chinese/korean blend? 

Food:
Anyway, for two people we both got the non-seafood AYCE which included chicken, pork, beef, sausage (wasn't a fan of it...), white fish fillets, and salmon. The bass(?) fillets were not good. they were too heavily seasoned and fell apart completely upon grilling, but on the other hand, the salmon was on point and I had more than 4 plates of it!

The chicken and pork were my favourites, they were very juicy and seasoned perfectly, not too heavy and not too light. Some reviewers complain that it was too fatty but I prefer it a bit on the fatty side when it comes to grilling. The beef was good, but nothing too special to rave about. I think it was just regular beef slices, not bulgolgi, so be aware of that! 

We also got the $3.00 add on vegetables, and I wouldn't recommend it. The onions and pineapples were pretty good for grilling but we barely touched that and pretty much focused on the yummy meat instead. 

Service/interior:
The interior was very nice and clean, with a modern design to it and made a pleasant environment to dine in. The service was very fast, the servers came, dropped the food, and left. Efficient. On the occasions that we did talk to our server she was very nice, and was very accommodating!

We waited about 40 minutes before a server brought by the small, obligatory bread basket, and then 10 minutes later some of the sushi dishes we had ordered as appetizers, finally began to arrive.  They delivered two at once, one of which we didn't recall ordering.  When we were barely getting started on the sushi, the main course arrived.  I sent that back to the kitchen to keep warm while we hurriedly ate what was in front of us.  We were surprised when the correct sushi order arrived, followed a few minutes later by the main entrees, again.  We never got to finish the late-delivered sushi, and frankly, three sushi orders were more than we intended to eat.  The restaurant manager came by to offer us a glass of champagne, on the house, but we were already drinking a very good cabernet, so we declined,

The good part is that everything we tried, was excellent!  The sushi was very good.  We had yellow tail and yellow tail sushi rolls and also the ""caterpillar"" roll.  (Note:  the best yellow tail in town is at SoHo, a small local west end eatery).  For entrees, we tried the butter chicken in curry sauce, served with basmati rice and freshly made nan.  It was spicy and hauntingly flavorful and well-prepared. The second entree was the lamb shank also in a curry sauce and the same side dishes, but had an entirely different curry flavor:  savory, tender and delicious.

Thursday evening right before a baseball game, there were people drinking and eating outside and insude. The places was pretty busy.

UGGHH.... The server was wearing last years skinny shorts and was muffin topping out of them all over the place. She never refilled water, only came back after motioning to her, recommended shit food. 

I am a burger snob, so I ask before I order if the burgers are:

1. Good
2. Fresh not frozen
3. Can be cooked to med rare

Answers were:

1. Yes, they are excellent
2. Yes, hand pattied and fresh
3. Yes, but only to Meduim

So I get the burgers and frys. The frys were good. (got that out of the way)

Problems with the burger:

1. Worst burger i have ever had
2. fresh yesterday because it was a premade and cooked then placed in a juice of somesort, re-grilled on a flat op and burnt on one side only. It had zero flavor and was 1/2 mushy, 1/2 burnt.
3. was cooked all the way through like a freakin meatloaf

It was so bad i added salt 3 times and pepper 2 times. I still needed something to taste so i added the chili peppers from the pizza. 

Needless to say they took it off the bill. 

The other items we had was a Philly and there was about 1/2 the meat it should have. Pizza slice, was day old and rubbery. 

The drinks were served in cheap plastic cups like you get at a ""free drink "" special night in a nasty strip club or something. They were waek as shit too.

I admire the fact that they readily admit that their service is pricey, due to being available 24/7, no appointment needed.  They even provide information regarding other vets in the area, if you prefer to go somewhere cheaper for follow-up care, x-rays, etc...  

I've only gone in for our pets examination.  The doctor was kind, explained things well and appeared very caring.  My husband, however, had to take 2 of our pets to be put down (I couldn't handle that part...).  He told me each time that they were very patient, they explained everything that they were doing, and allowed him to spend as much time as he needed with our pets, at the end.  He described the doctor as reassuring and very compassionate.  They even gave us a paw print in bake-able clay for each pet, which I thought was very kind.

While I wouldn't go to this vet for non-emergency services, due to the cost, for emergencies, this is the place to go.

I even hesitated getting our pets put down here, due to the cost.  I hated the idea of paying someone so much to take away someone I loved (I know, that sounds weird, but that's how I felt).

This ""diner"", though self-identified as a ""diner"" isn't really a diner, at least in my mind. It does have a diner-like menu, but the vibe and décor makes it more of a café...or a bistro...or a café.

I had the ""Molly Wood's Breakfast"", but substituted the savoury beans for the meat. It included ""homechips"" and choice of a variety of toasts - white, whole wheat, rye and multi-grain. This selection automatically elevated it above most other breakfast places, but the quality of the multi-grain shot it to the top of the list, toast-wise. Even better than The Avenue Diner.

Now, the term ""homechips"" raised a bit of a red flag. We asked whether they were home fries or French fries, and we assured by the waiter that they were home fries, as he described their dimensions. Yes, they were shaped like home fries, but they were definitely French fries. Tasty, but not home fries. 

Everyone was very happy with their meals, and the waiter was attentive and very friendly. Why 3.75 stars? Well, I just couldn't put it in the category with Free Times Cafe or The George Street Diner (esp. for vibe), but it was better than 3.5, that's for sure! ;-)

NB It's important to note that they served Raspberry (D.O. - ""Rasp, the best berry"".) jam. This probably doesn't seem like much, but after visiting 90 different breakfast spots, we could count the raspberry jam on one hand, with a thumb left over. The standard? Strawberry.",2012-04-20 20:48:31

Meal:  Our group had the chimichanga, ranchero eggs, enchiladas with eggs, and the chiliquetes.  We also added had the chips with salsa.

Taste:   The seasoning was nearly perfect unlike other Mexican places nearby (like the Original Burrito Company), the food was both spicy and tasty.  It seems like too often that places confuse ""spicy hot"" as being tasty and well seasoned, but these places don't have the expertise in making something incredibly hot and delicious . . . but Los Taquitos does have that expertise.  Their salsa, in my humble opinion, is the best I have had to date and its by no means typical.  It appears they take real pride in making their salsa special.  The only dig is that the chips were overcooked.  8 out of 10.

Value:  Portions were more than fair and reasonable.  In fact, I would describe it that if you ate til you were full, you have a some left over for a small snack left over.  4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  There is no waiter service, just a walk up counter.  The staff was mediocre.  They weren't rude or inept, but they sure weren't friendly.  It was sort of like a robot was taking our order.  7 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is spot on of what you expect from a nice walk up taco and burrito place.  Nothing fancy, easy going, and great music.  The scenery is going to ""wow"" you but shouldn't district you from the entire experience.  3 out of 5.

Overall:  I have been to a handful of walk up taco and burrito places in the valley and Los Taquitos takes top prize.  This is the perfect place if you want some authentic, simple,  and fast Mexican food for lunch or after a night of drinking!

I feel like every time I come here, there is at least a 15 minute wait before they let me in. For only $17.99 a person and the endless rows of yummy in your tummy food, Hokkaido is definitely worth the wait. 

The atmosphere at Hokkaido is very upbeat and dynamic. There is always some type of party taking place in the buffet. Today there was an engagement party so the place was filled with balloons and confetti. Endless selection of food...all tasted amazing! I love the pepper shrimps and stir fry mushrooms. However, crab legs were kind of scrawny and there weren't that many variety of sushi/sashimi. Oysters though...definitely endless! I think between my boyfriend and me, we had like at least 10 plates of oysters, and they just kept refilling them until we finally surrendered. 

Service was okay. I was kind of annoyed that the waitress gave us the check so early, when we weren't even close to getting dessert yet. I know there are other people waiting, but there is no need to rush us like that. No worries, we took our good old time anyways. 

In conclusion, Hokkaido is good for everything, except for the crab legs. Sushi/sashimi were ok, but if you're only in it for the sushi/sashimi, then Tokyo Sushi Buffet is a better choice. However, if you're in it for all the variety of food, then I highly recommend Hokkaido!",2013-08-11 03:22:47

Despite being an open-air setup, the outdoor area was perplexingly stifling. Tables were crammed together uncomfortably, and there was very little air movement. The tabletop was sticky, which I attribute to the tacky finish rather than uncleanliness....but I could be wrong. More importantly, though, anyone who is in Vegas on a budget (and we DO exist) should not step foot in this place. Overpriced-but-average bar food and drinks are not my thing! Our margaritas were $15 a pop, but not overly large, strong....or good. At that price, that drink should give me a back rub, or at least a kiss!

They have gotten rid of the 5 courses, and now do 3 courses for $16. 

Appetizers we shared: Israeli cous cous salad with  cucumber carpaccio and pickled  red onions. It was very simple and not much to it, but it was clean and refreshing. Vegetable medley with apples in a light curry cream sauce served with pilaf in a tomato was actually really good. The vegetables were all cooked just right to where they are soft, but still have bite, the curry was really nice. It was actually pretty hearty and could be a meal in itself. 

Entree I had poached salmon, sauteed spinach and rice pilaf. The poach on it was done right, and the rice and spinach was seasoned but it was missing something. There was a bit of sauce bercy and the description said basil oil which I did not see so it may have been forgotten. The BF had herbed mustard pork loin which we thought was odd to have been thin sliced and battered since the description didn't really sound anything like how it was. It was a tad salty for the BF and my taste. the buttermilk cheddar mashed potatoes were good, the veggies were cooked well, and the parmesan roasted tomato was a nice tasty touch. 

Dessert the almond cookies duo (one plain, one chocolate) were nice and crumbly and were paired with a well done bright raspberry sorbet. The panna cotta though was more like just white jello. There was too much gelatin in it when it should have been just enough to set the cream mixture. 

Overall though the food was good and there was some pride in presentation. 

The service was alright. Our server was didnt say much at all and was softspoken to where some of it we didn't know what she said. I found it weird that she  never came up to ask us how everything was while we were eating, never checked on us if we needed anything, no thanks for coming, come see us again, have a good night, etc. at the end of the meal.  It's a open room and we can see a lot of the front staff is horsing around and talking including our server instead of doing their job. When walking out there was a bunch of servers and the maitre d by the door who did not greet people leaving because they were talking amongst themselves and have ""checked out"" already. 

 I get that this is still ""school"" but you're still serving real people who are paying money so this is just like any other business. Some people didn't seem to take it very seriously or learn much from school from how they presented themselves as servers. Maybe harsh, but if these are students that are going to graduate soon then I would think they would cover basic service points so I feel it's fair to call them out on it. 

Upon dining, I'm a bit surprised that there wasn't any comment cards for diners....if this is for the students to learn from, shouldn't they hear feedback on the good and bad? I know that maybe they don't want to hurt feelings with really ragey commentary but perhaps the instructor can read and use valid critiques into instructing the class. Hopefully the school reads Yelps at least! 

It's my first time and I know it changes with each class. I will be back as the concept is interesting and the general quality is good.",2012-06-24 08:00:38

It's lively, the alcohol and loud music gives the place a ""looser"" more ""social"" vibe and since I was surrounded with lovely company and people I've known for years, it was a great and fun night. It's that typical busy weekend place where everyone's kind of checking each other out. 

So if you're with someone you want to have a real and connecting, lasting, philosophical conversation with ... don't come here. 

The food was very good though. The elk Carpaccio was delectable, a mixture of textures and great flavor, held it's own over the red merlot. The skewer we ordered was beef, and it was so good, melted in our mouths. Great tasting and well cooked rice too! Also the Brussels sprouts kale Caesar salad was great. Really good. Big toasted croutons and a great amount of super saucy salad (ask perhaps for light on the dressing if you're being conscious of your waistline). 

All in all, a happy fun night with good music since the DJ was on point pretty much throughout, a great mixture of old school dance/r&b/rap music which is what we're into as a group generally.

Here's the rundown - I was thrilled to be able to get vegan hot n sour soup, which was super tasty and lived up to it's name! I love that you can get brown rice at no additional charge.  They also have great lunch specials deals - soup + entree + eggroll for like $7-8?! awesome.

I feel the real test of a pizza place is a plain cheese of a pepperoni pizza. Michael's goes above and beyond on that pizza alone. Not too greasy. On our last venture we decided to branch out and try the... Mashed Potato Pizza. While not an all the time option, it was amazing. Michael's regular crust topped with mashed potatoes, covered in cheddar and mozzarella cheese, real bacon, and a (as much as I hate this word) dollop of sour cream. Beautiful. 

In additional to the great pizza, they have cheap beers too. The usual liquor options too.

The interior is small but cozy. It has the appearance of a dive bar, but I don't think I'd call it a dive. They have a lot of kitschy decor. Pizza pillows on the window seat, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Pizza Time clock. The first room has the bar and a few tables, there is also a little room to the back where more tables are located if you don't want to sit in the bar area. They've got a few tv's so if you're into sports you can stay updated as well.  Keep in mind Wednesday is 50 cent wing night and Thursday night's are the pizza special so those two nights can get a little packed. 

My only other tip would be that while Yelp says they deliver, and my friend's confirm that sometime's they have in the past, when I called and asked they told me no. So, that may be a hit or miss situation.

This used to be a really run down, dumpy little video game store and it's unbelievable how much it's transformed now with super cute decor and tastefully done interiors. Everyone working behind the counter is super nice and hospitable. 
We were greeted with smiling faces when we came in. Upon going through the menu I couldn't decide if I wanted ice cream or an espresso drink. Everything looked good. I sampled the vanilla fudge and cherry blossom. They were both delicious but the vanilla fudge won. My husband had the right idea though. He got half cake batter and half mint chocolate. I enjoyed my ice cream and I ate some of his. Our 15 month old seemed to love the cake batter the most. When I was done, I couldn't forego another scoop so I got the strawberry which was delicious too. 
Next time I will open up my horizons to trying something other than ice cream. They also have Izze drinks and Oui yogurt if you're not in the mood for ice cream or coffee. And there's a case full of truffles and pastries too, if that's what you fancy. 
We also got to chat with the owner Sean, who was very personable and you can tell he takes pride in what he does. He said they considered locations all over Charlotte and Huntersville but I'm SO glad he chose this location! We are absolute fans of this place and wish Sean and his team at Percantile and Creamery the very best!",2018-08-19 01:14:58

Acai bowls are the latest health-food craze, and I'm glad a shop opened here in Madison so I could finally see what the hype on Instagram was all about. 

It's a little like eating a giant, expensive bowl of ice cream but without the fat, though definitely comparable levels of sugar. It's intended to be ""eaten as a meal"" which probably helps customers like me justify the price to themselves, but I wish they'd be upfront that this is clearly dessert based on some tropical berry. There's likely way more fiber and vitamin C in here than in ice cream though, so I guess there's that. 

Unfortunately, while marketed as a ""super food,"" a quick search will tell you this isn't an FDA approved statement, and there is no scientific evidence that the acai berry has more antioxidants than say pomegranate juice or red wine. It was a little alarming how delicious my bowl was, given that the acai berry isn't naturally sweet. I could feel my glucose levels spiking after the first few bites and decided to freeze the second half of my bowl (regular size, not large) to finish a day later. 

However, if you love the idea of a fruit smoothie you can eat, this is one of few options in Madtown. They also offer fresh pressed juices and smoothies you can drink. I'll come back to see if they have less sweet juice options. 

I was also given the option to add protein powder to my bowl, but they don't currently know how much protein is in the bowl on its own, and are ""working with a nutritionist"" for that information. For people tracking their macros/protein intake, likely those who want that added protein, not knowing how much is in the stand-alone product is a little disappointing.

A storm was brewing when we pulled into the packed parking lot, so we decided to sit near the windows in the lounge area of the bar.  

We started off with Sangria.   He had the watermelon and I had the passion fruit.  Both were delicious.  The watermelon was made with blush wine and came with a big slice of watermelon.  So, I guess you really need to like watermelon if you plan on ordering that.  I preferred the passion fruit made with red wine.  

For dinner I ordered a big ol' burrito covered in cheese and my friend got the tacos.  Everything was great and let me tell you, that burrito was the biggest thing I've ever seen.  Bring a hearty appetite.  

The server was super friendly and talked me through all his favorites since I couldn't make up my mind.

The best part of the night was when a complete stranger offered us a piece of her birthday cake.  Isn't that sweet?  She shared with the entire bar.  I guess looking back, you shouldn't take cake from strangers but I figured it was safe since the entire bar was eating it.

Another thing I have to warn you is it was too hot! A room filled with grills should have AC cranked up a little bit higher. I'm normally cold everywhere I go. I even packed a long sleeve jacket with me. But I was sweating. Everything was great till we almost paid tip on top of their mandatory 18% tip, and that 18% was based on the total price plus tax. We were not aware of the mandatory tip and on the credit card receipt there is an blank for tip. So if we didn't look closely enough, we would paid double tip. I wasn't too happy about that. But before I gave a lower review I decided to call the manager and see what their response would be. To my pleasant surprise. The manager Jin not only listened and apologized to my concern, he also offered to reverse the tip. Of course I didn't take it and told him their service and food deserve at least that amount of tip.

The lunch menu is limited with lunch specials coming only with choice of beef or chicken and entrees consisting of your typical mexican-american fare (burritos, chimichanga, etc).  There website opens with ""gourmet mexican fare"" but the lunch menu definitely doesn't reflect this.  I opted for the burrito colorado as it at least offered me a chance to try the carnitas that it was stuffed with.  The large burrito was topped with a red colorado sauce and accompanied by rice and very bland refried beans.  While the pork was tasty, I wouldn't call it ""carnitas"" as it didn't have any of the crispiness that it should.  I will say that their housemade hot sauce (available by request) was exceptional.  It brought the right amount of heat to the dish and was a needed addition to the refried beans.
Service was friendly and with only a few tables occupied, the food came out extremely fast.
In reviewing the dinner menu, there are a few things that sparked my interest and would warrant a return visit so I will update my review accordingly.

First, let's talk about the positives. I love the decor. The hidden front walkway entrance. The swing. (yes a real swing at the bar) And of course the huge wall of tequila is pretty breathtaking. Maybe the authentic look set my expectations too high. 
Between the two of us, we ordered fajitas, potato tacos, ceviche, a salsa trio, and a guava margarita. The fajitas were bland. Not bad, just boring. What fajitas don't come out sizzling? These ones. 
Potato taco, I would give these a C+ or even B-. Not bad, but not amazing. The best part was the jalapeno crema. (Not what I expect the best part to be on a taco)
Ceviche, PASS! I was so excited because it came with mango and jalapeno. Nope. Way too sweet, not nearly enough lime, cilantro, or cucumber to even out the flavors. 
Salsa trio, 2 outta 3 were great. The ""attempt at being spicy"" one, try again folks.

Injapan is nothing to rave about but not as bad as people say.  Guess it is a hit and miss here. 3/5 stars",2015-07-02 16:24:03
JaU9nwvNqxd76uzCY09hJA,eCErX2uz7AVmYuZu30CBvA,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,2,2,3,1,"What is it about Las Vegas and its lack of good Chinese takeout? Are there cosmic Asian forces at work that keep finger-licking Kung Pao chicken or delectable broccoli beef far way from our boozy, desert collective, or are all the solid Chinese chefs locked in at proper sit-down restaurants on the Strip? 
Regardless of why the sleeping dragon of delicious Chinese takeout has never awoken in our little corner of the Mojave, I had high hopes for Chop Chop Wok.
Reading the reviews here on Yelp convinced me - dare I say - that might have finally found THE spot. You know, the kind of solid New York City-style takeout joint whose Mongolian beef melts in the mouth. Where the sweet-and-sour chicken is a stack of crunchy, honeyed bonbons of poultry goodness. Where the rice sucks you down into pillowy rivers of starch so delicious that you never want to come up for air.
Man, did I have another thing coming.
Chop Chop Wok, unfortunately, is like a lot of neighborhood Chinese takeout joints here in Vegas: That is to say, it's run by a small coterie of smiling, accommodating folks ... who haven't the slightest idea how to turn out tasty dishes that trace their roots far back into the misty history of the Middle Kingdom.
Which is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's. 
We tried a variety of dishes, but everything from the egg rolls to the crab rangoons to the beef and chicken dishes disappointed. 
We're sorry, Chop Chop Wok. You're a bunch of truly nice people. But for those of us who've managed to find great Chinese takeout from Manhattan to the Midwest, we were hoping for so much more.",2012-08-01 02:29:31

I was a little surprised by the small size and the décor of the restaurant. Nothing negative, just not exactly what I had imagined after seeing trendy looking photos on Yelp. Menus were laid out on the tables. We selected a table and our beverage order was promptly taken. Already I'm comfortable that this is a place where you can eat a nice lunch and make it back to work on time. 

Our server passed when invited to make a recommendation, some more help would have been appreciated, so we simply went with the first two ""Signature Burgers"" listed on the menu. I know, we're disgracefully unimaginative! I ordered the Blu Burger, menu item number one, and definitely regretted not ordering the American Burger, menu item number two, when they arrived at our table. The American definitely had the stronger visual appeal. The Blu Burger was tasty, however, especially the caramelized onions. The buns not only looked great, but were soft and delicious. Other ingredients all seemed top notch. 

The cost of our lunch seemed very reasonable given the quality of the food, but a little pricey given the ambiance of the restaurant. Our tab, for two burgers, two sides of sweet potato fries, one ice tea and one water, was $28, not including tip.

I've never really embraced the gourmet burger fad. That said, it speaks well of the Blu Burger Grille that I'm anxious to return and try it out again. Next time I'll be ready to flip the menu over and customize.",2014-08-07 22:10:41

x8x4MMJ0tb5Scxtpl46r0A,aDYNz8cujkDdmbiOh95ANA,UByM7N0mF-ylIGUuIWHCtA,3,4,0,0,"Previously, I have only been to Sullivan's to hang out in the cocktail area & order from the bar menu, but this review is for dinner in the dining room.  

Now, generally, when I get to pick the place, my first choice would NOT be a chain restuarant, even an upscale one.  But, as it turns out, we had a gift card that could be used at either Del Frisco's or Sullivans. So, I went online to research menus ahead of time. Based on the menu (specifically the Ahi Tuna steak entree) I decided that we should go to Sullivans.    

Needless to say, I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED to learn that they were out of Ahi tuna since that was the whole reason I decided to opt for Sullivans.  BUMMER!!  (I could see a smaller locally owned place running out of a popular menu item, but a huge corporate chain like Sullivans should have a better idea from their POS system about how much of certain items to keep on hand in the restarurant at any given time.)  So, I purused the menu to explore my options...sadly for those who don't eat steak (like me), the rest of the seafood or poultry options were not really exciting.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

But, as a small consolation prize, they had the Knockout martini on special for $6 (which normally is around $12)... so I started with that.  The knockout is made of clementine vodka that has fresh pineapple steeping in it for at least a week.   It was somewhat sweet, but not cloyingly so. I enjoyed it very much. 4.5 stars. 

I decided to opt for one of the Sunday Prime-time specials.  For $34 a person, you can select one item from each of the following categories (however, beware, they have fairly limited options in each category):  (1.) Salad or soup,  (2.) An entree, (3.) A side dish, and  (4.) Dessert.

To go with my entree, I ordered with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  For $8, I got a fairly generous pour of an ok wine. 3 stars. 

I started with the wedge salad.  3.5 stars.  The salad was huge and slathered with lots of bleu cheese dressing and a little finely chopped tomato. (At least they aren't one of those restaraurants that feels compelled to automatically throw bacon on everything.  I was glad this salad comes without.)

For my entree, I went with the salmon w/buerre blanc sauce.  The salmon was a decent size and thankfully was not overcooked. The sauce wouldn't have been my first choice if there were other options, but it tasted fine.  Overall, I would give this item 4 stars. 

The side dishes on the special menu are very limited, and unfortuantely didn't include asparagus.  So, I went with the only other green option, the creamed spinach.  This dish was loaded with parmesan cheese and cream. It was ok, but I couldn't eat much of it because it was way too rich. 3 stars. 

The dessert was fairly disappointing from my standpoint.  I love a good bread pudding, so I was excited about trying the Bannas Foster bread pudding.  This was made in individual ramekins and had a couple of slices of bananas in it.  It was also topped with ice cream, whip cream, and a drizzle of what looked like a carmel sauce.  Sadly, it was not very flavorful and the bread pudding had almost a rubbery texture. 2 stars.  

David also got the wedge salad and chose the filet mignon for his entree.  He said the steak was over-salted.  He also chose mushrooms for his side and I tasted them - they were also a little over-salted. I couldn't eat more than a couple of these. For his dessert, he got the cheesecake to take home, since our server told us that we might want to split one dessert in house and take the other one to go (this  was a good suggestion because otherwise, it would be way too much!)  He also ordered a Highland Oatmeal Porter to go with his steak. 

Our server was nice, but the service was only ok - not great. One small thing we noticed is that some tables had bread served to them and some (like ours) did not.  Since this was my first time eating in the dining room at Sullivans, I don't know if you were supposed to order the bread, or if the server just forgot to bring it.  (Not a huge deal, but it would have been a nice touch.)   Another small thing I noticed was no manager going around the dining room to greet patrons. 

Overall, I was just not impressed given that our total bill came to $94 before tip. 
  
I would come back here to meet friends for cocktails & casual bites from the bar menu, but I would not come back for a full-fledged dinner.  There are just too many other great restaurants in Charlotte to choose from at this price point.",2012-11-19 16:01:57

I had the chopped salad and it had a delicious light dressing and the combination of vegetables worked well together.  However, it was on the small side.  After our meal, I went home and had a hummus sandwich.  The food and wines are still good.  The prices, on the other hand seem to have gone up considerably on most  things.  The short ribs for example, are now $21.00 instead of $16, and you definitely get less food than previously.  I looked at other tables as well, and the trend is throughout the restaurant.  The wines now average $12.00 a glass instead of $9.00.  

For me, this is a special occasion place.  The prices are above my pay grade.  It's 3 dollar signs, not 2.

Still three stars.

With a party of five, I called ahead to make sure they had room for all of us since we were on a schedule.  Vivian Q. was really friendly and said she would call me right back to confirm that she had enough employees there.  Not even five minutes goes by and she calls to confirm that we have an appointment!

Three of our friends were put into a semi-private room near the front, while myself and another friend were put in a room in the back.  I did ask if Rex was working, but he was off at the time I went.  (He now has his own business.)  Jason was the one who worked on me and he was quite aggressive and thorough.  When they flipped me over for some back work, I realized there was no hole for my face to go into, so I had to turn it to the side.  Unfortunately, my friend next to me didn't realize there was no hole for awhile and so she couldn't breathe!  (However, the chairs in the front room do have holes for your face to go into.  So, I guess it depends what chairs you get.)

At the end of the massage, they do this thing where they lift your legs up and drop them.  Well, the minimally covered chair he dropped my legs onto hurt a bit and he realized immediately that it wasn't as cushioned as perhaps the other chairs they have.  But out of habit, he did it again, and *thunk* my legs bang onto the chair.  Another apology comes out.  He also sat me up again to do some further shoulder work on me.  

Overall, I got some mixed reviews from my friends.  Some felt it was too much face and head work for them, while others didn't mind.  Another girl didn't know what to do during the whole hour...it was her first time! 

We also got a $2 Yelp discount off the 60 minute price at the time.

They do accept credit cards, but we tipped in cash.

Moving on to the food. We asked our waitress (who was nice but had friends at the next table so was less than attentive to us) what a good one would be. We were debating between fried zucchini and cheesy bread- well, we got both for some reason. We didn't order both, but because of the waitress paying attention to her friends I don't believe she was paying much attention to our order. Sadly, we didn't try the pizza after two appetizers. 

I watched the waitress serve the table in front of us (that she knew) free drink after free drink, but couldn't remember to bring us napkins. It was mostly because she was socializing with her friends about getting high and reminiscing. I don't mind if you know people, but please give others the same service. 

I asked for wine, they only had two reds and a white. I took the white, and then we decided to leave after that. We still had no napkins, or refills on water.

This proved to be a more popular event than I anticipated!  Who knew that soup, an hour+ outside of the West-end/downtown core, would attract so many people??  This was very apparent as 26 soup vendors were squished underneath tents and + the participants, it did get quite crowded.  The tents, I must say, were necessary 'cause it did rain a bit during the event.  

There were also a few long line-ups to try some soups - I didn't bother with those as I was trying to get through the ginormous list of soupmakers!  :)

Another indication that this was busier than anticipated was that quite a few soupmakers ran out of soup.  Alas, I was unable to judge them.

Venue has the tiniest lot and the other cars were left to park along some carrot farms.  I dunno if this is possible, but it would be advantageous if the organisers can predict ticket sales with some pre-sales.

I thought of checking this place out for lunch since I found out this is one of the very few (or the only one I know) places in Charlotte that serves Indian Maharashtrian street food, one of the biggest things I miss about India.
When we walked in, the place was empty, but then the owner heard the door open and came out to take our order. I was having a little tough time explaining all the dishes to my boyfriend, but then the owner gave me a menu that explained most dishes for someone not familiar with Indian terms.

Just like someone else said in their reviews, I was disappointed when I wasn't greeted or did not even get a smile. I tried to ease whatever tension was in the air by discussing some of the food items on the menu but it seemed like it was such a big task to get the lady to even talk to me.
That being said, the food still gets this place 5 stars and since it's a take out place, the lack of smiles doesn't bother me that much. Definitely a place to check out if you want to try something more than the usual South Indian or North Indian food.

The ""bataka vada"" (which should be 'batata' vada) was delicious! Even writing about it here is making me drool. My boyfriend had the paneer kathi rool and I had the Bombay grill sandwich, both of which were great. My masala chai was good too!
Something about the sev puri amused me though. They gave us whole puris, potatoes, noodles and sauces/chutneys separately and I had to make the puris (or mix it into the end product) myself when I got home. I see the reason why they did it, it is to keep the puris from going soggy with the sauces filled in them too long, but I doubt someone who is not familiar with Indian street food would understand what to do with a bunch of puffed up puris and sauces or how to make the sev puri.

FYI, you need to tap one side of a puri to make a hole through which you put in just a bit of potatoes, mint chutney, tamarind sauce, yogurt and then top it with the sev (noodles) and eat the whole thing in one go! I hope this helps some confused soul out there in tasting this mouth-watering off-beat cuisine

Update: Make sure the yogurt and chutneys are fresh before you take food home. I once got a bad batch where the yogurt had gone sour and the chutney container was puffed up with mold growing on the surface. Since it was too late to go back, I mentioned that to the owner the next time I went there, but they did not even so much as apologize for it.

Bottom line.....I spent  a week and half working on a deal to purchase my new Jeep Patriot Altitude and the General Manager all but confirmed it.....and I have the proof......yet when I arrived to purchase the Jeep he did not honor our agreement.

You know the funny thing is when I talked with him and one of the salesman about 3 weeks ago I mentioned that I had never purchased a vehicle in AZ and I was looking for a dealer that I could trust. These people assured me they were a family business and have been serving the valley for about 20 years or so and that they would be a dealership I could definitely trust.

Hmmmm....that was a complete load of crap......stay away from this dealership and most importantly don't trust anyone there.

When you go in, you will see the nice green house decor with the industry feel. The back wall bookshelf seating area is really cool too. Whoever designed the interior did a great job. 

Service was meh to me. We came in at 2:30pm and I was told that dessert doesn't serve till 3pm. We waited to order. At 2:55pm, I decided to order some drinks first. I asked the girl behind the counter if I can pay for my lychee rose cake right now and just wait till 3pm or whenever they can serve it. She said no. A guy behind her said he can go ask since it's only few minutes away. She refused for the guy to go even ask. I was highly annoyed by it. I understand you can't serve it till 3pm but you can't take my order first?! So I came back 3 minutes after to place another order for dessert. 

Food: we ordered Matcha latte, caramella. And lychee rose cake. The only thing that we like was the matcha. Caramella was too sweet with too much condensed milk. Lychee rose cake has no flavor when you eat it. Then, it has a artificial rose flavor after taste.

I've been here several times for conventions and a job fair (in more recent years). The parking is good, if you get there at a good time. Otherwise, good luck. I don't remember paying for parking. Yes, the building itself is a little old and could need some cosmetic work, too. That said, there are still so many events (crafts, jewelry, christmas, etc.) here, like the Bridal Spectacular twice a year- and since the hall is still being booked/attended, how bad can it really be? 

I remember the job fair the most since that was the most recent event. There were so many people, looking for a job, so it was literally, a sea of people. Some people were dressed like me, ready to interview, in dress pants and a nice button down shirt, groomed nicely and smiling. Others, were less than presentable, in shorts and t-shirts, kinda like they rolled out of bed and just didn't give a second thought to the appearance at all- but it's nothing new here, some people are just so flaky and unreliable (I've seen some strange ones at my old work places through the years). The recruiters/companies hiring were large companies- banks like Citi Group and US Bank, and the armed services were in full force too. The event was organized very well (you turned in a resume at the front, information was given to you about the event). 

I can't comment on the bathrooms because I just spent time in the convention hall. I also can't comment on the refreshments because I didn't notice any stands anywhere here.",2011-01-07 23:45:21

I don't know how many of you know this, but when you bowl out here, your average drops 20 pins from what you bowled in the East. I don't know if it's the climate, or the fact that they have pro tournaments out here pretty often.
In any event, I've bowled in at least 10 different hotels in this city, and the Orleans bowling alleys are by far, the most challenging lanes that I've ever played on.
I think the main reason that they were so difficult, was that this particular league was an afternoon league, so we always bowled on freshly oiled lanes.
I loved the challenge, and the fact that my team took first place that winter, has no bearing on this review.
Their pro shop is good, but they're not open for night bowlers.
My only problem, is that they ruined bowling for me at any other hotel, because the others are less challenging.

Specialty:Brazilian Steakhouse 
Menu items: Prix Fixe Rodizio style meats, salad bar and beer

It's snowing outside. The famous Canadian winter is finally making an appearance in this city. It's white, snowy, windy...and all of the sudden, its sunny as I write. Memories of carnivals, delicious meats, warm smiles and rhythms are coming to mind. Brings me back to CopaCabana, not the beach area in Rio, but the Brazilian steakhouse right here in Toronto, on the Yonge &amp; Eligible, I mean, Eglinton area. 

A week ago to be exact, I was eating at CopaCabana; a Brazilian Rodizio style restaurant. Rodizio is a style of restaurant service in Brazilian restaurants. One pays a fixed price (prix fixe) and the waiters bring an offering of meats to each table at several times throughout the meal, until customers gesture they've had enough. I would say gesture, because you can't really be at this restaurant without having a piece of meat in one's mouth for more than a second.

Upon getting seated, we were invited to start our meal with an assortment of salads and accompaniments from the buffet-style salad bar.

The salad bar has a variety of salads (cold and hot) to choose from. Soup, paella, steamed rice and even pizza were also part of the buffet. Although I really enjoyed the assortment of this salad bar, I can't really say there was a particular salad that stood out. However, as part of our meal, the salad bar was great and so was the selection. On a side note, my take on the salad bar is that restaurants use this as a tactic to get you full before the meats start rolling in. Makes sense, that is the most expensive part of the meal. Do I justify it? No. Is it upsetting? Not really, its really up to the person to control his or her portions and know that the best is yet to come... 

And so it was! Grilled pineapple, in my mind, was one of the best things to pair our meal with. Pineapples wake up your taste buds so that one can enjoy the true taste and juiciness of the meats. In addition to its great nutritional value, Pineapple has a protein-digesting enzyme, bromelain, that helps digestion at the end of a high protein meal; hence why its highly used in Rodizio style restaurants.

Now on to the real deal. The meats!
CopaCabana's extensive meat menu made our experience a success. Our table was privy to Chicken Drumsticks, Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin, Beef Ribs, Top Sirloin, Fillet Mignon, Suckling Pig and Homemade Sausage, amongst others. All of them being well cooked, tender when needed and tasty. This was a meat-comatose I would love to experience again.

And if unlimited salads and meats are not enough for you...well then I am sure the beautiful Brazilian dancers might just be what you needed to begin or end your night with.

I was immediately greeted with a smile, seated at a pleasant table, and provided a menu. After a very short wait, my server came to take my beverage order.

She returned very shortly with my iced Yekemem Shai (tea with cinnamon, cardamom & coves), and took my lunch order.   I ordered the sampler from the lunch menu, and selected Doro Wat with boiled egg (spicy chicken stew), Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots) as my three items.  I also ordered the Tikl Gomen (cabbage, potatoes and carrots), and some Ayeb (home made mild crumbly cheese) to sprinkle on top.  There was an option for rice, injera or both - but I stuck with just injera.

I had never had this sort of iced tea before, but as I started sipping, I was really glad that I had ordered it.  It had a lovely perfumed aroma and flavor but was not overpowering.

The café  had a pleasant ambiance which I enjoyed while I was waiting for my food.  As I waited, the restaurant around me filled fairly quickly, and I was glad that I had arrived when I did.  It looked like there was also a lot of take out activity going on.

Shortly my food arrived, and it looked and smelled delicious.  I forgot about taking a picture until the Doro Wat, my stand out favorite, was completely consumed.  Everything looked and tasted fresh and was nicely seasoned.  The portions were more generous than I expected.  The injera was very nicely made, and not as sour as I have sometimes had it.  The Ayeb was interesting, but I will pass on it next time as it was very mild and didn't really add much flavor.

I was provided refills for my tea, as well as a fresh cup to take with me.  Service was friendly and attentive throughout my visit.  I left wondering why I had waited so long to come back here.

We had reservations for Saturday Night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. I am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. I don't care how fancy the mall is, I think mall food every time I dine at one. Mastro's my friends is no Mall Food Place.

The Service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while I'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. It was like they were our dedicated staff.

The meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).

The Bread basket was a good start, it had Pretzel Bread, olive bread, a Parmesan crisp, and few other breads. The sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. We had Creamed Corn (some of the best I've ever had), Creamed Spinach, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, King Crab Gnocchi, and Mushrooms. We also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 Caesars (one regular and one spicy), Tomato and Onion, and Tomato and Mozzarella. A seafood tower and crab cakes were also ordered, I'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. 

They entrees were pretty stellar as well, I was splitting the 33oz Wagyu Tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, I had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things I have to do). This was one of the best pieces of Cow I've had in my life (and I've had A LOT of cow). It was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect IMO), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. I don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. 

Table mates also got the Seabass, A Filet, and a few other meats, I was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their filets were about 12oz servings.

After dinner, they brought out a Warm Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!

I have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. My only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. They did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.

Will I be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!",2011-12-22 04:25:12

The menu is huge, and this is just the menu for the gringos. If you know Chinese there is a whole menu of family meals that you can order from. 

There are many vegetarian dishes not just the usual tofu and veggies, they have a large selection of exotic mushroom and veggie dishes.

I had the golden mushrooms with tofu $7.99 a house specialty. Mitake mushrooms a light brown sauce and huge pillow of soft fried tofu. It was nice ans somewhat light

We also had the black mushrooms with Chinese greens. $9.99 This dish had a very earthy taste and the greens were very fresh but hard to eat with chopsticks.

Another great dish was the veggie hotpot that had some really interesting textures along with the noodles and veggies. 

Service was a bit lack luster, but maybe that was due to the wedding in the other side. 

The shopping center it is in is a bit run down too so you are assured you are paying for quality food and not the building. 


Bottom line great selection good flavors good value mediocre service.",2011-11-29 21:17:48

This was not the greatest USPS I've ever frequented but I really didn't have much of a choice. A good friend of mine recently moved to another country and I came to this USPS to send her a care package. My experience was mediocre - mainly due to the guy at the counter who really didn't know how to help me. Have you ever heard of Saipan? Yea, me either, but my friend moved there and I was determined to send her some love. The USPS employee hadn't heard of Saipan either but it technically *IS* a U.S. territory with a U.S. zip code. 

After waiting in line for 10 minutes (slow service due to only two employees working that afternoon) I get to the counter and give the guy my friend's  address and ask for his help. I didn't know the process to mail a box to Saipan - that's precisely why I went to the post office! The experts were supposed to help! Apparently he is not an expert... Anyway, he tells me the wrong information and sent me to an empty counter to fill out customs forms. The other employee working overheard my discussion with the guy at the counter and realized the information he gave me was incorrect. She corrected his mistake and gave me the right forms to fill out. 

I got back in line (another 7 minutes) and thankfully made it to the woman's counter. She knew what she was doing and helped me with my shipment. $25 to send a large box to Saipan, with delivery in under a week! I am grateful that 50% of the employees working that afternoon knew what they were doing. I am frustrated by the lack of competence on the man's part, although I should probably be more patient given that Saipan is a tiny, unheard of island in the middle of nowhere. 

-2 stars for wrong information
+3 for affordable pricing with tracking info and a reasonable delivery timeframe 

USPS... Can't live with them, can't live without them. I'll be back soon, and thankfully next time I'll know what to do!

From the outside it looks like you're going to walk into this Super Big Lots because it is so huge! It used to be a sports apparel and equipment store so there's a lot of room in here for Big Lots to be Big....Lots!!!

I walked inside and was like whoa....this isn't as big as I was expecting it to be. It was laid out very spaciously, fitting everything you'd expect to find in a Big Lots store in this huge space. Why not take advantage of the square footage and make it a Super Big Lots? Perhaps they're waiting to see how successful this location will be?

Anyway, what's not to like about Big Lots? Name brand items for generic prices. Winning! There were a few things I saw on the shelves here that I've never seen in any other Big Lots but overall, it was your typical Big Lots (Man I am saying Big Lots a lot!).

Overall, I will come back often just to see what else they've done to the place. They haven't been here long and they are just minutes from my job, which can become very dangerous during lunch breaks or driving past from work! Yeah, it's Big Lots, so I'm a fan!",2013-03-18 04:28:58

Kum Hong is a take out Korean BBQ place nestled in a suburban plaza near many commercial buildings. Seriously, every restaurant offering a lunch deal thrives like it's nobody's business. 

On my early evening visit I was weirded out by the BBQ-ed pigs heads, resting it up a la Lord of the Flies. Many a sleepless nights I suffered throughout grade nine and a flashback to raw meat was really throwing my hungry body off. Stomach says eat, brain says run. 

I ordered the BBQ chicken on rice, $5.75. The meat portion isn't meager by any means, but the Chicken:Rice ratio is out of whack. It also comes with the 'delectably' fatty skin. Obviously, BBQ is not my thing, so I sucked it up and gently pulled off the skin before eating. Not bad. Actually, much better. If you enjoy BBQ I'm sure you'll really like Kum Hong. 

Be advised that the shop is not a really a sit down place, but I did see a couple of chairs at a high table near the window. Cash only!",2010-04-18 23:56:46

Taste wise they have great spices and sauces, and a HUGE, I am talking HUGE, menu. They have everything from sushi to fried chicken, and it is a all vegan.

If you are looking for fresh veggies and whole food, this isn't it. Even though their plates are really good, it is all about the fake meat here. Not a bad thing, but if you are trying to stay away from that stuff, this isn't the place for you.",2016-01-28 19:47:08

When we arrived we waited at the bar for about 10 minutes.  It was opening night, so I was impressed that the restaurant didn't seem chaotic, although the main dining area was completely sat (after they sat us) and the bar was very busy.  

One thing that I observed is that the bartenders were spending a lot of time perfecting the look of the drinks.  I don't drink alcohol so I can't say whether or not they also perfected the taste, but the drinks they were serving over the bar were very elegant and beautiful!   

When they were ready to seat us, they gave us the table in middle of the main dining area, near the DJ booth and in front of the sushi bar.  I was very impressed by the space, the decor, the atmosphere.  Everything felt classy, yet comfortable and chic....I LOVE restaurants that really pay attention to the detail of the energy in the room.  

The DJ was great, although I will admit that I have no idea who was spinning.  I was with amazing company and they were extremely entertaining the entire night.  I remember enjoying the music though and noticing how it was setting the perfect tone for the members of the room.  

Chef provided us a tasting of several of his pride dishes.  We had about 15 different dishes, and I was a fan of all except one.  I did not really care for the pork chops, but maybe it was because it was the least unique of the other dishes that were brought out.  

Meal highlights: Lamb Chops, Octopussy, Sizzling Steak Plate (my absolute favorite item of the night), and the sashimi platter.  

It was obvious that the staff was in training as I saw a few bussers fill our glasses with pitcher water when we had bottled water sitting right on the table.  However, little things like that don't bother me or ruin my experience, especially when everything else was so flawless!  

One complaint from the table, as I don't drink alcohol, was that the large tropical looking fishbowls were super sweet which made it difficult to drink.  They ended up just eating the fruit out of the bowl and leaving the big bowl of alcohol.  

I will definitely be back, hopefully very soon.  I am dying for another round of that sizzling steak!  

Bravo Kumi, I am excited to recommend your restaurant to my clients, friends and family.",2013-07-28 08:02:55
